[Ignacio Arsuaga, president of Hazte O\u00edr, accused the judge of \u201ckidnapping\u201d his bus, which had a slogan on the side saying: \u201cBoys have penises, girls have vaginas. Don\u2019t be fooled. \u201d  The bus generated outrage among left wingers after its first day on the streets of Madrid on Monday, resulting in the city council banning it from their roads. Judge Jos\u00e9 Juan Escalonilla then backed the decision, with Madrid prosecutors now considering whether to investigate it for hate crime. They say that failure to do so could risk \u201cdisturbing the peace and creating a feeling of insecurity or fear among people due to their identity or sexual orientation, and specifically among minors who could be affected by the message. \u201d However, Mr. Asuaga said his group had the freedom to protest \u201csexual indoctrination\u201d in schools, adding that the slogan on the side of the bus is based on a \u201cfact of biology\u201d. \u201cWe are going to appeal this unjust decision and file a criminal case against the   Madrid mayor,\u201d he said. La Gaceta reports the group now plans to cover the bus with a tarpaulin containing different messages in order to circumvent the ban and continue travelling Friday. They may also charter a second vehicle with the same message. The group created the campaign in response to posters put up in cities across the north of Spain depicting naked children with genitalia of the opposite sex. The posters, created by transgender advocacy group Chrysallis, declared: \u201cThere are girls with penises and boys with vaginas. It\u2019s as simple as that. \u201d They were funded by an anonymous American donor who gave \u20ac28, 000 (\u00a324, 000) to help the group spread its message.'"}, "time": 1742562198.9267368}
