[The offer follows weeks of determined Democratic opposition  \u2014   amid determined waffling by top GOP leaders  \u2014   to any funding for Trump\u2019s wall during this year.  \u201cWe have our list of priorities,\u201d budget director Mick Mulvaney said at a business conference on Thursday. He continued:  Won\u2019t surprise anyone what some of them are. We want more money for defense. We want to build a border wall. We want more money for immigration, law enforcement. The Democrats may have some of their own priorities. I [already] indicated making some of these payments for the Obamacare subsidies is one of their priorities. Okay, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re willing to be at that discussion if they want to have it and that\u2019s what we\u2019re telegraphing   \u2026     we understand they have a certain amount of leverage in the Senate because we do need 60 votes [to get funding]. So we need some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate. They are entitled under that set of circumstances to get some of their priorities funded. It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and Democrats some of their priorities. We think we\u2019ve opened the door [to a compromise]. I know that we have. Democrats may be open to that compromise. On Wednesday, the Democrats\u2019 Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer told reporters that Democrats are trying to preserve funding for Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to get it in the bill. We\u2019re very hopeful, negotiations seem to be going quite well   \u2026     We want to make a good budget that meets our principles   \u2026     so far, so good,\u201d he said, according to a report from BNA. com. Democrats will pay a price for obstructing Trump\u2019s priorities, Mulvaney warned. If [Democrats] tell us to pound sand, I think that\u2019s probably a disappointing indicator of where the next four years is going to go. If they tell us, however, that they recognize that President Trump won an election, and he should get some of his priorities funded for that reason, elections have consequences, as folks who win always like to say. \u201d For months, GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have declined to champion funding Trump\u2019s wall in the 2017 budget supplemental, which is due April 28. Trump has asked for roughly $1 billion to install or upgrade roughly 60 miles of border walls and fences this year.  GOP leaders are reluctant to fund the wall, in part, because they don\u2019t want to trade some of their budget priorities to persuade the Democrats to compromise on their   opposition to Trump\u2019s wall. Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall, which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers, cheap workers, and future voters into   cities.  Also, GOP leaders know their business donors oppose the wall, which would reduce the inflow of   consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States. Democrats know the GOP leaders are not willing to champion\u2019s Trump\u2019s wall, so they are escalating their opposition to Trump\u2019s wall and his border reforms, such as greater enforcement of current laws. For example, Democrats are threatening to block all budget funding  \u2014   and so shut down many government agencies  \u2014   unless they get their way.  On Wednesday, Schumer said all extra immigration funding should be held up until the next round of budget debates in the fall of 2017.  \u201cWe think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there\u2019s votes and discussion and nothing should be shoved down people\u2019s throats and that would apply to the many immigration issues that are before us, not just the wall,\u201d Schumer said in a press call. BNA reported:  Billions of dollars for the wall and other funds that Trump wants to boost enforcement have emerged among the \u201cpoison pill\u201d riders that Schumer said could threaten passage of the omnibus by the time federal money runs out at midnight April 28. The government is operating under a stopgap continuing resolution because only one of the 12 fiscal 2017 bills was enacted last fall. Schumer suggested that Democrats have considerable leverage in the talks over the details of the omnibus, which have continued during lawmakers\u2019   recess. \u201cOur Republican colleagues know they control the House, the Senate, the White House [and] a shutdown would fall on their shoulders and they don\u2019t want it,\u201d Schumer said. On multiple occasions, GOP leader Ryan has said the Trump wall will be funded in the 2018 budget starting in October, while hinting it will get little funding for construction in 2017.  This month, Officials at the Department of Homeland Security  However, officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been told by GOP budget leaders that they can reprogram some of their existing funds to pay for construction of prototype wall designs in June.  In his Wednesday call with reporters, Schumer gloated that the GOP leaders are not supporting Trump\u2019s budget request.  \u201cI think there\u2019s agreement, quiet agreement in the [GOP and Democratic budget leaders] that if the president doesn\u2019t interfere and insist on poison pill amendments [funding for the wall] to be shoved down the throats of the Congress, we can come up with an agreement. \u201d Follow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742564308.5174253}
