Cresent Hardy (R) for his seat in Nevada Congressional District 4.\\nSo why does Kihuen believe that Bundy is responsible for the murder of two police officers?\\nVia RJ \u2026 the Millers had visited the Bundy ranch at one point to join the protesters, but didn\u2019t fit in and left the group. The lawsuit says the Millers went to the ranch but never met or spoke to Bundy before they were forced to leave.\\nBundy\u2019s lawsuit calls the mailer connecting Bundy\u2019s conflict to the police shootings as \u201clibelous\u201d and complains that it exposes Bundy to \u201chatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy because it insinuates that (Bundy) orchestrated and promoted the disgraceful and disgusting acts of the killing of two local law enforcement officers.\u201d\\nThe lawsuit says the ads came in the forms of television ads and mailers.\\n\u2026It shows a mugshot of Bundy and states: \u201cThis man\u2019s armed standoff led to the deaths of two Las Vegas police officers.\u201d The mailer adds: \u201cAnd he\u2019s supported by Congressman Hardy.\u201d\\nThoughts on this?
