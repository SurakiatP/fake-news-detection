Moreover, two weeks ago Spain had developed a resolution that blamed Russian\\'s military activities in Syria. \\nPravda.Ru\\'s political expert Alexander Chichin revealed the nature of the contrariety of Spain\\'s policy on Russia. \\nExpert said that this decision is connected with NATO\\'s attitude. Initially it all was referred to one tanker which was not an issue for Spain. Then they discovered that there was a whole fleet. Afterwards spanish realised that this fleet included aircraft carrier \\'Admiral Kusnetsov\\', cruiser \\'Pyotr Veliky\\' and antisubmarine aircraft carrier \\'Severomorsk\\'. \\nThat\\'s why Spain had to refuse. At the moment spanish people say that they are very ashamed for not refusing straight away. They are disappointed that they have recieved NATO\\'s warn. \\nIt is worth mentiong that Spain could have got benefits from this proposal because the country needs money. These ships during only six days could make a great sum of money from Russia to Spain. \\nSpain had to choose between its international authoriy and its inner financial profits. Abandonnig the proposal, Russia saved Spain from resolving this kind of dilemma. \\nPravda.Ru \\nRead article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru Will Spain rise to glory with Felipe VI?'"}, "time": 1742563759.4501505}
