I don\u2019t want to be kicked to death tonight by James Woods,\u201d at which point the conservative actor hopped onstage, snatched off Oswalt\u2019s shoe, and chided him: \u201cThis is an awards show, get some shoes, Jesus. \u201d The impromptu bit was not scripted, Oswalt assured his social media followers.  Regaining control of the show, Oswalt continued: \u201cI feel bad for Trump. Here\u2019s what happened: They had the [White House] Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, Obama went up and made fun of Donald, and Donald said, \u2018I\u2019m taking his job. \u2019\u201d \u201cNow he\u2019s sitting there saying: \u2018This job sucks! My life before this was amazing! \u2019\u201d he added. \u201cDonald Trump taking Obama\u2019s job would be like if the head of linguistics at Rutgers made fun of David Lee Roth   \u2026     and he said, \u2018I\u2019m the head of linguistics at Rutgers. Bring on the hookers and cocaine! \u2019\u201d Later, Chelsea Handler took her own shot at Trump by ridiculing his claim that millions of people may have illegally voted in the 2016 general election, though the talk show host\u2019s jokes didn\u2019t appear to land with the audience. \u201cIf you win this award tonight I want everybody to remember not to get a big head because there are millions of illegal voters in California. Not to mention the ones in Massachusetts who took a bus and voted in New Hampshire,\u201d Handler joked.  Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who was awarded the Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement, went on a fiery   tirade during his acceptance speech. The West Wing creator condemned Trump as being \u201cout of touch\u201d and urged the room full of writers to combat the administration by writing stories that help heal the country. While accepting the WGA West\u2019s Laurel Award, director Oliver Stone broke from the night\u2019s   bias and instead bashed both major political parties. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable now to take shots at Republicans and Trump and all that and avoid the Obamas and Clintons,\u201d Stone said, according to Deadline. \u201cBut remember this: In the 13 wars we\u2019ve started over the last 30 years and the 14 trillion dollars we\u2019ve spent and the hundreds of thousands of lives that have perished from this Earth, remember that it wasn\u2019t one leader but a system  \u2014   both Republican and Democrat. \u201d Introducing Stone was actor and rare Hollywood conservative James Woods. \u201cSo my publicists says \u2018Whatever you do don\u2019t talk politics.\u2019 I say, \u2018Ok.\u2019 And I show up and 15 minutes later I\u2019m Darth Vader,\u201d Woods joked.  Back in New York at the WGA Awards East, which were taking place simultaneously, host Lewis Black also took shots at Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re living at the intersection of satire and reality,\u201d Black joked.
