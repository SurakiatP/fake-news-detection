Gambia\u2019s erratic leader, Yahya Jammeh, seized power in a coup 22 years ago and once said he could rule for a billion years. But on Thursday the Senegalese military headed toward the capital of Gambia, Banjul, where Mr. Jammeh has been holed up in the state house, insisting that his rule is still valid. Mr. Jammeh has warned that he will fight back against any foreign military intervention. At least 26, 000 Gambians, worried about violence, have fled the country, the United Nations says, and several senior officials in Mr. Jammeh\u2019s government have resigned in protest or have left the nation as well. As the invasion began, the winner of the election, Adama Barrow, was being sworn into office in a brief ceremony about 150 miles outside of Gambia. The inauguration took place in a nondescript room at the Gambian Embassy in Dakar, Senegal, because Mr. Barrow has so little control over his country that he did not go home for the funeral of his son, who had been killed by a dog over the weekend. Mr. Barrow\u2019s team ultimately decided that the embassy in Dakar was the closest they could safely get to Gambian soil to start the new administration. Plans for an elaborate ceremony in a soccer stadium in Gambia\u2019s capital had to be scrapped amid the standoff. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the kind of ceremony to be jubilant about, but the situation is dangerous,\u201d said Halifa Sallah, a spokesman for Mr. Barrow. But late on Thursday it appeared the situation could still be resolved without a fight. State television broadcast news that the presidents of Liberia, Mauritania and Guinea would arrive Friday to negotiate a resolution. A Senegalese military official said troops would stand by for talks. During the inauguration in Senegal, Mr. Barrow arrived to enthusiastic whoops from hundreds of supporters and emerged from a motorcade beaming. He was sworn in just before 5 p. m. his hand on a Quran, pledging to serve his country \u201cwithout fear or favor. \u201d Several people who had gathered outside to watch on a large television screen shouted, \u201cNo more dictatorship!\u201d In a brief speech, the   Mr. Barrow called on the Gambian security forces to pledge their loyalty to him, asking that the military stay in their barracks. \u201cWe are one Gambia, one people,\u201d he said. Gambia has suffered high unemployment and political repression for years under Mr. Jammeh, with many citizens abandoning the country to risk perilous and often deadly journeys to Europe by sea. Minutes after Mr. Barrow was sworn in, celebrations erupted across Gambia, with thousands gathering in some areas. Lamin Demba, a welder, said he felt like a free man. Joining others in celebration in front of his welding shop with piles of metal, he took out his phone and called a relative in Italy. \u201cCome back home boy, we are free now,\u201d he shouted into the phone. \u201cNow Gambia is free. \u201d But while Mr. Barrow has popular support in Gambia, it has not been enough to dislodge the erratic Mr. Jammeh. After initially accepting defeat in the election, he suddenly cited voting irregularities and called for a new vote. \u201cHe is still the president,\u201d said Seedy Njie, Gambia\u2019s minister of information, communication and technology. \u201cSo, yes, he is here. \u201d This week, Gambia\u2019s Parliament voted to extend Mr. Jammeh\u2019s term for three months, though international officials denounced the move and many analysts consider it unconstitutional. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Thursday supporting the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States to ensure a peaceful transfer of power to Mr. Barrow. The resolution, presented by Senegal, which has a rotating seat on the council, offers \u201cits full support to the Ecowas in its commitment to ensure by political means first the respect of the will of the people\u201d of Gambia in the election that ousted Mr. Jammeh from office. The speed with which the council has taken action shows how little support Mr. Jammeh has among world powers. He has overseen a legacy of human rights abuses, including imprisoning opponents and declaring that gay people should be beheaded. He has claimed to have the ability to cure AIDS with little more than an herbal concoction. Mr. Barrow, by contrast, is an unassuming real estate agent who fell into the candidate\u2019s position after Mr. Jammeh jailed other opposition party members. He left the country last week to meet with West African leaders to discuss how to resolve the matter of taking over the presidency. Fearing for his safety at home, he wound up in Senegal, which surrounds Gambia on three sides and has a huge stake in Gambia\u2019s stability. Mr. Jammeh\u2019s circle of friends has been shrinking considerably in recent days. The African Union said it would fail to recognize him as president as of Thursday. The presidents of Liberia and Mauritania met with him to urge him to step down, to no avail. His chief spokesman and longtime mouthpiece fled the country. Many of his ministers resigned. Mr. Jammeh has tried numerous channels to cling to power. He appealed to the Supreme Court, but because he had fired most of the judges and failed to replace them, a full panel could not be assembled in time to hear his case. This week, Mr. Jammeh declared a state of emergency in the country. He shut three independent radio stations and his officers arrested people selling #GambiaHasDecided  . For now, it appears members of the security forces are staying loyal to him. But with Mr. Jammeh lacking a broad support base, his ability to provide for supporters who have lived off his good graces for years will be challenged. \u201cHe has nothing left, really,\u201d said Mr. Sallah, Mr. Barrow\u2019s spokesman. \u201cIn the end I don\u2019t see how he can stay. \u201d Mariam Sakho, a Gambian waitress in Banjul, said she was confident that Mr. Jammeh would step down, especially now that many of his ministers were deserting him. \u201cYesterday, my boss say I should not come to work because it is not safe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for me, I believe nothing will happen, so I told him I will come. Everybody is tired with Yahya Jammeh I believe he will go. \u201d People stayed glued to radios for news, while many Barrow supporters celebrated openly. \u201cNobody can stop me,\u201d said Fatou Njie, a Barrow supporter. \u201cIt is my right. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563218.1291134}
