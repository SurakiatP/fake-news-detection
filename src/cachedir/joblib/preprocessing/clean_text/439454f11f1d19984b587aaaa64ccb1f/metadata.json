The international encryption expert and open-source advocate wanted people to know that there was a clear path to recovering Clinton\u2019s emails that she has claimed were deleted because of their \u201cpersonal\u201d nature.   \\nYou can see the list here: I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true.

Using XKeyscore, the surveillance program revealed by Edward Snowden, NSA analysts could drill deeper into data as far back as 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state, the Business Times reported. \\nCongress spent millions of dollars investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails and illegal use of a private server, and the liberal media , rather than reporting on the results of those investigations, has instead tried to use the conflict between Democrats and Republicans as a sideshow to distract from the issues that really matter to Americans.
