[The AI famous for winning at Jeopardy and replacing insurance claims agents will take on its greatest challenge yet: Twitter trolls. Watson will use its ability to interpret natural language and analyze images to do something that the estimated 2, 300 remaining employees of the social network have repeatedly failed to do.  Once thriving, the embattled social network has been in steady decline for years. In an attempt to strike a balance between the open nature of the platform and preventing online \u201cabuse,\u201d Jack Dorsey and his team have instead careened through a public comedy of errors as people on both sides of the debate have lost patience and moved on from the platform. Twitter Vice Present of Data Strategy Chris Moody said that they have had \u201csome abuse\u201d on the platform, discussed \u201cvery publicly in the past few months. \u201d In announcing the partnership with IBM Watson, he stressed that their first priority is to \u201cstop the abuse. \u201d \u201cWatson is really good at understanding nuances in language and intention. What we want to do is be able to identify abuse patterns early and stop this behaviour before it starts,\u201d he said. Watson will help Twitter identify \u201cabusive\u201d accounts. Twitter will then use the information to decide whether to limit a user\u2019s visibility or simply ban them from the service altogether. Whether or not Watson proves effective at his task, Twitter will face an uphill battle to regain its status and popularity. The company is caught between users who have become discouraged by its toxicity, and others equally dismayed by its tightening of free speech on the social network. In any case, this is a desperate attempt to reverse the company\u2019s fortunes  \u2014   but at this point it looks a lot like swapping deck chairs on the Titanic.
