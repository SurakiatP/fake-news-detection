He\u2019s a fiction. There is only the motion of particles in the brain. Therefore, nothing is inviolate, nothing is protected. Make the brain do A, make it do B; it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is harmonizing these tiny particles, in order to build a collective consensus, in order to force a science of behavior.\u201d (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)Individual power. Your power.It stands as the essence of what the founding documents of the American Republic are all about, once you scratch below the surface a millimeter or so.Therefore, it stands to reason that colleges and universities would be teaching courses in INDIVIDUAL POWER.As soon as I write that, though, we all fall down laughing, because we understand the absurdity of such a proposition. Can you imagine Harvard endowing a chair in Individual Power?Students would tear down the building in which such courses were taught. They\u2019ve been carefully instructed that the individual is the greatest living threat to the planet.If you can\u2019t see that as mind control, visit your local optometrist and get a prescription for glasses.So we have this astonishing situation: the very basis of freedom has no reflection in the educational system.You can say \u201cindividual\u201d within certain limited contexts. You can say \u201cpower,\u201d if you\u2019re talking about nuclear plants, or if you\u2019re accusing someone of a crime, but if you put \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d together and attribute a positive quality to the combination, you\u2019re way, way outside the consensus. You\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re committing some kind of treason.In order to spot the deepest versions of educational brainwashing, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME STANDARD AGAINST WHICH YOU CAN COMPARE WHAT IS COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE INTO THE MINDS OF STUDENTS.If you lack that standard, you miss most of the action.If you lack that standard, you have already been worked over by the system.And in this case, the standard is INDIVIDUAL POWER.Clean it off, hose off the dirt, polish it, look at it, think about it, remember it.Then you\u2019ll see some Grade-A prime mind control. Everywhere. Because schools either don\u2019t mention it, or they discredit it.Back in the days when I was writing on assignment for newspapers and magazines, I pitched a story about individual power to an editor. I wanted to trace its history as an idea over the past ten years.He looked at me for a few seconds. He looked at me as if I\u2019d just dropped some cow flop on his desk. He knew I wasn\u2019t kidding and I had something I could write and turn in to him, but that made it worse. He began to squirm in his chair.He laughed nervously. Then he stopped laughing.He said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t what we do.\u201dFor him, I was suddenly radioactive.I had a similar experience with a high-school history teacher in California. We were having lunch in a cafe in Santa Monica, and I said:\u201cYou should teach a course in individual power. The positive aspects. No group stuff. Just the individual.\u201dHe frowned a deep intellectual frown, as if I\u2019d just opened my jacket and exposed a few sticks of dynamite strapped to my chest. As if he was thinking about which agency of the government to report me to.Now, for the schizoid part. The movies. Television. Video games. Comics. Graphic novels. They are filled to the brim, they are overflowing with individual heroes who have considerable power. These entertainment businesses bank billions of dollars, because people want to immerse themselves in that universe where the individual is supreme. They want it badly.But when it comes to \u201creal\u201d life, power stops at the front door and no one answers the bell.Suddenly, the hero, the person with power is anathema. He\u2019s left holding the bag. So he adjusts. He waits. He wonders. He settles for less, far less. He stifles his hopes. He shrinks. He forgets. He develops \u201cproblems\u201d and tries to solve them within an impossibly narrow context. He redefines success and victory down to meet limited expectations. He strives for the normal and the average. For his efforts, he receives tidbits, like a dog looking up at his master.If that isn\u2019t mind control, nothing is.Once we enter a world where the individual no longer has credibility, a world where \u201cgreatest good for the greatest number\u201d is the overriding principle, and where that principle is defined by the elite few, the term \u201cmind control\u201d will have a positive connotation. It will be accepted as the obvious strategy for achieving \u201cpeace in our time.\u201dAt a job interview, a candidate will say:\u201cYes, I received my PhD in Mind Control at Yale, and then I did three years of post-doc work in Cooperative Learning Studies at MIT. My PhD thesis? It was titled, \u2018Coordination Strategies in the Classroom for Eliminating the Concept of the Individual.\u2019\u201dFrom Wikipedia, \u201cCooperative Learning\u201d: \u201cStudents must work in groups to complete tasks collectively toward academic goals. Unlike individual learning, which can be competitive in nature, students learning cooperatively can capitalize on one another\u2019s resources and skills\u2026 Furthermore, the teacher\u2019s role changes from giving information to facilitating students\u2019 learning. Everyone succeeds when the group succeeds.\u201dThat is a towering assemblage of bullshit.\u201cEveryone succeeds when the group succeeds.\u201dYou could use that quote on the back cover of Orwell\u2019s 1984 or Huxley\u2019s Brave New World . Everyone does not succeed \u2014 because the individual never finds out what he can do on his own. That avenue is cut off. He only knows what he can achieve in combination with others. He only knows what he can understand when he borrows from others. He may never glimpse what he truly wants to do in life.This is a tragic situation, but the tragedy is concealed, because the memory of shifting from individual independence to group dependence is gone. There is no such memory. A child is brought up without independence. Therefore, how can he recall losing it?He only knows the group and the team and the participation and the praise. He only knows the organizing of his life within a synthetically produced context.He is taught that this is good and necessary.So, one day, when a bolt comes out of the blue and he recognizes he is himself, what will he use to grasp that revelation and build on it?Yes, there are productive groups and teams, and one is always working with others, to some degree. But the core and the starting point is one\u2019s self. That is where the insight and the magic begin. That is where the great decisions and commitments are made. That is where the world is born, every day.I see no end of writing about this magic, because civilization has been turned upside down by treacherous people who have been fabricating a counter-tradition that will sink the ship.
