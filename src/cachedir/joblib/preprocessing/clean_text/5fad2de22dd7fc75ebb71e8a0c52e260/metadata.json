[Here are a handful of wins from 2016 \u2014  victories achieved by Americans in the face of opposition from the media, big business, the political establishment, and progressives.  1) The collapse of Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. Bush infamously called illegal immigration an \u201cact of love\u201d and wanted to force   Americans to compete with an unlimited supply of foreign professionals for decent jobs. He said he wanted to grant legal status, and U. S. citizenship, to tens of millions of illegal aliens. He declared enforcing immigration law was not an \u201cAmerican value. \u201d Rubio, of course, pushed for the   \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill that would have flooded America with 33 million new migrants seeking U. S. jobs and granted amnesty plus an unlimited supply of foreign college graduates and refugees  \u2014  after swearing to the Tea Party voters who put him in the Senate he would never vote for an amnesty bill. GOP voters reacted by tanking Bush in South Carolina and dealing Rubio a humiliating defeat in Florida during the Republican primaries. 2) Electing Donald Trump as President of the United States. Voters elected Trump not because he was a billionaire celebrity who writes his own tweets, but because he campaigned at great personal expense and risk to build a wall, deport illegal aliens, reform   programs, halt the illicit drug trade, prevent Islamic terrorism, renegotiate trade deals outsourcing U. S. jobs, and curb American involvement in   Middle Eastern conflicts. Rubio and Bush were comically out of touch with Americans\u2019 concerns about these issues. In a mere 18 months, the conventional wisdom about ratcheting up immigration and handing out amnesty to illegals was swept away. Trump\u2019s first term is very promising for   immigration reformers \u2014  and at the very least, Hillary Clinton will never have the chance to make her open borders \u201cdream\u201d a reality. 3) Victims of illegal alien crime and their families receiving national awareness, sympathy, and outrage on their behalf. Forget reporters calling them a \u201chate group\u201d and a \u201chate rally\u201d \u2014  for the first time these   families told their stories directly to their fellow citizens on the national stage and asked for justice. Celebrities are told they\u2019re \u201cso brave\u201d for posing nude and tweeting about women\u2019s\u2019 rights, but it takes real courage to recount your son\u2019s death at the hands of an illegal alien, publicly, in the hopes no parent is ever made to suffer such a loss. Illegal alien crime is almost completely preventable, and Americans rewarded the only candidate who took their side in this crisis with the presidency. 4) Fewer Americans trust the media and its stealthy pleas for amnesty and mass immigration. Despite    media propaganda about mass immigration and the aggressive denials that any drawbacks exist, over half of all voters are openly insisting they want immigration levels halved or reduced to zero. Another 58 percent believe illegal aliens should not be allowed to stay in the U. S. period. Breitbart News previously reported on a poll that found 75 percent of voters want unemployed Americans to receive U. S. jobs, compared to only three percent who think the U. S. should import more foreigners to fill them.   percent said politicians \u201cwho would rather import foreign workers to take jobs rather than give them to current U. S. residents [are] unfit to hold office. \u201d Meanwhile, trust in the media continues to hover at an   low. 5) The facts about immigration continue to \u201ccome out of the shadows. \u201d There is now no excuse for leftists and the media to sneer at anyone who questions mass immigration as \u201cdemagogues. \u201d   million migrants is an enormous number of people to fit into a country in only a few decades. Businesses got cheaper workers and Democrats got more voters, but the nation got millions of new residents who have little incentive to assimilate. Voters are finally allowed to ask: Do we want to live in a country where barbaric practices  \u2014   such as beheadings, animal sacrifice, and female genital mutilation  \u2014   take place? Do we want our children to learn \u201cthe value of diversity\u201d instead of math, reading, science, writing, and American history? The media can no longer cover up these stories so easily, and political correctness lost much of its power over the immigration debate. 6) The nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. Thanks to the Democrats\u2019 nuclear option, the   Sessions is almost certainly a \u201clock\u201d for Attorney General. A   Department of Justice will crack down on lawless sanctuary cities, help craft tougher sentences to penalize drug trafficking, and overhaul the department to answer voters\u2019 calls for law and order. 7) Paul Ryan abandoning the   visa program. This visa program would have given 198, 000   jobs to migrants instead of unemployed or underemployed Americans. Ryan\u2019s decision to not continue the   program may be a sign that one of the nation\u2019s leading advocates for importing foreign workers may have learned a lesson or two. The     program allows companies to annually bring in 66, 000 foreign workers instead of hiring Americans. The program provides the companies with cheap seasonal workers, minimizes the need for companies to recruit and train Americans, and it also cuts the salaries paid to   American workers, say advocates. Ryan\u2019s December 2015 language expanded the visa program by saying that foreign   workers would not count towards the annual 66, 000 limit if they had worked for a   employer during the prior three years. In effect, the \u201creturning worker exemption\u201d covertly quadrupled the size of the   program from 66, 000 visas per year up to 264, 000 visas per year. That is an increase of up to 198, 000 outsourcing visas each year. Ryan has retreated on his \u201c  Plan\u201d before Trump assumed office, but cautious voters should still assume that he adheres to his     immigration and amnesty beliefs.  8) The death of the bill promising to slash prison sentences for drug traffickers, including many illegal aliens. As murders rise in major cities and a raging opioid epidemic claims tens of thousands of lives, some Republicans partnered with Democrats to spring federal drug traffickers from prison. As Breitbart News has previously reported: Nearly a quarter of all inmates in federal prison are   according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, most of which are Mexicans. The bill would have released illegal alien drug traffickers into American communities without requiring their deportations. Fortunately, under a Trump administration, the bill has virtually no chance of becoming law.'"}, "time": 1742563088.3855004}
