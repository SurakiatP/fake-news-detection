Investigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target\u2019s mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions. The NSO Group\u2019s software can read text messages and emails and track calls and contacts. It can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the whereabouts of the phone user. In response, Apple on Thursday released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9. 3. 5. Users can get the patch through a normal software update. Apple fixed the holes 10 days after a tip from two researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company. \u201cWe advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,\u201d said Fred Sainz, a company spokesman. In interviews and manuals, the NSO Group\u2019s executives have long boasted that their spyware worked like a \u201cghost,\u201d tracking the moves and keystrokes of its targets, without leaving a trace. But until this month, it was not clear how exactly the group was monitoring its targets, or who exactly it was monitoring. A clearer picture began to emerge on Aug. 10, when Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been tracked by surveillance software several times, began receiving suspicious text messages. The messages purported to contain information about the torture of U. A. E. citizens. Mr. Mansoor passed the messages to researchers at the Citizen Lab, who confirmed they were an attempt to track him through his iPhone. This latest effort was far more sophisticated than what was found aimed at his devices before. The researchers found it was connecting to 200 servers, several of them registered to the NSO Group. Strewn throughout the spyware code were references to Pegasus, the name of an NSO Group spyware product. Citizen Lab brought in Lookout to help examine the code. Together, they discovered that the spyware relied on three previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities  \u2014   called \u201czero days\u201d because Apple didn\u2019t know about them and had zero days to patch them. In many cases, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate those of the Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and even the Pokemon Company to gain the trust of its targets, according to the researchers. \u201cNSO Group was very professional, and very effective in staying silent,\u201d said Mike Murray, a vice president at Lookout. In recent years, zero day flaws have been traded among hackers, brokers, companies like the NSO Group, and spy agencies and law enforcement networks eager for ways to break into devices. Flaws in Apple\u2019s iOS software are sold at a premium. Last year, a similar   exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS software was sold to Zerodium, a Washington buyer and seller of   for $1 million. Earlier this year, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced that his agency had paid hackers who found a way for the F. B. I. to crack into an iPhone used by one of the shooters in last year\u2019s mass killings in San Bernardino, Calif. Neither the hackers nor the F. B. I. have told Apple how this was accomplished. Apple\u2019s software update patches the NSO Group\u2019s exploits, but it is unclear whether the company has patched the vulnerabilities used by the F. B. I. to crack into its iPhone. Apple recently began a \u201cbug bounty\u201d program to pay hackers who report vulnerabilities in its systems. Among the other NSO targets, besides Mr. Mansoor, were Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican journalist, who broke a story on conflicts of interest among Mexico\u2019s ruling family. In several cases, NSO Group\u2019s tools had been crafted to target users in Yemen, Turkey, Mozambique, Mexico, Kenya and the U. A. E. Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said in an email, \u201cThe company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations. \u201d Mr. Dahbash added that NSO Group does not operate any of its systems and requires that its customers use its products in a \u201clawful manner. \u201d \u201cSpecifically,\u201d he said, \u201cthe products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes. \u201d He would not say if the software is used by government agencies in the U. A. E. or Mexico. In 2014, NSO Group sold a majority stake to San   private equity firm Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million. Francisco Partners declined to comment. Mr. Mansoor said in an interview that the discoveries were a sad reminder that no matter what he does to protect his devices and digital security, he will continue to be a target for companies that provide this sort of spying technology. \u201cI guess I am their regular customer,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the guinea pig. \u201d Bill Marczak, the researcher at Citizen Lab who has been helping Mr. Mansoor protect his digital security, said that the surveillance experienced by Mr. Mansoor is likely to expand. \u201cThe targeting of these activists and dissidents is a taste of what\u2019s to come,\u201d Mr. Marczak said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re facing today will be faced by ordinary users tomorrow. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563283.9133024}
