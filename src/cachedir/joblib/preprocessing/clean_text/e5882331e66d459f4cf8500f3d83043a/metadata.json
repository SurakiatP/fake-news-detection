[\u201cI hope the Senate will stop it, it\u2019s bad public policy,\u201d Schneiderman said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect people with   conditions it\u2019ll cost millions of people healthcare. \u201d  \u201cBut, if they pass the bill in the form the House passed it,\u201d he said, \u201cit is unconstitutional. It includes an unconstitutional attack on women\u2019s rights to reproductive health services, including abortion. \u201d Schneiderman called the AHCA \u201cbad public policy\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in its current state after the House passed it Thursday. \u201cIn a tricky way, [it] tries to wipe out Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to kill off Planned Parenthood, which would impose an undue burden on women\u2019s   rights. \u201d \u201cWe are beseeching the Senate to make sure this never becomes the law of the land,\u201d Schneiderman added. Several Republican Senators warned that they would not pass the AHCA in its current state and would instead write their own bill. \u201cWe cannot pull the rug out from under states like Nevada that expanded Medicaid, and we need assurances that people with   conditions will be protected,\u201d Sen. Dean Heller ( ) said in a statement. President Trump, however, says he is \u201cso confident\u201d that the Senate will pass the AHCA even before the Congressional Budget Office releases their analysis estimating the law\u2019s cost and impact on the nation.'"}, "time": 1742561767.893885}
