Heat is a familiar part of life in Phalodi, in the deserts of Rajasthan, so residents were following a familiar drill even before temperatures soared to 123. 8 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday: When the heat comes, stay indoors, chug buttermilk and, if you must go out, cover your head and pray for shade. It is a drill that may prove ever more necessary if temperatures continue to rise. Dr. Bhani Ram Paliwal, the principal medical officer at a government hospital in Phalodi, could not remember a day like Thursday in 15 years of working there. Roughly 500 patients, almost double the average number, visited his outpatient department, many complaining of diarrhea and fever. \u201cIt was like heat waves were coming out of a clay oven,\u201d he said. Scientists say that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high pace, average global temperatures could rise by more than six degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. \u201cClimate change is obviously going to be playing a role,\u201d said Andrew Robertson, a senior research scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. May is typically the hottest month in much of India, Dr. Robertson said, with lots of sun and stagnating   air leading to broiling temperatures. The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast a severe heat wave for parts of western India through Saturday. Extreme heat was also forecast across central and northern India into next week, though officials say another record high is unlikely. The heat is amplified by an accompanying drought across much of the country. As farmers await the rains of this season\u2019s monsoon, they continue to struggle with the effects of inadequate rainfall from the last monsoon: negligible crop yields, scarce drinking water and emaciated cattle. \u201cMy buffalo is giving only   of the normal milk,\u201d said Dinesh Bishnoi, a farmer in the village of Sajananiyo ki Dhani near Phalodi. His grandfather, who is 93, \u201chas never seen this kind of heat in his life,\u201d he said. This year, India is facing \u201ca double whammy: more heat and less water,\u201d said Dileep Mavalankar, the director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, who helped develop the city of Ahmedabad\u2019s plan to cope with heat waves after a deadly one in 2010. \u201cThe main protection against heat is water,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have adequate water or water gets contaminated, you might die because of diarrhea and dehydration in the summer. \u201d Last year more than 2, 400 people died from   illness in India, according to India\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority. Many of those who died were laborers and farmhands who work outside, even in peak temperatures, officials said. India\u2019s former record high was 60 years ago, when temperatures reached 123 degrees Fahrenheit in Alwar, also a city in Rajasthan. The heat makes going outside virtually unthinkable and, experts say, staying indoors is a critical safety measure. \u201cIf you go outside you can\u2019t survive in this heat wave,\u201d Dr. Paliwal said.'"}, "time": 1742561863.9942558}
