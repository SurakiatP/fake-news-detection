That\u2019s my honest, sober observation \u2014 from a person who is a full professor, has a Ph.D., was well-trained in and had taught epistemology and the scientific method to undergraduate and graduate students. I go to where the empirical evidence leads me. \\nOne of the most far-out conspiracy theories is that a shadowy group of \u00e9lites controls governments. In the United States, those \u00e9lites variously are called shadow government, secret government or deep state. (See \u201c Deep State: Who really rules America \u201d) \\nAn even more far-out version of that conspiracy theory is that the shadowy \u00e9lites are satanists. \\nThis post is about Hillary Clinton and her close associates being satanists. Really. Exhibit A Larry Nichols in 2009 \\nI originally reported the following more than a year ago in \u201c Clinton friend and assassin Larry Nichols says Hillary Clinton is a satanist \u201c. \\nLarry Nichols is a former Green Beret and a longtime associate of Bill Clinton. The two men first met in Arkansas in the late 1970s when Bill was an up-and-coming politician. When Bill was elected governor of Arkansas, he inserted Nichols as the marketing director of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority , an Arkansas state agency that was one of the entities investigated by the Senate Whitewater Committee . \\nOn the Pete Santilli radio show on September 24, 2013, Nichols admitted that he had killed people as the Clintons\u2019 hit man or assassin-for-hire. (See \u201c Bombshell: Long-time Clinton associate says he killed people for Bill & Hillary \u201c) \\nOn June 24, 2015, interviewed by Alex Jones for InfoWars , Nichols dropped another bombshell. He said, beginning at the 28:44 mark in the audio above: \\n\u201cBack when Hillary was first lady, she would go home on the weekends to California with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason * and some of the other ladies of \u2018Designing Women\u2019. And they went to a church for witches. Witches, witches, witches . . . . You know that lady that was tryin\u2019 to run for the Senate and sometimes she\u2019d gone to some place where they did witch stuff? Hillary went to a church and worshiped Satan . . . . What . . . I think is scaring the hell out of you: there are people that love them [Clintons], no matter what.\u201d \\n* Note: Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, together with her husband Harry, was the producer of Designing Women , a popular TV sitcom (1986-1993). Exhibit B \\nI first reported the following in a post about two months ago, \u201c Hillary aide talks about animal sacrifice to demon Moloch in WikiLeaks email \u201c. \\nIn early August 2016, WikiLeaks released a (hacked) email from W. Lewis Amselem to Cheryl Mills, Hillary\u2019s chief of staff. At the time of the email, Amselem served in the State Department under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as head of the U.S. delegation to the Organization of American States (OAS). (He has since retired.) In the email, Amselem made mention of \u201csacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch\u201d \u2014 an ancient demon. \\nBelow is a screenshot I took of the WikiLeaks email (you can see the email for yourself here ). I painted a red bracket around the animal sacrifice phrase. \\nIn the Old Testament , Gehenna was a valley by Jerusalem, where apostate Israelites and followers of various pagan gods sacrificed their children by fire (2 Chr. 28:3, 33:6; Jer. 7:31, 19:2\u20136). One of those gods was Moloch (aka Molech, Molekh, Molok, Molek, Molock, Moloc, Melech, Milcom or Molcom), an ancient Ammonite god who demanded a particular kind of propitiatory child sacrifice from parents. ( Amselem is a Sephardic Jewish surname.) Exhibit C \\nThe latest evidence of satanism on the part of a Hillary Clinton associate is an email recently released by WikiLeaks . \\nThe email was sent from Tony Podesta, a powerful Democrat lobbyist, to his brother John Podesta , a longtime Clinton associate who is the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Tony had forwarded an invitation to attend a satanic ritual called \u201cspirit cooking dinner\u201d from Marina Abramovic, 69, a Serbian \u201cperformance artist\u201d who now lives in New York. Abramovic\u2019s email says: \\n\u201cDear Tony, \\nI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? \u201c \\nTony appended to Abramovic\u2019s invitation this message to John Podesta: \\n\u201cAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner. \u201d Here\u2019s a screenshot of the email (you can view it on WikiLeaks here ): Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars explains that \u201cspirit cooking\u201d is a \u201csacrament\u201d in Thelema \u2014 a religion founded by British occultist-satanist Aleister Crowley, whose motto was \u201cDo As Thou Wilt\u201d\u2014 in which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are mixed to create a \u201cpainting.\u201d According to Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then \u201cspirit cooking\u201d is a \u201cspiritual ceremony\u201d\u2014\u201cto symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine\u201d and \u201ca representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism \u2018As Above, So Below\u2019.\u201d Mike Cernovich cuts (no pun intended) to the quick: Spirit cooking is an \u201coccult practice used during sex cult rituals , as explained in the book Spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes .\u201d So who is Marina Abramovic? Let\u2019s begin with this disturbing image of Abramovic posing with a bloody goat\u2019s head \u2014 a representation of Baphomet: Here\u2019s a video of Abramovic on \u201cspirit cooking painting\u201d: Cassandra Fairbanks of WeAreChange.org has more information on Marina Abramovic: She is known for gory \u201cperformance art\u201d in the name of \u201cconfronting pain and ritual.\u201d One of Abramovic\u2019s performances involved repeatedly stabbing herself in her hands. Another featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming pentagram, then jumping inside the pentagram and fainting. Exhibit D \\nMany FBI agents involved in the now re-opened criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, who we would expect to know more about her than we do, regard Hillary Clinton as the antiChrist. \\nSpencer Ackerman reports for The Guardian , Nov. 4, 2016: \\n\u201cDeep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. \\nCurrent and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \\n\u2018The FBI is Trumpland,\u2019 said one current agent. [\u2026] \\nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u2018the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel ,\u2019 and that \u2018the reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u2019\u201d \\nH/t FOTM \u2018s Anon and Will Shanley \\nSee also:'"}, "time": 1742564488.9510624}
