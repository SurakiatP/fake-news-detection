Wilmore, visibly infuriated by MILO\u2019s comments, said \u201chang on a second, you can go f*** yourself alright,\u201d to rapturous applause and squealing from Maher\u2019s audience. \u201cYour argument is that these people are stupid, you didn\u2019t hear a word what this man said earlier in this segment because he can talk circles around your pathetic, douchey little ass,\u201d he continued. Wilmore then challenged MILO\u2019s theory that Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones is barely literate. \u201d \u201cLeslie Jones is not barely litterate, you can go f*** yourself again for that one,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cShe\u2019s a very thoughtful person and very funny. \u201d Why is the goofy white boy coming thru!! The announcers won\u2019t even call him lebron. The jamesing like a Muthafucka! Wake up James!!  \u2014   Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) June 3, 2016,  \u201cYou should check her twitter feed, she can barely spell,\u201d MILO responded. Despite not receiving support from Maher\u2019s   audience, Georgian Congressman Jack Kingston did come to MILO\u2019s defense. \u201cLarry, I\u2019m a great fan of yours man, but we are all about the First Amendment here and MILO, go for it brother, because I think what they did you to in Berkeley was atrocious. \u201d Watch MILO\u2019s appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher at this link, and watch his Overtime appearance below.
