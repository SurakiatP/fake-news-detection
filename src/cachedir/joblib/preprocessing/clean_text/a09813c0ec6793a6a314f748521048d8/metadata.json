C.  \u2014   Coursing beneath the boisterous chanting of the  \u2019s name Tuesday night  \u2014   that single syllable that will now forever conjure more than just a gilded real estate empire  \u2014   were the more nuanced hopes, fears and expectations of the Americans who shocked the world, and even themselves, by electing Donald J. Trump president of the United States. It was a combination of emotions that felt as novel and raw as the candidate himself. In interviews around the country, many supporters said they hoped for great things under a President Trump  \u2014   though many also said they had no idea what they were in for. And nearly all of them agreed that Mr. Trump had, like many good businessmen before him, found a way to expertly tap a well of hidden demand  \u2014   in this case, for a champion among what he called the nation\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of mistrust between the people and their government in Washington, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a result like this,\u201d said Ken Merrifield, 53, the mayor of Franklin, N. H. \u201cIt\u2019s a revolution. \u201d On Tuesday evening at an election party here, Dennis M. English Jr. stood in the crowd in a tailored suit, clutching a fat celebratory cigar. He jabbed a fist in the air as Fox News recorded victory after victory for Mr. Trump. \u201cThis isn\u2019t all white people!\u201d yelled Mr. English, who is black. \u201cMinorities are voting for Trump, I\u2019m telling you!\u201d (Exit polls showed 87 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s vote came from whites 2 percent came from blacks.) Mr. English is the director of a state office that helps businesses owned by minorities compete for government contracts. In his work, he said, he had toured some of the most depressed counties in eastern North Carolina. Before Mr. Trump, he said, it seemed that few politicians were addressing the grievances of people who were economically wounded by   deals that hastened the downfall of the textile industry. \u201cWe need to get those jobs back,\u201d Mr. English said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be on the ground. I\u2019m talking thousands of people who are walking around those counties unemployed. \u201d In Wisconsin, Beth Schmidt, chairwoman of the Rock County Republican Party, said she woke up Wednesday morning feeling happy but a little stupefied. \u201cAs a Republican, I should be bouncing off the walls,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what to think. \u201d Ms. Schmidt, a    mother of three adult children, is fervently against abortion. She feels that welfare is necessary, but that it has become overused. She was not one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, instead favoring Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina in the primary season. But she \u201cmoved forward\u201d in the general election, deciding to vote for Mr. Trump in the end. She is convinced that Mr. Trump will surround himself with smart and experienced people. \u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see that he will, surprisingly, bring people together,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to pray for this. As time goes on, people are going to see a different Trump. \u201d To Mark Harris, a businessman from Georgia, Mr. Trump\u2019s indecorous outbursts and often crude behavior were a price worth paying for the   he believed Mr. Trump would bring to government. \u201cA lot of the American people can put aside him being rough around the edges to take the chance on the change that he talked about,\u201d he said. Mr. Harris, 49, a retailer in one of Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs, could hardly contain his glee over Tuesday\u2019s outcome. It was, he said, an unrestrained rejection of politicians, lobbyists and the news media. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of the government in Washington, D. C.,\u201d he said. But he also had a warning for Mr. Trump: Break your promises at your peril. \u201cIn four years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll see if he\u2019s smart enough to be able to go through with what he\u2019s promised the American people,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIf he\u2019s able to put into motion what he has proposed over this election, he will win in four years, hands down. \u201d At the same time, some supporters seem to have installed a sort of   decoder of the Trumpian style, harboring a sense that some of his most audacious promises  \u2014   like the plan to build a southern border wall, and make Mexico pay for it  \u2014   are perhaps not best taken literally. Joseph Connor, of Bergen County, N. J. said it was the general principles in Mr. Trump\u2019s message that were more important, particularly the idea of getting government out of the way of commerce. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to shed regulation and let Americans do great things in the world,\u201d said Mr. Connor, who works in finance and belies the stereotype of Trump voters as working class and rural. \u201cAnd I see that in Trump. \u201d At Republicans\u2019 election night party in Phoenix, a pair of friends, Linda M. Wright and Susan Cheatham, pumped their fists and thanked Jesus for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to raise our taxes,\u201d said Ms. Wright, 58, of Phoenix. \u201cHe\u2019s going to protect our borders,\u201d said Ms. Cheatham, 53, of Scottsdale. \u201cHe won\u2019t take our weapons away,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cHe will appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect our Constitution,\u201d Ms. Cheatham said. \u201cYeah, protect the Constitution  \u2014   that\u2019s key,\u201d Ms. Wright concluded. They agreed that Mr. Trump represents their version of America: a place that loves God and cares for its military. \u201cNobody has the right to come into our country and steal it from me,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like our country, don\u2019t move here. Don\u2019t come here and try to impose your religion on us. \u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Ms. Cheatham said, \u201cShariah law. \u201d With his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States and to deport all of the nation\u2019s illegal immigrants (positions that he seems to have since altered) Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was bound to speak to the country\u2019s white nationalists: In Louisiana on Tuesday, David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who mounted an unsuccessful Senate bid, celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThe great mass of his supporters, the overwhelming white vote, they also have a right to respect their heritage, their values,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe he\u2019s really an advocate of Western Christian civilization. \u201d But Mr. Duke rejected the idea that racism was part of Mr. Trump\u2019s message. So did Bridg Webb, 21, who was walking into a celebratory Republican rally at the   football stadium of the University of Utah on Tuesday. On the way, Mr. Webb said, someone drove by him and shouted, \u201cNazis!\u201d That, he said, was exactly what Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents  \u2014   in the news media, on the left, in urban centers  \u2014   failed to grasp about voters like him. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a bigot I\u2019ve been called a white supremacist,\u201d he said. \u201cI pride myself on being a good guy. I go out of my way to help people. All these things are so unfair, and it\u2019s all because I said I like Donald Trump. \u201d Mr. Webb grew up in a Mormon family in Elk Ridge, Utah, a community outside the conservative city of Provo. Though it is a safe place, and though Utah is humming along with 3. 4 percent unemployment, Mr. Webb said he felt creeping fears about the threat of terrorism after attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. He worried the American economy would not have a stable job for him. He hopes to become a police officer, and he worried that Mrs. Clinton would pass gun restrictions that could disarm law enforcement. Mr. Trump, he said, was a balm for those fears. Supporters like Jeanne Koval, 57, and her husband, Alan, 59, see themselves as part of a global movement against corrupt governments run by insiders. The couple, who hail from Fenton, Mich. were playing the slots on the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday night. Ms. Koval, a nurse, compared her support for Mr. Trump to the support that the Filipino nurses she works with have shown for the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte. \u201cThey were tired of the corruption, and they want someone who can get something done,\u201d she said. Neither could specifically say what change they wanted Mr. Trump to make, but they voiced concern about rising health care costs and jobs going overseas. Ms. Koval said her parents\u2019 health care premiums recently increased $600 a month. In Utah, Olivia Blackham, who was adopted from Guatemala as a baby, voted for Mr. Trump in her first presidential election. She did so in large part because, she said, she believed America\u2019s immigration system was broken. Ms. Blackham said she had been frustrated after working with refugees who received free health care while her   friends and family had to pay high premiums and hundreds of dollars for prescriptions. She said she believed Mr. Trump could fix that. \u201cI\u2019m really passionate about getting it straight,\u201d she said. But as the reality set in that Mr. Trump would become the 45th president of the United States, Ms. Blackham, 34, expressed a lingering uneasiness. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be scary,\u201d Ms. Blackham said. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a change. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628443.680213}
