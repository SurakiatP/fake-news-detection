But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life  \u2014   how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. \u201cFor many years, I couldn\u2019t talk about being an addict,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk about being imprisoned. I couldn\u2019t talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. \u201d She paused to fight back tears. \u201cI could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. \u201d But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. \u201cWe just did it on our own as a public service because we had the   personnel,\u201d Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year  \u2014   the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a   partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily want to give the impression that just because we\u2019re learning about more cases, the crime is increasing,\u201d Mr. Myles said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. \u201d Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being \u201cbought and sold, traded and bartered. \u201d \u201cUsually, the traffickers play on people\u2019s ignorance and na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d she said. \u201cTraffickers exploit people who are vulnerable. \u201d That is part of the lesson she imparts to airline personnel, along with practical advice on how to spot people who may be traveling against their will  \u2014   often young passengers who look disoriented, refuse to make eye contact or act oddly subservient to a traveling companion. American Airlines, Ms. Rivard\u2019s former employer, offers free miles to the volunteers of Airline Ambassadors International. American\u2019s employees already undergo training on human trafficking, led by the Department of Homeland Security, according to a company representative. Ms. Rivard said airlines\u2019 existing programs are not enough. She cited instances in which she said airline staff failed to take signs of trafficking seriously, and added that she wished more resources were available to her organization. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost much. We try to raise about $3, 000 per training\u201d from individual donors, she said. An Airline Ambassadors International training session in late January in Houston, just before the Super Bowl there, was filled to capacity. \u201cIt was an amazing event,\u201d Ms. Hubbard said. \u201cI give kudos to the city of Houston and to the agencies that are doing the work on the ground. \u201d Though human trafficking gets more attention during major sporting events like the Super Bowl, there is little hard evidence  \u2014   from Polaris or elsewhere  \u2014   to suggest a major spike in trafficking during large events. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to somehow give the impression that there are new victims and new types of trafficking that only happen around that time,\u201d Mr. Myles said, though he added that major events might lure criminals who were already operating in other areas. The Houston Police Department has been revamping its approach to human trafficking for years, said Capt. Dan Harris, of the department\u2019s vice division. It now offers training on human trafficking for officers as well as assistance for survivors. \u201cWe had the processes, the procedures and the relationships already in place,\u201d Captain Harris said. \u201cThe only thing we really did for the Super Bowl was work more hours in order to go after, mainly, the johns. \u201d While law enforcement agencies and charities work to address the problem on the ground, Ms. Hubbard and other flight attendants plan to keep an eye on things in the air. \u201cIf someone is being held against their will, then a crime is being committed inside my airplane,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it is my responsibility to make sure that these people  \u2014   whose lives are in my hands while they\u2019re on board my aircraft  \u2014   are safe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563213.8708148}
