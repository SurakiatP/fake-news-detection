Rioters caused an estimated $100, 000 in property damage in Berkeley on Wednesday, and only one person was arrested. Bank windows and ATMs were smashed, a Starbucks was looted,   graffiti was painted on store fronts, Molotov cocktails were thrown, and garbage fires were lit in the streets. On Thursday, Trump responded to the rioting by threatening to cancel federal funding for colleges that failed to protect the right of free speech. \u201cIf U. C.
