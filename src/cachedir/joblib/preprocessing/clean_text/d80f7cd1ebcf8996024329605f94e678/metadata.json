The killer turned out to be homegrown, a    Briton, Khalid Masood, who had a criminal record but was not on any   lists. The Islamic State, which rejects peace and coexistence, described Mr. Masood on Thursday as a disciple and a hero for the assault carried out a day earlier in the shadow of Big Ben. Mr. Masood plowed a rented Hyundai sport utility vehicle through pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge, killing two and injuring at least 40 crashed the vehicle into a fence and then emerged brandishing knives to fatally stab the constable before other police officers shot and killed him. On Thursday evening, another seriously injured victim died, bringing the total number of dead to five, including Mr. Masood. Details about Mr. Masood emerged on Thursday as the government worked to project normalcy and calm nerves. The authorities emphasized that they thought the assailant had acted alone, and that they did not expect any further attacks. But they raided six properties across the country, detaining eight people in London and Birmingham. \u201cYesterday, an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy,\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament, addressing colleagues who a day earlier had been placed on lockdown for hours. \u201cWe are not afraid, and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism. \u201d She called the violence \u201can attack on free people everywhere. \u201d At the United Nations, where the Security Council observed a minute of silence, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said, \u201cThe world is united to defeat the people who launched this attack and to defeat their bankrupt and odious ideology. \u201d Even as the British capital returned to its daily rhythms, and as Parliament resumed business, police officers were trying to learn whether they had missed signs of Mr. Masood\u2019s radicalization. He was born on Dec. 25, 1964, in Kent, in southeastern England, and had recently lived near Birmingham, historically known for its automotive industry and now home to many South Asian and Caribbean immigrants and their children. It was there, in the Spring Hill neighborhood, that Mr. Masood rented from an Enterprise branch the Hyundai Tucson that he used in the attack. Mr. Masood had a record of convictions, from 1983 to 2003, for assault, weapons possession and violations of public order. But he was not the subject of any current investigation, and \u201cthere was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,\u201d the London police said. Birmingham has a history of connections with radicalism. It was home to Rashid Rauf, a liaison to Al Qaeda and a main suspect in a plot to blow up   airliners in 2006 he was killed in 2008 in an American airstrike in northern Pakistan. Last year, security services foiled a bomb plot in Birmingham, linked to extremists. The Home Office made support for the Islamic State a criminal offense in June 2014, when Mrs. May was home secretary, and experts on radicalism said that the change had driven many extremists underground. On Thursday morning, the Islamic State issued a statement on the messaging app Telegram, calling the attacker a soldier who had \u201ccarried out the operation in response to appeals\u201d to fight Western powers involved in military operations in the Middle East. The group has called for attacks on Britain, and Mr. Masood\u2019s assault was reminiscent of attacks in France and Germany carried out with vehicles. A man tried to drive into a crowd in Antwerp, Belgium, on Thursday but was stopped. Mrs. May visited victims at a hospital in London for 40 minutes on Thursday, according to her office. Details about most have not been released, but some information has dribbled out. Police Constable Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was patrolling the Parliament building when the assailant fatally stabbed him. Tributes for Constable Palmer have poured in, and the Metropolitan Police announced on Twitter that his badge number would be retired. \u201cKeith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty  \u2014   protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life,\u201d London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said. Kurt W. Cochran, an American traveling in Europe with his wife, Melissa Payne Cochran, died of injuries, according to a statement from the family issued through the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in Salt Lake City. Clint Payne, Mr. Cochran\u2019s    said in the statement that the couple had been traveling in Europe for their 25th wedding anniversary, and had been scheduled to fly home on Thursday. He called Mr. Cochran \u201ca good man and a loving husband. \u201d Mr. Cochran\u2019s wife was wounded in the attack, and hospitalized with \u201ca broken leg, a broken rib and a cut on her head,\u201d her sister, Sarah   said in a post on Facebook. Their parents were serving as missionaries in London, according to the church. The couple ran a recording studio in West Bountiful, Utah, and Mr. Cochran had shared pictures of their stops in Germany and Scotland. Aysha Frade, 43, a British teacher who lived in London, was fatally injured as she was heading to pick up her two daughters. She taught Spanish not far from Westminster Bridge, according to the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, and she had family in Spain, according to the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The injured also included three   boys from the Brittany region of France who were on the bridge with other visiting students and who sustained leg and arm fractures. On Thursday, the French Education Ministry said that their conditions were no longer  . Five South Koreans were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. Four of them  \u2014   three women and a man in their 50s and 60s  \u2014   suffered fractures and other injuries. A    woman, however, required surgery for a head injury, according to South Korean news reports. The two Romanian victims, Andreea Cristea, 31, and Andrei Burnaz, 32, were from the Black Sea port city of Constanta, according to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, which quoted an official saying they had been visiting London to celebrate Mr. Burnaz\u2019s birthday. Ms. Cristea was rescued after she plunged off the bridge into the Thames as the assailant careened the S. U. V. through the crowd, and news reports said she suffered serious head injuries and lung damage. Mr. Burnaz\u2019s foot was fractured. An area outside Parliament remained a large crime scene on Thursday, as police officers examined the pavement stones for clues. The Palace of Westminster, which includes the Houses of Parliament, is a bewildering warren of corridors, and the work of ensuring that it was clear of assailants took time in the immediate aftermath of the assault. A group of visiting schoolchildren  \u2014   some in tears  \u2014   were among those caught up in the confusion, which lasted for hours. Lawmakers were confined to specific areas, where they were given water and in some cases sandwiches. But what some lacked most of all was the power to communicate, and to check that their staff was safe. Over all, the atmosphere was one of calm and cooperation, however. \u201cPeople appreciated the gravity of the situation,\u201d said Nigel Evans, a Conservative lawmaker. That may have been partly because an attack of this type had not been completely unexpected. Security has been noticeably tightened in Parliament in recent years, with large barriers placed in front of parts of the building to thwart the threat of a truck bomb. Police officers with submachine guns patrol the grounds routinely. But the complex is by a busy street, and some lawmakers still wonder whether some of the security was designed with the idea of fending off the type of attacks once mounted by the Irish Republican Army, which in 1979 assassinated a Conservative lawmaker, Airey Neave, using a car bomb in Parliament. \u201cI am shocked, but I am not surprised,\u201d Chris Bryant, a Labour lawmaker, said of the latest attack. \u201cWe have always known that a marauding attack by an individual would be the most difficult to prevent. \u201d On Thursday, with tightened security, lawmakers crowded into the parliamentary chamber determined to show that they would not be deterred. Ed Miliband, a former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the mood had been one of \u201cshock and determination and also admiration for the job that the security people are doing. \u201d \u201cI think we are seeing people\u2019s increased determination to carry on with their normal business,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564118.0419276}
