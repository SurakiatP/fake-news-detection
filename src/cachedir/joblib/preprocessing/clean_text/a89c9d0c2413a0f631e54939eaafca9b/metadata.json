Here\u2019s an excerpt from it, because it is an \u201carticle\u201d that is completely false, written by Andy Borowitz for The New Yorker and it appeared November 5th as The Borowitz Report .\\nTHIS EXCERPT IS FROM A FALSE ARTICLE, LABELED AS \u201cCOMEDY\u201d \\n\u201cThe Russian President seemed to relish the warm response he got at his first Trump rally, in Tampa, Florida, where he led the crowd in a raucous chant of \u201cLock her up.\u201d While some in the media criticized the Trump campaign for allowing Putin to influence the outcome of a U.S. election, the Republican nominee\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, pushed back in an appearance on CNN. \\n\u201cThis is just another case of media bias against Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cJay Z and Beyonc\u00e9, who have no experience in government at all, are allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton, but Vladimir Putin, who actually runs an entire country, can\u2019t appear with Donald Trump? Come on.\u201d \\nONCE AGAIN: THIS EXCERPT IS NOT TRUE AND IS NOT NEWS. \\nThis article (as further evidenced by its e-mail address) is listed as \u201chumor,\u201d and The Borowitz Report is supposed to be comedic. Andy Borowitz is a New York Times bestselling author who was the creator of \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d and has written for the New Yorker since 1998. In 2001, apparently, he created the Borowitz Report that is listed in Wikipedia as being \u201ca satirical news column that has millions of readers around the world.\u201d\\nI personally do not find one thing funny about it, but there\u2019s plenty that is \u201cfunny\u201d about it in another meaning. \\nAndy Borowitz is a Harvard graduate who just happened to have worked for the Democratic National Convention in 2004. His work is picked up by the Mainstream Media Marxist Monopoly (MMMM, my own term) by such notable Pravda-like publications such as the LA Times, Seattle Times, Philadelphia Enquirer, and the Huffington Post. Borowitz also appears periodically as an NPR Commentator.\\nThe excerpted article is a deliberate attempt at disinformation, \u201ccovering\u201d itself as \u201ccomedy.\u201d There is absolutely nothing funny or entertaining about that article. As his column is described as having \u201cmillions of readers around the world,\u201d Borowitz and his handlers and editors know exactly what they\u2019re doing .\\nThis deliberate piece of disinformation, masquerading as \u201ccomedy/satire\u201d and presented in a \u201cnews-style\u201d fashion in large circulation is meant to confuse and sway voters. \\nA substantial percentage of the American public believe the crafted script of the government is preparation of a false flag operation to rig the election and blame it on the Russians. They have set it up to convince people that the Russians are hacking into and manipulating our electoral process. \u201cHumor,\u201d it is labeled as? What is humorous about it? Absolutely nothing .\\nAbout a dozen websites listed the title of Borowitz\u2019s disinformation either whole or in part. Never having heard of Borowitz or his \u201ccolumn,\u201d I looked at it in horrified disbelief, then found on www.abovetopsecret.com on a commenting thread that \u201cThe Borowitz Report\u201d was not true news. I\u2019m glad the report is false, because it would be picked up and immediately pointed at to \u201cprove\u201d a \u201cRussian connection\u201d between Trump and Putin, and be used for further \u201cjustification\u201d for the U.S. government to pin the coming theft of the election/sabotage on Russia.\\nAs it stands, though, Borowitz put out this garbage and really made it appear \u201cnewsworthy\u201d to skew an already dumbed-down voting public into believing in the theatrics of its presentation, along with the \u201cconnection\u201d to further substantiate claims of a rigged election by Trump with the aid of Putin, the President of Russia. This is a pure Alinsky tactic of disinformation , as pure as you can find, and Borowitz can smile and say that it is just comedy, just satire.\\nJust Borowitz\u2019s \u201cfunny\u201d way of trying to influence an election using his \u201ccomedic column\u201d as a shield to protect him from any wrongdoing. \\nThe Trump rally in Reno, Nevada was \u201cdisturbed\u201d the other day on November 5, 2016. The disrupter was a man named Austyn Crites, a 33-year-old Republican who supports Clinton, an oxymoron in itself unless you consider George H.W. Bush and Colin Powell, Republicans who are voting for Clinton. Crites vociferated his displeasure at Trump and the Secret Service agents assigned to protect him removed the man from the audience . Authorities stated that no weapon was found upon him.\\nCrites is listed in the e-mails of John Podesta in Wikileaks as being a Clinton supporter. \\nIt is quite obvious this man deliberately disturbed the rally in Reno. It remains to be seen whether or not he is a paid operative of the Clinton campaign. Whether or not he is being paid, he was in the service of Hillary Clinton and performed his duties. He followed an Alinsky tactic of disrupting and attacking (either violently or nonviolently) a function or organization of an opponent to color it in a negative light and cause confusion and disruption .\\nFinally, we come to some information listed on www.thegatewaypundit.com , with a video courtesy of Fox Business News from Cavuto coast to coast . In this video clip of about 1 minute, Obama is being interviewed regarding whether or not illegal aliens will be able to vote in this election. Obama (made of Teflon through and through) did not directly \u201cbite,\u201d but still managed to hint at if an illegal alien should vote in the U.S. election? It probably would stand, as he said this on camera:\\n\u201cThe sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential.\u201d \\nPresident Barack Hussein Obama II \\nWhen you see the video there can be no doubt that the question was meant to lead him into his nebulous answer to exonerate him from any potential \u201cguilt,\u201d because nothing will come of it yet his point has been made. A sitting president of the U.S. has given assurances that illegal aliens will be able to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\\nThe Democrats and the \u201cinvisibles,\u201d the controllers from behind the scenes will be pulling out all of the stops. A false flag event is just around the corner, and these Marxists are all setting it up\u2026facilitators of whatever is planned, be it a \u201cfabricated\u201d cyberattack blamed on Russia, a Trump victory that will be \u201cnullified due to Russian influence,\u201d or even a theft that can be detected.\\nThis last item? Susan Duclos of All News Pipeline wrote an excellent article recently regarding such matters. Susan\u2019s piece detailed with great precision Obama\u2019s ability to suspend the elections as authorized under the John Warner Defense Act of 2006. She explained how he could declare martial law in accordance with National Security Presidential Directive 51 after classifying \u201ccivil unrest\u201d and disruption of elections and the government as a \u201ccatastrophic emergency.\u201d\\nA Hillary Clinton \u201cvictory\u201d and confirmation of election theft by Trump supporters will lead to a revolt , and civil unrest is the preferred emergency that Obama would use to declare martial law and suspend/nullify the election . No matter who wins, there will certainly be unrest, and that will probably be coupled with other actions undoubtedly being set up by Obama and the Democrats as we speak. Alinsky may be deceased, but his tactics are being employed by the Democrats in increasing frequency as we draw nearer to election day.\\nJeremiah Johnson is the Nom de plume of a retired Green Beret of the United States Army Special Forces (Airborne).
