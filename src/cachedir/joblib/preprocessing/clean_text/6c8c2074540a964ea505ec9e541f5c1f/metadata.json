Knowing this, Hillary gave her word that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign donations should she be elected president. However, a new leak just exposed her real plan for foreign donors, and it\u2019s not looking good. Hillary Clinton \\nOnce again, Hillary has landed herself in the middle of more scandalous activity. With the FBI reopening her email and private server investigation and WikiLeaks continuously exposing her corruption, she can\u2019t seem to catch a break \u2014 and she shouldn\u2019t. Her long list of scandals continues to grow, as should her nose, after being busted lying to the American people yet again to manipulate her way into our White House. \\nAccording to a leaked memo, Hillary\u2019s words mean nothing. Although she promised that the Clinton Foundation would cease accepting foreign donations if she were to be elected president, a leaked memo has exposed her real plans and proven that she didn\u2019t mean what she said. Two-faced Hillary told the public one thing, while her secret plan was for something much different. \\nThanks to WikiLeaks, the truth is again being revealed after the organization published an email that was sent to John Podesta, the Clinton Campaign chair. The email contained the leaked memo, which appears to have been crafted by Cheryl Mills, a Clinton aide, who wrote, \u201cI connected with HRC this am regarding the steps she will take with regard to the Foundation should she announce a decision to explore a run for the Presidency,\u201d just days before Hillary announced her run for president. \\nAlthough she\u2019s said otherwise throughout her campaign, Hillary\u2019s personal preference, as indicated by the leaked memo dated April 7, 2015, is for the foundation to continue accepting money from foreign governments, The Daily Caller reports, and this could mean bad news for Hillary as five FBI field offices are currently investigating her \u201cnonprofit\u201d foundation due to pay-to-play allegations, although the Department of Justice did their best to suppress investigations into the corrupt Clinton Foundation. \\nThe leaked memo clearly shows that Hillary indicated to staffers that her personal preference is for the foundation to continue to accept money from foreign governments, even if she is elected president . What\u2019s worse, the corrupt Clintons were hesitant to limit the foundation\u2019s financial operations in any way, as the memo says, Hillary \u201cdoes not want to limit the Foundation\u2019s ability to operate programs now or in the future,\u201d adding, \u201c we don\u2019t want to close the door to unexpected opportunities. \u201d \\nThe memo goes on to mention a \u201ccompromise\u201d option, where it says they could \u201csay that the Foundation will not accept contributions from foreign governments unless that funding is part of an ongoing program or a disbursement for a completed negotiation.\u201d However, under that option, the foundation would continue to accept money from Qatar despite Hillary\u2019s own admission that the country is financially supporting ISIS . \\nThe \u201cfinal option\u201d mentioned \u201cwould mirror the 2008 [Memorandum of Understanding] agreement whereby the Foundation submits new foreign government contributions and those of a substantial size increase to an independent body (e.g. White House, State Department) for review. The obvious challenge with this is that there is no independent body to make that review.\u201d However, as The Daily Caller notes, Hillary \u201cdid not uphold her end of the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),\u201d and even liberal-leaning PolitiFact ruled the claim that Hillary acted in accordance with the 2008 MOU \u201cmostly false.\u201d \\nWhen is enough, enough? The Clinton crime family will never change their ways and their fake foundation is only a front for their shady deals. The Clintons\u2019 greed for money and power is endless and nothing \u2014 not even our laws \u2014 will stand in the way of Hillary and Bill as they grab as much of both as they can. There\u2019s only one place Hillary belongs while on this earth, and that\u2019s not the Oval Office, it\u2019s a cinderblock cell. After her time there is done, she has a one-way ticket to hell, where she probably hopes to overthrow the devil. That is how evil, corrupt, and power hungry she is. Her deceit and depravity know no bounds, and she would even give the devil a run for his money. Do you really want that kind of person to be our next president?'"}, "time": 1742562832.7540221}
