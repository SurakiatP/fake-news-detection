[Such an unplanned,    meeting took place last Wednesday at the White House, where President Donald Trump sat down with TMZ President Harvey Levin, according to the New York Times. Levin and Trump have a history together, partly based around Trump\u2019s appearance on Levin\u2019s Fox News special \u201cObjectified. \u201d  The success of that show has now led to a spinoff series, also called \u201cObjectified. \u201d Levin spoke with Trump about appearing again on an episode of that series, which starts in September. However, he also asked the    to help in securing an interview with the most famous man not named Donald Trump to ever own a \u201cMAGA\u201d hat. That of course being Tom Brady. According to the New York Times, \u201cOne of Mr. Levin\u2019s ideal guests is Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback and a friend of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Levin planned to ask the president if he would help secure the athlete\u2019s participation, according to one of the people who described the visit. \u201d An    meeting with the leader of the free world, a probable second feature with POTUS on your TV show, then leveraging that visit to secure a better than average shot at getting an interview with greatest quarterback of all time? Not a bad way to spend a Wednesday afternoon. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn'"}, "time": 1742562549.1174085}
