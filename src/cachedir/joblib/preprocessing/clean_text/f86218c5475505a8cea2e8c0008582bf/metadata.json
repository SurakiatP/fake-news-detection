It was the first significant redrawing of the nutrition information on food labels since the federal government started requiring them in the early 1990s. Those labels were based on eating habits and nutrition data from the 1970s and \u201980s and before portion sizes expanded significantly. Federal health officials argued that the changes were needed to bring labels into step with the reality of the modern American diet. The Food and Drug Administration  proposed the changes in 2014, but consumer advocates worried that many of the major elements would not survive lobbying by the powerful food industry. A number of companies vigorously opposed, for example, a separate line for added sugars. But the final rule, announced by Michelle Obama on Friday, mostly remained intact, including the line on added sugars. \u201cThis has to be scored as a huge win,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cThe F. D. A. \u2019s final rules confirm what the agency proposed originally on the most important elements. The big ones  \u2014   calories, added sugars  \u2014   survived. \u201d The changes jump out. The calories are in large bold numbers, and are easier to spot at a glance. A single ice cream serving is   of a cup  \u2014   compared with the current half cup. Most food manufacturers will be required to use the new label by July 2018. Producers with less than $10 million in annual food sales will have an additional year to comply. Millions of Americans pay attention to food labels. The changes are meant to make them easier to understand  \u2014   a critical step in an era when more than   of adults are obese, public health experts say. The epidemic has caused rates of diabetes to soar and has increased risks for cancer, heart disease and stroke. Comments from companies and trade associations seemed to reflect acceptance. The American Beverage Association said its members had already put clearer calorie counts on the front of beverage bottles as a part of Ms. Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move!\u201d campaign. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents food and beverage companies, said, \u201cWe look forward to working with F. D. A. and other stakeholders on messages and activities to help consumers understand what the new labels mean. \u201d But the sugar industry did not relent in its criticism. The Sugar Association said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the F. D. A. \u2019s decision to require a separate line for added sugars. It argued that the rule lacked \u201cscientific justification. \u201d The association said, \u201cWe are concerned that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent that is not grounded in science, and could actually deter us from our shared goal of a healthier America. \u201d Getting the original nutrition labels on food packages was a major battle. Dr. David Kessler, the former F. D. A. commissioner, said the fight went all the way to the Oval Office, where the first President George Bush sided with the agency in what was considered a major victory for public health. \u201cThey got this right,\u201d he said of the new changes in an interview on Friday. \u201cThis will affect people\u2019s lives. It gives really important information to people who want to use it. \u201d It is also important for the food and beverage industry, he said. \u201cBy putting added sugars on the label, it creates incentives for industry to make healthier products, because they don\u2019t want to look bad with all of that sugar on the label. \u201d Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said he believed the new line for added sugars would help change behavior. \u201cA lot of people will be shocked to see how much sugar is in soda,\u201d he said. \u201cTeachers and parents will leap at that as something to show their kids. \u201d A   can of Coke has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar, which, according to Mr. Jacobson, is about the equivalent of 9. 2 teaspoons. He said a shortcoming of the new rules was that companies could still express sugar in grams, not in teaspoons.'"}, "time": 1742563085.7934313}
