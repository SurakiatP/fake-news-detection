We are a sovereign nation. If you\u2019re going to be a sovereign nation, you have to have borders and you have to protect those borders. Mark Zuckerberg has no idea of who\u2019s coming into this country and what it takes to vet those individuals. I as a law enforcement officer in my 39th year. We do a lot of vetting of people. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m tired of all the crocodile tears about the kids  \u2014   the poor kids coming,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about that.
