He described \u201ca global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations. \u201d The New York Stock Exchange, the hedge fund billionaire George Soros and the chief executive of the investment bank Goldman Sachs flashed across the screen. Now Mr. Trump has named a former Goldman executive and   with Mr. Soros to spearhead his economic policy. With Wednesday\u2019s nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman trader turned hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier, to be Treasury secretary, a new economic leadership is taking shape in Washington. Mr. Mnuchin will join Wilbur L. Ross Jr. a billionaire investor in distressed assets, who has been chosen to run the Commerce Department, and Todd Ricketts, owner of the Chicago Cubs, who has been picked to be deputy commerce secretary. All are superwealthy and to be overseen by the first billionaire president in United States history. That two investors  \u2014   Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross  \u2014   will occupy two major economic positions in the new administration is the most powerful signal yet that Mr. Trump plans to emphasize policies friendly to Wall Street, like tax cuts and a relaxation of regulation, in the early days of his administration. While that approach has been cheered by investors (the stocks of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been on a tear since the election) it stands in stark contrast to the populist campaign that Mr. Trump ran and the support he received from   voters across the country. Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund executive and member of the Trump transition team, insisted on Wednesday that appointing wealthy investors did not contradict the campaign\u2019s populist message. \u201cThe   people of the United States, they need a break,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cAnd we need to switch them from going from the working class into the working poor into what I call the aspirational working class, which my dad was a member of. \u201d Still, Democrats were quick to attack the latest nomination. \u201cSteve Mnuchin is just another Wall Street insider,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a joint statement. \u201cThat is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington  \u2014   that is hypocrisy at its worst. \u201d So far, none of the nominees who will be shaping economic policy have any significant experience in government. Mr. Mnuchin, 53, and Mr. Ross, 79, are both familiar with buying distressed properties and selling for a profit. But they are political neophytes with scant experience in managing large organizations. They will oversee two government agencies that together employ about 130, 000 people around the world. In the case of Mr. Mnuchin at Treasury, his experience as a principal investor who made large sums of money through     wagers suggests that he will look critically at the thicket of regulations that now constrain the   activities of investment banks. That could mean a reassessment of what has come to be known as the Volcker Rule, part of the   financial overhaul that followed the 2008 financial crisis. The rule forbids banks to make certain speculative investments with their own capital. \u201cI would say the No. 1 problem with the Volcker Rule is it\u2019s too complicated and people don\u2019t know how to interpret it,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to look at what to do with it as we are with all of  . The No. 1 priority is going to be to make sure that banks lend. \u201d In the interview, Mr. Mnuchin also said he would look to cutting corporate tax rates as a way to increase economic growth. And he said the wealthy would not see a big tax cut. \u201cAny reductions we have in   taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in the interview. \u201cThere will be a big tax cut for the middle class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it. \u201d There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachs luminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E. Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr. a Republican, in 2006. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father, Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm. While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broader financial community it is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s track record at hedge and private equity funds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, that makes him appealing. \u201cMnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers  \u2014   Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak their language,\u201d said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. \u201cHe comes from a trading desk, and that\u2019s something that is very strong,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended   for Mr. Trump, added. While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of Wall Street, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years of experience managing people and organizations under their belt. Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing of IndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in 2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions. After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted by protesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a   lender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain. In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted the deal. \u201cHe purchased IndyMac Bank for $1. 6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3. 4 billion plus a return of capital,\u201d he said of Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country. \u201d Mr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan, were sued over their mother\u2019s early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, an investor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. The lawsuit, filed by a trustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3. 2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from his mother\u2019s account shortly after she died belonged to other victims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit. Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin. In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company Dune Entertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox. It was a successful partnership Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune\u2019s money) like \u201cAvatar,\u201d which took in $2. 8 billion worldwide in 2009. After breaking with Mr. Seelig in 2012, Mr. Mnuchin teamed up with a company called RatPac, owned by the rowdy filmmaker Brett Ratner and the Australian billionaire James Packer. Mr. Ratner was then notorious in Hollywood he resigned as a producer of the Academy Awards in 2011 after using an   slur at a public event and making frank remarks about his sex life on Howard Stern\u2019s radio show. (He apologized.) But together the three men formed a vehicle to invest $450 million in an extensive array of Warner Bros. movies. Some have been major hits, like \u201cGravity,\u201d which took in $723. 2 million. But there have also been money losers, including \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea. \u201d Still, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attending   parties at the H\u00f4tel du    during the Cannes Film Festival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50 jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo  \u2014   playing a Merrill Lynch executive  \u2014   in Warren Beatty\u2019s new movie \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply. \u201d Beyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners are decidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is Louise Linton, a    actress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan real estate: Trump Tower for the   and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin. But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin is described by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command a room. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professional acquaintances than close friends. The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates for Treasury, according to a fund manager close to the  \u2019s economic brain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Company, Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. of Colony Capital, a Los   real estate investor who has been close to Mr. Trump for decades.'"}, "time": 1742564473.0839534}
