HITS 105 general manager Terry Thomas said \u201cbanning all Madonna songs at HITS 105 is not a matter of politics, it\u2019s a matter of patriotism. \u201d Madonna headlined the   demonstration in Washington D. C. over the weekend and delivered an incendiary speech from the stage. \u201cYes, I\u2019m angry. Yes, I\u2019m outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this won\u2019t change anything,\u201d Madonna said. Thomas says it\u2019s inappropriate to play the Material Girl\u2019s music after hearing her \u201c  sentiments. \u201d \u201cIt just feels wrong to us to be playing Madonna songs and paying her royalties when the artist has shown   sentiments,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf all stations playing Madonna took their lead from us, that would send a powerful economic message to Madonna. \u201d Madonna defended her comments, saying they were taken \u201cwildly out of context. \u201d Nevertheless, the U. S. Secret Service has reportedly opened an investigation into the  \u2019s comments.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563322.3213255}
