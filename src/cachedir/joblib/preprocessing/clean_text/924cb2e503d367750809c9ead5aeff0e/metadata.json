Amid growing anticipation about whether the John Lewis advert will feature a lovelorn reindeer or a sad robin, people who love cloying corporate sentimentality have been informed about humanity\u2019s other cultural output. Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: \u201cFor many centuries before high street shops started creating 30-second seasonal narratives to sell jumpers, mankind has been telling stories. \u201cThese stories were written down in books, which are stored in libraries or on bookshelves. Some of them are pretty good. \u201cMuseums are another good starting point for learning about the things humanity has created that do not involve an animated creature breathing on a window and then drawing a heart in the steam. \u201cFuck it, even Netflix has some good stuff on it.\u201d Mother-of-two Nikki Hollis said: \u201cI actually tried to get the book version of the last John Lewis advert but apparently it doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cI hope the new one is about an otter who falls in love with Rita Ora and they have little half-human festive otter pups. Then they all go up in a balloon.\u201d \\nSave'"}, "time": 1742564444.4935274}
