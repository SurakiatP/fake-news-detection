Churches refused to bury the victims\u2019 remains. Their deaths were mostly ignored and sometimes mocked by politicians and the media. No one was ever charged. A joke made the rounds in workplaces and was repeated on the radio: \u201cWhere will they bury the queers? In fruit jars!\u201d Outpourings of grief from politicians and everyday people have followed the Orlando shooting, but for those who remember the fire in the New Orleans bar, the UpStairs Lounge, its lonely memory has loomed large over conversations about the carnage this week at the Pulse nightclub. Mike Moreau, 72, who lost several friends in the fire, said he was struck by all the differences between then and now, but also by the familiarity of tragedy\u2019s dull ache. \u201cWhat happened to us had to be kept so private,\u201d said Mr. Moreau. \u201cThe public didn\u2019t want to know about it, and if they heard about it they didn\u2019t care  \u2014   \u2018Thank God, they\u2019re gone, they deserved it. \u2019\u201d \u201cTo see the outpouring of love and support that these poor families have gotten is fantastic,\u201d he added about the Orlando massacre. \u201cThey are hurting the same way we hurt, but at least they know that the world supports them and understands their grief. \u201d Mr. Moreau was with friends at a nearby bar on June 24, 1973, when an arsonist doused the stairs of the UpStairs Lounge with lighter fluid, set it aflame and rang the doorbell. When someone answered the door, a fireball burst into the room. One group of patrons fled out a back exit, but another was trapped across the room, caught between the flames and    windows fitted with metal bars. When firefighters extinguished the blaze, they found a pile of charred bodies, some embracing and others pressed against the windows. Congregants from the New Orleans chapter of the Metropolitan Community Church, an L. G. B. T.  group, were meeting there after services. The Rev. Bill Larson was among the dead. His charred body was left slumped against the window bars in full view of   for hours. He was one of many who died without ever coming out to their families, and his mother would not deal with his remains, said Robert L. Camina, who directed a documentary, UpStairs Inferno, about the blaze. \u201cHis mother refused to collect his ashes because she was too embarrassed that she had a gay son,\u201d Mr. Camina said. \u201cAnd that is just one example. There are three people who were never identified at all. Why? Somebody has to miss them. \u201d Those three were buried in unmarked graves in a potter\u2019s field along with a fourth person, Ferris LeBlanc, whose family did not know his fate until last year, Mr. Camina said. \u201cThey dug a hole in the ground and put a bag in it and covered it back up,\u201d Mr. Moreau said. Public figures were unsupportive. The mayor, Moon Landrieu, did not cancel his vacation. Forty years later, a son of his, the current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, declared a day of public mourning for the fire\u2019s victims on its anniversary. \u201cL. G. B. T. people have a place at the table now that they did not have then,\u201d said Clayton   who wrote a book about the arson that was published in 2014. The fire was an open wound for the gay community in New Orleans for years. No one was charged with the attack, and a man viewed by many as the primary suspect was never arrested. He committed suicide a year after the blaze. \u201cThere was never any sense of justice,\u201d said Sebastian Rey, the president of the L. G. B. T. Community Center of New Orleans. Survivors had to deny any connection to the fire, including the loss of loved ones, because they could lose their jobs or apartments if bosses and landlords suspected they were gay. Mr. Rey said people who lived through that period did not talk about it for decades. As time passed, the tragedy became \u201ca rumor\u201d to new generations of L. G. B. T. people, he said. Johnny Townsend, who interviewed survivors in the late \u201980s and finally published their accounts in 2014, said the 40th anniversary commemoration gave it a kind of public attention it had not had before. \u201cPeople now feel more of a sense of their own history,\u201d he said. For Mr. Moreau, the outpouring of support for the victims in Orlando has been an \u201cuplifting\u201d sign of progress, he said. \u201dIn Orlando, those poor people know at least that the whole world is behind them,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody cared about us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561750.140838}
