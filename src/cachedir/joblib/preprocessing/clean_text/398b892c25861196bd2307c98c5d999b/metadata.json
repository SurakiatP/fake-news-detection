Crazy happenings have just transpired in the last 24 hours, and you\u2019ll love Hillary\u2019s scandalous stop that\u2019s making it so much worse as Rachel Maddow gets caught having a breakdown on live TV. \\nHillary embarrassed herself last night at a free concert given in her name by Jennifer Lopez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Hillary came out on stage and pandered so badly to the Latino community that it came off as repulsive. Rachel Maddow cries on live TV over Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign imploding over new email scandal with Anthony Weiner. \\nAfter Rachel Maddow learned that Hillary sustained what she called \u201ca brick being thrown right at the Clinton campaign,\u201d referring to James Comey\u2019s actions, she was caught fighting back tears as another liberal hack tried to convince her that the FBI\u2019s decision to re-open the email scandal is a big deal. \\nMaddow was hoping he would tell her not to worry and that Hillary can still win, but when she didn\u2019t get that news she wanted, she became enraged and then fought back tears. However, it all got worse with what Hillary did this morning. \\nThis morning, Hillary Clinton was caught making a stop at a Miami bar before noon. That\u2019s right, calling it a campaign stop, Hillary strolled into the bar, which looked like a sleazy kind of place, and created even more controversy for the candidate since her drinking has been a sore subject since day one of this campaign. False alarm on missing hillary. She\\'s at a bar in Florida\u2026\u2026 Mid day on a Sunday \"campaigning\" #GoHillary \\n\u2014 Known patriot (@NCSBM) October 30, 2016 \\nAs Mad World News previously reported, \u201cWikiLeaks email from her campaign advisor Jen Palmeri to campaign chairman John Podesta seems to indicate that having to sober Hillary up was a routine occurrence. However, since everyone was scared of her, no one wanted to do it.\u201d \\n\u201cShould I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you? I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll get on with Cheryl and we\u2019ll end up in a bad place. I\u2019m in a session that lasts till 3:30 your time. Is that timely or should I walk out?\u201d \u2026 \\n\u201cI just sent. Was getting my hair cut and trying to write all this on an iPhone. I think you should call her and sober her up some .\u201d [via Wikileaks ] \\nHillary\u2019s drinking problems are well known by Washington insiders, so after the last 24 hours, seeing the fallout as her campaign was squashed, making a stop at a Miami bar before noon makes perfect sense. \\nHillary\u2019s going to need a lot more than Jennifer Lopez gyrating while wearing a thong on stage and Rachel Maddow crying on live TV to breathe life into her dead campaign. We better be on high alert for some manufactured scandal coming at Donald Trump. Too bad for Hillary, it will be seen for what it is \u2014 Hillary and her henchmen trying to save her unsalvageable campaign.'"}, "time": 1742563040.323424}
