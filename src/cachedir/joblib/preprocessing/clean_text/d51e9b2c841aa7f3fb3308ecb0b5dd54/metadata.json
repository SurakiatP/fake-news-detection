Legend has it that Ivan founded the region\u2019s capital, also called Oryol, in 1566. Now Gov. Vadim Potomsky has commissioned a bronze statue of the former czar on horseback, wielding a sword and a cross, to be erected in front of the city\u2019s children\u2019s theater in honor of the city\u2019s 450th birthday. The rehabilitation campaign builds on a move by Russia\u2019s minister of culture back in 2014 to depict Ivan as the victim of Western disinformation. The minister suggested that the name in Russian, \u201cIvan Grozny,\u201d would better be translated as \u201cIvan the Strict. \u201d Ivan\u2019s more dubious deeds include founding the first version of Russia\u2019s secret police and beating his own son to death. The death is the subject of one of the country\u2019s most renowned historical paintings, by Ilya Repin, something Governor Potomsky dismissed as \u201ca work of fiction. \u201d The governor told the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets that, for him, Ivan is part of a triumvirate of Russia\u2019s \u201cthree great rulers,\u201d along with Peter the Great and Joseph Stalin. \u201cEach of them is a unique story,\u201d he said, \u201cbut each made a great contribution to Russian sovereignty, its might. \u201d The public remains unconvinced. Even the anchor of the   television program \u201cNews of the Week\u201d said recently that Russia seemed to be suffering from a \u201cmaniacal obsession\u201d with new statues, noting that neither the Romanovs nor Stalin himself ever erected a monument to the Terrible. Critics horrified by the very idea of the statue abhor even more Governor Potomsky\u2019s planned location. Aleksander Mikhailov, artistic director of Oryol\u2019s children\u2019s theater, imagined parents having to explain to young ones that the czar killed his son. \u201cHe is too controversial and tragic a figure in Russian history,\u201d Mr. Mikhailov said. Governor Potomsky initially waved off the criticism, then said he would delay the installation a month to consult with the public. Some people in Oryol, he told the newspaper, \u201ccomplain about everything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561838.2613132}
