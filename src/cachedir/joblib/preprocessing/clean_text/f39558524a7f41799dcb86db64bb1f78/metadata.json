MSNBC, after flailing at the end of the Obama years, has edged CNN in prime time. Stephen Colbert\u2019s openly   \u201cLate Show\u201d is beating Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight\u201d for the first time. Bill Maher\u2019s HBO flock has grown nearly 50 percent since last year\u2019s presidential primaries, and \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d has registered its best ratings since Jon Stewart left in 2015. Traditional television, a medium considered so last century, has watched audiences drift away for the better part of a decade. Now rattled liberals are surging back, seeking catharsis, solidarity and relief. \u201cWhen Obama was in office, I felt like things were going O. K.,\u201d Jerry Brumleve, 58, a retiree from Louisville, Ky. said last week as he stood in line for a \u201cDaily Show\u201d taping in Manhattan. These days, he is a newfound devotee of Rachel Maddow of MSNBC  \u2014   \u201cShe\u2019s always talking about the Russians!\u201d his wife, Yvonne, chimed in  \u2014   and believes Mr. Stewart\u2019s successor, Trevor Noah, has finally \u201chit his stride. \u201d \u201cWith Trump in office, I really feel the need to stay more informed,\u201d Mr. Brumleve added. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what the hell this guy is going to do. \u201d Many others feel the same. Last month, Ms. Maddow was watched by more viewers than at any time in the   run of her show. The turbocharged ratings are a surprise even to    television executives, who had been bracing for a plunge in viewership after the excitement of the presidential campaign. Before election night, networks were scrambling to generate new hits and digital offshoots that could stanch the bleeding. Instead, the old analog favorites are in, with   franchises like \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d drawing its highest Nielsen numbers in 24 years. Despite a dizzying array of new media choices, viewers are opting for television\u2019s mass gathering spots, seeking the kind of shared experience that can validate and reassure. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense of we\u2019   \u201d Mr. Noah said in an interview, noting that Mr. Trump\u2019s election had infused his show with a new sense of purpose. \u201cPeople are finding a space here in saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not crazy  \u2014   somebody else is also outraged by this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Noah said. Uncertainty and tumult have long driven ratings, and the interest is bipartisan. Fox News, already cable\u2019s   network, is having another big year: In February, its   viewership was up another 31 percent from a year ago.   of the 48 million people who watched Mr. Trump\u2019s address to Congress two weeks ago did so on Fox. But MSNBC\u2019s growth has outpaced its rivals  \u2014   its   audience in February was up 55 percent from a year ago  \u2014   a striking turnaround for a channel once considered the   of cable news. The network has beaten CNN in total weekday   viewers for six of the last seven months. (CNN still outranks MSNBC in prime time among the   audience of adults ages 25 to 54.) At MSNBC headquarters in New York on a recent weeknight, the mood was energized. Ms. Maddow sprinted down a   hallway minutes before her 9 o\u2019clock airtime the anchor was late for makeup after   a   monologue on Russian meddling in the election. (Generous by cable news standards, the segment still spilled over its allotted time.) It was a day after a Maddow milestone: Her Wednesday show outranked that of her Fox News counterpart, Tucker Carlson, in total audience and the coveted    demographic. Later, after swapping her   blazer for a fleece   Ms. Maddow speculated that some viewers were gravitating to the show to feel part of a broader movement across the country. \u201cThere is this surge in civic interest and engagement,\u201d Ms. Maddow said as she sprawled in a chair in her cluttered Rockefeller Plaza office, where the tip of an Emmy Award poked out of a metal beer pail. \u201cIt feels like a spontaneous, organic, pretty   heterogeneous, energized, constructive force, and it\u2019s been interesting to me to see it happen everywhere. \u201d Still, Ms. Maddow smiled when told that some viewers say they turn to her as a source of sanity. \u201cMy standard response to that is, \u2018That is a gossamer thread  \u2014   you need to work on that in your life! \u2019\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m a TV show, and you shouldn\u2019t depend on me. Anything can happen. Build up other sources of sanity. \u201d In some ways, television is the last mass medium that Americans turn to en masse in uncertain times. \u201cIt is a place where we congregate,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe all gather around that hearth to know what\u2019s going on out there, and be comforted by the people who come on our screens to say, things will be all right. \u201d Last week, outside a taping of Samantha Bee\u2019s TBS comedy show, \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d Stacie Bloom, 44, said she was finding television \u201ccathartic. \u201d \u201cMaddow, I love her,\u201d said Ms. Bloom, a scientist who lives in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s reinforcing to watch. It\u2019s the same reason I marched in the women\u2019s march: It\u2019s because I believe in it, and I want to be surrounded by other people who believe in it, too. \u201d Ms. Bee, in an interview, said she was glad her show could provide an outlet for liberals\u2019 frustrations. \u201cI\u2019m certainly requiring catharsis myself,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI wish I could be more helpful to them, actually. As much as they need the show, I need the show. I experience it in a different way than the audience experiences it, but I need it, too. \u201d For Mr. Noah, who struggled early on to replicate the success of his \u201cDaily Show\u201d predecessor, Mr. Stewart, the election became a clarifying moment. \u201cWe are in the same position as a lot of our audience is in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt the change and we felt an immediate shift, and we responded accordingly. \u201d Viewing habits seem to reflect the increasingly polarized state of the nation. Cable news, with its sharp punditry, is seeing huge ratings, but viewership for the   network evening newscasts is falling, along with that of   morning shows. CNN, once the   straight man of cable news, has embraced its role as foil to Mr. Trump, with anchors like Jake Tapper delivering aggressive interviews and commentary on the administration. Gloria Steinem, the liberal activist and writer, wrote in an email that she had grown tired of \u201cfalse equivalency or  \u201d from news organizations, which she blamed for aiding Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cI watch MSNBC for Joy Reid, Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O\u2019Donnell because I trust them as journalists,\u201d Ms. Steinem wrote, adding, \u201cA journalist\u2019s job is not to be balanced it\u2019s to be accurate. \u201d At Rockefeller Plaza, Ms. Maddow was asked if it felt odd to be enjoying a major career moment thanks to the election of a president whose policies she loathes. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a winner right now, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like, \u2018Score! Let\u2019s hope for even more senior diplomats to get fired! \u2019\u201d \u201cLike, God, no,\u201d Ms. Maddow added, turning serious. \u201cI am not hoping for it to get worse. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563224.6034503}
