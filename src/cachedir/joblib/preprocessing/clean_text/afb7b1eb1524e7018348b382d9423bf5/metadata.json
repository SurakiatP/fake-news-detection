[Hillel Neuer, director of the   UN Watch, expressed his outrage in a statement Friday:  \u201cElecting Saudi Arabia to protect women\u2019s rights is like making an arsonist into the town fire chief,\u201d said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd. \u201d \u201cEvery Saudi woman,\u201d said Neuer, \u201cmust have a male guardian who makes all critical decisions on her behalf, controlling a woman\u2019s life from her birth until death. Saudi Arabia also bans women from driving cars. \u201d According to UN Watch, the United States forced a formal vote, against China\u2019s wishes, instead of allowing the normal practice of allowing regional groupings to select the nations on the commission by themselves, in secret. However, the vote was still held behind closed doors, meaning it is not yet clear precisely which countries voted to honor one of the world\u2019s foremost abusers of women\u2019s rights. Neuer calculates, based on the voting math, that at least five European Union member states would have had to vote for Saudi Arabia for it to win a seat on the commission. The U. S. State Department\u2019s most recent human rights report on Saudi Arabia (largely prepared by the outgoing Obama administration) notes that despite being allowed to participate in municipal elections in 2015, the state of women\u2019s rights in the kingdom remains generally abysmal: Women continued to face significant discrimination under law and custom, and many remained uninformed about their rights.   \u2026     The law does not provide for the same legal status and rights for women as for men, and since there is no codified   law, judges made decisions regarding family matters based on their interpretations of Islamic law. Although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian, women have fewer political or social rights than men, and society treated them as unequal members in the political and social spheres. The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her \u201cguardian\u201d with the legal authority to approve her travel outside of the country. A guardian also has authority to approve some types of business licenses and study at a university or college. Women can make their own determinations concerning hospital care. Women can work without their guardian\u2019s permission, but most employers required women to have such permission. A husband who verbally (rather than through a court process) divorces his wife or refuses to sign final divorce papers continues to be her legal guardian. In 2015, Saudi Arabia reduced a Sri Lankan woman\u2019s sentence for adultery from execution by stoning to three years in prison. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
