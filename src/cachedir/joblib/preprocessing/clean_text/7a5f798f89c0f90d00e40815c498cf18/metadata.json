Even beyond appearances, it\u2019s possible to see why both of them admire Mr. Bowie, that relentless pop chameleon. Mr. Cyrus, though never quite respected for his music or hairstyle, has managed to stretch his   charisma, distinctive look and willingness to engage with the kitschy and the lowbrow into a constantly regenerating career of nearly 25 years. By embracing his cowboy camp factor, and now his aging   essence, Mr. Cyrus, 54, has ambled down a surreal path from his first, biggest hit, \u201cAchy Breaky Heart,\u201d in 1992, to a varied acting r\u00e9sum\u00e9, including roles in David Lynch\u2019s \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d which made Miley a star. Along the way, there were detours to tabloid purgatory, borderline irrelevance and \u201cSharknado 2. \u201d And yet even after going Hollywood, Mr. Cyrus has enough juice in the   universe to carry an acerbic,   original series, \u201cStill the King,\u201d which premieres Sunday, June 12, on CMT. \u201cI\u2019ve reinvented a couple times in my career, at least,\u201d said Mr. Cyrus, who has mostly laid low since Miley\u2019s   cultural emancipation. \u201cBut how do you reinvent out of \u2018Hannah Montana\u2019?\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then it hit me: A dysfunctional Elvis impersonator who lies his way into the church. That made sense. \u201d \u201cI told Miley about it,\u201d he added, \u201cand she said, \u2018Dad, that\u2019s exactly what you need. \u2019\u201d \u201cStill the King,\u201d a   comedy with a gritty Southern feel, finds Mr. Cyrus, a   of the show, playing an exaggerated take on the worst version of himself: \u201cBurnin\u2019 Vernon,\u201d a louche   wonder scamming his way into a job as a preacher and into the life of the teenage daughter he didn\u2019t know he had. Jayson Dinsmore, the executive vice president of development for CMT, said the show represents a new push for the network into premium scripted programming. He compared Mr. Cyrus\u2019s role in \u201cStill the King\u201d to that of Larry David in the    comedy \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d  \u2014   but with a star who\u2019s \u201cundeniably charming. \u201d \u201cSometimes we forget how successful Billy Ray has been,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people who has multigenerational fans. \u201d Also, Mr. Dinsmore added, Mr. Cyrus is \u201cincredibly good looking  \u2014   women flock to him,\u201d a boon for a network whose viewers lean female. Mr. Cyrus, a Kentucky native and politician\u2019s son, whose own   puts him somewhere between George W. Bush and Joe Biden in manner, said that, \u201cI kind of traded my musical soul to be an actor. \u201d Despite never truly being welcomed into the country establishment, \u201cI\u2019m a   first and foremost\u201d and not technically a   wonder, he said. \u201cSome Gave All\u201d  \u2014   Mr. Cyrus\u2019s first album  \u2014   \u201chad four hit singles on it,\u201d he insisted, adding a few expletives for emphasis. \u201cHere\u2019s the damn truth: I\u2019ve had more hits than any   wonder in the world. I don\u2019t mean that as bragging because I wish that my name wasn\u2019t even in that conversation. But if you look on Wikipedia, it\u2019ll say that. \u201d Despite his early musical success, Mr. Cyrus saw the writing on the Nashville wall when his third album in three years failed to match the first two. \u201cI said,   they\u2019re coming after me,\u201d Mr. Cyrus recalled. \u201cThe teeter has gone to totter  \u2014   I\u2019m on the way down. \u201d He cited his   songwriting, including an emphasis on the environment. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing they want to hear from me,\u201d he said. Thus began one of the stranger recent sagas in American celebrity bootstrapping as Mr. Cyrus willed his family (six Cyrus children in all)  \u2014   and especially the daughter born Destiny Hope Cyrus  \u2014   into becoming a household name. Following in the footsteps of diversified country stars like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton  \u2014   and more recently, rappers like LL Cool J and Ice Cube  \u2014   Mr. Cyrus aimed for longevity onscreen, first in an appropriately bizarre meeting with an auteurist director. \u201cI had two stolen chickens in my agent\u2019s car while I did the interview with David Lynch,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said, having rescued the baby birds with Miley and her brother before they could become snake food at a petting zoo in Malibu. After he cameoed as the philandering pool guy in \u201cMulholland Drive,\u201d Mr. Cyrus was cast as the lead  \u2014   a Christian physician  \u2014   in \u201cDoc,\u201d which ran from 2001 to 2004 on Pax TV. Ms. Cyrus   on the show and by 2006 had debuted as the   star Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel, with Mr. Cyrus appearing as her father, Robby Ray. What followed, along with more fame and fortune, was years of   (and parenting) scrutiny  \u2014   Miley\u2019s risqu\u00e9 Vanity Fair photos, the bong video, the twerking  \u2014   that seems almost quaint in retrospect. \u201cWhen you work as much in the business as we do, there\u2019s gonna be peaks and valleys,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said. \u201cFame is a dangerous thing, but when you volunteer for it, you have to accept that it ain\u2019t all roses. \u201d \u201cHere\u2019s a lady singing about it right now,\u201d he added, motioning to the speakers playing \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d with Janis Joplin. For her part, Ms. Cyrus relishes a   relationship with her father these days. The pair prefers hanging at home, playing music together (she bought him a Tibetan singing bowl for his birthday)  \u2014   \u201cno TV on, just us talking, not on our phones or out to dinner for show,\u201d she told this reporter last year. \u201cI feel lucky that I\u2019m his kid. When I sit with my dad, there\u2019s a million things I could say that he could\u2019ve done differently  \u2014   as you could with any parent  \u2014   but he\u2019s the best dad I could\u2019ve ever chosen. \u201d Though he stresses his outsider status, Mr. Cyrus, who favors distressed jeans, big sunglasses and western boots, also enjoys his insider connections. At the John Varvatos store on the Bowery, a staffer referred to Mr. Cyrus as a \u201cfriend of the brand,\u201d gifting him an American flag scarf and leather jacket. Further downtown, while perusing the Morrison gallery\u2019s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll photos, he told persuasive   stories, as if holding court on a barstool, of intimate interactions with the likes of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, George Jones and even Kurt Cobain. \u201cI wrote a poem about Kurt the day he died called \u2018The Circus,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cyrus said. It was about life under the spotlight. \u201cThat\u2019s when I said to myself, I need to step back from this because I don\u2019t want to die. \u201d Mr. Cyrus eased his hard living  \u2014   his only real indulgence since the   is marijuana, he said, but \u201cjust about enough to keep me from drinking\u201d  \u2014   though his ambition hasn\u2019t slowed. In addition to his 14th studio album, \u201cThin Line,\u201d due for release in September, he has been writing an environmental horror film about \u201cfracking and all the damage it\u2019s doing  \u2014   but with blood and guts,\u201d he said. Raised in a family of Southern Democrats, Mr. Cyrus said he follows politics \u201cprobably much deeper than anyone would think,\u201d though he stopped short of picking sides in the presidential election, saying only that he respects both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, whom he called \u201ca very brave and very intelligent man. \u201d (His promotional tour for \u201cStill the King,\u201d with its potential   audience, included Fox News.) \u201cIf there\u2019s a heavenly father, there\u2019s gotta be a Mother Earth,\u201d he said, echoing Miley\u2019s own recent   tendencies. (\u201cI have to tell you, she learned that off me,\u201d he added.) He also spoke out recently on Facebook against laws that regulate transgender bathroom access, citing Ms. Cyrus\u2019s involvement in LGBT issues. But   as ever, he shrugged off any suggestion that his continued relevance is due only to his   daughter. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said, aviator glasses shining on a New York street. \u201cI was here first. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561923.8795419}
