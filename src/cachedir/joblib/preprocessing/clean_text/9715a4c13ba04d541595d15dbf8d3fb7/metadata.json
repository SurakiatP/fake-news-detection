At an interview there, Mr. Simon demonstrated how to pluck the string and squeeze the sides to get the \u201cboing\u201d that\u2019s the first sound on \u201cStranger to Stranger,\u201d his 12th solo studio album and his first since 2011, which is due for release June 3. \u201cStranger to Stranger\u201d is a set of songs that crack jokes and ponder questions about love, death, spirituality, baseball, economic inequality, brain chemistry and music itself. It\u2019s the latest ambitious, tuneful installment in a career that has had far more to do with curiosity than  . Along the way, Mr. Simon has sold millions of records, with Simon and Garfunkel in the 1960s and in a   solo career ever since. He has racked up Grammy Awards and accolades he has also received scathing receptions for projects like his 1998 Broadway musical, \u201cThe Capeman,\u201d although revivals concentrating on the songs rather than the storytelling were praised. \u201cI\u2019m a wanderer,\u201d Mr. Simon said. \u201cSo much of this record, and the way I record, is about just going there to see: What is it? What can you learn?\u201d At 74, Mr. Simon could be comfortably retired, savoring the continuing popularity of his older songs like \u201cAmerica,\u201d which he donated to  ads for the Bernie Sanders campaign, or \u201cThe Sound of Silence,\u201d which became a hit last year for the   band Disturbed. Or he could stay on the road performing his oldies just the way his original   fans remember them (though he recently said any reunion with Mr. Garfunkel is \u201cout of the question\u201d). He could also keep trying to write new songs in the style of those oldies. Instead, Mr. Simon\u2019s recent albums are as experimental as anything he has ever recorded. \u201cHe trusts himself and he pushes himself. That\u2019s a very good combination,\u201d said the composer Philip Glass, a longtime friend and occasional collaborator. \u201cIf one part of that equation isn\u2019t there, then you\u2019re in trouble. \u201d Mr. Simon has a clear imperative. \u201cTo make a pop record, if you don\u2019t make it really interesting, nobody\u2019s going to listen to it,\u201d he said. On \u201cStranger to Stranger,\u201d Mr. Simon is, above all, playing by ear. \u201cThe sound is what led me to everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe theme of this album  \u2014   it\u2019s not a lyrical theme. It\u2019s a sound theme. This is the time that we\u2019re living in and this is what it sounds like to me from the sources that I find interesting. In a way it\u2019s not that different from   guys that are interested in sound, like Kanye or Kendrick. \u201d In hindsight, Mr. Simon arguably brought a sampling mentality to songwriting long before the concept had a name or a technology. He has always incorporated nuggets he comes across, from folk songs like \u201cScarborough Fair\u201d and \u201cEl Condor Pasa\u201d to vintage gospel like the Swan Silvertones\u2019 \u201cOh Mary Don\u2019t You Weep\u201d and imported records like the ones that led him to South African music for his \u201cGraceland\u201d album. \u201cThey come from different cultures, but they all have something that makes you say, \u2018I\u2019m not listening to a weird thing,\u2019\u201d he said. After some early recriminations  \u2014   he is still resented by British folkies he heard and echoed in London in the 1960s  \u2014   Mr. Simon has made sure to share credit with his sources or compensate them upfront. \u201cBut if someone hears a line, \u2018I\u2019ll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in my name,\u2019 in \u2018Oh Mary Don\u2019t You Weep,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to write \u2018Bridge Over Troubled Water,\u2019\u201d he noted. (Among the neat arrays of photographs and memorabilia on the walls of Mr. Simon\u2019s office, he keeps a framed copy of the string arrangement for \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d its title, misheard from the demo by the arranger, is \u201cLike a Pitcher of Water. \u201d) Mr. Simon still prizes the   ideal of an album as two connected   sides, which he considers a \u201cnatural form. \u201d Yet he recognizes the ways streaming and randomly shuffled playlists can provide instant gratification. \u201cThe whole listening process changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s harder is to say to somebody, I know you\u2019ve got it, but if you give it a little while longer you might actually find a pleasure that exists in music that you haven\u2019t experienced, because they keep cutting it shorter and shorter before you get to the pleasure. They just keep giving you shots of adrenaline, not serotonin. \u201d He explained: \u201cSerotonin is the drug that puts you in the situation where you feel safe and comfortable. The drug that gives you the awe is the dopamine. And the adrenaline is the thing that keeps you going. \u201d When they arrive together, he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s so incredible, it\u2019s an addiction, and that\u2019s why artists keep doing it. \u201d \u201cStranger to Stranger\u201d opens with \u201cThe Werewolf,\u201d a jovial shuffle that gibes at the rich getting richer amid \u201cIgnorance and   national debate\u201d it was written well before the current presidential campaign, Mr. Simon said. \u201cCool Papa Bell\u201d is named after the fastest runner in the Negro Leagues, before baseball was integrated, while \u201cThe Riverbank\u201d depicts the funeral of a veteran who committed suicide. The title song reflects on songwriting and romance: \u201cLove endures all the carnage and the useless detours,\u201d Mr. Simon sings. The music on \u201cStranger to Stranger\u201d exults in percussion four of the album\u2019s first six tracks don\u2019t use guitar at all. The songs often stretch beyond pop\u2019s typical four minutes and take startling (but in the end logical) twists. They subtly cohere, with some songs sharing rhythmic elements they also continue to expand Mr. Simon\u2019s sonic vocabulary with unique instruments as well as with electronics, loops and samples. Mr. Simon has often been called a perfectionist, but Mark Stewart, a guitarist in Mr. Simon\u2019s band since 1998, calls that a \u201c \u201d description. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a sonic safari,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for the rare bird. And he\u2019s just so consistent in his finding the bird. And of course, we\u2019re all assembled to help. But you can\u2019t finish a musical sentence for the guy. He\u2019s going to stay on the trail till he finds it. \u201d The album\u2019s snappiest song, \u201cWristband,\u201d starts as a fictional anecdote and turns into a larger metaphor for privilege. Its narrator is a singer who goes out for a smoke, hears the stage door lock behind him and realizes he left behind his   wristband as he faces a bouncer who\u2019s \u201ca     . \u201d Eventually, riots ensue among \u201cKids that can\u2019t afford the cool   anger is a   you\u2019ll never get a wristband. \u201d The music for \u201cWristband\u201d grew out of the sliding tones of a West African talking drum track. Mr. Simon asked Carlos Henriquez, from the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, to duplicate them on the bass, and found a stretch that felt like a montuno, a Latin dance vamp. Mr. Simon\u2019s son Adrian pointed him toward the electronic music of an Italian producer, Digi G\u2019Alessio, who calls himself Clap! Clap! Mr. Simon met with him while touring Europe with Sting and later visited his studio in Sardinia to choose some bubbling electronic syncopation. There are also handclaps from a flamenco group  \u2014   Mr. Simon recorded the whole group together and isolated the clapping, then slowed it down digitally  \u2014   along with percussion and horns from Mr. Simon\u2019s touring band. And the whole multitracked assemblage simply jumps. The album\u2019s sounds also include instruments invented by the composer Harry Partch  \u2014   among them chromelodeon and   bowls  \u2014   that divide an octave into 43 steps, which are used to bend the harmonic ambience of \u201cInsomniac\u2019s Lullaby. \u201d And they include the gospel voices of the Golden Gate Quartet, recorded in 1939,   and played forward and backward. Listening to the group\u2019s vocals in reverse, Mr. Simon heard the words, \u201cStreet Angel,\u201d giving him a song title and a character mentioned in two of the album\u2019s songs: a homeless,   schizophrenic who ends up in the hospital. \u201cToo much dopamine, and you\u2019re schizophrenic,\u201d Mr. Simon said. \u201cBut just over here, and you\u2019re a visionary. \u201d \u201cProof of Love\u201d features a     groove and intertwining guitar parts that Mr. Simon worked out with the Cameroonian guitarist Vincent Nguini, who has been part of his band since he made \u201cGraceland\u201d in the 1980s. Its lyrics grew out of a trip Mr. Simon made to a spiritual healer in Brazil in 2014. \u201cI like spiritual adventures,\u201d he said. \u201cI half believe it and I half don\u2019t believe it. But the half that believes it really likes it. \u201d At one point, Mr. Simon was asked to make music for some of the healer\u2019s other visitors. Someone handed him a guitar and he started to play \u201cThe Sound of Silence,\u201d approaching one person at a time. \u201cAs I walk toward people they start to weep and fall down,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI walk from room to room and everywhere it happens the same way. This is a big energy thing that\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m not controlling it. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing this, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad. \u201d Mr. Simon is already on tour, mostly playing theaters, although his New York City date is on June 30 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Queens, where he grew up. His band convenes Africans (Mr. Nguini and Bakithi Kumalo, from the Graceland band) contemporary classical musicians (from YMusic, Bang on a Can   and the Philip Glass Ensemble) a percussionist (Jamey Haddad) who\u2019s versed in jazz, Middle Eastern and Indian music, a   saxophonist (Andy Snitzer) an accordionist adept at   zydeco and blues (Joel Guzman) and a drummer from Nashville, Jim Oblon, who \u201cknows the sound of rockabilly and \u201850s blues that I\u2019m always trying to get,\u201d Mr. Simon said, noting that all his influences \u201cmesh together\u201d live. \u201cSo all kinds of forms can coalesce in some way that breaks this feeling that we\u2019ve been dumbed down. \u201d With the band, Mr. Simon also finds new grooves for older songs. \u201cHe wants to honor the story of the song, not necessarily the original arrangement,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cHow do you honor that story now? That\u2019s the question he asks himself, and how can he do that song for the 2, 000th time and believe it. \u201d Mr. Simon is well aware that he\u2019s had an exceptionally long career. \u201cI often think, I don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019m doing the idea I had when I was 13,\u201d he said. \u201cSixty years later, it\u2019s a   \u2019s idea. Do I still want to do it? That\u2019s a good question. I usually ask it when I start off on each album. Then I start. I grumble, I grumble, and then some idea comes along. And I always say this after every album: I really don\u2019t know if I want to do it again. But this time I really do mean it. \u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut I always mean it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628450.451705}
