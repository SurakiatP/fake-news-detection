Within a week, she had been chased off Twitter by a mob spewing racist insults. \u201cI\u2019ve not just been cyber bullied, I\u2019ve been racially cyber bullied with tweets and pictures so horrific and racially charged that I can\u2019t subject myself any longer to the hate,\u201d she wrote. Her account has been silent since. Online harassment has become a depressingly common workplace hazard for people of color in the public eye. Last month, the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d star Leslie Jones temporarily quit Twitter after weathering a deluge of racist abuse. And last year, the Brazilian actress Ta\u00eds Ara\u00fajo reported a series of harassers to the police after they had inundated her Facebook page with similar comments. But the racist taunts hurled at Ms. Kordei didn\u2019t originate from some white supremacist message board, or even from a crew of Fifth Harmony haters. It came from within the Fifth Harmony fandom itself. The incident illuminates some strange similarities between the bands of internet trolls stalking the web and the legions of online fans seeking to stir up some drama. They both know that the most hurtful weaponry to wield against black women include images of apes, threats of lynching and a    . Fifth Harmony is a Simon   girl group that snagged its first Top 10 hit this year with the saucy single \u201cWork From Home. \u201d Its brand would best be described as \u201cgyrating girl power. \u201d But when Ms. Kordei sat down with the digital lifestyle magazine Galore for the Facebook Live interview on the subject of female friendship, one question  \u2014   \u201cDescribe each girl in one word\u201d  \u2014   ripped a fault line through the group\u2019s young, female fan base. Of her bandmate Ally Brooke, Ms. Kordei said: \u201cSunshine, because she is literally the light of the group. \u201d Of Lauren Jauregui: \u201cMy therapist, I can go to her about absolutely anything, and I feel like I can trust that she won\u2019t judge anything that I say. \u201d And Dinah Jane: \u201cShe\u2019s like the   queen, she just has a good time anywhere she is. \u201d When she reached Fifth Harmony\u2019s final member, Camila Cabello, she paused. \u201cShe is   \u2026     let\u2019s see. Camila. Very quirky. Yeah, very quirky. Um, cute. Quirky. \u201d That\u2019s it. But that was enough to enrage some fans of Ms. Cabello, the    who has been positioned as Fifth Harmony\u2019s breakout star (and earned a spot in Taylor Swift\u2019s squad). To this set, Ms. Kordei\u2019s answer was apparently insufficiently effusive. \u201cCamila is a lot more than cute and quirky she\u2019s kind, classy, mature and hardworking,\u201d one fan tweeted. The backlash soon grew big enough to hit the teen gossip sites (\u201cOMG: Did Normani Kordei Throw Shade at Camila Cabello?\u201d the magazine   asked) before curdling into something more sinister. In fan enclaves across the web, a subset of Fifth Harmony followers called Ms. Kordei \u201cNormonkey,\u201d \u201ccoon,\u201d and \u201cnigger. \u201d One said she \u201cdeserves to be lynched. \u201d Another Photoshopped her face onto the body of a woman hanging from a tree. This is the kind of rhetoric you expect to see on 4chan\u2019s political message board, a den of white supremacist rhetoric fused with ironic memes. The trolls of 4chan have lately helped power the online presence of the   the folks who led the Twitter assault against Ms. Jones. Now the internet\u2019s most unruly celebrity fans are cribbing their troublemaking tactics from the same playbook. The firestorm against Ms. Jones was touched off by a nasty review of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d published by Milo Yiannopoulos, a conservative provocateur. As the attacks built, comment threads unspooled inside 4chan, surfacing racist images and commentary to hurl at Ms. Jones in Twitter\u2019s open marketplace. Abuse against Ms. Kordei was organized, too, by an anonymous Twitter account that popped up directing fans to inundate her with slurs. Trolls thrive off provoking a response from their targets. When Ms. Jones began speaking out against the abuse on Twitter, 4chan posters traded gleeful messages. Fans, too, delight in forging some connection with the stars, even if it comes in the form of a rebuke. The abuse against Ms. Kordei escalated after she took to Twitter to deny a feud with Ms. Cabello and to denounce the fans attempting to stir up trouble. That behavior eventually scored a response from Ms. Cabello, too. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hate on somebody else to support me  \u2014   I don\u2019t appreciate it and it\u2019s not what I\u2019m about,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBe kind or move on. \u201d Most Fifth Harmony fans, who call themselves Harmonizers, are not racists. As the abuse mounted, support for Ms. Kordei poured out under the hashtags #IStandWithNormani and #WeLoveYouNormani. Still, racially tinged remarks about Ms. Kordei have been a   presence amid her rise in popularity  \u2014   fans have expressed surprise that she reads books and called her \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cape\u201d \u2014   and the abuse tends to flare at dramatic moments within the roiling fan narrative of imagined alliances and feuds (like the supposed ongoing beef between Ms. Kordei and Ms. Cabello). A similar dynamic has played out among One Direction fans, some of whom have greeted Zayn Malik, the group\u2019s lone Muslim member, with death threats and slurs like \u201cterrorist. \u201d He briefly quit Twitter in 2012, citing Islamophobia, and left the band last year. And when Robert Pattinson started dating the singer FKA Twigs in 2014, a subgroup of his fans inundated her with racist abuse on Twitter that left her \u201cgenuinely shocked and disgusted. \u201d Some level of infighting is embedded within pop fandom itself. Like One Direction before it, Fifth Harmony is a   pop group that\u2019s been perfectly primed to exploit differences in personality, style and ethnic background of the group\u2019s singers. The Spice Girls played this trick most baldly, naming and dressing members after a singular trait  \u2014   Baby, Scary, Sporty, Posh and Ginger. But supporting a favorite bandmate can easily degrade into trashing a least favorite. In a New York Post article from 1998, one    Spice Girls fan said of Ginger (Geri Halliwell): \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like her. I think some people hate her the most out of all of them. \u201d She added: \u201cI personally don\u2019t like Scary Spice, though. \u201d Typically, girl group loyalism falls into the benign end of human  . But in the crucible of online fandom, demographic distinctions can coarsen into warring factions. A fan fantasy that frames the band members as hating one another  \u2014   and paints one of them as rude, stupid, evil, and deserving of death because she is black  \u2014   is no longer just idle fan fictions. As Ms. Kordei put it in one of her notes to fans, \u201cFor those of you who enjoy speculating creating drama that doesn\u2019t exist, please keep in mind that myself and the other girls in the group are PEOPLE. \u201d She added: \u201cThis is our story so let us write it our way, instead of you trying to write it for us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561638.888195}
