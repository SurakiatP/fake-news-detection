The author is a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant at the School of Politics, University of Leeds, UK Frankenstein is on the loose... The demons unleashed from Pandora\u2019s box accompany him taunting the earth...A chaos, unseen since WW2, has been decimating the humanity. The anguish in human institutions, the agony of the social and political establishment is echoed on global basis. The Middle East has been the epicentre of this devastating storm with Turkey, a once stable and secure nation, being drawn deeply into this unprecedented vortex of despair. Turkish tourism has descended into turmoil amidst this unrivalled crisis as well. Wave of armed attacks juxtaposed with the still raw trauma of failed coup d\u2019\u00e9tat coinciding with the high season lacerated tourism. According to analyst Wolfango Piccoli of the consulting firm Teneo Intelligence: \u2018Taking into account direct and indirect income, tourism accounts for as much as 12 percent (or $96 billion) of Turkey\u2019s GDP and tourist arrivals were down 45 percent compared to 2015\u2019. This is the sharpest drop ever since 1998. However, is it right to put the blame at the gate of regional problems and terrorism only for this bleak situation? Terrorism and a series of unforgiveable domestic and foreign policy blunders such as meddling in Syria, dispute with Russia, failure to acknowledge the threat posed by the rising wave of Jihadism could obviously be held accountable to a considerable extent yet Turkey has a more challenging issue: the image! What actually deterred the Western vacationers from coming to Turkey is not only the fear of terrorism but also anger at the inflammatory politics of Turkey. Germany issued a travel advisory to its citizens not only for terrorism but also for the pathetic fact that those visiting Turkey should not make public statements against the Turkish state whilst Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders warned that the Netherlands cannot guarantee the safety of citizens travelling to Turkey if they have been \u2018critical of Turkish leaders.\u2019 German newspaper Die Zeit reported that flow of tourist to Turkey has shown \u2018signs of continuous abating\u2019 due to Erdogan\u2019s clampdown on the opposition media and a series of terrorist attacks in the country. \u201cErdogan\u2019s foreign policy has been an unmitigated disaster for Turkey, but his autocratic domestic tendencies at home have also led to alienation,\u201d said Jonathan Schanzer, vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. Vienna airport displays news at a screen saying \u201cTurkey allows sex with children under the age of 15\u201d upon a story released by Austrian tabloid Kronen (country\u2019s largest newspaper), that Turkey\u2019s constitutional court to cancel a law that designated all sexual activities with children under the age of 15 as abuse. Thomas Schnoell, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry, confirmed the ambassador had been summoned by Ankara. In a fury, he said \u201cthis is for us a matter of freedom of the press.\u201d This allegation could be the truth or a fallacy... whatever it was, yet it caused a massive row, led to \u2018Don\u2019t Go to Turkey Campaign\u2019 and tarnished the image of Turkey immensely across Europe voicing concerns about Islamization of the state. An outstanding report titled as \u2018Tourism as Politics: Turkey\u2019 published in 2014 by professor Thomas Clayton at Middle East Institute, George Washington University seems to have prognosticated the current plight of Turkish tourism. Clayton posits that \u2018 the recent domestic and international political upheavals hold both risks and opportunities for Turkey\u2019s tourism potential. The domestic political controversy over the Gezi Park protests and the government\u2019s response have also tarnished Turkey\u2019s image in a way that officials are quick to dismiss but may prove extremely detrimental to Turkey\u2019s long term plans to become a major international tourist destination.\u2019 Admittedly, terrorism has become a hot potato in the hands of Turkey and the survival of Turkish tourism relies not on entirely combating terrorism and resolving the crisis in the perception of its safety. It is actually more linked with \u2018re-construction of its image\u2019 on the global stage. The impressions left at home and abroad have impacted tourism antagonistically. Tourism is a crucial part of understanding, and a creative way to analyze, domestic and foreign policy as well. There is an urgent need for a political reset and long-overdue reforms to embrace the political and legal stability and to strengthen the democracy in the foreseeable future. Considering that boosting halal tourism is not the solution, the abrupt restoration of ties with Europe and other estranged regional powers is therefore of paramount significance for a quick recovery of tourism. \\nConsequently, the golden segment of Turkey\u2019s economy could be rejuvenated if the relentless and short-sighted policies are disposed of and above all a dovish rather than a hawkish approach is adopted towards domestic and international crises.
