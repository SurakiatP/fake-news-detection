He left behind his house, \u201ctons of wheat\u201d and a BMW. But now that his town, an early target of the Iraqi security forces as they advance on Mosul itself, has been cleared of the Islamic State forces, it is not jubilation he feels, but fear of what awaits him if he tries to return. He wistfully talked about his city\u2019s diversity as something completely unattainable now. \u201cIn that time, the Muslims and Christians were like brothers,\u201d he said. Musab Juma, a Shiite who used to live in the Mosul area, said he would not be going back, either. He relocated to Najaf, in southern Iraq, where he has a food stall and has decorated his home with old photos and antiques from his hometown. Yazidis and Kurds and Shabaks, other minorities that were once vital pieces of Mosul\u2019s human tapestry, have moved on, too. And many Sunni Arabs, who make up most of Mosul\u2019s population, say they will never go home again, even if that is where their parents and grandparents are buried. Before the Islamic State\u2019s occupation began more than two years ago, Mosul was Iraq\u2019s most diverse city. Its rich culture, stretching back to the ancient Assyrians, and reputation for tolerance made it a vital symbol of an Iraq that could at least aspire to being a unified and whole nation. Now, as Mosul\u2019s exiled civilians watch the battle for their city unfold, the only thing they seem to have in common is the belief that they once shared a special history that can never be reclaimed. Some of that belief, but not all, was torn apart after the   invasion of Iraq in 2003, when many Christians felt threatened and fled as Arabs and Kurds fought over old animosities. Mosul, home for many former Baathist army officers suddenly tossed from power after the invasion, became a center of the Sunni insurgency and a stronghold of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor of the Islamic State. \u201cUntil 2003, the Mosul community was living in peaceful coexistence, but after that, things changed,\u201d said Jafar Khaleel, 46, who left Mosul in 2014 after the Islamic State onslaught. \u201cThe Sunnis don\u2019t trust the Shiites. The Shabak cannot live with the Christian. This is what the American occupation left behind. \u201d Back then, there was a social compact for Iraq\u2019s minorities that at least promised security in exchange for tolerating the tyranny and lack of personal freedoms under Saddam Hussein\u2019s government, led by an elite class of Iraq\u2019s minority Sunni population. Today, there is widespread nostalgia for that time, though it is not shared by most of Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority, now in power. \u201cFor generations, life was normal there,\u201d said Sabah Salim Dawood, 62, a Christian from Mosul. \u201cIn the factories, on the farms, in the offices, nobody asked, \u2018What are you?\u2019 \u201d Now there is a sense of unraveling that feels permanent. \u201cA man cannot describe in words what he misses,\u201d said Omar Ahmed, 29, who used to work in Mosul\u2019s Health Ministry and is now exiled in the northern Kurdish region. Walking through a ransacked church recently in Bartella, a mostly Christian town at the edge of Mosul, reveals an elegy to what has been lost. Some walls have been burned others are streaked with Islamic State graffiti. A whiteboard on a wall in an anteroom lists a daily schedule for Islamic State recruits  \u2014   fitness routines, weapons instructions and Shariah law lessons. Strewn on the floor are dusty reminders of those who once prayed there: Christian storybooks, copies of a \u201cquarterly social  cultural journal\u201d published by the Chaldean Church, a Santa Claus figurine, photographs of schoolgirls and a pink plastic rose. An old Iraqi tourist guide from the 1980s celebrated Mosul as a city whose rich history as a place of great Arab conquests important to the region\u2019s   past that made it \u201ca city of great importance. \u201d Its nickname as the \u201cthe city of two springs\u201d  \u2014   because autumn and spring weather are so similar  \u2014   was a testament to the city\u2019s livability. \u201cSince 1969, a Spring Festival has been held every year in Mosul,\u201d the tourist guide noted. \u201cFlower processions and folk dancing by thousands of people from every walk of life bring much gaiety to the place. \u201d Moslawis, as they are known, have their own dialect, and jokes, many based on their reputation for being stingy, which goes back to a famine in 1917, when they suffered as the Ottoman Empire took food from the city to feed its starving army. The rest of Iraq is known for its generosity, but a common joke goes that the only time a Moslawi will invite someone in for lunch is during Ramadan, when everyone is fasting. Even so, the city is also known for its food, especially Mosul\u2019s kibbe, flat bulgur wheat discs stuffed with ground meat that are famous all over Iraq. There is the abundance of cultural heritage, the remnants of empires: ancient churches, monasteries, tombs, shrines and an antiquities museum that is important not just to Mosul but the broader Middle East. Nearly all have been destroyed or defaced by the Islamic State. Putting the city back together socially is \u201cgoing to take a very, very long time,\u201d said Rasha   a Sunni Arab from Mosul who now lives in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where she is a research fellow at the   Studies and Research Center and writes about her home city. \u201cI think everyone is going to live on their own. The Yazidis are going to live on their own. Christians are going to live on their own. The Sunnis are going to live on their own. \u201d As a child, she recalls, her classroom had seven Christians, seven or eight Kurds, two or three Yazidis, one or two Shiites, and the rest Sunni Arabs. There were four or five languages spoken, she said, plus three religions and two sects of Islam. \u201cThat diversity you didn\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d she said. Walking to school, she would pass by a winged bull statue from Assyrian times, at the old city walls, that has been demolished by the Islamic State. \u201cI really regret now that I took them for granted,\u201d she said. Perhaps most painful is seeing former friends turn into enemies. Muhammad Sayed, 26, is Shiite, so for him there was only this choice when the Islamic State took over Mosul: Leave or be killed. Like many Shiites from the city, he eventually moved to Najaf, a holy city for his sect, where he now bakes bread and sells it on the street. \u201cThe Islamic State destroyed my childhood and my memories,\u201d he said. \u201cThey turned some of my friends into murdering terrorists, some of the friends that I studied with in primary school and high school, and I have the most beautiful memories with them. But they have joined the terrorists, and for them, I have become an infidel. \u201d The task of trying to stitch Iraq back together is immensely complicated. But for Iraqis who have been displaced, it all boils down to a single, simple human emotion. \u201cThe major problem in Iraq is dealing with fear,\u201d said Falah Mustafa, the Kurdish region\u2019s foreign minister, at a recent panel discussion in Erbil, about Mosul\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely painful to be betrayed by your neighbor. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562121.0677047}
