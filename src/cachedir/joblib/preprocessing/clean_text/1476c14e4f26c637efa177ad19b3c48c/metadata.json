The emerging face of the American working class is a Hispanic woman who has never set foot on a factory floor. That\u2019s not the kind of work much of the working class does anymore. Instead of making things, they are more often paid to serve people: to care for someone else\u2019s children or someone else\u2019s parents to clean another family\u2019s home. The decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a   later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent. For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a \u201ccybernation revolution\u201d inexorably creating \u201ca permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance. \u201d Machines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a   truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers  \u2014   for now, Amazon employees only  \u2014   are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A. T. M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8. 4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate   imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A. T. M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money. But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade:   assistants, home health aides,   assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists,   aides, physician assistants. . .. You get the idea. Nine of the 12   fields are different ways of saying \u201cnurse. \u201d In 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of   labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M. I. T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued \u201cvery rapidly\u201d over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries. The rise of   employment reflects the fact that Americans on average have more money to spend and that we are spending relatively less of that money on physical goods, because those goods have become cheaper. It took 10. 5 hours of work at average wages to buy a bicycle in 1979 it took just four hours in 2015. Most Americans don\u2019t want a second and third bicycle, so that leaves more money for other purposes. And increasingly, the money is spent on services: help around the home, entertainment and vacations and, most of all, education and health care. These jobs are difficult to mechanize or to perform with greater efficiency. Convalescents cannot be trained to eat more quickly. A phlebotomist cannot draw blood from two arms at once. Robots, as yet, cannot change diapers. Moreover, consumers may have an emotional investment in seeing this caring work performed by people rather than machines. They may be willing to pay for a personal touch. Another limitation on our ability to program computers to do the work of people is summarized by the observation of the Hungarian scientist Michael Polanyi that \u201cwe can know more than we can tell. \u201d Consider the work of a security guard, who is basically tasked with sounding the alarm if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Technology improves security, but it is not easy to write a formula approximating intuition. The Cassandras, however, were right to warn about poverty in the midst of abundance.   providers  \u2014   \u201cservants,\u201d as they once were called  \u2014   tend to be poorly paid. There is little job security the benefits are meager the work is physically demanding and emotionally draining. It is not particularly surprising that women and immigrants have been more likely to take these jobs than   men. For many of the caretaking service jobs, less than 10 percent of the work force is male. The wages of service work increasingly determine the welfare of the American working class and, to a substantial degree, the broader economy. But politicians have paid little attention. That\u2019s partly because Americans continue to view service work as a way station, not a way of life. Teenagers get their first job at McDonald\u2019s mothers dip back into the work force as receptionists seniors make a little extra money as Walmart greeters. The reality is that these are the kinds of jobs millions of Americans hold for their entire working lives. And increasingly, these are the jobs their children will perform, too.  \u2014  Binyamin Appelbaum  Santa Clara, Calif. \u2022 The Home Health Aide By Elise Craig Two major events in Ofelia Bersabe\u2019s life persuaded her to become a home health aide. In 2008, the Bay Area electronics company where she worked for 21 years as a   supervisor let her go in a mass layoff. And that same year, her mother, whom she followed to the United States from the Philippines nearly two decades earlier, died. \u201cWhen she passed away in my arms, I felt that I hadn\u2019t given her the full attention I wanted to,\u201d Bersabe said. \u201cI promised myself that I would concentrate on taking care of women, especially seniors. In that way, I feel like I\u2019m still taking care of her. \u201d Nine years later, at age 69, Bersabe is among nearly a million Americans who work as home health aides, a field that is expected to grow 38 percent by 2024, faster than most other occupations, thanks in large part to the aging   population. Already a senior herself, Bersabe works 65 hours a week caring for two elderly clients with dementia. She spends five   and   night shifts in her clients\u2019 homes, providing companionship, reminders to take medicine and light housekeeping for one client, and everything from bathing and dressing to diaper changing for the other. Having two jobs is partly a necessity and partly a hedge should one of her clients die, she can still rely on income from the other. She also needs the money. Because she is a member of the Service Employees International Union Local 2015, the agencies that Bersabe works for pay her $16. 13 and $11 an hour. California\u2019s current minimum wage is $10. 50, but the living wage for someone like Bersabe is $11. 29. Bersabe is grateful for the money and has no complaints about her wages, but she acknowledges that making a living in the Bay Area\u2019s technology bubble is tough. She lost her house after the 2008 layoff, and she and her husband, who works nights as a security guard, now share a   apartment rental behind Levi\u2019s Stadium, where the 49ers play, with two other elderly couples. The gratitude Bersabe\u2019s clients show her  \u2014   one kisses her when she arrives  \u2014   is incredibly fulfilling, she said, but the work is hard. Dementia patients can be very unpredictable. \u201cI have a very tame cat, and when they start to have  \u201d  \u2014   the   confusion that can be a symptom of dementia  \u2014   \u201cI have a wild tiger,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the person herself, it\u2019s the sickness. \u201d Once, when a client began to get agitated and yell at Bersabe, she sneaked around to the front door and rang the doorbell. The client welcomed Bersabe as an old friend that she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. Bersabe expects to work through her 70s and 80s and maybe even into her 90s. \u201cI\u2019ll work as long as I can stand on my own two legs,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I can drive and walk and God permits me, I\u2019ll enjoy the job I love. \u201d Bersabe has no intention of being a burden to her three children, who have families of their own and are scattered from Kentucky to the Philippines. \u201cHonestly, I am thinking, when the time comes, who is going to take care of me?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother my kids. I want them to see me as a kicking woman, like I was before. \u201d Elise Craig is a freelance writer and editor based in San Francisco. Brooklyn \u2022 The Hair Braider By Jazmine Hughes On a recent visit to Jennifer\u2019s Beauty World, in Flatbush, Brooklyn, Sonia Ufot started by detangling my tightly coiled hair and   it   then she parted a small section into an individual plait, wrapped a section of filler hair around the root and braided it straight down for 16 inches. She repeated this step around 80 more times, over the course of about six hours, all that time spent either standing or hunched over on a high stool. \u201cIt takes time and patience for you to be able to stand on your feet for hours to braid somebody\u2019s hair,\u201d she said, \u201cso you really have to love doing it. \u201d Ufot, 38, has known how to braid since she was 15 she picked up the skill in Warri, Nigeria, where she was born. A family friend owned a braiding shop, and she visited every day, watching the women do their work and, eventually, persuading them to let her practice on their customers\u2019 heads. She majored in economics at Delta State University in Nigeria, but while she was at school, she found out she had thyroid cancer and eventually moved to the United States for treatment. She started braiding hair for the money and never returned to economics. \u201cThere\u2019s more money doing hair,\u201d she told me. And because she\u2019s in such high demand, Ufot can work 12 to 15 hour days, sometimes seven days a week, depending on appointments. She charges between $100 to $250 for each style, depending on its intricacy. She hasn\u2019t gone on vacation in five years. Unlike most people trained in cosmetology, braiders, many of whom are immigrants, don\u2019t use chemicals, sharp objects or heat just a comb, oil, water and their hands. Individual states legislate the requirements for becoming a licensed hair braider in several, braiders  \u2014   even those with a   knowledge of braiding  \u2014   are required to complete more than 2, 000 hours of training at cosmetology schools, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars and whose classes have almost nothing to do with styling black women\u2019s hair. Many cosmetology schools don\u2019t even offer braiding instruction. In 2016, Iowa ended its   requirement for hair braiders, allowing them instead to pass basic    exams with the state Nebraska, too, recently ended its laborious stipulation of 2, 100 hours of cosmetology training for natural hair braiders. In New York, braiders are required to obtain a   license, which allows the stylists to perform the   techniques of styling black hair  \u2014   for example, shampooing hair, applying extensions, making dreadlocks, braiding  \u2014   and not much else. It costs about $70 and mandates schooling, which costs more. But many braiders operate without licenses. Ufot wants to go to cosmetology school her goal is to enroll by year\u2019s end, if she can get enough financial aid. She figures it will cost her about $15, 000, so she\u2019ll continue braiding and attend night classes as long she can get someone to look after her    daughter. She told me that she wants to learn how to do all types of hair  \u2014   dyeing, perms  \u2014   and dreams of owning her own shop. \u201cI want to get my cosmetology license so I\u2019m able to do all of the things,\u201d she told me, laughing. \u201cI want to be able to cut white people\u2019s hair!\u201d Jazmine Hughes is an associate editor for the magazine. Cicero, Ill. \u2022 The   Worker By Ben Austen Adriana Alvarez was leaving her McDonald\u2019s at the end of a daylong shift in 2014 when a man stopped her in the parking lot. She\u2019d noticed him inside, buying coffee, and now he asked if she\u2019d heard about the Fight for $15. Laughing, she said $15 an hour for   work sounded crazy. She was racing to pick up her son Manny from day care, but she talked with the guy later that evening. She told him that she earned $8. 50 an hour, just 25 cents above the Illinois minimum wage. She\u2019d been at the same McDonald\u2019s in Cicero, a largely Latino town west of Chicago, for about four years. In all that time, she had one raise: 10 cents. The man explained that she\u2019d been cheated even out of her low pay: Workers at restaurants had been required, illegally, to punch out before tallying up their registers or breaking down   boxes. \u201cI think about it now,\u201d Alvarez says. \u201cGod, I was stupid. \u201d A few weeks after meeting the organizer, Alvarez said, she and her   handed in a petition demanding that the store manager show them more respect in front of customers. Not only did the yelling stop, she said, but they soon received a raise of as much as 75 cents. \u201cPushing works,\u201d Alvarez says she learned. In March 2014, she joined her first rally, a multicity coordinated Fight for $15 day of action. Alvarez is now 24 and still works at the same McDonald\u2019s. Nationally, jobs in retail and food services outnumber those in manufacturing by more than two to one. The country\u2019s largest private employers include Walmart, McDonald\u2019s, Kroger and the conglomeration of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. These chains are no longer places just for teenagers to work part time: The average age of a   employee has climbed to 29 like Alvarez, a third of them have spent some time in college. Fight for $15 doesn\u2019t operate like a traditional union: There are no contracts with employers, and Alvarez and others pay no dues. The Service Employees International Union has been its primary source of funding from its inception in New York City, in 2012. Yet Fight for $15 organizers take credit for winning wage increases for 22 million workers in America. Although the federal minimum wage of $7. 25 hasn\u2019t budged since 2009, numerous cities and states since 2012 have raised their base pay to $12, $13 and even $15 an hour. Under President Trump, the effort is sure to face additional hurdles. But Fight for $15 helped lead the campaign to derail Trump\u2019s first pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, organizing workers from his   chains to march on their stores and to share their stories of wage theft. Low pay is an issue that crosses party lines: Two of every five U. S. workers earn less than $15 an hour. Today Alvarez makes $11 an hour at McDonald\u2019s. She has never been put on the schedule for a full   week she receives no benefits, health coverage or overtime. Yet the raise has allowed her to replace the moldering floorboards in her basement apartment. And Alvarez has been transformed in other ways by the labor fight. She has emerged as one of its spokeswomen, and the job has taken on a new significance. \u201cWhen people say we should go back to school, I say the adjunct professors who joined us went to school,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cHow come they\u2019re not doing better? I\u2019m not just serving customers. I\u2019m also serving these innocent ladies\u201d  \u2014   her    \u2014   \u201cwho might not be conscious of their rights. I\u2019m like their protector. \u201d Ben Austen is working on a book about Chicago\u2019s     complex. 4. Stuart Culver Brooklyn Park, Minn. \u2022 The Delivery Driver By Jaime Lowe Stuart Culver starts his overnight shift for O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts at 7 p. m. and finishes about nine hours later. A relay driver, he exchanges freight  \u2014   mufflers, batteries, drums of   fluid  \u2014   with another driver in La Crosse, Wis. and then makes deliveries to five stores on his route. The road has changed over the two decades that he has been driving trucks. \u201cIn today\u2019s day and age, it\u2019s really stressful,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more likely to be struck because of other drivers using their cellphone. \u201d The regulatory landscape has changed, too. Every year, for example, Culver has to undergo a Department of Transportation physical, because he has sleep apnea. In recent years, online giants like Amazon have pushed for   delivery times, sometimes delivering orders on the same day. As consumers increase their online shopping  \u2014   total retail sales in the United States increased only 2. 9 percent last year, but online sales rose 15. 1 percent  \u2014   distribution networks have adapted by integrating more and more consumer destinations into their systems. Mark Merz, a spokesman for O\u2019Reilly, attributes part of the company\u2019s success to \u201chaving inventory immediately available when a customer needs those parts. \u201d Though O\u2019Reilly extended its reach to 4, 829 stores in 47 states last year and revenue surpassed $8. 5 billion, that growth hasn\u2019t led to an expansion of its work force or changed the nature of its jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been   for over six months,\u201d Culver says. \u201cGuys are doing extra work and taking on extra stores for their routes. \u201d Culver, who belongs to the Teamsters Local 120, says he is not paid by the amount of time it takes him to complete his deliveries but according to the route driven, which varies from year to year. Culver says he made roughly $53, 000 last year, earning almost $23 an hour. \u201cOur wages haven\u2019t really gone up in the same way that other jobs\u2019 wages have gone up,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to go to special school to get my license, and how we\u2019re treated and looked at hasn\u2019t really changed in 20 years. \u201d Culver, who is 56, doesn\u2019t expect that technology will eliminate work like his. \u201cI don\u2019t see how automatic truck drivers are going to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many variables. \u201d O\u2019Reilly still needs people to operate the electric pallet jacks and hydraulic liftgates at the rear of their delivery trucks, still relies on backs and arms to unload and inspect orders. Despite the toll the work has taken on Culver  \u2014   two operations to fuse vertebrae in his neck and a   operation  \u2014   he says he likes the job. \u201cI\u2019m happy doing this, I enjoy what I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope I can make it to 65. \u201d Jaime Lowe is a freelance writer and a frequent contributor to the magazine. Las Vegas \u2022 The   Rep By Eric Steuer When Sandi Dolan moved to Las Vegas in 2014, to escape the cold Colorado winters, she\u2019d been working primarily as a   representative for more than a decade in the insurance industry. Dolan is remarkably upbeat, and she says she genuinely enjoys helping strangers solve problems. But she said that day after day of calls about accidents and claims made for a pretty depressing gig. \u201cNo one ever wants to talk to their insurance company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s never a good phone call. \u201d Not long after landing in Las Vegas, Dolan started looking for a job. She found a   opening with Zappos, the online    retailer. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know anything about the company,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after I was hired, I started talking to locals, and people were like: \u2018You have no idea, do you? We all tried to get in there. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Zappos has more than 500 people on its   team, about a third of the company\u2019s total staff. Most employees work together in the company\u2019s headquarters, a   building downtown that used to be Las Vegas\u2019s city hall. Employees like Dolan, who work the phones, start at $14 an hour, about a dollar less than the median wage earned by the more than 2. 5 million Americans who work as   representatives. But Dolan, who makes slightly more than that, points out that, unlike at many other companies, most Zappos workers are   employees who receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. At Zappos, employees are encouraged to interact with   throughout the business and eat together on campus. The company frequently hosts events, ranging from product demonstrations to scavenger hunts, which are open to all employees. Dolan said this is one thing that makes her current work so much better than previous jobs. \u201cI\u2019ve been in places where I wasn\u2019t even allowed to take a break with someone if they were a different pay grade than I was,\u201d she said. Another difference from Dolan\u2019s previous   jobs is that Zappos reps aren\u2019t limited in the amount of time they are allowed to spend on each conversation. \u201cAt other jobs, I\u2019d be stressed because I\u2019d have to resolve each call in about five minutes in order to make my numbers,\u201d Dolan said. She knows she could be making more money somewhere else, but she wouldn\u2019t enjoy her day as much. \u201cI figured I\u2019d do this for six months just to get something local on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so I could look for something else,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t looked for a job since I stepped foot in here. I don\u2019t plan on it. \u201d Eric Steuer is a contributing writer for Wired based in San Francisco. Columbus, Ohio \u2022 The Meat Cutter By Abe Streep Every day at 2 p. m. Ruhatijuru Sebatutsi, a Congolese refugee, rides a bus from outside Columbus, Ohio, where he lives with his wife and eight children, with 10 of his colleagues. The bus travels 40 miles southwest to Washington Court House, population about 14, 000, and drops its passengers near a plant owned by the SugarCreek Packing Company, which produces pork and poultry products like bacon bits and sausage patties. Just before 4, Sebatutsi, 40, changes into the uniform of a meat cutter: cap, gloves and scrubs. Then he takes his place in a line of men and women from Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bhutan and rural Ohio. Sebatutsi fled war in Congo as a teenager and spent most of his life in Rwanda\u2019s sprawling Gihembe refugee camp before being relocated to Ohio in 2015. Once the shift starts, he pushes meat through cutting machines. \u201cYou push again and again,\u201d he told me through a translator. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a lot of knowledge. \u201d There are three breaks per   shift: 15 minutes early on, a   meal break, then 10 minutes toward the end. At 1 a. m. he takes the bus home. When he arrives, his wife and children are sleeping. He works seven days a week, making $11. 50 an hour, time and a half on Saturdays and double on Sundays. \u201cI am so lucky,\u201d he said. Central Ohio is particularly welcoming to refugees, having resettled more than 17, 000 since 1983. In November 2016, the region became a flash point for those opposed to resettlement when a   Ohio State University student was killed by police after attacking pedestrians. Still, in early February, the Columbus mayor, Andrew Ginther, signed an executive order supporting the resettlement of refugees. His reasons were economic as well as altruistic. Nearly 12 percent of Columbus is  . According to a recent study from the New American Economy, a nonprofit    group,   immigrants pay $1. 2 billion a year in taxes and have an annual spending power of $3. 2 billion. They work as doctors and engineers, open small businesses employing thousands, perform manual labor in warehouses and frequently do the jobs that many other Americans will not, like meatpacking. SugarCreek is one of many meatpacking businesses nationwide that have turned to refugees. Last spring, the company approached Community Refugee and Immigration Services (CRIS) a Columbus   resettlement agency. \u201cThey needed people,\u201d said CRIS\u2019s Marcus Gorman, who arranges employment for the newly resettled. \u201cThey had a lot of opportunities for   workers, and they were accustomed to working with folks that spoke little to no English. \u201d Now, Gorman said, about 65 of CRIS\u2019s clients work at SugarCreek. Since Sebatutsi started last November, he has opted to work every day, which he said is the best part of the job. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overtime, and you can make money. \u201d But, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s also the worst thing. \u201d He is no longer able to join his family at church. All that pushing, slicing and packaging is repetitive, but it\u2019s far better than life in Gihembe. \u201cThe kids can ask you for something, you cannot provide,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here you work, you take care of your problems, you do something for yourself. \u201d Abe Streep is a contributing editor for Outside and a contributing writer for The California Sunday Magazine. Dalton, Ga. \u2022 The Carpet Whisperer By Lizzie O\u2019Leary The warehouse where Guadalupe Guido works is so bright inside that it feels like noon no matter the time of day. Huge metal racks hold row after row of carpet that will be trucked from this plant in Dalton, Ga. all over the United States. Dalton calls itself the Carpet Capital of the World, and everyone in Guido\u2019s family  \u2014   her mother, father, sister and herself  \u2014   work for one of Dalton\u2019s carpet companies. Guido, who is 23 and goes by Lupe, has been working at Engineered Floors for almost two years. She has risen quickly, starting on yarn machines, before driving a Hyster forklift, working as a production clerk and now serving as a tufting scheduler. She creates orders, dictating the type of yarn to use and how much footage of carpet each job will need. \u201cWithout this person,\u201d she said of her role, \u201cthere really is no show. \u201d In the political sphere, manufacturing work is often associated with men, and specifically white men. But women have always worked in carpets in Dalton and at Engineered Floors. And Dalton is about 50 percent Latino, which is reflected in the work force here. Many people in the city came from Mexico in the 1970s and \u201980s to work in the industry, including Guido\u2019s parents, Jose and Martina. Lupe Guido was born in Dalton and dreamed initially of becoming a lawyer. \u201cI talk a lot,\u201d she said with a laugh. But at 18, she wanted independence and her own money and went to work at Mohawk Industries, one of the largest carpet companies in the city, where her mother still works. It was not what her parents had in mind. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was always: \u2018Go to school, go to school,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018You don\u2019t want to be working how I\u2019m working. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d But the carpet industry, like most of American manufacturing, has undergone radical changes. The hardest and most dangerous jobs are now performed by machines that are mostly run by computers, and those computers are watched over by people like Guido. Engineered Floors is new in comparison to Mohawk or Shaw Industries, the two companies that have dominated Dalton for decades. But Guido has been able to move up quickly. She earns $15. 50 an hour, up from $11 an hour when she started in 2015. At the end of each year, she gets a $500 bonus. Guido said she would like to stay at Engineered Floors if she can. To do so requires vigilantly managing her time so that she can move up. She\u2019s awake at 6 a. m. clocks into her job at 7 and works a   shift until 5 p. m. After dinner with her fianc\u00e9, who also works in the carpet industry, Guido spends her nights studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree in   management at Georgia Northwestern Technical College. One day, she wants to be a department manager or a plant manager. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve been growing and growing,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want for that to stop. \u201d Lizzie O\u2019Leary is the host of the radio program \u201cMarketplace Weekend. \u201d More reporting by O\u2019Leary and the producer Eliza Mills about the carpet industry in Dalton, Ga. is on Marketplace Weekend. Las Vegas \u2022 The Hotel Cleaner By Amanda Fortini Most mornings, Wendy Almada  \u2014   a   attendant, or G. R. A. at the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip  \u2014   puts on a pair of latex gloves and tackles the bathroom first. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do beds,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to clean bathrooms. \u201d Next she yanks off the sheets, bags them and makes up the bed. She dusts, vacuums, empties the garbage. If a light bulb is out or the carpet needs to be shampooed, she puts in a work order. She scans the room for any last detail that she might have overlooked, then clocks out and moves on to the next one. She cleans 13 rooms a day, with suites counting as two or three. Sometimes the job is that straightforward, but often she opens the door to find what all G. R. A.s dread: a \u201ctrashed\u201d room. \u201cThey eat and they leave all the trash everywhere: cans, food,\u201d she said, gesturing with her hands. She was seated at a folding table in a trailer parked in the lot of the Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union. \u201cEspecially the bachelor party. Oh, my God, those are bad. \u201d Because she is a member of the union, the job pays her $17. 65 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, chartered in 1935, is the largest union in Nevada, representing 57, 000 men and women from 167 countries (its membership is 56 percent Latino and 81 percent people of color) among them cooks, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, bellmen and   attendants. The average wage of a   worker is $23 an hour, compared with the $10 an hour made by a nonunionized Las Vegas hospitality worker or the $6 an hour Almada, who is 42 and who moved to the United States from the Mexico border town of Agua Prieta (she got her green card when she was 11, and became a citizen when she was 22) was paid at her last job in a    factory in Tucson. She said she was fired from that job for taking two months\u2019 maternity leave, which prompted her and her (now former) husband to move to Las Vegas. They had heard that there were jobs at the casinos, where 90 percent of the hospitality work force on the Strip belong to the culinary union. But it was only after they divorced and she needed to support herself and her three children that Almada applied for her job at the Aria. That was six years ago. Almada enumerates all the ways that the job and its attendant union membership has improved her life: free health insurance and pharmacy benefits a pension job security and soon a $20, 000 down payment she will use to buy her first house. Initially she didn\u2019t understand the benefits and regulations the union conferred. This is a common reason workers can still be taken advantage of, particularly those who don\u2019t speak English. For the past seven months, though, Almada has been on an extended, contractually allowed,   leave of absence to serve as an organizer at Mandalay Bay Casino she is teaching other workers to read and understand their own contracts. \u201cI never had these rights in Arizona,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I had my little one, they fired me and nobody helped me. If I was working here with the union, that doesn\u2019t happen to me. \u201d Amanda Fortini is a contributing editor at Elle magazine and a visiting lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Boston \u2022 The Pipe Fitter By Carlo Rotella From the job site in Roxbury where he works as a union pipe fitter, Nate Awan can see the building that once housed the Phillis Wheatley Middle School, from which he was expelled for fighting and other misbehavior. \u201cThat was back in my knucklehead time,\u201d he said. The fifth child of an overwhelmed single mother, Awan was kicked out of four schools and took a bullet in the shoulder before going to prison at 18 for trying to shoot a rival gang member. While serving a   sentence, he resolved that he would change his fate. With the help of a former prosecutor who took an interest in his rehabilitation, Awan found his way into Operation Exit, a program founded in 2014 in which the city of Boston partners with unions to channel residents with criminal backgrounds into the trades. Having sampled carpentry,   work and other options, Awan, who had always been fascinated by welding but doesn\u2019t like heights, chose pipe fitting over iron work. There\u2019s plenty of politics in the building trades, but there\u2019s also an ethos of craft meritocracy. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you look like, it\u2019s what your clevis hangers look like,\u201d Awan said, referring to the brackets used to support pipes. \u201cAll at the same level, nothing crooked. It\u2019s about your work ethic. \u201d He\u2019s already planning to get his    son into the local when he\u2019s old enough. Awan, who is 28 and currently a   apprentice making $30 an hour plus benefits, can become a journeyman in three years, and he looks forward to continuing up the scale of seniority and pay toward the top rate of $50 or so an hour. He still lives near the Four Corners section of Dorchester where he grew up, but he\u2019s shopping for a house outside the city. \u201cYou come from no money for food, nothing, to where you\u2019re buying a house, buying a car,\u201d he said. \u201cYour son needs a school uniform, you can get him one. \u201d Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin Walsh, intends Operation Exit to enable this kind of transformation of prospects and consciousness. Walsh, who also grew up in Dorchester and had his own troubles (a bullet grazed his leg) before putting his life on course in the building trades, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had 80 graduates come through this program, and we\u2019re expanding from the building trades into coding and culinary arts. Some of these guys were impact players on the street. It has an effect. \u201d Programs that reduce crime by connecting offenders and potential offenders to meaningful work are getting more attention across the country. Some, like Operation Exit, focus on   after prison others, like the Chicago CRED initiative recently started by the Emerson Collective and Arne Duncan, the former U. S. secretary of education, try to reduce gun violence by teaching job and life skills to young men adrift from both school and the labor market. It takes a significant investment of time and resources to shift a life from a   trajectory to a viable future in this way, but Awan testifies to the approach\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cI\u2019m no surgeon or   prosecutor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for me  \u2014   a product of his environment, taken from my mother at 9, incarcerated at 18, sweeping and mopping in the hole in prison for 19 cents an hour, living like a peasant  \u2014   this here is a lottery ticket. \u201d Carlo Rotella is the director of American studies at Boston College and the author, most recently, of \u201cPlaying in Time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561670.7496195}
