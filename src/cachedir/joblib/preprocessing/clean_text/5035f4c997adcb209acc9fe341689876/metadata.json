A cabinet order on Thursday directed officials to have the refugees transferred to Thengar Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal that is lashed by high tides   and submerged during the monsoon season. The suggestion that they be moved to the largely uninhabitable marshland several hours by boat from the mainland drew criticism from around the world. The relocation plan was last proposed in 2015, but the government quietly suspended it after criticism from international aid groups and rights activists. Its reinstatement follows the arrival of about 65, 000 Rohingya from Myanmar in October and November, after a crackdown by Myanmar\u2019s army and attacks on security forces by Islamic insurgents. The United Nations has called the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group denied citizenship in Myanmar, the world\u2019s most persecuted minority. John McKissick, head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the Bangladeshi city of Cox\u2019s Bazar, near the Burmese border, said in November that Myanmar\u2019s government was trying to achieve an \u201cultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority. \u201d Since 1992, about 32, 000 registered Rohingya have been living in two United Nations camps near Cox\u2019s Bazar, but estimates of unregistered refugees range from 200, 000 to 500, 000. Many of them live in two sprawling makeshift shelters close to the official camps, while others are scattered across southeast Bangladesh. Talk of forced relocation worries refugees who have lived in the Cox\u2019s Bazar area for more than two decades. \u201cWe have been here for a long time,\u201d one of them, Shafiul Mostafa, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday from one of the camps. \u201cWe have gotten to know our neighbors, and we can speak the local dialect, which is similar to our language. If we are taken to a new place, it will be very difficult for us. We won\u2019t be able to communicate with anyone. \u201d The United Nations refugee agency, which runs the camps, criticized the relocation proposal in 2015, calling it \u201ccomplex and controversial\u201d and saying that departures would have to take place with the migrants\u2019 consent. Now, the return of the plan has taken aid groups by surprise. \u201cU. N. H. C. R. is concerned about this news and seeking details from the authorities,\u201d Shinji Kubo, a representative of the United Nations refugee agency in Bangladesh, said by email. \u201cAny move must be carried out through a consultative and voluntary process, and the feasibility of the proposed site must be assessed. \u201d Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say a recent crackdown in Myanmar indiscriminately targeted the Rohingya, citing satellite imagery showing 1, 500 Rohingya homes burned down and widespread reports of mass killings and rapes. The cabinet in Bangladesh has directed officials to take steps to stop further \u201cillegal entry of Myanmar nationals\u201d and to prevent existing refugees from \u201cmixing in with local populations. \u201d It also ordered officials to keep all illegal immigrants from Myanmar in designated areas, and to arrest them or push them back into those areas if they tried to leave. The order, which was posted on the cabinet\u2019s website, said the arrival of Rohingya in recent months had raised tensions, created \u201cphysical risks\u201d for local people, and caused social and economic problems in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Critics of the relocation say the order has more to do with a desire to develop Cox\u2019s Bazar, home to what the government promotes as the longest beach in the world, into a booming tourism destination to rival others in Asia. \u201cRight now, people here are only building hotels and guesthouses,\u201d said Hayat Khan, an executive at the Ocean Paradise Hotel in Cox\u2019s Bazar. \u201cYou go to the beach for half an hour, and then there\u2019s nothing more to do. You need cable cars, and theme parks like the Window of the World in Shenzhen,\u201d he added, referring to a city in southern China. \u201cFor that, you will need a lot of investment, and a lot of land. \u201d Rohingya refugees and their leaders say that they were not consulted about the plan. \u201cIf the government wants something, we will have to obey them,\u201d said Mr. Mostafa, the refugee. \u201cAt the end of the day, what we want or don\u2019t want is not going to matter to anyone. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562260.5564427}
