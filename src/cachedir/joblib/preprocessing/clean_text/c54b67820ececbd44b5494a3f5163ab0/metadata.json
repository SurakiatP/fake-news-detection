Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nThe CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey\u2019s letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. \\nBattleground tracker found that by a small margin Comey\u2019s letter made Democrats more likely (net +7) to support Clinton. \\nIn the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 48%-40%, North Carolina (48%-45%), and in Colorado (42%-39%). The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona (44%-42%). \\nAccording to CBS News , \u201cAnd the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap \u2013 slightly larger now than the last time in these states \u2013 that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump.\u201d \\nTo put it another way, Hillary Clinton\u2019s support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. \\nThese are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story isn\u2019t moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there aren\u2019t enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. \\nRepublicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. If the Comey letter is the big October surprise, it isn\u2019t working on voters. \\nHillary Clinton Maintains Swing State Leads As Comey Email Letter Flops added by Jason Easley on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016\""}, "time": 1742562296.5275862}
