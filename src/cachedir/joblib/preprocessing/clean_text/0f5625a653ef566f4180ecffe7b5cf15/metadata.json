President Donald Trump while praising Pope Francis for his alleged \u201cdenunciation of #MuslimBan\u201d and of the Rohingya genocide going on in Myanmar. [Zarif appears to have attempted to drive a wedge between Trump and the Pope, tweeting that the world \u201cneeds leaders who urge dialogue  compassion, not walls  exclusion. \u201d  Welcome @Pontifex denunciation of #MuslimBan  #RohingyaGenocide. World needs leaders who urge dialogue  compassion, not walls  exclusion.  \u2014   Javad Zarif (@JZarif) February 10, 2017,  The Iranian minister was referring to a recent general audience in which Pope Francis made some extemporaneous remarks urging prayer for the persecuted Rohingya people, who are Muslims. The Pope actually never mentioned President Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban on 7 nations that are hotbeds of Islamic terrorism, including Iran. In his remarks Wednesday, Francis asked his hearers to pray in a special way for \u201cour Rohingya brothers and sisters. \u201d \u201cDriven out of Myanmar, they go from one place to another because they are unwanted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are good people, peaceful people. They are not Christians, but they are good, they are our brothers and sisters. And they have been suffering for years,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThey have been tortured, killed, simply because they follow their traditions and their Muslim faith. Let us pray for them. I invite you to pray for them to our Father in Heaven, all together, for our Rohingya brothers and sisters. \u201d Earlier in his address, the Pope repeated a favorite   of his regarding the need to \u201ccreate bridges rather than walls,\u201d though the Vatican has insisted that this figurative expression refers to an attitude of openness to dialogue with others, and does not refer to specific walls or persons. Charles Maung Bo, the first Catholic cardinal from Myanmar (the former Burma) has called the persecution of the Rohingyas \u201can appalling scar on the conscience of my country. \u201d According to Cardinal Bo, the Rohingyas are \u201camong the most marginalized, dehumanized and persecuted people in the world. They are treated worse than animals. Stripped of their citizenship, rejected by neighboring countries, they are rendered stateless. \u201d Among his recent tweets, Zarif also confirmed his support for U. S. protesters against President Trump, saying that many Iranians had also demonstrated in defiance of \u201cthreats  insults\u201d from the U. S. government.
