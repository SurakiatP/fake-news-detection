The One Percenter MICHELLE CLARK, 22 \\n\u201cI know exactly what I want in our next president, but look, we both know what\u2019s going to happen if this interview ends up online: my Twitter account will be flooded with vulgar, misogynistic comments and brutal attacks on my appearance. I could talk about my thoughts on the economy or immigration, but the more thoughts I share, the more material I\u2019m giving to some Reddit user who will tell me to perform the most perverse act he can think of and then tear into me for having an opinion\u2014any opinion. So what\u2019s the point of saying anything? Let\u2019s just end this interview now.\u201d The Millennial ZIAD AYOUB, 37 \\n\u201cI don\u2019t like those presidential candidates. Not a single one of them. They just don\u2019t value human life like you and I do. I ask myself all the time how anyone could believe all the barbaric things these people believe. They refuse to see any point of view other than their own, and they have no problem going around and blowing up people that aren\u2019t like them. I know they\u2019re out there plotting horrible things right now. I don\u2019t want them anywhere near me.

I know life\u2019s going to get worse over the next four years, so the candidates need to just cut to the chase and tell me how shitty it\u2019s going to get. Are you going to dick me over on my taxes? Dick me over on my kids\u2019 medical bills? Dick me over on gas prices? I\u2019m voting for whoever has the sack to come right out and say it.\u201d The Immigrant Voter Voices The Onion asks ordinary citizens to share their thoughts, concerns, and staggering ignorance about the 2016 election. 1 What\u2019s the most important quality for the next president to have?
