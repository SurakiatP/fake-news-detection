WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. \\nHe did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, \u201c this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process \u2013 for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. \u201d \\nHe also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being \u201c controlled by Clinton supporters. \u201c We were fastest on #Podestaemails6 , faster than @wikileaks , and the US conspiracy machine can\u2019t handle it https://t.co/njAae50qDd \\n\u2014 RT (@RT_com) 13 October 2016 \\nThe Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. \u201c I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton, \u201d he said. \\nAssange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing \u201c what in their mind is white trash. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562267.3301303}
