I joked a few weeks ago that Hillary Clinton will not be elected President because \u201cGod doesn\u2019t hate America.\u201d And then I woke up on Saturday and learned that John Podesta, Hillary\u2019s grey eminence, has an especial interest in a Satanic artist called Marina Abramovi\u0107. Later that day, I learned that a DC pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong (which is owned by David Brock\u2019s ex-lover) is an especial favorite of the Hillary team and has, shall we say, a sinister take on what constitutes \u201ckid friendly.\u201d \\nAfter such knowledge, what forgiveness? We recorded this show before James Comey announced that the FBI investigation into Hillary\u2019s emails is OFF ON OFF. Hillary\u2019s supporters made a little holiday in their hearts, but I can\u2019t but help think this is too late to save her. There has never been a major-party candidate for President who boasts such a unique combination of incompetence and corruption. The elite and the media are entirely on her side, but of course Wikileaks has revealed that so many members of the MSM can be regarded only as unofficial Hillary staffers, and in the event the people are no longer buying what they are selling. \\nI daresay Hillary has a program, but the MSM has not deigned to inform us what it is. They know that the destruction of the American nation is no longer as popular as it once was, and that Hillary faces a challenger, Donald Trump, who has promised the American people that \u201cInvade the world; invite the world; immiserate the world\u201d will no longer be American policy when he becomes President. \\nSo the MSM has instead instructed Americans that they daren\u2019t vote for Trump because he\u2019s a sexual vulgarian and a big meanie who has engaged in fat shaming. They forget (or at least pretend to) that it was Hillary\u2019s husband, Bill Clinton, who administered the coup de gr\u00e2ce to American public modesty. \\nTrump has a program, one that is expressed powerfully and succinctly in his two-minute YouTube video, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Argument For America.\u201d America First. America for Americans, not America for bankers, globalists and the theorists of \u201cCheap chalupas.\u201d Fancy that. The MSM was roused to fury by Trump\u2019s heartfelt patriotism and accused him of \u201canti-Semitism.\u201d A serious error. These people have no idea of the force they have unleashed. In asserting that it is forbidden to criticize Jewish malefactors solely because they are Jewish, they have given credence to the most sweeping anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. You hear the words \u201cfailed\u201d&\u201ccorrupt\u201d& you think, \u201cHe means the Jews.\u201d So revealing #Trumpslide https://t.co/TMVJCO4I3G \\n\u2014 Kevin Michael Grace (@KMGVictoria) November 5, 2016 \\nThe MSM forgets (or at least pretends to) that Trump is not John McCain or Mitt Romney. He has no interest in virtue-signalling, particularly to those who do not bother to hide their dishonesty and malice. Trump has demonstrated, repeatedly, that he cannot be cowed. \\nThis is indeed an existential election, and I remain confident that America will choose the candidate committed to the American nation. \\nEpilogue: At long last, the Grace & Steel podcast has solved its recording problem. We now employ Audacity (free!) as our primary recording program, with Total Recorder as a backup. Aspiring podcasters, of which there are many, will benefit from the detailed (and illustrated) instructions compiled by my broadcasting partner, Kevin Steel. And listeners to our podcast will discover that the result of our struggle is a profoundly improved broadcasting quality.'"}, "time": 1742562025.4733703}
