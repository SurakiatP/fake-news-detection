Patients like Ms. Bowers are choosing to defy medical advice and social convention and remain breastless after breast cancer. They even have a name for the decision to skip reconstruction: They call it \u201cgoing flat. \u201d \u201cReconstruction is not a simple process,\u201d said Dr. Deanna J. Attai, a breast surgeon in Burbank, Calif. and a past president of the American Society of Breast Surgeons, adding that more of her patients, especially those with smaller breasts before diagnosis, were opting out of reconstruction. \u201cSome women just feel like it\u2019s too much: It\u2019s too involved, there are too many steps, it\u2019s too long a process. \u201d Social media has allowed these women to become more open about their decision to live without breasts, as well as the challenges, both physical and emotional, that have followed. For a recent video created by wisdo. com, a social media platform, and widely shared on Facebook, Ms. Bowers and her friend Marianne DuQuette Cuozzo, 51, removed their shirts to show their scarred, flat chests. And Paulette Leaphart, 50, a New Orleans woman whose clotting disorder prevented her from having reconstruction after a double mastectomy, walked topless from Biloxi, Miss. to Washington this summer to raise awareness about the financial struggles of cancer patients. \u201cBreasts aren\u2019t what make us a woman,\u201d Ms. Leaphart said. The nascent movement to \u201cgo flat\u201d after mastectomies challenges   assumptions about femininity and what it means to recover after breast cancer. For years, medical professionals have embraced the idea that breast restoration is an integral part of cancer treatment. Women\u2019s health advocates fought for and won approval of the Women\u2019s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, which requires health plans to cover prosthetics and reconstructive procedures. Since then, breast reconstruction has become standard care. More than 106, 000 reconstructive procedures were done last year, a 35 percent increase since 2000, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. While it is not known exactly what percentage of women opt for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, one study found that in 2011, 63 percent of women who were candidates for the procedure chose to have it. In some parts of the United States, the number is closer to 80 percent today. In promoting the surgery, doctors cite studies that suggest breast reconstruction improves a woman\u2019s quality of life after cancer. But some women say that doctors focus too much on physical appearance, and not enough on the toll prolonged reconstructive procedures take on their bodies and their psyches. Up to   of women who undergo reconstruction experience complications. A systematic review of 28 studies found that women who went without reconstruction fared no worse, and sometimes did better, in terms of body image, quality of life and sexual outcomes. \u201cThat\u2019s the dirty little secret of breast reconstruction: The risk of a major complication is higher than for the average elective surgery,\u201d said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who performs the procedure. Ms. Cuozzo, who appeared in the Facebook video with Ms. Bowers, spent a year having her breasts rebuilt after a double mastectomy, but after four infections in five months, she had the implants removed. The reconstruction, she said, \u201cwas getting worse than the cancer. \u201d While some states, including New York, now require physicians to tell women about the availability of breast reconstruction, women say they often are not informed of the option to remain flat. \u201cI was never told there was a choice,\u201d Ms. Cuozzo said. \u201cI went from the breast surgeon to the plastic surgeon, and they said, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to do. \u2019\u201d Dr. David H. Song, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Chicago and immediate past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said that the risk of complications was real, but that focusing on them was like focusing on plane crashes when \u201cmillions of flights land safely. \u201d Given advancements in surgical techniques, \u201cthe aesthetic result can be better than the native breast,\u201d Dr. Song said. \u201cPatients can come out the other end looking more youthful, with a better aesthetic in her breast than before. \u201d But it is that kind of talk  \u2014   suggesting that a reconstructed breast is an improvement on a woman\u2019s natural breast  \u2014   that enrages many women who have undergone mastectomies. For starters, a reconstructed breast is often numb and can no longer play a role in sexual arousal. It often lacks a nipple, since the nipple is usually removed in a mastectomy. After looking at photos of reconstructed breasts, \u201cI was slightly horrified,\u201d said Charlie Scheel, 48, of Brooklyn, who decided against implants after a double mastectomy. \u201cYou don\u2019t have nipples and you have scars everywhere. \u201d Rebecca Pine, a cancer survivor from Long Island who   a photography and writing project called \u201cThe Breast and the Sea,\u201d said, \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous amount to put your body through, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to get our breasts back. \u201d Ms. Pine, 40, had reconstruction after her first mastectomy, but had the implant removed later when she had a prophylactic mastectomy on her other breast. \u201cThey don\u2019t look or feel, in most cases, like our breasts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nerves are cut, so they\u2019re not receptive to feel or touch. \u201d Dr. Susan Love, author of a   book about breast health, said that doctors aiming to expand access to reconstruction may have become overly enthusiastic about the surgery. \u201cSurgeons became so proud of what we were able to do that we may have forgotten that not everybody may want it,\u201d Dr. Love said. Dr. Marisa C. Weiss, founder of breastcancer. org, said doctors should not assume every patient wants reconstructed breasts. \u201cI\u2019ve had   dancers who do not want reconstruction and nuns who say, \u2018I need reconstruction,\u2019\u201d she said. Some women say physicians pressured them to get implants. When Catherine Stapleton, of Florida, woke up after her mastectomy, she discovered that her breast surgeon, a woman, had left unsightly flaps of skin and tissue that could be used for breast reconstruction later, in case she changed her mind. \u201cWhen I woke up from anesthesia, I was in shock,\u201d said Ms. Stapleton, 58, who is now facing additional major surgery to correct the first procedure. Geri Barish, president of the Long Island advocacy group 1 in 9, said a doctor had chided her when she opted against reconstruction. \u201cOne doctor said to me: \u2018How can you walk around like that? You look deformed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. Support groups and social media have allowed women to share stories about the realities of reconstruction. \u201cA lot of the women in my support group had infections, and they were surprised at how many surgeries were involved,\u201d said Alicia Staley, 45, who stayed flat after a double mastectomy. \u201cAs I compared notes, I wondered, \u2018Why are all these women doing this to themselves? \u2019\u201d Coming to terms with a flat chest after breast cancer can be difficult. While some women wear a prosthesis in their bra, it is not uncommon for them to stop using it. \u201cThey\u2019re heavy, they\u2019re uncomfortable, and they\u2019re in a sensitive area where you have scars,\u201d Ms. Pine said. Women say they take many of the clothes they wore before surgery to Goodwill and begin wearing scarves and long strands of beads to hide their flat chests. Others try to embrace their new form by having elaborate tattoos inked where they once had breasts. Ms. Pine has a lotus flower tattoo on one side and a dragonfly on the other. Sara   39, a technical writer in Kalamazoo, Mich. tried two types of implants but had a constant burning sensation and got rid of them. She then started a virtual support group called Flat and Fabulous. \u201cWe\u2019re not \u201d she said. \u201cBut many women never feel it\u2019s part of their body. \u201d For Kate Cloudsparks, 64, a farmer in southern Iowa who has been flat since a preventive mastectomy 21 years ago, discovering the Flat and Fabulous Facebook page this year led to her first communication ever with women who had made the same choice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody else like me. I was carrying it around for 20 years without having anywhere to share it,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally, I had an opportunity to talk about what it\u2019s been like to live as a woman without breasts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562805.3864863}
