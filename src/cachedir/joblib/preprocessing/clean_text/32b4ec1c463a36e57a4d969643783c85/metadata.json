[The recent reports further prove, at least in part, President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that senior Obama officials had collected intelligence on Trump aids and disseminated it throughout the government. Rice\u2019s involvement  \u2014   as it relates to her reported role in the unmasking of Trump aids and circulating sensitive information  \u2014   places the longtime Obama operative at the center of another major political scandal.  Below are five facts from Susan Rice scandals every American should know. 1. Susan Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign aides as part of a political intelligence operation.  Rice allegedly maintained spreadsheets of Trump aides\u2019 telephone calls \u201cone year before the 2016 presidential election,\u201d according to the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller reports: \u201cWhat was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,\u201d diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday. \u201cThe overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cIn short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls. \u201d 2. Rice claimed that climate change was responsible for the deadly civil war in Syria.  \u201cIn the years prior to civil war breaking out in Syria, that country also experienced its worst drought on record,\u201d Rice said in October 2015, during a speech at Stanford University. \u201cFarming families moved en masse into urban centers, increasing political unrest and further priming the country for conflict. \u201d Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed in the conflict since President Barack Obama drew his infamous \u201cred line\u201d in 2012, promising to retaliate against Syrian President Bashar  \u2019s regime if it used chemical weapons on its own people. 3. Rice once declared that there is \u201cno military solution\u201d to the raging conflict in Yemen. \u201cAs in Syria, there is no military solution to the crisis in Yemen,\u201d Rice said in April 2015, during a speech at the Arab American Institute\u2019s Kahlil Gibran Gala. Seven months before Rice\u2019s speech, President Obama had called his administration\u2019s drone   military operation in Yemen a success story. President Trump, however, ordered more airstrikes against   in Yemen in February than any year in Obama\u2019s presidency. 4. Susan Rice said accused deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl served \u201cwith honor and distinction. \u201d In March 2015, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was charged with treason for allegedly deserting his fellow soldiers and abandoning his Afghanistan outpost in 2009. In a June 2014 broadcast of ABC\u2019s This Week, Susan Rice defended Bergdahl, saying he \u201cserved the United States with honor and distinction. And we\u2019ll have the opportunity eventually to learn what has transpired in the past years. \u201d As Breitbart News reported, six soldiers lost their lives searching for   First Class Bowe Bergdahl after he abandoned his outpost. 5. Susan Rice was the driving force behind a misinformation campaign about the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi terror attacks.    Ambassador Rice, acting as the Obama White House\u2019s spokeswoman, appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows and repeatedly claimed that the Benghazi attacks had been caused by an   video. Rice appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, and CNN and regurgitated talking points purporting that the protests that had erupted \u201cspontaneously\u201d near two U. S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya and were a result of a \u201chateful video\u201d that was offensive to Islam. But government documents, released following a Judicial Watch lawsuit, reveal that government officials monitoring the attack in   did not cite an   video as an explanation for the paramilitary attack on the U. S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. In May 2015 interview, former Obama CIA Director Mike Morell said Rice\u2019s Benghazi talking points blaming an   YouTube video crossed \u201cthe line between national security and politics. \u201d \u201cI think the line in there that says one of our objectives here right on the Sunday show is to blame the video rather than a failure of policy,\u201d Morell said on Fox News\u2019 Special Report. \u201cAnd as you know, I say in the book that I think that that is crossing the line between national security and politics. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563759.2087674}
