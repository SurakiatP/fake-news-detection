The owner, James L. Dolan, can go years without engaging with the news media. But on Friday, he went on the radio to say that Charles Oakley, a stalwart member of some outstanding Knicks teams from the 1990s, would not be let into the Garden as a result of an altercation on Wednesday night that ended with Oakley being led from the arena in handcuffs while fans chanted his name. It was hard to find precedent for the Knicks\u2019 decision  \u2014   former players are normally treated like celebrities, not told they will not be allowed into a game even if they buy their own ticket  \u2014   but it fit the almost bizarre image the franchise now seems to be busy creating for itself. Dolan, who announced the decision on Michael Kay\u2019s afternoon program on ESPN Radio, said he was taking the step to bar Oakley out of concern for the safety of the team\u2019s other paying customers. \u201cWe need to keep the Garden a place that\u2019s comfortable and safe for everybody who goes there,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cSo anybody who comes to the Garden  \u2014   whether they\u2019ve been drinking too much alcohol, they\u2019re looking for a fight, they\u2019re abusive, disrespectful to the staff and then fans  \u2014   they\u2019re going to be ejected and they\u2019re going to be banned. \u201d Several times over the course of the   interview, Dolan described Oakley\u2019s behavior on Wednesday night as out of line. Dolan also said that Oakley \u201cmay have a problem with alcohol\u201d and that Oakley needed to seek help to control his anger. If Oakley were to address his behavioral issues, Dolan said, the Garden would most likely welcome him back. Oakley, 53, has long been estranged from the Knicks and has had an adversarial relationship with Dolan. But he has insisted he was not acting inappropriately on Wednesday night when he sat down not far from Dolan to watch the Knicks play the Los Angeles Clippers. A number of fans who were sitting near Oakley said they had not seen or heard him being belligerent. Other fans suggested that he seemed somewhat combative. In any case, after security guards approached him, a shoving match ensued, and that was followed by the    sight of Oakley being grabbed and led away. But many things with the Knicks are not easy to fathom. Their starting point guard, Derrick Rose, went AWOL for a day. The team itself has lost 20 of its past 26 games, continuing a run of futility that has dominated Dolan\u2019s two decades as owner. And the team president, Phil Jackson, mimicking Dolan, has not spoken with reporters who cover the team since September. Jackson\u2019s few communications have come via an isolated interview or two and occasional Twitter posts, some of them cryptic. But despite the little that he has said, he has still managed, at various moments, to anger both LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. And although he seems intent on trading away Anthony, the Knicks\u2019 only star, Jackson has a problem: Anthony\u2019s   clause. Asked about Jackson during the radio interview, Dolan asserted that he would stay out of his way despite the dismal results Jackson has produced in his nearly three years as team president. He said he would honor Jackson\u2019s   contract \u201call the way to the end. \u201d But while Dolan has long been unpopular in New York and Jackson does not have many admirers these days, Oakley has plenty of support. The incident on Wednesday led to an outpouring of acclaim for him, not only from the team\u2019s frustrated fans but also from current and former N. B. A. players, who have long admired the tough work ethic that Oakley displayed on the court. Given all the negative fallout from Oakley\u2019s ejection, Dolan was asked in the interview whether the organization now felt embarrassed. \u201cWell, I certainly think Charles should be embarrassed,\u201d he said. Oakley, who was reached by telephone after Dolan\u2019s radio interview concluded, said that he had not listened to the broadcast but had already heard about some of Dolan\u2019s comments. \u201cNothing they\u2019re doing makes sense,\u201d Oakley said. \u201cI mean, this man, something\u2019s wrong with him. He crossed a bridge the first night, and then he\u2019s been crossing another bridge every day since. \u201d Oakley, who has acknowledged that he had a couple of drinks before he arrived at Wednesday\u2019s game, declined to address Dolan\u2019s statement that he might have problems with alcohol. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no comment on that. I don\u2019t have to defend myself on that. The people around me know if I have a drinking problem or not. \u201d Asked if he planned to pursue legal action against Dolan or the organization, Oakley said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. \u2019\u2019 Oakley later wrote on Twitter that he was planning to hold a news conference next week. Meanwhile, neither Oakley nor those backing him are liable to take kindly to repeated suggestions by the Knicks  \u2014   the first came in a statement on Wednesday night  \u2014   that Oakley needs some kind of \u201chelp\u201d for his behavior. Instead, there was more support for Oakley, with Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, weighing in after Dolan\u2019s interview. \u201cPainful to believe that my last image of Oak at MSG is him dragged out of the arena,\u201d Roberts wrote on Twitter. \u201cIs that how we remember our Legends? #NoBan. \u201d Dolan said he hoped that Oakley would not be barred forever. He said he would love to honor Oakley at midcourt along with several of his former teammates  \u2014   again, provided that he seeks help. \u201cBut his behavior, it just doesn\u2019t work with that,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cUntil he can address it and get it under control, then we probably won\u2019t be able to do it. \u2019\u2019 Dolan said it was clear to him that Oakley had gone to Wednesday\u2019s game with an \u201cagenda\u201d to be disruptive. Oakley never should have been allowed to take his seat, Dolan said, which he cited as one of his reasons for firing Frank Benedetto, the Garden\u2019s senior vice president for security, on Friday morning. Benedetto, who previously served with the United States Secret Service, could not be reached for comment. Dolan recalled how, during the first quarter of Wednesday\u2019s game, a security guard approached him to relate that he and his   were having difficulties with Oakley. Dolan said he had asked if they could wait to deal with the problem between quarters to avoid a big scene on national television. The security guard agreed with him, Dolan said, but the situation escalated. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do,\u2019\u201d Dolan said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until it was pointed out to me that he was behind us, I sort of opened my ear and started to hear and what I heard was terrible,\u2019\u2019 Dolan added. At one point during the radio interview, Dolan was reminded that he does not give many interviews. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cthis isn\u2019t my favorite thing. \u201d Nor, no doubt, is watching his team lose again, which the Knicks did on Friday night at the Garden, falling to the Denver Nuggets,  . Dolan sat in his customary seat near the court. Oakley, meanwhile, was absent, except for the chants bearing his name.'"}, "time": 1742562296.4793115}
