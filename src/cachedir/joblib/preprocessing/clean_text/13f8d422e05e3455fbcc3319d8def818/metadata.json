What biologists discovered turned out to be even more frightening: the reappearance of a parasite known as the New World screwworm fly that had not been seen in the United States since the 1970s and had been considered eradicated. State and federal officials are hopeful that the infestation, which so far is restricted to Florida\u2019s southernmost Monroe County, is being controlled. Symptoms were first reported in wild deer in July, and laboratory tests in late September confirmed the presence of the screwworm, which is the larva of the screwworm fly. The infestation has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to livestock and is being seen by some experts as a reminder of the challenges of controlling the spread of diseases and infestations in a world of limitless global travel and trade. \u201cIn the very big picture, this is just the latest example of our failure to adequately protect people, agriculture and the environment from consequences of a shrinking world, an interconnected world,\u201d said Adam Putnam, Florida\u2019s commissioner of agriculture. \u201cMillions of cargo containers and millions of passengers arrive every year, entering and exiting Florida and bringing unwelcome pests and disease with them. \u201d In July, Florida Key deer, the smallest subspecies of the   deer, started turning up with grotesque wounds. The tiny deer are the last of their kind  \u2014   only about 875 remain  \u2014   and live in the wild at a federal refuge in the Florida Keys that was established to protect them in 1957. Eight deer died in July and August, and 11 more died during the September mating season. Refuge managers at first thought the injuries were abscesses caused by males puncturing one another with their antlers during the rut, when they fight for dominance. Employees at the refuge, many of whom were not even born the last time the screwworm was found in the United States, had never seen anything like it. In all, about 15 percent of the existing endangered Key deer herd  \u2014   132 animals  \u2014   have died since July. Infections were also found in two stray cats, a dog and a pet pig. Officials worry that if the screwworm spreads to ranches and farms, it could cause up to $1 billion in livestock losses. \u201cWe had no idea what this thing was,\u201d said Kristie Killam, a ranger at the National Key Deer Refuge, the   center run by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. \u201cThere was a few here and there in July and August, but it was September, when the rut started, that we started scratching our heads and saying, \u2018This is a little bit out of the ordinary,\u2019\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt looks like a horribly infected wound, an infected wound that never got treated, infected with mushy maggots. \u201d Lab test results in late September confirmed the presence of the screwworm. Native to South America, it first appeared in the United States in the 1800s. Screwworms are larvae laid by flies in the open wounds of an animal, where the larvae feed on flesh. The fly is a little bigger than a common housefly, with orange eyes and a metallic dark blue or gray body with three dark stripes down its back. An animal quarantine was imposed by officials in Florida in early October, and an agricultural emergency was declared to avoid the spread of the parasite. An infestation in the southeastern United States from the 1930s to the 1950s caused $20 million a year in livestock losses and took 20 years to eradicate, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Since that infestation, the federal government has spent millions of dollars in the last century to keep the screwworm out of Mexico and Central America, lauding it as \u201cone of the greatest success stories in the history of agriculture in the Americas\u201d  \u2014   only to see it reappear in South Florida. Some critics said the authorities should have reacted faster to the threat. They said the delay could cause the infestation to spread, imperiling the one million head of cattle in Florida. \u201cIf private veterinarians or government agencies were aware there was something going on in the pet and deer population and didn\u2019t report it, that\u2019s the example of the breakdown I\u2019ve just been venting about,\u201d Mr. Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner, said. Officials involved with the eradication program disagreed. \u201cThis had not been around since the \u201950s and \u201960s,\u201d said Dan Clark, the manager of the refuge. \u201cMy staff wouldn\u2019t have worked professionally with anything like that. Even a lot of veterinarians just had never seen it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAny reasonable person would have done what we did. \u201d To eradicate the screwworm, seven million fly pupae sterilized by radiation are being released each week in the Florida Keys. The female mates only once in her lifetime, so the idea is that if the female mates with a sterilized fly, the screwworm infestation should be over in about six months. For the first time since the outbreak began, no deer died in the past week, showing that those measures and antiparasitic medications fed to the deer are beginning to show signs of success, the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement on Thursday. The authorities have also set up a mandatory inspection station along the   highway leading to the Florida Keys, where anyone transporting an animal out of the county must stop to have it checked. Nearly 5, 000 animals  \u2014   from chickens to cats, horses and even an ape  \u2014   were inspected without any parasite findings. Brian McCluskey, the associate deputy administrator for veterinary services for the federal Agriculture Department, said it was unclear how the screwworm returned to the United States, but it could have come from someone traveling by boat from Cuba, where the screwworm is present. It is also present in Haiti and other countries, so lab tests will have to be used to determine the origin. The refuge is in a part of Florida that has been a common landing spot for smugglers dropping off Cuban migrants, who sometimes bring their pets. Dr. John H. Wyss, a retired veterinarian who ran the Agriculture Department\u2019s eradication program in Central America for 12 years, said it took 50 years to eliminate the screwworm from the southern United States to Panama. A serious infestation could take two to three years to eliminate, he said. \u201cThe real economic threat would be to the livestock in Florida,\u201d Dr. Wyss said. \u201cIt would be a tremendous cost. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628472.4743693}
