Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nVladimir Putin might have popularized the shirtless-on-horseback calendar pose that was echoed recently by Alex Jones , but Jesse Jackson deserves credit for at least one thing: he chose to keep his shirt on Wednesday when he rode up to the front lines of a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n\u2014 Marisa Villarreal (@marisa_villarr) October 26, 2016 Proud to stand with the Sioux Indians today in North Dakota. #StandingWithStandingRock pic.twitter.com/0dPbDk6RJD \\n\u2014 Rev Jesse Jackson Sr (@RevJJackson) October 26, 2016 Jesse Jackson on the frontline with that native bling #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/QevCYFugN3 \\n\u2014 Ruth Hopkins (@RuthHHopkins) October 26, 2016 \\nSeen standing with Jackson (literally; check over his shoulder above) was \u201cAvengers\u201d actor Mark Ruffalo, who offered his own exclusive scoop of sorts by confirming that climate crusader Leonardo DiCaprio would be stopping by Thursday, assuming his green-friendly private jet that runs on unicorn tears isn\u2019t delayed. This is happening! #noDapl ! Rev. Jesse Jackson calls @POTUS from #StandingRock !

The Seattle Times reports that the administration asked Energy Transfer Partners for a second time Tuesday to voluntarily cease construction, to no avail. And Hillary? No one\u2019s even sure yet where she really stands on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but a few of Ruffalo\u2019s fans aren\u2019t happy that he\u2019s now with her, sort of. Please please please. This is is worth getting out and voting for. A vote for HRC is a vote for @BernieSanders and @SenWarren ! https://t.co/9YElwJ48AJ \\n\u2014 Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 16, 2016 @MarkRuffalo @BernieSanders @SenWarren It most certainly is not. That's propaganda Clinton stans like to push. I vote for who I believe in. \\n\u2014 Stan Dallas \ud83d\ude0d (@FanInTheMoon) October 16, 2016 @MarkRuffalo @BernieSanders @SenWarren I don't recall Sanders being pro TPP, pro fracking and circling China with missiles. Lay off the weed \\n\u2014 Tony Gagliardi (@hornetgags) October 16, 2016 @MarkRuffalo @BernieSanders @SenWarren @1lolamarina Sorry Mark, never was a turn the other cheek kind of guy. She wronged us. Never Democrat \\n\u2014 John Jenkins (@Oteachjohn) October 18, 2016 @MarkRuffalo @BernieSanders @SenWarren NO. A vote for HRC is a for #ElectionFraud , corporate rule, corruption & endless war. #NeverHillary \\n\u2014 Basement Barista (@SouthBoulder) October 16, 2016 @MarkRuffalo @dailykos So vote for Hillary who is a pro-fracking warhawk? Time to get the @GreenPartyUS 5% for a true progressive voice. \\n\u2014 Eric Magnuson (@emmagnuson) October 17, 2016 . @MarkRuffalo Jill Stein's PROGRESSIVE policies are more like Bernie than HRC's. Why should Hillary get my vote? #JillNotHill \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc9a\u262e\ufe0f \\n\u2014 #DNC fraud lawsuit (@Ontheotherhand) October 16, 2016 @MarkRuffalo @BernieSanders @SenWarren A vote for HRC is NOT a vote for Bernie Sanders.
