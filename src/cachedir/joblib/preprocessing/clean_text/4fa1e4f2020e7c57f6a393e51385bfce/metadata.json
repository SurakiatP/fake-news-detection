Here\u2019s how: \\nBrett MacDonald | Twitter | Facebook | \\nNEW YORK \u2014 Today was not a great day for the Clinton campaign. Recently leaked emails from within the Clinton campaign have reached the ears of some prominent members of the Black Lives Matter community \u2014 members whom the emails were about. They are particularly upset about a series of emails that seems how to best \u201cuse\u201d the victims of gun violence while making sure those victims were black. Understandably, some of the members have taken to speaking out against her campaign now. In a word, they\u2019re pissed. \\nErica Garner, the daughter of controversial man who died after being put in \u201cchokehold\u201d by a New York officer has been one of the most vocal critics. \u201cI\u2019m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed \u2018using\u2019 Eric Garner \u2026. Why would you want to \u2018use\u2019 my dad?\u201d she tweeted. \\nThat was way earlier today. She hasn\u2019t stopped since: \u201cIf you vote for her (Clinton) by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does. Remember her hiding being Negros(sic) that supported the crime bill?\u201d If you vote for her by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does. Remember her hiding being Nergos that supported the crime bill? \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nBut here\u2019s the real kicker: \u201cI don\u2019t care what BLM activists endorse #Hillary \u2026 They WILL continue more of the same, they don\u2019t care about Black lives and I got proof!\u201d I dont care what BLM activists endorse #Hillary \u2026 They WILL continue more of the same, they dont care about Black lives and I got proof! \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nBut that\u2019s not the only setback the Clinton campaign saw today. Martin Shkreli, the controversial \u201cpharma-bro\u201d and top-tier troll, had a very alarming announcement for the music community: if Trump wins, he will release his previously unheard music from the Beatles, Nirvana, and, mot importantly to the black community, Wu-Tang. If Trump wins, my entire unreleased music collection, including unheard Nirvana, Beatles, and of course, Wu-Tang, comes out, for free. \\n\u2014 Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) October 27, 2016 This article was written by Brett MacDonald.
