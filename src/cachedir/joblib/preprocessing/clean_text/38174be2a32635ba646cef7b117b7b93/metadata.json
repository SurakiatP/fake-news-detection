Multiple thousands of employees from the Service Employees International Union and United Service Workers West, led by David Huerta, will strike. \u201cWe understand that there\u2019s risk involved in that,\u201d Huerta told BuzzFeed News, \u201cbut we\u2019re willing to take that risk in order to be able to move forward in this moment, while the most marginalized are in the crosshairs of this administration. \u201d A statement announcing the strike says that participants will be rejecting Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and what they say is his \u201cagenda of hate and greed. \u201d \u201cWe need to show this Administration, Congress and large corporate interests that our human and economic worth is more powerful than their agenda of hate and greed,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOpposing Trump is not enough. We must stop him. \u201d The last time there was a major strike of this magnitude was when the first Day Without Immigrants took place in 2006.'"}, "time": 1742561908.8252134}
