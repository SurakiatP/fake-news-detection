One of the guests, Mayor Ken Taylor of Huachuca City, Ariz. was incensed. \u201cI will NOT attend a function that is sent to me in \u201d Mr. Taylor replied in an email to the invitation sent by John F. Cook, his former counterpart in El Paso and the executive director of the U. S.  Border Mayors Association. \u201cOne nation means one language,\u201d Mr. Taylor continued, \u201cand I am insulted by the division caused by language. \u201d In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Cook said that he was flabbergasted by the reply, but that \u201cI didn\u2019t want to pick a fight. \u201d So, in a response to Mr. Taylor, he wrote, \u201cThe purpose of the Border Mayors Association is to speak with one voice in Washington, D. C. and Mexico City about issues that impact our communities, not to speak in one language. My humble apologies if I ruffled your feathers. \u201d The reactions on Twitter were less forgiving. The fuss, first reported by The El Paso Times, captures one side of a longstanding battle over the use of Spanish in the United States that has played out on many fronts, from the    reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance by   students in Wisconsin to conversations on school buses in Nevada and this year\u2019s presidential campaign. During the Republican primary, Donald J. Trump said of one of his rivals, Jeb Bush, who is fluent in Spanish, \u201cHe should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States. \u201d In Arizona, the aversion to Spanish in some quarters also underscores the angst of a vanishing majority that is still dominant in political and business circles. A state law bans bilingual education, or the practice of teaching    children in their native language while they also learn English, in public schools. Demographers project that Latinos, who make up 31 percent of Arizona\u2019s population, could become the state\u2019s largest ethnic group by 2020. The bilingual invitations to the Aug. 24 meeting went out Wednesday to the mayors of every city and town along the Mexico border, including Huachuca City, whose population of 1, 900 is 15 percent Hispanic. Despite Mr. Cook\u2019s apology, Mr. Taylor continued his offensive. \u201cAmerican is going \u2018Down Hill\u2019 fast because we spend more time catering to others that are concerned with their own self interests. It is far past time to remember that we should be \u2018America First\u2019   \u2026     there is NOTHING wrong with that. \u201d Mr. Taylor invoked his military service  \u2014   \u201cI am a Veteran who served in other Countries FOR America,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Cook said he, too, is a combat veteran, from Vietnam. \u201cThis has nothing to do with a lack of patriotism from my side,\u201d he said. In an emailed statement on Saturday, Mr. Taylor said he was \u201chorrified at how badly I have been misrepresented to the public\u201d in what he called a private conversation. He said his objection was not to the invitation, but rather to the organization that \u201cproduced literature putting America subservient to Mexico. \u201d He added: \u201cI respect Mexicans and would correspond to them in Spanish first. It seems reasonable that Americans should be honored accordingly by our own. \u201d The purpose of the border mayors association is to \u201caddress the opportunities and challenges facing the United States and Mexico in a global economy,\u201d Mr. Cook said. Attendance of its meetings is not mandatory, but he nonetheless removed Mr. Taylor from the email list, as he had requested in one of his notes. \u201cGiving away our sovereignty to benefit others is NOT a way to strengthen our Nation and OUR homes, it is an idea that is provably doomed to failure for the common man,\u201d Mr. Taylor wrote. \u201cIf Mexico is NOT stopping drugs, crime, and terrorists from coming INTO our country from Mexico, then Mexico is not a friend and I don\u2019t care to help. I have better things to do in fighting the problems they export to us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563667.6563382}
