He told host Sean Hannity that he finally got to apologize to Lewinsky in person after a coincidence made them neighbors. \\nRovin also said that Hillary Clinton had an affair with longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster that lasted for years. Foster was found dead in what police said was a suicide, but speculation has always been that he was murdered. \\nPart of Rovin\u2019s \u201cfixer\u201d responsibilities included helping scrub Foster\u2019s office after his death. He also said he was ordered to distract the media while Team Clinton rummaged through Foster\u2019s office.   \\nFoster also said he hired Jerry Parks, an Arkansas investigator, to spy on Bill because Hillary was worried about Bill\u2019s exploits with so many \u201csluts\u201d and how that could hurt their political careers. \\nTwo months after Foster was found dead, Parks was found shot nine times at a stoplight in his SUV in Little Rock, Arkansas.
