This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans \u201cdeplorable.\u201d As if that weren\u2019t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. \u201cI think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don\u2019t get killed,\u201d Seagal tweeted. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do [email protected] \u201cPneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,\u201d he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. \u201cCapable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,\u201d he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. \u201cObama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,\u201d he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. \u201cBest thing in the world\u2026Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there\u2026 #HYPOCRITICAL,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAn America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.\u201d What do you think of Seagal\u2019s comments?
