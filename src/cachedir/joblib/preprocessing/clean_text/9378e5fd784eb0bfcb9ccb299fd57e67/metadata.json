Devin Nunes announced Wednesday that members of President Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, including the   were \u201cincidentally\u201d surveilled by the intelligence community, additional names of the transition team were \u201cunmasked,\u201d and that the information was not obtained in relation to Russia. [Nunes recalled his recent confirmation that information on members of the Trump transition team had been incidentally collected by the intelligence community on numerous occasions. \u201cDetails about U. S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. \u201d  \u201cThird, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked,\u201d said Nunes. When later asked by reporters if the President was also included in the incidental collection of information, Nunes replied, \u201cYes. \u201d In response to another reporter, Nunes said \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d that Trump\u2019s personal communication was collected. Rep. Nunes later went on to say of \u201cdozens\u201d of reports he has seen thus far, \u201cI have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the   and his team were, I guess, at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence in what appears to be  \u2026    intelligence reporting channels. \u201d He added that he is, however, awaiting further information. The representative\u2019s fourth point was emphatic, \u201c  \u2026    none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team. \u201d He made clear that the House Intelligence Committee will investigate surveillance of Trump associates and subsequent dissemination of information gathered. He stated that the goal is to determine: Who was aware of it, Why it was not disclosed to Congress, Who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, Whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates, Whether any laws, regulations, or procedures were violated, Nunes said that he believes the collection was done legally, but questions remain as to unmasking and the dissemination list of information collected during the transition during the months of November, December, and January. Rep. Nunes characterized the information that was collected as \u201cA lot of it appears like it was  \u2026    it was essentially a lot of information on the   and his transition team and what they were doing. \u201d He said he has asked the Directors of FBI, NSA, and CIA to \u201cexpeditiously comply\u201d with his March 15 letter and provide a full account of such surveillance activities. Nunes called the NSA very, very helpful. He expects additional information to come on Friday. Rep. Nunes said he has not seen any information that has anything to do with Russia or the Russian investigation. He said that while he expects more information and did not make an absolute determination on how the information was collected, \u201cIt was not criminal, it was normal, foreign surveillance is what it looked like to me, but let\u2019s wait until we get all the information. \u201d \u201cThis appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under FISA, where there was incidental collection that then ended up in reporting channels and that was widely disseminated,\u201d said Nunes. Rep. Nunes said he was surprised and alarmed by the discovery of this information, \u201cbecause we went through this about a year and a half ago as it related to members of Congress  \u2026    \u201d Nunes stated that he would travel to the White House in the afternoon to share the new information he has with President Trump.
