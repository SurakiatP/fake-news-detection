But she is most remembered for two indelible sitcom roles: Laura Petrie on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and later, Mary Richards on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show. \u201d [ Read Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] Ms. Moore first appeared in The New York Times in 1962, during the first season of \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d which ran from 1961 to 1966. A reporter interviewed her during a brief trip to New York to   CBS executives and affiliates. (\u201cWhen they saw Mary, there was quite a bit of applause and a few whistles,\u201d a network spokesman said.) By 1965 the show was a hit and Ms. Moore was a star. The writer Joanne Stang called her the \u201cvirtually uncontested popularity queen of weekly television,\u201d marveling that Ms. Moore \u201chas made housewifery a highly palatable pastime. \u201d \u201cI guess they simply like me,\u201d Ms. Moore said in the article. At the time she was preparing to try to leverage her TV success into a film career, having recently signed a contract with Universal. But she was similarly   about her prospects. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have the chemistry for the big screen, I guess I\u2019ll look for something else to do when the \u2018Van Dyke Show\u2019 goes off,\u201d she said. Ms. Moore did appear in films like \u201cThoroughly Modern Millie,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s So Bad About Feeling Good?\u201d and \u201cChange of Habit,\u201d but it was another television show that became her defining role. \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d which Ms. Moore produced with her   Grant Tinker, debuted in 1970, arriving in an era whose social mores were signified by the groaner headline The Times used to introduce it and other new   series: \u201cOut of the Kitchen, Ladies. \u201d Early coverage was similarly dismissive: \u201cMary Tyler Moore is caught in a preposterous item about life as an \u2018associate producer\u2019 in a TV newsroom,\u201d Jack Gould wrote in The Times in a preview of the 1970 TV season. In his brief review of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d Mr. Gould complained that the star was saddled with \u201cone set of bizarre happenings at a TV station\u2019s newsroom and another in her living accommodations. \u201d But within a few years, The Times had reconsidered its stance. \u201cConsistently tight writing and good acting have made this situation comedy the best of its kind in the history of American television,\u201d Dan Menaker wrote in 1973. The following year, The Times was revealing \u201cWhy 30 Million Are Mad About Mary. \u201d (The answer: She is \u201cbeautiful and sexy, but not threatening. \u201d) As the show wrapped up its run, during which it had broken ground in prime time with its depiction of a single professional woman, an Associated Press article in The Times noted that the show \u201claid to rest the myth that audiences would not accept a situation comedy involving a woman, unless she was married and burned dinner at least one night a week. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m just part of it,\u201d Ms. Moore said in the article. \u201cBut it really has affected a lot of people, all to the good. \u201d Ms. Moore\u2019s career never again reached the heights of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d but she stayed busy branching out into musicals and additional,   series, and playing against plucky type in TV movies and films like \u201cOrdinary People\u201d and \u201cFlirting With Disaster. \u201d In the twilight of her career, as the lifetime achievement awards started rolling in, she embraced her signature role in lighthearted reunion specials and in the occasional interview. In 2012, Neil Genzlinger, a television critic for The Times, watched the series finale of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d with the actress, who apologized in advance for a watery eye that had been plaguing her. \u201cAs we finished,\u201d Mr. Genzlinger wrote, \u201cMs. Moore reached for the tissue box. \u2018Now I am crying,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s not just a bad eye. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561758.6658509}
