[\u201cThe commission is going to be about a dozen people, bipartisan, five of them current or former Secretaries of State,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cWhat it\u2019s going to do is take a nationwide look at the problem of voter fraud. There\u2019s a lot of debate around the subject of voter fraud, and as someone who has been Secretary of State in a state where we introduced photo ID as well as proof of citizenship, and security for   ballots  \u2014   which is oftentimes a source of fraud or a type of fraud that occurs  \u2014   we\u2019re going to look at it from a nationwide perspective. \u201d   \u201cI\u2019ve amassed a lot of data at the state level in Kansas, but there really hasn\u2019t ever been an effort by a federal entity to measure the statistics and the facts nationwide and see what the numbers look like,\u201d he noted. Kobach recalled that Kansas and other states asked the Obama administration to provide lists of aliens on legal visas to check against voter rolls, so they could weed out ineligible voters.  \u201cThe federal government has consistently said no, under the Obama administration. Well, this commission will have the authority to maybe look at a couple of states and say, \u2018okay, let\u2019s check how many people who are registered voters in those states are also known aliens,   according to the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be exciting, something never done before, and it will give us some sense of what the real numbers are of this problem. \u201d \u201cThe Social Security Administration has what\u2019s called the \u2018master death file.\u2019 It sounds like some sort of starship from Star Wars, but the master death file is a list of people who have died. The Social Security Administration wants to track that, and of course keep Social Security Numbers rotating to people who are living. That\u2019s a database that can be used to bump against some of the voter rolls,\u201d he added. \u201cThings like that, where we can just take some hard statistics and gather some numbers  \u2014   and we\u2019ll also be looking at anecdotal things and    prosecutions for voter fraud. It\u2019s a big job,\u201d Kobach said. Marlow anticipated that Kobach would encounter obstructionism from Democrats despite the bipartisan nature of his commission, because as he starkly put it, \u201cWe know that the Democrats would like to have lax voter laws and voter rules, because that allows them to cheat. \u201d Kobach said that after the commission was announced last week, \u201cwe did have people like Chuck Schumer coming out immediately and criticize me, and say that the commission is a waste of time. \u201d \u201cMy response is, \u2018Senator, what are you afraid of? What are you afraid the commission is going to find, that you would attack the   of the commission ad hominem, and that you don\u2019t want the commission to look at the evidence? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cLook, if he\u2019s right and voter fraud is virtually   in America, then the commission will find virtually nothing, and we will make his case for him,\u201d Kobach argued. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of curious how some of the leadership of the Democrat Party  \u2014   and that includes Tom Perez  \u2014   have criticized the commission, when I would think if they really are interested in the facts, they would say \u2018Hey, great the commission will prove to us that voter fraud doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 So yeah, it\u2019s been interesting. \u201d Kobach said the Trump administration is \u201cdoing well\u201d on immigration and border security so far, in his estimation. \u201cI think the executive orders are what needed to be done. The vetting of people coming from parts of the world where terrorism is rampant, where ISIS or   control territory, is very problematic. I give them high marks for that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing is, they\u2019ve sent a very clear message to the ICE agents that hey, we\u2019re taking the rope off your hands, we\u2019re untying your hands and letting you do your job,\u201d he continued. \u201cJust by doing that, just by seeing ICE agents more active and out on the field, back doing what they were supposed to do, that has sent a message to the smugglers and to the illegal aliens coming in that there is a new sheriff in town. \u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the border crossing numbers plummeting,\u201d Kobach stated. \u201cI think that\u2019s great. It does show what those of us who have studied and worked in the immigration field know, and that is that if you make a slight change of policy in Washington, you\u2019ll get an immediate reaction on the border. \u201d  \u201cFor example, whenever the   crowd starts talking about an amnesty  \u2014   and under President Obama, they had a president who was welcoming an amnesty  \u2014   then immediately border crossings surged,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe word gets down south of the border very quickly, and people surge in, because they want to be in the country so that they can claim they were eligible for the amnesty when it happens. Similarly, the opposite is true too. If a more aggressive enforcement begins, word gets across that hey, this is going to be tougher. The price of a coyote smuggling you in is going to double or triple. That affects behavior. \u201d  \u201cThose are some good marks for the administration. I think there is more they could be doing, and hopefully they will be doing it in the near future,\u201d he said. Marlow cited some of the more vicious attacks on Kobach\u2019s character, and asked what it was like to endure such calumny merely because he insists on border security and clean elections. \u201cIt\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Kobach replied. \u201cThey\u2019ve been dragging my name through the mud for years now. I\u2019ve become calloused to it, and it doesn\u2019t bother me that much. But you know, it bothers my wife, my family. You don\u2019t want your kids to read that. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so false,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen someone is in a debate, and they don\u2019t have any arguments left, oftentimes on the Left they resort to ad hominem remarks. They just attack you as a person. They call you a racist, they call you a vote suppressor. They just come up with these stupid names. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t have any actual arguments left. I\u2019m not surprised any more by it. It doesn\u2019t bother me, but it\u2019s rather tedious, and I certainly don\u2019t like my family seeing it. \u201d Kobach anticipated his commission completing its work within a year, and said he would continue to work on ballot integrity and border security in the meantime. \u201cWe should see some interesting data, whatever it is, that the commission is able to present to the country. I continue to work in the area of illegal immigration as a litigator, so I\u2019ll be working there. I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of things happening, especially on sanctuary cities,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia has got this bill that has passed one house, it\u2019s in the other house, to create a sanctuary state, which is just extraordinary. I think you could potentially see litigation on that. You could see litigation on a whole bunch of things,\u201d he anticipated.  \u201cI\u2019ll keep fighting to keep our voter rolls clean, and to help this commission find whatever there is to find on the subject nationally. The fight to secure our borders is something that has to be done both within the administration and without. States need to help. States like Texas made a great effort to enlist state and local law enforcement, just like Arizona did a few years ago. I\u2019ll be continuing to push for that,\u201d Kobach promised.
