Looking visibly uncomfortable in front of the camera during a particularly brutal interview, Hillary exited stage left as quick as she could when a horrified staff member caught what she did backstage. \\nHillary probably felt safe going into the interview by liberal-leaning Matt Lauer, who conducted a televised question and answer session with the Democratic candidate in September at the Commander-in-Chief Forum. As she\u2019s apparently accustomed to, Hillary allegedly received a list of questions before the event, so she could prepare her answers (lies) and prevent being caught on the spot to come up with what to say, making her come across flawlessly to the public. Thinking everything was worked to her advantage as is typically the case, Lauer threw the candidate a curve ball that Hillary couldn\u2019t hide from. \\nAccording to The Watch Towers, a Comcast official (the parent company of NBC Universal) stated that Lauer went rogue when he asked \u201cone legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails.\u201d The alleged informant said at that point \u201cwe could see she (Hillary) was beginning to boil.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s evident by her expression and tone caught in the recording of the Forum interview that Hillary wasn\u2019t happy about being forced to answer a question she wasn\u2019t prepared for. Holding her rage inside the best she could, the person claiming to be a producer on the set, accused Hillary of launching an explosive verbal assault on her staff backstage after the interview. \\n\u201cShe was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her \u2013 she went kind of manic and didn\u2019t have any control over herself at that point,\u201d the anonymous informant claimed in an unconfirmed report by Watch Towers . \\n\u201cHillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and throw it at the face of her assistant, and the screaming started,\u201d the description of the alleged events also said. The staffer claimed that they heard Hillary turn her rage on Donald Trump, saying, \u201cIf that f \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 ing bastard wins, we all hang from nooses! Lauer\u2019s finished\u2026and if I lose it\u2019s all on your heads for screwing this up.\u201d \\nWhile the reports of this incident have not been authenticated, it definitely doesn\u2019t seem out of character for Hillary, and with what happened to Lauer after the interview certainly shows that the Democratic candidate complained. \u201cMatt Lauer was massively criticized for the rest of the week on air by the Clinton campaign and the rest of the MSM as having conducted \u2018an unfair and partisan attack on Clinton\u2019,\u201d Watch Towers reported. \\nAs we saw in the court hearings over Benghazi, Hillary is a loose cannon when being called out on her illegal, dishonest, and deadly actions that she\u2019s not used to being confronted on. Whether this explosive tirade happened or not \u2014 to any degree of severity \u2014 her angry actions against the American people and our heroes she disrespects, speak volumes about who she is, which isn\u2019t someone we need leading our country.'"}, "time": 1742628430.4193769}
