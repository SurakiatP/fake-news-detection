She has not only illegally declared herself \u201cleader\u201d of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an iron-fisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. \\nDuring elections earlier this year, Myanmar\u2019s constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nation\u2019s highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her children\u2019s dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the \u201cdefacto leader\u201d of Myanmar. \\nCanada\u2019s The Globe and Mail in an article titled, \u201cSt\u00e9phane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the \u2018de facto\u2019 leader of Myanmar,\u201d would note that Canada\u2019s government recognized this legal side-stepping, stating: \\nDion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmar\u2019s foreign minister, \u201cthe de facto national leader\u201d of her country \u201cbecause they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody who\u2019s not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state.\u201d \\nSuu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmar\u2019s decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. \\nIn essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman who\u2019s Western backers \u2013 particularly in the United States and United Kingdom \u2013 have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her party\u2019s first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian \\nAnother myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for \u201chuman rights.\u201d Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this self-serving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. \\nIn addition to escalating violence targeting the nation\u2019s Rohingya\u2019s population, several activists online have been sent to jail for \u201cinsulting\u201d the ruling government and Western-backed media fronts and organizations. \\nMyanmar\u2019s Eleven Media Group (EMG) in its article, \u201cFacebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi,\u201d attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state: \\nA Facebook user named Zaw Zaw (aka Nga Pha) was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. \\nHe has been charged under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor [posted on Facebook],\u201d said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34-year-old resident of North Okkalapa Township. \\nAround 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted: \u201cYou deserved it for insulting a good person.\u201d \\nThe article also admits: \\nThe Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing (aka A Nyar Thar), the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. \\nAung Myint Tun (aka Ko Pho Htaung), a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. \\nAnother man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. \\nHla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the Commander-in-Chief. \\nEMG \u2013 ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous military-led government by Reporters without Borders \u2013 would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmar\u2019s laws to silence its own critics, claiming: \\nEleven Media Group (EMG) also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. \\nOne would expect such a tidal wave of abuse \u2013 as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world \u2013 to be met with sweeping condemnation from the West\u2019s various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders \u2013 yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off \\nThe West\u2019s champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the military-led government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyi\u2019s breaches of Western standards of \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201chuman rights,\u201d the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. \\nThe overt nature of both the West\u2019s and Suu Kyi\u2019s hypocrisy illustrates that \u201cdemocracy,\u201d \u201crule of law,\u201d and \u201chuman rights\u201d are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power \u2013 hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could \u2013 because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their faux-nongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. \\nInternational audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric \u2013 supporting supposed \u201cpro-democracy\u201d and \u201cpro-human rights\u201d advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power. \\nTony Cartalucci, Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher and writer, especially for the online magazine \u201cNew Eastern Outlook\u201d .'"}, "time": 1742563031.4678235}
