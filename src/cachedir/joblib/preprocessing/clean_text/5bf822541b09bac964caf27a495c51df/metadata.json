[Speaker Ryan\u2019s bill, often referred to as RyanCare, would impose a 30 percent premium surcharge on those who forego insurance for longer than three months. Conservatives have panned this surcharge as creating another individual mandate penalty.  The Congressional Budget Office analysis reports that Speaker Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal bill forces one million people to purchase health insurance or pay the bill\u2019s insurance premium surcharge. Avalere Health reported that because health insurance premiums adjust based on age, Ryan\u2019s health penalties would be cheaper for younger Americans, and more expensive for older Americans. Avalere\u2019s report states that \u201cA    individual at 100% of the federal poverty level ($11, 880 in income for 2016) could pay over $1, 000 more in penalties under AHCA for not having insurance in the prior year than what she would pay for not having insurance under the current law. Finally, unlike the ACA individual mandate penalty, the AHCA\u2019s penalties are not prorated based on how long someone is uninsured, so penalty increases are higher for those who have shorter gaps in coverage. \u201d Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, said, \u201cThe continuous coverage penalty functions much like today\u2019s individual mandate, but it increases penalties for   and older individuals, and it reduces penalties for younger and wealthier people. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563857.785931}
