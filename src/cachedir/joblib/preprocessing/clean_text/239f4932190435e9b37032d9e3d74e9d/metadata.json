(These files were written in Italian, and then translated by a respected New York City professor of the language.)\\nOne section of the report deals with September 2012 \u2014 the same month as the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, and three others. In an alleged message from Clinton to top aide Huma Abedin, the secretary made it clear she wasn\u2019t going to rush to take action.\\n\u201cAvoid that they appeal to the AUMF, lets give a political weight to the wait, take time,\u201d the message reads. (The acronym AUMF most likely refers to an \u201cauthorization for the use of military force.\u201d)\\nThe text continues, \u201cWhat has happened has happened, at Sigonella they are standing still, they have to remain firm.\u201d\\nSigonella almost certainly refers to Naval Air Station Sigonella, located in the Italian island region of Sicily. According to reports, a US Air Force source once claimed that attack jets were being armed and fueled at Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy on Sept. 11, 2012, or the night of the Benghazi attacks. The source has said the jets could have refueled at Sigonella, which is located some 400 miles from Benghazi, and helped stave off the slaughter.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742564319.713821}
