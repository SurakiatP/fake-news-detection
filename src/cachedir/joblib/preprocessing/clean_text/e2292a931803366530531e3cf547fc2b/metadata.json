Black community activists said the outcomes will test the calm that prevailed after the shootings and could trigger unrest if those angry about the killings feel justice is not served. \\n\u201cThe community is, for lack of better words, on eggshells,\u201d said Justin Bamberg, a state legislator and lawyer who represents Scott\u2019s family. \\nBoth trials are expected to last several weeks and draw national attention to the port city of about 133,000 people that is known for its cuisine and well-preserved 18th and 19th century architecture. But Bamberg said the cases have important distinctions. \\nRoof\u2019s trial is less about his guilt or innocence than whether he will be sentenced to life in prison or death, Bamberg said. Roof\u2019s lawyers have said he would plead guilty to 33 counts of hate crimes, obstruction of religion and firearms charges if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. \\nSlager\u2019s case, on the other hand, could produce a rare result: a guilty verdict against a U.S. police officer charged with murder or manslaughter.
