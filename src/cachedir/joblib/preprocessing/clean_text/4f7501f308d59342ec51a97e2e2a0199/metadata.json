Why would they fight the voter ID if they don\u2019t plan to have massive voter fraud?\u201d \\nThe mainstream media and the Clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until Election Day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in Hillary\u2019s favor, Nichols said. \\n\u201cFolks, do not believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe polling is a part of this game plan to destroy your confidence in your ability to win.\u201d \\n\u201cI believe Donald Trump is winning,\u201d Nichols added. \u201cYou\u2019re winning. You\u2019ve just got to stay the course.\u201d \\nNichols warned that voters must take extra steps to ensure their vote isn\u2019t being altered. \\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make people at the precinct prove that your vote was recorded properly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t show you proof, then demand a paper ballot.\u201d \\nThe damning videos provided by Project Veritas exposing high-level Democrat operatives discussing how they steal elections illustrate that worries about voter fraud aren\u2019t unfounded, with even the New York Times acknowledging a recent survey showing that most voters fear their ballot won\u2019t count because they believe \u201cthe political process is so dominated by corporate interests.\u201d NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
