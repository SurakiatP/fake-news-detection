It\u2019s just tremendous. \\n\u201cIn fact, if I were to try to tell you how tremendous this is, you wouldn\u2019t believe me.

Jail\u2026is\u2026where\u2026she\u2026belongs!\u201d \\nThe triumphant Cubs team will now embark on a world tour of Illinois to celebrate their remarkable world-beating achievement.
