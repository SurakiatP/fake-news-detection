[Hodgson argued that if \u201csanctuary cities are going to harbor and conceal criminal illegal aliens from ICE [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] which is in direct violation of Title 8 of the U. S. Code, federal arrest warrants should be issued for their elected officials. \u201d  Hodgson reiterated his point Wednesday, saying, \u201cIt is a felony under federal law for anyone to harbor or conceal someone they know to be in the country illegally. And in the instances of sanctuary cities, we have mayors who are saying, \u2018Look, we\u2019re not going to allow our law enforcement people to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement if they have someone that they know to be illegal in their custody. \u2019\u201d Hodgson later added, \u201cThis is all about following our laws, and we can\u2019t have elected officials in this country saying that they\u2019re going to be exempt from any consequences and they\u2019re going to choose what laws they want to follow. That can\u2019t happen in America. What we need to do is send a clear message. If these elected officials are going to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going to defy federal law,\u2019 and their leadership positions are going to encourage that kind of thing, they need to be, absolutely, issued arrest warrants. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
