[\u201cTrump has proven that he really can\u2019t take the heat in the White House kitchen. But, he won\u2019t get out of it, either. His ego won\u2019t let him. Removing him will be up to us,\u201d the Who\u2019s the Boss actress wrote in an essay published in Marie Claire.   Milano says the \u201ccrushing,   blow\u201d of Trump\u2019s election spurred women to begin \u201corganizing the resistance. \u201d The actress writes: \u201cMost of us thought \u2014  no, assumed \u2014  that when we woke up on November 9, 2016, we\u2019d be looking into the poised and confident face of the first female president. We stepped up! The powerful Hillary Clinton, a lifelong civil servant, politician, wife, mother, and former First Lady seemed to embody all the glorious elements of a modern leader. Instead, we arose to the sinister smirk of her opponent, the \u2018dark horse.\u2019 All we heard were our hearts drop over the deafening mic drop. \u201d The    actress later describes Trump as \u201can egomaniac with no political experience, questionable business ethics, and a crude moral compass\u201d who \u201chas been charged with running our big, beautiful, diverse, country. \u201d Milano\u2019s essay came on International Women\u2019s Day, which saw   #DayWithoutAWoman protests around the world and in the U. S. organized by leftist Women\u2019s March activists. The actress says Trump\u2019s election forced women to begin \u201cfighting back with marches, rallies and town hall meetings. \u201d \u201cSo, with powerful hearts and pussies, we began the fight,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe grabbed back. We realized the power of our collective voices and awakened a sleeping, feminist giant. She\u2019s smart. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s strong. She\u2019s pissed. \u201d \u201cFeminine power is boundless. Women can change the world. We already have  \u2026    and we\u2019re not giving up now. The march goes on. \u201d Milano was an early supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential bid. She\u2019s spent much of her time on social media slamming Trump\u2019s policies.
