The challenges facing Donald Trump have grown. Filings revealed that the Trump campaign, with just $1. 3 million in cash, is trailing Hillary Clinton by more than $41 million  \u2014   even as it has made sizable payouts to his family and companies. Mr. Trump said the shortfall showed that his operation was \u201cleaner and more efficient, like our government should be. \u201d But it also means that he\u2019s leaning on the Republican National Committee for help. Above, protesters gathered outside the Manhattan hotel where Mr. Trump spoke to hundreds of evangelicals. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton laced into Mr. Trump\u2019s business record and economic policies. In a speech in Ohio, she called him the \u201cking of debt,\u201d said he would \u201crig the economy for Wall Street again\u201d and warned that his idea of defaulting on American debt could start \u201ca global panic. \u201d He responded on Twitter, including one tweet that said, \u201cHer judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. \u201d _____ 3. A compromise on gun sales was proposed a day after four other measures stalled in the Senate. The new bill, restricting sales to terror suspects on the government\u2019s \u201c \u201d list, was offered by Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat. Attorney General Loretta Lynch visited people wounded in the attack nine days ago in Orlando, Fla. while a state senator running for Congress said he would hold a drawing for a   rifle to burnish his   credentials. _____ 4. So much for an upset. The U. S. men\u2019s soccer team lost   to Argentina in the semifinals of the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario. La Albiceleste, as the team is known, was ranked No. 1 by FIFA going into the tournament and features Lionel Messi, perhaps the best player in the world. Argentina will now play the winner of Wednesday\u2019s semifinal match in Chicago between Colombia and Chile. _____ 5. There are those who see grand theater and operatic drama in sports. But the triumph of LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers brings another kind of work of art to mind, which you may have heard of in high school. The story of a hero leaving the nest to find his fortune, making gains but suffering, and finally returning home to find it holds everything he ever needed? That\u2019s the classic bildungsroman, our ( ) sports reporter reminds us. _____ 6. \u201cBrits don\u2019t quit. \u201d That was David Cameron, Britain\u2019s prime minister, making a   appeal to voters to choose to remain in the European Union on Thursday. Three years ago, when he promised the referendum, it seemed like a safe way to buy a   peace with the   wing of his Conservative Party. But now polls suggest the outcome is too close to call. _____ 7. The F. A. A. issued new rules allowing a broad range of businesses to use drones under 55 pounds, but stopped short of allowing package delivery. A lawyer working on behalf of Amazon and Google said that once drones become commonplace, it will be \u201charder to argue against broader uses  \u2014   like for delivery. \u201d _____ 8. If \u201cThe Graduate\u201d were written today, the messianic businessman\u2019s \u201cone word\u201d to Dustin Hoffman\u2019s aimless character might be \u201cbiometrics\u201d instead of \u201cplastics. \u201d Some of the biggest U. S. banks are already enabling customers to use face and eye scans, fingerprints or voice analysis to access their accounts. \u201cWe believe the password is dying,\u201d an expert on financial crime said. _____ 9. Finally, good news for a peculiar Central Asian antelope. The saiga population is beginning to recover after a mysterious ailment last year killed more than 200, 000  \u2014   more than half  \u2014   of the animals in Kazakhstan. In the   herd, numbers rose from 31, 000 to 36, 000 by April. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news,\u201d a preservationist said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
