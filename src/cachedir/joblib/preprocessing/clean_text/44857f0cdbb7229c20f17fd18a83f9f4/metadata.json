Army Corps will spend more than $1 million to clean up the mess left behind by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. The protesters  \u2014   who succeeded in temporarily shutting down pipeline construction under orders from President Barack Obama  \u2014   were evicted after President Donald Trump put the pipeline project back online.
