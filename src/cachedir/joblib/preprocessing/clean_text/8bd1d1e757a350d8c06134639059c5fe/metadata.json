Journalists who caught a glimpse of the musician entering the tightly guarded building in Manhattan took to Twitter to document the strange spectacle. Mr. West\u2019s appearance occurred shortly before former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was named as   Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Energy Department  \u2014   the same agency that Mr. Perry said during the 2012 presidential race that he wanted to abolish. For Mr. Trump, the visit was another   stuffed into a series of more consequential events, including the possibility of a showdown with Republicans in Congress over intelligence reports that Russia may have interfered in the election. Once Mr. West returned to the lobby with Mr. Trump, he didn\u2019t provide much information about the reasons for his visit. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. Asked what he and Mr. West talked about, he responded: \u201cLife. We discussed life. \u201d Mr. West\u2019s visit was probably a welcome one for the  . It came hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s   announcement on Monday that he would refrain from any new business deals with his real estate company while in the Oval Office. In addition, the focus this past week has been on Mr. Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest as president, which would include the growing cadre of billionaires and multimillionaires he wants to install in his cabinet. There is also substantial interest around his choice for secretary of state: Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who has friendly ties with the Russians. For his part, Mr. West dodged questions about the possibility of performing at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. The rapper only smiled at reporters and said, \u201cI just want to take a picture right now. \u201d It is unclear why the musician and sometime fashion designer stepped out from a reported recovery and into the center of the media circus at Trump Tower, but Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, said in an email that Mr. West had requested the meeting. \u201cThe meeting was requested by Kanye and we were delighted to host him,\u201d Ms. Hicks wrote, adding, \u201cThey had a very positive and productive conversation. \u201d She did not elaborate, but later in the afternoon, Mr. West said on Twitter that he wanted to meet with Mr. Trump to discuss \u201cmulticultural issues\u201d that included \u201cbullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums and violence in Chicago. \u201d He added: \u201cI feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change. \u201d Much about Mr. West\u2019s public presence has been a mystery of late. He abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour in November after a series of unsettling concert appearances. He was hospitalized in what was characterized in   dispatches as a \u201cpsychiatric emergency. \u201d In one   rant a few weeks ago, Mr. West voiced his support for Mr. Trump and ended the performance, much to the shock and disappointment of his fans. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m taking his lead,\u201d Mr. West said of Mr. Trump, after spending some time railing against the news media and praising Mr. Trump\u2019s policy against political correctness. His statements, some of which targeted his contemporaries in the music industry, including Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9, came weeks after his wife, Kim Kardashian West, was robbed at gunpoint in a Paris apartment. Mr. West has expressed interest in politics before,  declaring in a rambling speech last year that he wanted to run for president in 2020. He has also been an outspoken critic of politicians. In 2005, he lashed out at a sitting president on live TV, declaring during a   for Hurricane Katrina victims, \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people. \u201d Mr. Bush later called Mr. West\u2019s criticism a \u201cdisgusting moment\u201d for his presidency. On Tuesday, Mr. West\u2019s relationship with the Trump administration seemed to be off to a rosier start. When the two said their goodbyes, Mr. Trump leaned in to say something to Mr. West, then headed back into the elevator with his daughter Ivanka.'"}, "time": 1742563010.959808}
