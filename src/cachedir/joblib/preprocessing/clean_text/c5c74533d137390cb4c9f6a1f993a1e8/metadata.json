But the 73-year-old actor defied script and delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump. \\n\u201cHe\\'s so blatantly stupid. He\\'s a punk, he\\'s a dog, he\\'s a pig [...] a mutt who [...] doesn\\'t do his homework, doesn\\'t care. He\\'s an idiot. Colin Powell said it best: He\\'s a national disaster. He\\'s an embarrassment to this country,\u201d the Raging Bull actor said. \\n\u201cIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has,\u201d he stated. \\n\u201cHe talks how he wants to punch people in the face? Well, I\\'d like to punch him in the face,\u201d De Niro said. \\nBut after the Republican presidential nominee was declared the 45th president-elect on Wednesday, De Niro clarified that he would no longer like to punch Trump because the man was elected to the highest seat in political office. \\nThe veteran actor, however, told Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night show on ABC News that he is \u201cnot feeling good\u201d after Trump\u2019s victory, which caused protests and student walkouts across the country. \\nProtesters on Wednesday slammed Trump\u2019s divisive campaign rhetoric against immigrants, refugees, Muslims and ethnic minorities. \\nDe Niro said he has to respect Trump because of his new position - which means no punching. \\n\u201cAre you still going to punch Donald Trump in the face?\u201d Kimmel asked the actor, \u201cbecause you could now get arrested for that, I think.\" \\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that now, he\u2019s the President,\u201d replied De Niro. \u201cAnd I have to respect that position, although we all know what he\u2026 We have to see what he\u2019s gonna do and how he\u2019s really gonna follow through on certain things. As we can see now in a lot of cities, a lot of people are getting very upset and protesting.\u201d \\nMany renowned figures, including some heads of states and other high-ranking officials, had publicly denounced Trump -- some even used abusive language against him -- in the run-up to the November 8 presidential election. But several of them have now softened their stance and some even sent messages of congratulations to the president-elect. Loading ...'"}, "time": 1742562421.3424685}
