They are now worried that her numbers will be bad when she joins the 9 am hour of Today,\u201d a source reportedly told Radar Online. \u201cIf Kelly tanks at 9 am she will also bring down Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb at 10 am. \u201d The debut of Kelly\u2019s Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, with its   Vladimir Putin interview, could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes. Her second show got clobbered as well. As Radar Online noted, Kelly\u2019s interview with Erin Andrews \u201cwas destroyed by 60 Minutes, which scored 7. 66 million total viewers. Kelly got a paltry 4. 35 million people to tune in to her program. \u201d Already in desperation mode, NBC is reportedly \u201cscrambling\u201d to land big \u201cgets\u201d like Kathy Griffin or Adrianna Grande because, according to the source, the network seems to have already determined that \u201cpeople are not tuning in to watch Megyn without huge guests. \u201d After reportedly being rejected multiple times, Kelly finally found a producer for her daily   morning show just last Friday. Veteran producer Jackie Levin agreed to produce the show, which is set to debut in September. NBC News reportedly had trouble locking down an executive producer for Kelly\u2019s daily   show for months. According to one television insider, though \u201cNBC and Megyn Kelly would like you to believe\u201d her show did not have an executive producer because \u201cthere are just so many great people lining up for the job,\u201d it was \u201cquite the opposite. \u201d According to the insider\u2019s source, Kelly and NBC had \u201capproached some big names and they have all said no. \u201d Kelly reportedly wanted Bill Geddie, Barbara Walters\u2019 longtime producer, to run her morning show. But he reportedly turned her down in addition to other top names because \u201cno one wants to take the gig and most of the blame if Kelly flops at NBC. \u201d NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack has reportedly been busy lowering expectations for Kelly to the network\u2019s affiliates. When news of NBC\u2019s hiring of Kelly broke, one executive reportedly said that \u201cthe degree of difficulty\u201d would be \u201cextremely high\u201d for Kelly and if she does not succeed, \u201cshe could end up fading into obscurity,\u201d especially since her trial run at Fox News for a   show was panned and got terrible ratings.'"}, "time": 1742628443.5813916}
