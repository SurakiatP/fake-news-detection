I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be there until at least 8 PM. Steve says he\u2019s hosted many groups there before, so the manager is fine with us not knowing how many people will join. That means you don\u2019t need to worry about there being enough room for everyone if we have the high class problem of really good turnout. \\nIn all the meetups, readers have really enjoyed getting to chat with other members of the community, so I\u2019m looking forward to another fun event. I am flying into Dallas that AM, so the only caveat is that if the Dallas or NY airports are reported to be having serious problems in the morning, you might double check the site for updates (although I think you should plan on meeting regardless even if I wind up being delayed). See you soon! 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Notices on'"}, "time": 1742562287.4681442}
