Fox News Just Exposed Hillary \u2019s ILLEGAL VOTING Scheme To The Entire Country! \\nHillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. \\nOnce again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1324, which makes it a felony to \u2018conceal\u2019 or \u2018harbor\u2019 any \u2018alien\u2019 \u2018including any means of transportation.\u2019 The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for \u201ccommercial advantage or private financial gain,\u201d could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti- Trump speech. \\nHillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented \u201cDreamers\u201d into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump \u2019s immigration plans could result in their deportation \u2013 though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. \\nClinton\u2019s national voter registration program, called \u201cMi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,\u201d was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. \\nThe 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee.
