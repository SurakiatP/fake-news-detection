This is just another instance of this. We need to ask other questions. Was he sending unsecured emails to HRC? He would need a different S/MIME certificate to send an encrypted email to HRC than the one for addresses because HRC wouldn't have the private key for the State Department certificate. So, we have to presume that he knew that he was sending unsecured emial to HRC. The location of the server is a Red Herring. It was somewhere in cyberspace. What matters is that it was that she was using a private email account that appeared to be unsecured. The fact that it was unsecured is the major point here. If it had been properly secured with digital cryptography, it wouldn't have really mattered if it was in her home at least as far as national securty was concerned.\""}, "time": 1742564150.452685}
