For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. \\nThe White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that \u2018Putin is hacking the US elections.\u2019 In response, the President is weighing his options \u2013 tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed \u2018malicious cyber-activity\u2019 tools. \\nEven VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,\u201dWe\u2019re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.\u201d \\nIt seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? \\nWhat was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America\u2019s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton\u2019s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington\u2019s new anti-Russia movement. \\nOn July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, \u201cThe Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton\u2019s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.\u201d \\nAnyone who was paying attention back then knew this \u2018Russian hack\u2019 talking point was purely political, but then again, who\u2019s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. \\nYou can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party\u2019s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump\u2019s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump\u2019s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, \u2018comparing one dictator to another.\u2019 \\nNever one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . \u201cIf you\u2019ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party\u2019s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?\u201d said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. \\nBacked by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia \u2013 not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona \u2013 a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media\u2019s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, \u201c Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,\u201d we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: \\n\u201cHackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.\u201d \\nBut then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: \\n\u201cThe bureau described the threat as \u201ccredible\u201d and significant, \u201can eight on a scale of one to 10,\u201d Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state\u2019s voter registration system for nearly a week.\u201d \\nAnd then, down to almost nothing\u2026 \\n\u201cIt turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.\u201d \\nAt no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, \u201cCyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.\u201d \\nAre American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: \u2018bottom of the bag\u2019) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories \u2013 in the middle a national election cycle? It\u2019s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. \\nBehind Clinton\u2019s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House\u2026 \\nOn October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager John Podesta \u2013 giving them to Wikileaks. \\nSoon, there was a queue of \u2018national security\u2019 politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, \u201cRussia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin\u2019s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, \\xadcyber and economic response.\u201d \\nAccording to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only \u2018evidence\u2019 that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged \u2018Russian government hacks\u2019\u2013 provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike\u2019s word for it. \\nIMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. \\nThe Post\u2019s Nakashima then added: \\n\u201cThe administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.\u201d \\nAn online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are \u201cconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,\u201d the joint statement said. \u201c\u2026 We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d \\nMoscow\u2019s press secretary\u2019s reply: \u201cThis is some sort of nonsense,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov. \\nDespite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN\u2019s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really \u201cconfirmed\u201d that Russia was behind the email hacks \u2013 and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. \\nLikewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that \u201cRussia did it,\u201d thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn\u2019t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona \u2013 are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a \u2018 parallel universe .\u2019 \\nStill, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how \u201c 17 US intelligence agencies \u201d aka the \u201cIntelligence Community\u201d\u2013 all agreed that Russia did it. \\nThe announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\n\u201cWe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cI find that deeply disturbing.\u201d \\nWhat\u2019s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton\u2019s \u201917 agencies\u2019: \\nAir Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\nWhat does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta\u2019s emails? Answer: nothing. \\nThe exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. \\nIn both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington\u2019s flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and \u201cjournalists\u201d working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN \u2013 none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party\u2019s decree that \u201cRussian is hacking the US election process.\u201d If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: \u201c\u2026 [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow \u2014 the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are \u2018hacking\u2019 US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a \u201c disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. \u201d \\nUnder partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into \u201cpeople linked to the Trump team with Russia.\u201d Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven\u2019t come up with anything. \\nTo be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack \u2013 because her staff read it to her from the campaign\u2019s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government\u2019s much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that\u2019s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam\u2019s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq\u2019s imaginary \u201cWinnebagos of Death\u201d aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. \\nFor those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as \u2018Washington Intelligence,\u2019 I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, \u201cNo, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We\u2019re not like that. No, this time it\u2019s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!\u201d \\nIn 2014, Obama claimed that Kim\u2019s notorious \u201cBureau 121\u201d hacked into Sony Pictures. \\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign \u2018hack\u2019 and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington\u2019s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called \u2018 Bureau 121 .\u2019 Just like with today\u2019s \u201cRussian Hack\u201d theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House\u2019s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the \u2018Russian Hack\u2019 claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . \\nJumping the Shark \\nAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. \\nSoon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to \u201cdestabilize and dominate the West.\u201d Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of \u2018interfering\u2019 with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia\u2019s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump\u2019s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 \\n\u2014 Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 \\nClinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only \u2018evidence\u2019 seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as \u2018proof\u2019 that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign\u2019s desperate claims. It was embarrassing. \\nThey could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. \\nEither way, the political strategy here is clear \u2013 to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video \u2013 their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. \\nTheir other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. \\nTo prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. \u201cFor the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,\u201d said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. \u201cI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year\u2019s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week\u2019s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,\u201d said Clinton. \\nThe party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. \\nParty Meltdown \\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s replacement didn\u2019t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches \u2013 showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives \u2013 straight to Hillary Clinton. \\n\u201c A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\u201d \\n\u201c A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.\u201d (Source: Daily Caller ) \\nBrazile\u2019s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party\u2019s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: \\n. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile\u2019s reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her \u2013 and that\u2019s saying a lot. \\nIn addition, it was also revealed how CNN\u2019s head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of \u2018journalists\u2019 the Clinton campaign would \u201cwork with\u201d to gain favorable coverage. You\u2019d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN\u2019s election coverage. \\nClearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN\\'s Gloria Borger refers to being in \"GOP hell\" and says she\\'ll \"reach out soon\" to Podesta.

Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: \\n\u201cSome investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn\u2019t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.\u201d \\nThere\u2019s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe \u2013 a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . \\nSo why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top \u2013 to the President himself. \\nWhat 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary\u2019s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton\u2019s server \u201cthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.\u201d The President\u2019s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: \\n\u201cObama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton\u2019s private email server.\u201d \\nSo, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails \u201coff grid\u201d with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server \u2013 maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. \\nSure, he\u2019s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club \u2013 caught out lying to the American people. \\nOn top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as \u201c born classified .\u201d The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. \\nCOVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) \\nIt should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action \u2013 that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. \\nOn Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case \u2013 currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a \u2018sexting\u2019 scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: \\n\u201cOh yes. Recall our post from last week, \u201c Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary\u2019s Benghazi Hearing \u201d in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton\u2019s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.\u201d \\nOh, and if that wasn\u2019t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta\u2019s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as \u2018best friends.\u2019 FOX News confirms: \\n\u201cFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,\u201d Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta\u2019s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. \\nTo call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. \\nRussia \u2013 The Party Scapegoat \\nFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: \u201cIronically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.\u201d Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. \\n\u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 \\nAnother veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused \u201cthe KGB\u201d working with Republicans to \u201chijack the election\u201d during his wild rant on MSNBC . \\n\u201cI think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That\u2019s what I think,\u201d said Carville. \\nMaybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. \\nThese are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos\u00e9s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence \u2013 unlike the \u2018Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.\u2019 \\nSuffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that \u2018Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.\u2019 They\u2019ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep \u2013 a perfect double entendre . \\nThe geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington\u2019s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown \u2013 that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed \u2018rebels\u2019 Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. \\nWith so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? \\nThe demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d\u2019etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it\u2019s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks \u2013 and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America\u2019s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , \u201cWe are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,\u201d He was forced to resign shortly after that. \\nWhat\u2019s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although \u2018 Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,\u2019 and \u2018 Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 \u2018 certainly comes to mind. \\nThat said, it\u2019s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of \u2018Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.\u2019 When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington\u2019s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election \\nOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: \\n\u201cWe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It\u2019s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.\u201d \\nSelf-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. \\nKnowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere \u2013 if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. \\nStill, we\u2019re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington \u2013 before it\u2019s too late. \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \\nFiled Under: Featured , Patrick Henningsen , Shout , US News Tagged With: CNN , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Donna Brazile , Gloria Borger , Hillary Clinton , Media Cog , Russia , wikileaks WillDippel \\nHere is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: \\nSometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory.
