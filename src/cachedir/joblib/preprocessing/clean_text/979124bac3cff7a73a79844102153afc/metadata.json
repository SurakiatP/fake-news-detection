Whenever the term \u201cNazi\u201d is used to describe a minority group, you know things are bad. Democrat donor and Hillary Clinton supporter Benjamin Barber was caught on hidden camera voicing his opinion on blacks who may vote Republican. The disturbing comments were recorded at a fundraiser for United States Senate Candidate Deborah Ross, of North Carolina. Barber said, \u201cHave you hear of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So black who are helping the other side are seriously f*cked in the head. They\u2019re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think \u2018if I help them we\u2019ll get along okay; somehow I\u2019ll save my race by working with the murderers.\u201d Barber was caught in this disgusting tirade on the Upper West Side of New York City after the fundraiser in September. Watch for yourself: \\nBesides being disturbing, these comments have racist undertones that are more far-reaching than they even seem at first. It is as if blacks do not have the ability to work and create a good life for themselves, so they are somehow obligated to support liberals and Democrats. \\nLyndon Johnson started pandering to the black vote decades ago, and ever since, the black community has suffered. Fatherless homes, unemployment, drugs, and crime problems have plagued black communities. These communities also contain good people, people who deserve better. \\nAll that having been said, comparing Black Republicans to Jews who killed other Jews while in Nazi captivity is just bizarre. It appears that this man is sincere when he speaks, as well! \\nWill this video make a difference in an already out of control Election? \\nThe hits just keep on rolling.
