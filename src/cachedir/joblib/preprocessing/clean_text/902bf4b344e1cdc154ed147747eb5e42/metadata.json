I can\u2019t tell you what that does to me as a writer to see a line [I wrote]. And what it means for the conversation, in this moment in history,\u201d Miranda told The Huffington Post on Thursday.  The     also said Trump\u2019s order is \u201cagainst the fundamental freedom of religion in our constitution. \u201d President Trump signed an executive order last week which suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days. The order prohibits the arrival of Syrian refugees into the United States and halted entry of citizens from failed state,   countries including Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Miranda, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, also pledged his support for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) a   agency Trump has promised to defund. \u201cThe importance of the NEA \u2015 I can not tell you how many studies and findings find that arts lift up every other score in education,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cWhen you learn music, you use both hemispheres of your brain. It helps you with the math and it helps you with the arts. It\u2019s so important that the arts have attention in our education. It certainly saved my life. I don\u2019t know where I would be without the amazing arts education I got at a public school. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be talking to you. So, we\u2019re going to have to fight to protect it. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742628598.6921232}
