The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after   Donald J. Trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai   after his election victory. Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwan\u2019s formal independence from China. Ms. Tsai, who is visiting Central America this week, made two calls to officials in Taiwan seeking updates on the Liaoning\u2019s transit, the Central News Agency reported, citing Alex Huang, the president\u2019s spokesman. China\u2019s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from Taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a show of force, and I think it is intended in part to intimidate, and that\u2019s worrisome from the U. S. and Taiwan\u2019s point of view because we don\u2019t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIf the Trump administration does see this as a test of U. S. resolve, I suspect they\u2019ll push back pretty forcefully. \u201d China sent the carrier, which had been conducting exercises in the South China Sea, into the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday morning. Taiwan\u2019s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity, after Japan and South Korea deployed fighters on Monday. Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate Japan and South Korea and over the Sea of Japan. Taiwan, considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory, has been governed separately since 1949, when the forces of the Nationalist leader Chiang   fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the Communists. China views any assertion of Taiwan\u2019s separateness from the mainland  \u2014   like Ms. Tsai\u2019s call with Mr. Trump  \u2014   as an affront to its claim of sovereignty. Since 1979, the United States has recognized the government in Beijing and broke off formal diplomatic ties to Taiwan as part of the One China policy. In the wake of the   call, China warned the incoming president against making changes to that policy after he takes office on Jan. 20. Liu Zhenmin, a Chinese vice foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the Taiwan Strait was an international waterway and that it was normal for the Liaoning to pass though it. The passage would not have any effect on   relations, he said in remarks carried in the Chinese news media. Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, told reporters in Washington in response to a question about the Liaoning\u2019s passage through the strait that the United States \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a problem\u201d with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law. It also was not the first time the Liaoning had sailed through the strait: It passed through in November 2013 on its way to the South China Sea after having been commissioned only the year before. In that instance, the carrier kept to the western half of the strait, closer to mainland China. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry said that the Liaoning was also staying to the west of the strait\u2019s middle and urged citizens to remain calm. A transit on the eastern side, closer to Taiwan, would be viewed as much more provocative. Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said that for the Chinese, traveling through the strait was a logical way to move from one area of fleet operations to another along its long coastline. In order for warships based in northern ports, like the Liaoning, to return home from southern waters, they must either pass close to Japanese islands or transit the Taiwan Strait. \u201cGeography forces a very binary choice,\u201d he said. Mr. Graham said it was important to see how the Liaoning conducted its passage. If it had aircraft on deck and was conducting flight operations, that would be seen as more provocative than if it passed through the strait with the aircraft in its hangar bay, he said. The Liaoning, commissioned in 2012 and built from a Soviet hull, is China\u2019s first aircraft carrier. In past decades, the United States has shown its resolve to defend Taiwan by sailing carriers through the Taiwan Strait. In 1995, the aircraft carrier Nimitz transited the strait amid heightened tensions after Beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters. China\u2019s military   is highly secretive, but it would seem inconceivable for the Liaoning to pass through such contested waters without approval from the president, Xi Jinping, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the military. And the Chinese military media has described the aircraft carrier as embodying Mr. Xi\u2019s plans for a stronger navy, capable of projecting force far beyond China\u2019s territorial waters. Last Thursday, the front page of People\u2019s Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, featured a report about the aircraft carrier\u2019s latest journey under the headline, \u201cWe\u2019re sailing under the leader\u2019s attentive gaze,\u201d a clear tribute to Mr. Xi. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the Liaoning\u2019s passage was part of the ship\u2019s scheduled training in the western Pacific, which had begun on Dec. 24. Mr. Ma also said that the   relationship in the coming year would face \u201cincreasing uncertainty, looming risks and challenges. \u201d He added that Taiwan\u2019s government and \u201cindependence forces\u201d there had \u201cseriously threatened the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,\u201d accusing them of engaging in separatist activities and warning that China would \u201cresolutely safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. \u201d The aircraft carrier\u2019s passage was part of a cluster of recent acts by the Chinese military that have raised hackles in the region. Last month, a Chinese warship seized an underwater drone belonging to the United States Navy about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The drone was returned after the Obama administration publicly chided China over the seizure. On Monday, Japan said it had sent fighter jets into the air after Chinese bombers and surveillance planes flew over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. \u201cWhen China was militarily weaker, Japan considered that area to be its backyard,\u201d said Ni Lexiong, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. \u201cThis was a way of telling Japan that if there ever is conflict, the location of any future battle space won\u2019t be decided by you and America. We have the initiative. So Japan, don\u2019t think of meddling further afield in Taiwan or the South China Sea. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561636.2436202}
