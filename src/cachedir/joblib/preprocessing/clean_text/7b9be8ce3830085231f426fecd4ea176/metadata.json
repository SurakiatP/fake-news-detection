Asked his views on the role of carbon dioxide, the   gas produced by burning fossil fuels, in increasing global warming, Mr. Pruitt said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d that \u201cI think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. \u201d \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis. \u201d Mr. Pruitt\u2019s statement contradicts decades of research and analysis by international scientific institutions and federal agencies, including the E. P. A. His remarks on Thursday, which were more categorical than similar testimony before the Senate, may also put him in conflict with laws and regulations that the E. P. A. is charged with enforcing. His statements appear to signal that the Trump administration intends not only to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies, but also to wage a vigorous attack on their underlying legal and scientific basis. A report in 2013 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of about 2, 000 international scientists that reviews and summarizes climate science, found it to be \u201cextremely likely\u201d that more than half the global warming that occurred from 1951 to 2010 was a consequence of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A January report by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded, \u201cThe planet\u2019s average surface temperature has risen about 2. 0 degrees Fahrenheit (1. 1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other   emissions into the atmosphere. \u201d Benjamin D. Santer, a climate researcher at the Energy Department\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said, \u201cMr. Pruitt has claimed that carbon dioxide caused by human activity is not \u2018the primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\u2019 Mr. Pruitt is wrong. \u201d \u201cThe scientific community has studied this issue for decades,\u201d Dr. Santer added. \u201cThe consensus message from many national and international assessments of the science is pretty simple: Natural factors can\u2019t explain the size or patterns of observed warming. A large human influence on global climate is the best explanation for the warming we\u2019ve measured and monitored. \u201d The basic science showing that carbon dioxide traps heat at the Earth\u2019s surface dates to the 19th century, and has been confirmed in many thousands of experiments and observations since. Mr. Pruitt has faced frequent criticism for his close ties to fossil fuel companies. In his previous job as the attorney general of Oklahoma, he sought to use legal tools to fight environmental regulations on the oil and gas companies that are a major part of the state\u2019s economy. A 2014 investigation by The New York Times found that energy lobbyists had drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and even Mr. Obama, outlining the economic hardship caused by the environmental rules. But in a sign of how far outside mainstream views Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks on Thursday have placed him, even executives of some of the nation\u2019s largest fossil fuel producers said they were surprised by his comments. Interviewed at CERAweek, an annual conference of major energy producers this week in Houston, Wael Sawan, an executive vice president at Shell Energy Resources, said he was \u201cabsolutely convinced CO2 can cause serious damage to not only this generation but future generations. \u201d Mr. Pruitt spoke at the Houston energy conference on Thursday afternoon in a session moderated by Daniel Yergin, a prominent energy economist and a member of a White House advisory panel. Mr. Yergin did not ask Mr. Pruitt any questions about his remarks from Thursday morning, saying later that he had been unaware of the comments when interviewing him. Mr. Pruitt did not clarify his comments or respond to reporters who sought to question him. He said at the energy conference that the Obama administration had gone too far with some environmental rules and that he intended to work more closely with industry and individual states to address pollution issues. \u201cThe future ain\u2019t what it used to be at the E. P. A. ,\u201d he said. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks come as the Trump administration prepares to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s two signature policies to address global warming: a pair of sweeping regulations intended to curb carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and power plant smokestacks. At the same time, the White House is considering a 17 percent cut to the budget of NOAA, one of the nation\u2019s premier agencies of climate science research, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks on Thursday were consistent with his past public statements questioning the established science of   climate change, but in denying the role played by carbon dioxide, they go a step further. In addition to putting him at odds with the consensus of climate scientists, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks also raise the possibility that, as the Trump administration moves forward with unwinding Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, it could put the administration in violation of federal law. In 2009, the E. P. A. released a legal opinion known as an endangerment finding concluding that, because of its contribution to global warming, carbon dioxide in large amounts met the Clean Air Act\u2019s definition of a pollutant that harms human health. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, one of the nation\u2019s most powerful environmental laws, all such pollutants must be regulated by the E. P. A. A federal court upheld the finding, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to it. Thus the E. P. A. remains obligated to regulate carbon dioxide. In his Senate hearing, Mr. Pruitt said that as administrator of the E. P. A. he would not revisit that 2009 legal finding. \u201cIt is there, and it needs to be enforced and respected,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. But energy lobbyists close to the Trump administration have since urged the new administration to consider building a legal case against the endangerment finding. Advisers to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team said they read Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks as a signal that he intends to do just that. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign commitment was to undo President Obama\u2019s entire climate edifice,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s E. P. A. transition team but has no role in policy making. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking through the whole thing, and based on what Scott Pruitt said this morning, I do think they are looking at reopening the endangerment finding. \u201d Mr. Trump is expected to announce an executive order next week directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding the climate change regulations on emissions from power plants.'"}, "time": 1742561907.3988702}
