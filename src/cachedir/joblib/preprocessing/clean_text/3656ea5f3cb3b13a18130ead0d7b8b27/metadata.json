Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive Oval Office interview that the \u201cintent\u201d of the New York Times in its negative coverage of him is \u201cso evil and so bad\u201d and that \u201cthey write lies. \u201d[\u201cIf you read the New York Times, if you read the New York Times, it\u2019s \u2014  the intent is so evil and so bad,\u201d President Trump said in the interview on Monday afternoon. \u201cThe stories are wrong in many cases, but it\u2019s the overall intent. Look at that paper over the last two years. In fact, they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong. \u201d  He went on to say about the newspaper that \u201cthey write lies. \u201d Trump\u2019s comments came in a discussion about the media generally, in a part of the exclusive Oval Office interview focused on \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cfake media\u201d versus journalists who are trying to get it right. The president specifically praised this reporter, and Steve Holland of Reuters, as two examples of journalists who do try to accurately report the news \u2014  and made a distinction between \u201cfake\u201d media and the media as a whole. Trump said that the \u201cfake\u201d media has made a concerted effort to conflate his distinction between \u201cfake media\u201d and the media generally, and that \u201cthere\u2019s a difference\u201d between the two. He said that his comments about the \u201copposition party\u201d and the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d were specifically about the \u201cfake media,\u201d not the media as a whole. This is a point that the president made in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU) last Friday in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, D. C. Hope Hicks, the director of Strategic Communications at the White House, joined in part of the conversation with the president. The president also specifically singled out the New York Times for one embarrassing and egregious error the newspaper made during the course of the campaign, when it posted an article \u2014  and printed it on the front page \u2014  containing allegations from several women against him. The piece, by Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey, was actually challenged by women quoted therein, prompting even the vehemently   CNN to question the authenticity of the Times\u2019 reporting, with CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan saying the piece was \u201cconcerning\u201d to her \u201cas a journalist. \u201d President Trump also declined to comment specifically on the looming   Warner potential merger, a deal that would boost CNN\u2019s parent company significantly, but did say generally speaking he believes there should be \u201ccompetition in the marketplace\u201d \u2014   especially in the media industry. Read a full transcript of this section of President Trump\u2019s interview with Breitbart News, including the section with Hicks: BREITBART NEWS NETWORK (BNN): \u201cThe big thing I kind of wanted to zone in on right off the bat is \u2018the opposition party,\u2019 the media \u2014  \u201c PRESIDENT TRUMP (POTUS): \u201cWell, it\u2019s not the media. It\u2019s the fake media. \u201d BNN: \u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to \u2014  \u201c POTUS: \u201cThere\u2019s a difference. The fake media is the opposition party. The fake media is the enemy of the American people. There\u2019s tremendous fake media out there. Tremendous fake stories. The problem is the people that aren\u2019t involved in the story don\u2019t know that. \u201d HOPE HICKS: \u201cJust the fact that they didn\u2019t report that accurately proves your point. \u201d POTUS: \u201cWhich accurately?\u201d HICKS: \u201cThey said \u2018Oh Donald Trump said the press is the enemy of the American people. \u2019\u201d POTUS: \u201cRight. They take \u2018fake\u2019 media off. They say \u2018the media is the enemy of \u2014  well, they didn\u2019t say the \u2018fake media.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say the media is the enemy \u2014  I said the \u2018fake media.\u2019 They take the word fake out and all of a sudden it\u2019s like I\u2019m against \u2014  there are some great reporters like you. I know some great honorable reporters who do a great job like Steve [Holland] from Reuters, others, many others. I wasn\u2019t talking about that. I was talking about the fake media, where they make up everything there is to make up. \u201d BNN: \u201cRight and that\u2019s what I wanted to zone in on with you because I know you made that very clear in your CPAC speech. Can you kind of more clearly define what standards and quality we should expect from those who are doing reporting?\u201d POTUS: \u201cIt\u2019s intent. It\u2019s also intent. If you read the New York Times, if you read the New York Times, it\u2019s \u2014  the intent is so evil and so bad. The stories are wrong in many cases, but it\u2019s the overall intent. Look at that paper over the last two years. In fact, they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong. They did a front page article on women talking about me, and the women went absolutely wild because they said that was not what they said. It was a big   article, and the Times wouldn\u2019t even apologize and yet they were wrong. You probably saw the women. They went on television shows and everything. \u201d BNN: \u201cYes, it was pretty embarrassing for the Times. \u201d POTUS: \u201c[They said] \u2018we really like Donald Trump and he [the Times reporter] totally misrepresented us. He said he was going to say good and it was absolutely bad.\u2019 This was a front page article, almost the entire top half of the New York Times, and it was false. It was false. Did they apologize? No. I call them the failing New York Times and they write lies. They write lies. Nobody would know that. For instance, when people read the story on the women \u2014  first of all, the reporter who wrote the story has a website full of hatred of Donald Trump. So, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be a reporter because he\u2019s not objective. It\u2019s not all, but it has many negative things about Donald Trump. But he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to write on Donald Trump. And, he writes that story. But that\u2019s one of many. So, when you read the Sunday New York Times, it\u2019s just hit after hit after hit. And honestly, I think people are wise to it because if you look at the approval rating, you see it\u2019s down. You know, it\u2019s gone. There\u2019s very little approval. \u201d BNN: \u201cNow, during the campaign, one of the things you and a lot of your campaign guys like Peter Navarro talked about was breaking up some of these oligopolies in the media. If you look at the media, part of the problem seems to be that a vast majority of the media companies are owned by just a handful of different companies. Obviously, there\u2019s a looming merger between ATT and Time Warner. I wanted to see what your thoughts are on that and if CNN\u2019s pretty bad behavior over the course of \u2014  they really don\u2019t seem to be making an effort to get it right \u2014  does that give you hesitation in terms of approval of the deal?\u201d POTUS: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on any specific deal, but I do believe there has to be competition in the marketplace and maybe even more so with the media because it would be awfully bad after years if we ended up having one voice out there. You have to have competition in the marketplace and you have to have competition among the media. And I\u2019m not commenting on any one deal, but you need competition generally and you certainly need it with media. \u201d Specifically, this part of the interview came in the wake of the president\u2019s CPAC speech, in which he delineated the difference between fake news and real news. At CPAC on this topic, Trump said:  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It\u2019s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make \u2019em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, \u201cNine people have confirmed. \u201d There\u2019re no nine people. I don\u2019t believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said, \u201cGive me a break. \u201d Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people. But they say, \u201cNine people. \u201d And somebody reads it and they think, \u201cOh, nine people. They have nine sources. \u201d They make up sources. They\u2019re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word \u201cfake. \u201d And all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy.  They take the word \u201cfake\u201d out. And now I\u2019m saying, \u201cOh, no, this is no good. \u201d But that\u2019s the way they are. So I\u2019m not against the media, I\u2019m not against the press. I don\u2019t mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don\u2019t get \u2014  I don\u2019t get too many of them. But I am only against the fake news, media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word. I\u2019m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\u2019s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. \u201cA source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being. \u201d Let \u2019em say it to my face. Let there be no more sources. And remember this  \u2014   and in not  \u2014   in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story. There are some great reporters around. They\u2019re talented, they\u2019re honest as the day is long. They\u2019re great. But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people.  And they shouldn\u2019t use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you\u2019ve never seen before. So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story  \u2014   and I put myself in your position sometimes. Because many of you, you\u2019re not part of the story. And if you\u2019re not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know  \u2014   if you are part of the story, you know what they\u2019re saying is true or not. This is the second part of President Trump\u2019s exclusive interview with Breitbart News in the Oval Office on Monday. The first focused on the epic fail at the Academy Awards in Hollywood on Sunday night. More pieces from President Trump\u2019s exclusive interview, including details about his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress and key matters such as immigration, health care, taxes, trade, and national security are forthcoming.'"}, "time": 1742564222.7582026}
