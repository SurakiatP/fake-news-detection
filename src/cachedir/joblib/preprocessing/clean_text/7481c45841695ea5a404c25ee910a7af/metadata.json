[In an interview with Mercury News, Guilfoyle said: \u201cI\u2019m a patriot and it would be an honor to serve the country. I think it\u2019d be a fascinating job. It\u2019s a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position. \u201d  Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that President Trump was considering Guilfoyle as a replacement for Spicer, whose time as press secretary has been marked by a number of gaffes and mistakes. An anonymously sourced report by ABC News also alleges that Trump is furious with his communications team over recent media narratives and could fire both Spicer and his communications director Mike Dubke. Guilfoyle, 48, is the former first lady of San Fransisco, having been married to former city\u2019s former mayor Gavin Newsom and served as its deputy district attorney from 2004 until 2006. She currently works as a   on talk show The Five on the Fox News channel. \u201cI think I have a very good relationship with the president. I think I enjoy a very straightforward and authentic, very genuine relationship, one that\u2019s built on trust and integrity, and I think that\u2019s imperative for success in that position,\u201d Guilfoyle added. \u201cSean Spicer is a very nice man and a patriot. He\u2019s dedicated himself to this public service. Very tough position he\u2019s in. I wish him the best and I know he puts a lot of effort into it. \u201d Responding to the rumors, a Fox News spokesperson said: \u201cKimberly is a valued member of the FOX News primetime lineup, and is under a   contract with the network. \u201d Meanwhile, Guilfoyle said through a spokesperson: \u201cAs I stated in the interview, I really love what I do and my job   The Five is tough to beat. \u201d You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742561667.8457294}
