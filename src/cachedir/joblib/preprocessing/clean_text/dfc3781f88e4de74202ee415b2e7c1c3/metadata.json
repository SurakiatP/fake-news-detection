Relief organizations just over the border in Turkey said the loss of life was extensive, rising as high as 36 plus more than a dozen other children in a life-threatening conditions. \\nThe Syrian rebel government, which controls the area of Idlib province and is attempting to oust Assad, had been administering the program with international support. They have since announced the immunization project has been stopped. \\nParents accused rebel government health authorities of failing to store the vaccines properly, and of supplying out-of-date medication. But opposition officials denied accusations of negligence, saying that the vaccines came from Unicef and WHO, and that the same batch had successfully vaccinated 60,000 schoolchildren in 30 locations in recent days. \u201cIt\u2019s very bad. The figures of dead we are getting go into the 30s. Children are dying very quickly,\u201d said Daher Zidan, the coordinator of the medical charity, Uossm. \u201cWe think it will get worse.\u201d \\nBut the rebel government are blaming the Assad government. \u201c Primary investigations point to a limited security breach by vandals likely connected to the regime, which has been attempting to target the medical sector in Free Syria in order to spread chaos, \u201d the rebel ministry said in a statement. \\nThe WHO said it was urgently checking the reports and could not confirm the toll. Other well-followed Syrian monitoring groups said there had been deaths. \\n\u201c At least 36 children have died and 50 others are suffering from poisoning or allergic reactions after measles vaccinations in Jirjanaz, in Idlib province ,\u201d the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.'"}, "time": 1742628474.2379527}
