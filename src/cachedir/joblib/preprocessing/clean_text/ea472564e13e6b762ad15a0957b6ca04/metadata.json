Here are five productions this month that will take about a \u201cHomeland\u201d episode of your time, with room enough for dinner  \u2014   or a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d binge  \u2014   afterward. Running time 1 hour I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m way too busy to spend more than an hour a day contemplating my own death. That\u2019s where this show fits in nicely. Written by the Pulitzer   playwright Will Eno, \u201cWakey, Wakey\u201d stars Michael Emerson as a man in a wheelchair who reflects on his life knowing that death is around the corner. There are existential echoes of Beckett and Albee in this contemplative work that\u2019s part TED talk, part show and tell. Our critic praised it as a \u201cglowingly dark, profoundly moving new play. \u201d [Read the review]  At the Pershing Square Signature Center, through March 26  Running time 1 hour 10 minutes Yeah, yeah, yeah: You want to see \u201cHamilton. \u201d But you don\u2019t have A) the time, B) the connections or C) the tickets. This    \u201cHamilton\u201d parody, from Gerard Alessandrini, the creator of the   \u201cForbidden Broadway,\u201d is the next best thing. (O. K. maybe more like the next available thing.) If the lyric \u201cIn New York, you can be a real ham\u201d sounds like a sidesplitter, this one\u2019s for you. (If not, stay far away.) Our critic called it a \u201csmart, silly and often convulsively funny thesis, performed by a   cast that is fluent in many tongues. \u201d At Stage 72, the Triad, through May 14 spamilton. com Running time 1 hour Marin Ireland, of Amazon\u2019s \u201cSneaky Pete,\u201d stars in Mart\u00edn Zimmerman\u2019s drama about a university professor whose child is killed. Inspired by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings of 2012, it\u2019s a solo show on a bare stage, with a story that takes a surprising direction. The play \u201capproaches the subject of American gun violence from a startlingly original perspective,\u201d according to our critic.

Based on Oliver Jeffers\u2019s book of the same title, \u201cThe Way Back Home\u201d is about an adventurous boy who makes an unexpected landing on the moon and has to summon the courage to find his way home. Told with puppets, it\u2019s a great way to introduce children as young as 3 to the visual treats of the theater. And tired parents can do it in less time than it might take to put their kids to bed. At the New Victory Theater, March   Running time 1 hour 20 minutes Ok, so the reviews for David Mamet\u2019s new play weren\u2019t great. \u201cCynical and morose\u201d is how our critic put it. But if you\u2019ve never seen the dark work of this provocative American playwright (\u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d) now\u2019s your chance. This one\u2019s about a psychiatrist who refuses to testify on behalf of a gay client accused of a horrific crime. If you don\u2019t like it, soothe yourself with a killer cupcake from Billy\u2019s Bakery around the corner from the theater. At the Atlantic Theater through March 26'"}, "time": 1742563660.7364686}
