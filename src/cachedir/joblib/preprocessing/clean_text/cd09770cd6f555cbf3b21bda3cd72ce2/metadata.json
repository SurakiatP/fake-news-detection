[While the court ultimately backtracked on Wednesday\u2019s ruling calling for legislators to be stripped of immunity and fully granting itself lawmaking authority, the judiciary has not restored the National Assembly\u2019s powers, nor has it rescinded its demand that three opposition legislators be stripped of their powers due to socialist accusations of \u201cfraud. \u201d  Venezuelans protested Wednesday\u2019s ruling every day for the past week, with the most violent protests occurring in Caracas, many before the judiciary themselves.   reports that, on Friday, the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) \u201cfired buckshot and swung batons\u201d at unarmed protesters in front of the Supreme Court. The GNB fighters remained in riot gear during the protests and shoved protesters.

GNB officers corralled Elyangelica Gonz\u00e1lez, a reporter for Univisi\u00f3n and Caracol News, dragging her by the feet and hair away from the Supreme Court. Video circulated on social media of the attack, and Gonz\u00e1lez shared it on her own Instagram account.  Hoy quiero darle gracias infinitas a ese angel que captur\u00f3 el momento preciso en que \u00e9sto estaba pasando. Tuviste la valent\u00eda de grabar despu\u00e9s de ver c\u00f3mo me dieron patadas y me tumbaron, por eso tu video comienza conmigo en el piso, ya golpeada y sin tel\u00e9fonos. Gracias en nombre de todos los periodistas, a ti y a todos quienes me han escrito, me han llamado, y me dan su solidaridad.  S\u00ed, \u00e9sta soy yo. Confieso que al ver ese video llor\u00e9 mucho, a\u00fan me siento triste despu\u00e9s de varias horas. Me duele todo el cuerpo y m\u00e1s el alma, jam\u00e1s pens\u00e9 que esto me podr\u00eda pasar.  \u00c9sta soy yo, pero eso no es mi pa\u00eds, eso no somos nosotros, ese odio, esa violencia, esa sa\u00f1a no dice quienes somos.  \u00c9sta soy yo, pero soy tambi\u00e9n todos los periodistas de mi pa\u00eds que salimos a diario a buscar las historias impostergables, las urgentes, las que todos deben conocer.  \u00c9sta soy yo, una mujer, madre, esposa, hija, hermana y afortunadamente periodista enamorada de lo que hace porque creo firmemente en nuestro poder de construir y ayudar.  \u00c9sta soy yo, luchando por mi derecho a informar, con las \u00fanicas armas que tengo, mi tel\u00e9fono, mi micr\u00f3fono, mi libreta, mi grabador y mi voz.  La \u00fanica manera de que evitar que hable es que me arranquen las cuerdas vocales. #SOYPERIODISTANODELINCUENTE, A post shared by Elyangelica Gonzalez (@elyangelicanews) on Apr 1, 2017 at 2:32pm PDT,  Gonz\u00e1lez wrote to the unidentified person who recorded the incident: \u201cthank you to the angel who captured this moment  \u2026     on behalf of all journalists. \u201d She later accused the GNB before reporters of attacking her for being present as they used rubber bullets to shoot at unarmed protesters and keep them away from the building.   members of the opposition also accused the socialist government of dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of intimidating them into silence. Henry Ramos Allup, the former head of the opposition in the National Assembly, accused unidentified Secret Police (Sebin) officers of following him on a highway on Saturday, apparently waiting to arrest him. Ramos Allup wrote on Twitter, \u201c[The officers] attempted to apprehend me in an abusive manner and told me I did not have parliamentary immunity. \u201d As in Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s case, Ramos Allup thanked citizens who recorded the incident on their phones, using the publicity to prevent his arrest. @verdadesofenden @hramosallup Venezuela\u2019s President of Congress @hramosallup followed by a Police Car without a registration plate.

On Saturday, the Supreme Court clarified this in a statement that some are reporting as the undoing of the usurpation of legislative power. The court, the statement read, \u201chas not stripped the Parliament of its functions, just as it has not dissolved or annulled it, and recognizes legislative immunity as a guarantee of the legislative functions with the limits prescribed by the Constitution. \u201d This statement differed from its original ruling: \u201cWhile the contempt scenario persists and the National Assembly remains invalid, this institution will guarantee that the parliamentary duties be executed directly by this institution or whatever institution it wishes. \u201d It, nonetheless, insisted that these guarantees would not be in place until the National Assembly \u201creassumed the legal, valid, and legitimate exercise of its constitutional powers by abiding by the judiciary\u2019s decisions. \u201d The Supreme Court had already rendered the National Assembly void in January 2016, following the opposition\u2019s electoral victory a month earlier, claiming that three opposition legislators had acquired their positions through fraud, according to Maduro. Until those three legislators were removed, the National Assembly\u2019s laws would all die at the feet of the Supreme Court. The National Assembly, which argues there is no evidence for the claims of fraud, has considered the reworked Supreme Court ruling an insufficient correction of its original claims, noting that their refusal to accept the fraud claims still denies them their authority. On Sunday, the legislature\u2019s Vice President Freddy Guevara issued a statement calling for more protests against the socialist government. \u201cThe destruction of separation of powers concluded when the Supreme Court attempted to strip the Assembly of its powers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s intention now is to demobilize the people in their just demands and stop the pressure from the international community. \u201d \u201cThis is just beginning,\u201d he promised. \u201cThe struggle for freedom will not cease until the constitutional order is restored. \u201d Julio Borges, the president of the National Assembly, gave a statement Sunday insisting that the modified ruling changed little. \u201cNothing has changed, the coup continues,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Venezuela, there is no separation of powers, no democracy, no justice. \u201d On the Thursday following the passage of the ruling, Borges stood on the steps of the Supreme Court and tore up a copy of the ruling. \u201cThis is garbage,\u201d he told reporters. Another opposition legislator, Richard Blanco, demanded on Monday the arrest of the Supreme Court\u2019s justices. \u201cThese gentlemen should be behind bars to fulfill their duty to the people, who are currently wounded by this constitutional violation. \u201d The official position of the legislative opposition is that the justices should step down, not be arrested. On Monday, 51 Venezuelan NGOs issued a joint letter supporting that demand and calling for the \u201cimmediate resignation\u201d of the justices.  '"}, "time": 1742561831.1932094}
