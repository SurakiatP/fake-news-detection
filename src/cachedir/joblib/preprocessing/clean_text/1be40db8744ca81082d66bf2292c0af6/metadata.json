Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube \\nAppearing on Wednesday's episode of \u201cThe Doctors,\u201d Lattanzi revealed that she had implants and plastic surgery when she was younger because she suffered from body dysmorphia . \\nBody dysmorphia is a disorder which makes people obsess over parts of their body. \\nPeople with the disorder imagine their bodies to be severely flawed, to the point that it makes it difficult for them to function normally. \\nLattanzi spoke about her particular experience with the disorder as a teenager, and the anorexia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression that accompanied it: \\n\u201cI went through this sort of chubby phase [as a kid]- I ate to comfort myself. I would see comments in magazines about how I was chubby. So around 16 I started to restrict food, exercise more.\u201d Image Credit: Chris Weeks/Getty Images \\nOver one summer in particular, Lattanzi lost a lot of weight, but her new thinness brought with it problems, too. \\nShe said she turned to plastic surgery and implants: \\n\u201cWhen I was in the height of my body dysmorphia, I had a whole bunch of fillers. I\u2019ve had that all removed from my face because I like the way I look naturally.\u201d \\nRecently, Lattanzi saw some photographs of herself as a teenager and doesn't understand why she thought her appearance was so defective. Image Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images \\nShe says she's never shown the pictures to anyone before, but that they're a valuable tool for providing context to the mental illness from which she was suffering. \\nNow, having recovered from body dysmorphia and anorexia, the 30-year-old says she regrets making so many changes to her appearance: \\n\u201cI look back at myself and I as a teenager and I\u2019m like, 'What a beautiful young woman.' What was I thinking? Why was I so insecure?\u201d Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube \\nLattanzi feels that social media's focus on appearance is a major culprit when it comes to young women struggling with negative self-image: \\n\u201cI think so many young girls are going through body dysmorphia \u2014 we\u2019re constantly told how we\u2019re supposed to look via Instagram and filters. There\u2019s constant pressure for us to look perfect.\u201d \\nNow, Lattanzi says she's \u201cstable and in a loving relationship,\u201d but she's still plagued by some anxiety. \\nShe says the memory of her illness is a wound that may never completely heal. Image Credit: David Livingston/Getty Images \\nBody dysmorphia affects about 1.7% to 2.4% of the general population\u2014or one in 50 people. \\nIt is often accompanied by eating disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. \\nSurprisingly, according to some studies, cases of body dysmorphia are more often found in men than women.\""}, "time": 1742561903.60336}
