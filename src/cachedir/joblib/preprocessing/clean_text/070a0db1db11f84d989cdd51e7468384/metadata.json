[Stranahan brought up the outrageous allegation by a   blogger that Gorka was a Nazi sympathizer, based on a medal he was seen wearing. The false story was eagerly repeated, without the slightest bit of   by Chelsea Clinton and the Southern Poverty Law Center, among others.  \u201cMy parents escaped Communist Hungary in 1956,\u201d Gorka recalled. \u201cMy father actually escaped from a prison, a Communist prison, because he was an   and he had been betrayed and given a life sentence at the age of 20. In exile, he was awarded a medal  \u2014   it\u2019s the Order of the Vitez  \u2014   for his resistance to dictatorship in Hungary. \u201d  \u201cThat Order, for some people, because it is associated with the regent, Admiral Horthy, they think that makes my father, who escaped from a Communist prison, a fascist, and, therefore, \u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s never about policies, Lee. It\u2019s always about attacking the individual,\u201d Gorka told Stranahan. \u201cMy father was tortured in the basement of what used to be the Nazi secret police headquarters, at the age of twenty. He was tortured by Communists who, just a few years before, had been members of the Arrow Cross. That\u2019s the irony of central Europe. A lot of fascists became Communists. \u201d \u201cRemember, on the radical Left, facts are optional. I am on TV. I\u2019ve been a vocal supporter of President Trump during the campaign. They have to attack me. It\u2019s about Steve Bannon. It\u2019s about Jared Kushner. It\u2019s about General Mike Flynn. It\u2019s not about the policies. It\u2019s not about the substance. It\u2019s about ad hominem attacks. If you want to be effective, it\u2019s about triangulation and isolation. That\u2019s all it is, Lee. You know it better than anybody,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cThe irony is, the first person who wrote this article about me was allegedly fired from his last employer for     attitudes,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality. You read my book, Defeating Jihad. It\u2019s about how Israel is our closest ally. Not only that, I have said, for me, groups like ISIS and   are the new fascists. The linkage between groups that burn people alive, that behead people because they have the wrong passport, the linkage between them and the Communist and the fascists is the same. They\u2019re all totalitarians. One of them may have worshiped Karl Marx. The other may have worshiped the Aryan purity and Mein Kampf. These people are totalitarians, as well, groups like ISIS. They\u2019re just doing it in the name of their version of Islam. \u201d Gorka agreed with Stranahan that attacks on Trump administration officials like himself are actually attacks on his \u201caudience. \u201d \u201cIt has to have that broader connection. Why? Because what I\u2019ve seen in the last     weeks of us being in office is all we have is a majority of the media reporting reflects one thing, Lee: they cannot believe, refuse to believe, what happened on November the 8th. The American people spoke. The \u2018forgotten man\u2019 was given a voice. And they can\u2019t stand it, Lee. \u201d  \u201cAs a result, what President Trump stands for must be attacked day in and day out. It\u2019s not about policies. Remember, we never talk about Russia policy. It\u2019s about who bugged Mike Flynn, and what he said to the vice president. It\u2019s never about policy. It\u2019s never about ISIS. It\u2019s the classic attack, Lee: \u2018When did you stop beating your wife?\u2019 Remember? That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Dr. Gorka recorded a longer version of his father\u2019s story in a video interview with Stranahan. See it here.
