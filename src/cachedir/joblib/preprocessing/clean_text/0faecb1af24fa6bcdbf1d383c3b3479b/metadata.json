Woods owns 14 majors and is second to The Golden Bear on the   major winners\u2019 list. Moreover, with the field of impressive and fit young talent on the PGA tour, the question becomes whether a \u201cgood\u201d Tiger can ever walk off the 18th hole on a Sunday afternoon resting alone at the top of the leaderboard.   A back spasm last week at the Dubai Desert Classic forced Woods to pull himself from the tournament after stumbling to a    77 in the first round. The    who once dominated the sport and ranked #1 in the world for over a decade, now must lower the expectations bar as he faces the reality of a failing body. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be a little bit sore. As long as I can function, I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d Tiger spoke. \u201cIt was a tough, tough road,\u201d the beleaguered golf icon told CNN when referring to his protracted   layoff to recover from his last two back surgeries. \u201cThere was a lot of dark times where I couldn\u2019t get out of bed, couldn\u2019t move, the pain was too great.  \u201cAnyone who\u2019s ever had nerve pain in their back, they certainly understand what that feels like. I honestly didn\u2019t know this time last year, I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever play golf again. Just because of the fact that it\u2019s nerve pain. \u201d Woods started his comeback in December playing at his own tournament, the Hero World Challenge, where he showed some glimpses of his old self. He fired a 65 on his Friday round and led the field with most birdies over the   tournament, despite finishing 15th in a field of 18.  Woods teed it up for his first   tournament since his layoff, the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, two weeks ago. That ended poorly for the winner of 79 PGA tournaments, as he failed to make the cut to play on the weekend. The positive takeaway, however, was he felt strong and swung well. Unfortunately, the flat stick failed him during his Thursday and Friday rounds, where he misread greens and lipped out several putts. Woods previously won at Torrey Pines 8 times, including the US Open in 2008. Friday Woods announced on his own website \u201cthat due to ongoing back spasms, similar to what he experienced in Dubai, he will be unable to compete in the Genesis Open and The Honda Classic. \u201d  \u201cMy doctors have advised me not to play the next two weeks, to continue my treatment and to let my back calm down,\u201d Woods explains. \u201cThis is not what I was hoping for or expecting. I am extremely disappointed to miss the Genesis Open, a tournament that benefits my foundation, and The Honda Classic, my hometown event. I would like to thank Genesis for their support, and I know we will have an outstanding week. \u201d Tiger was scheduled to play both of those tournaments as key stepping stones to sharpening his game for his return to the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club in April. Woods\u2019 chance to add another major victory to his distinguished career appears to be fading away once again.'"}, "time": 1742564487.947018}
