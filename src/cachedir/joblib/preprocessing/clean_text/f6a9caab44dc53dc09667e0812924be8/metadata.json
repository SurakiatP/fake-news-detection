Trump and furious lobbying by Israel, the Obama administration on Friday allowed the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction. The administration\u2019s decision not to veto the measure reflected its accumulated frustration over Israeli settlements. The American abstention on the vote also broke a longstanding policy of shielding Israel from action at the United Nations that described the settlements as illegal. While the resolution is not expected to have any practical impact on the ground, it is regarded as a major rebuff to Israel, one that could increase its isolation over the paralyzed peace process with Israel\u2019s Palestinian neighbors, who have sought to establish their own state on territory held by Israel. Applause broke out in the   Security Council\u2019s chambers after the vote on the measure, which passed 14 to 0, with the United States ambassador, Samantha Power, raising her hand as the lone abstention. Israel\u2019s ambassador, Danny Danon, denounced the measure, and castigated the council members who had approved it. \u201cWould you ban the French from building in Paris?\u201d he told them. The resolution describes the settlement building as a \u201cmajor obstacle\u201d to peace and demands that Israel stop the construction, which most the world regards as illegal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who had scrambled in recent days to stop the measure from coming to a vote, issued a blistering denunciation afterward. \u201cIsrael rejects this shameful   resolution at the U. N. and will not abide by its terms,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cAt a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall \u2018occupied territory.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Netanyahu immediately retaliated against two of the countries that sponsored the resolution. He ordered Israel\u2019s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal to return home for consultations, canceled a planned visit to Israel next month by Senegal\u2019s foreign minister and cut off all aid programs to Senegal. The vote came a day after Mr. Trump personally intervened to keep the measure, which had been originally proposed by Egypt, from coming up for a vote on Thursday, as scheduled. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said he had spoken to Mr. Netanyahu. Both men also spoke to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah  . Egypt postponed the vote under what that country\u2019s United Nations ambassador called intense pressure. But in a show of mounting exasperation, four other countries on the Security Council  \u2014   Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela  \u2014   all of them relatively powerless temporary members with rotating   seats, snatched the resolution away from Egypt and put it up for a vote Friday. The Obama administration has been highly critical of Israel\u2019s settlement building, describing it as an impediment to a   solution in the   conflict that has long been the official United States position, regardless of the party in power. Mr. Trump, who had urged the administration to veto the resolution, has made clear that he will take a far more sympathetic approach to Israel when his administration assumes office on Jan. 20. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the resolution amounted to his most direct intervention on United States foreign policy during his transition to power. Minutes after the Security Council vote was announced, Mr. Trump made his anger known in a Twitter posting, saying: \u201cAs to the U. N. things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u201d A range of senators and congressmen from both parties also denounced the resolution, a reflection of the deep loyalty to Israel shared by Democrats and Republicans. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said, \u201cIt is extremely frustrating, disappointing and confounding that the administration has failed to veto this resolution. \u201d Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who oversees a subcommittee that oversees United Nations funding by the United States, threatened to take steps that could \u201csuspend or significantly reduce\u201d that financing. Reaction to the resolution also illustrated fissures among American Jews regarding Israeli policy. Some, like the World Jewish Congress and American Jewish Committee, called the resolution a   measure that would not help the peace process. Ronald S. Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement: \u201cIt is also disconcerting and unfortunate that the United States, Israel\u2019s greatest ally, chose to abstain rather than veto this counterproductive text. \u201d Other groups that have grown increasingly critical of the Israeli government\u2019s approach to the peace process applauded the resolution and the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to block it. J Street, a   organization that advocates a   solution, said the resolution \u201cconveys the overwhelming support of the international community, including Israel\u2019s closest friends and allies, for the   solution, and their deep concern over the deteriorating status quo between Israelis and Palestinians and the lack of meaningful progress toward peace. \u201d Ms. Power, the United States ambassador, portrayed the abstention as consistent with the American disapproval of   but she also criticized countries at the United Nations for treating Israel unfairly. She said the United States remained committed to its \u201csteadfast support\u201d for Israel and reminded the council that Israel received an enormous amount of American military aid. Ms. Power said the United States chose not to veto the resolution, as it had done to a similar measure under Mr. Obama in 2011, because settlement building had accelerated so much that it had put the   solution in jeopardy, and because the peace process had gone nowhere. \u201cToday the Security Council reaffirmed its established consensus that settlements have no legal validity,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States has been sending a message that settlements must stop privately and publicly for nearly five decades. \u201d She also rebuked Palestinian leaders for \u201ctoo often\u201d failing to condemn violence against Israeli civilians. But she directed a portion of her remarks to Mr. Netanyahu, whose relations with the Obama administration have never been warm. \u201cOne cannot simultaneously champion expanding Israeli settlements and champion a viable   solution that would end the conflict,\u201d she said, arguing that the settlements have undermined Israel\u2019s security. Israel\u2019s ambassador, Mr. Danon, who had exhorted the American delegation to block the measure, expressed his anger in a statement that looked forward to a change in policy under Mr. Trump. \u201cIt was to be expected that Israel\u2019s greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,\u201d he said. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, welcomed the resolution\u2019s adoption but tempered his approval with a warning. \u201cIn reality, today\u2019s action may be too little too late,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter years of allowing the law to be trampled and the situation to spiral downward, today\u2019s resolution may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the   solution and revive the path for peace. \u201d The resolution condemned Israeli housing construction in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank as a \u201cflagrant violation under international law\u201d that was \u201cdangerously imperiling the viability\u201d of a future peace settlement establishing a Palestinian state. The resolution also included a nod to Israel and its backers by condemning \u201call acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction. \u201d That language is diplomatic scolding aimed at Palestinian leaders, whom Israel accuses of encouraging attacks on Israeli civilians. Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, expressed appreciation to the Security Council. \u201cWe praise the countries that voted for the resolution,\u201d said Hazem Kassem, a spokesman for the group. \u201cWe emphasize the need to turn such a resolution into action, not only to halt settlements but to eradicate Israel\u2019s occupation in all its forms. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563460.0968878}
