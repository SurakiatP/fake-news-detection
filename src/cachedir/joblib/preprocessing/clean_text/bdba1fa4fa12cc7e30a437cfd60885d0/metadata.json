President Donald Trump attended a   inaugural prayer service this morning and then delivered remarks at the CIA headquarters \u201cto thank the men and women of the intelligence community. \u201d Meanwhile, women\u2019s rights and   activists took to the streets in Washington, D. C. and in \u201csister marches\u201d around the world to protest the election of President Trump the day after his inauguration. [All times eastern.  10:1o PM:  \u201cAnd the reason you\u2019re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth,\u201d Trump said. The approximately 400 CIA employees broke out into applause after Trump said this. In addition to making it seem, falsely, like he was in a feud with the intelligence community, Trump said the media \u201cshowed an empty field\u201d during his inauguration. \u201cWe had a massive field of people. You saw that, packed,\u201d Trump said. He then noted that when he woke up Saturday morning, he turned on the TV and noticed, \u201cI get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out. The field was, it looked like a million  \u2014   a million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, \u2018Donald Trump did not draw well. \u2019\u201d  He added, \u201cWe have something that\u2019s amazing because we had it looked  \u2014   honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on [the tv] and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. \u201d \u201cSo, we caught them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we caught them in a beauty, and I think they\u2019re going to pay a big price. \u201d  Trump went on to note yet another lie perpetuated by the media. Specifically, Zeke Miller of Time magazine falsely reported that Trump removed the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office. The bust of the esteemed, late civil rights leader was never removed. (President Barack Obama had removed the bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office shortly after he moved in and replaced it with MLK Jr. \u2019s). \u201cIn the Oval Office, there\u2019s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd, I also happen to like Churchill  \u2026     He doesn\u2019t come from our country, but had a lot do with it. He helped us, real ally. \u201d Trump had requested that Churchill\u2019s bust be replaced in the Oval Office upon his move into the White House. \u201cBut there was a cameraman that was right in front of it. So Zeke, Zeke from Time Magazine\u201d wrote a fake news story, Trump said. \u201cI would never do that. I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But this is how dishonest the media is. \u201d Trump added, \u201cI love honesty. I like honest reporting. \u201d  And finally, he told the CIA, \u201cI love you. I respect you. There\u2019s nobody I respect more. you\u2019re going to do a fantastic job. And we are going to start winning again, and you are going to lead the charge. Thank you. I\u2019ll be back. \u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also pointed out the lies perpetuated by the media during his emergency press conference Saturday. \u201cSome members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cPhotographs of the Inauguration proceeding were intentionally framed in a way to minimize the enormous support it had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d he said.  He noted earlier how Miller of Time magazine \u201cfalsely tweeted out that the bust of MLK, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. \u201cThis was just plain wrong. \u201d 7:20 PM:  \u201cSome members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,\u201d Spicer said. He explained that one reporter \u201cfalsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed form the Oval Office  \u2026     This was just plain wrong. \u201d  The false report, which Spicer described as \u201cirresponsible and reckless,\u201d came from TIME magazine pool reporter Zeke Miller: Tweeting again: wh aide confirms the MLK bust is still there. I looked for it in the oval 2x  didn\u2019t see it. My apologies to my colleagues,  \u2014   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) January 21, 2017,  Apology accepted https:  .   \u2014   Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 21, 2017,  Thanks to White House Chief of Staff for this wonderful picture of the MLK bust in the oval pic. twitter.   \u2014   Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 21, 2017,  Spicer further noted that the media had attempted to paint Trump\u2019s inauguration as appearing much smaller than President Barack Obama\u2019s. \u201cPhotographs of the Inauguration proceeding were intentionally framed in a way to minimize the enormous support it had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d Spicer said. He added, it was the first time in the nation\u2019s history that white floor coverings had been used to protect the grass and that they amplified empty spaces, whereas the grass had minimized the appearance of spaces in the past.  \u201cInaccurate numbers regarding crowd size were also tweeted,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cNo one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall does not put any out. \u201d He said this also applies to any attempts to count the numbers of protesters during the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d on Saturday.   \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk in the media about holding President Trump accountable. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you that it goes two ways. We\u2019re going to hold the press accountable as well. The American people deserve better,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd as long as he serves as the messenger of this incredible movement, he will take this message directly to the American people where his focus will always be. \u201d  Spicer\u2019s criticism of the media\u2019s fake news reporting resulted in a media meltdown on social media. MSNBC correspondent   Reid called Spicer \u201cthe new Baghdad Bob. \u201d Sean Spicer is the new Baghdad Bob. That was positively Soviet. https:  .   \u2014   Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) January 21, 2017,    Think Progress\u2019s Judd Legum suggested Spicer had \u201ctorched his credibility\u201d for confronting the media\u2019s misreporting with the truth: Spicer torching his credibility on DAY ONE,  \u2014   Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) January 21, 2017,  Naturally, other media figures from the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, and Salon also complained:  In that rendition of history Spicer gave, with no q\u2019s taken and false info given, the reality of what\u2019s happening w rallies doesn\u2019t exist.  \u2014   Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) January 21, 2017,  Spicer, before walking out without questions, says they will begin to hold the press \u201daccountable.\u201d No idea what that means.  \u2014   Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) January 21, 2017,  I\u2019m relieved @PressSec Spicer hauled in press to whine about crowd estimates. I worried he was going to announce we nuked Denmark.  \u2014   Dana Milbank (@Milbank) January 21, 2017,  1) 100% false 2) Spicer knows it 3) Trump trotted out Spicer to say this and watched 4) this is ridiculous. https:  .   \u2014   Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) January 21, 2017,  OMG: Spicer is accusing media of \u201dintentionally framing\u201d photographs to minimize inauguration turnout!  \u2014   Joan Walsh (@joanwalsh) January 21, 2017,  5:32 PM: \u201cWe won\u2019t go away, welcome to your first day,\u201d women marchers chanted near the White House.  It\u2019s ironic that they\u2019re threatening to never leave, since many of the protesters are actually leaving tomorrow or the next day after having been bussed in from around the country and even from Canada.  For them to actually stay and occupy Washington, D. C. would cost millions per day \u2014  an unrealistic possibility. It\u2019s much more likely these protesters are going to catch their bus or their flight home in the next day or so and depart the national political stage without gaining any real ground. Part of the reason for their looming irrelevancy was evident in the disorganized nature of the march \u2014  which was actually more of a giant gathering downtown. Protesters did not have a clear message of what they were asking for \u2014  other than venting anger at the fact Donald Trump is the duly elected and inaugurated president of the United States \u2014  and did not even march in a coordinated way in any particular direction throughout DC other than to just wander around in groups of a few hundred chanting one thing or another like the aforementioned threat to never leave or another age old Democratic Party protester chant \u201cThis is what Democracy looks like. \u201d Sure, celebrities like Madonna and Ashley Judd and top Democrats like newly elected California Sen. Kamala Harris joined in with speeches but the largely incoherent message that asks for nothing reasonable \u2014  the only thing they seem to be demanding is that President Trump go away, something that will not happen \u2014  leaves the women marchers against Trump leaving Washington empty handed. 4:48 PM: \u201cYes, I\u2019m angry. Yes, I\u2019m outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this won\u2019t change anything,\u201d Madonna told the crowd to roaring applause.   Are you ready to shake up the world?\u201d Madonna asked the crowd. \u201cWelcome to the revolution of love, to the rebellion, to out refusal as women to accept this new age of tyranny, where not just women are in danger but all regionalized people. Where being uniquely different, right now, might truly be considered a crime. \u201d Moments later, Madonna dropped the   on live TV. According to The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cThe singer\u2019s remarks aired uncensored on   CNN and MSNBC. \u201d \u201cIt took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the fuck up. \u201d she said. The pop   performed two of her biggest songs \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d and \u201cHuman Nature. \u201d During the latter, Madonna changed the song\u2019s lyric to say \u201cDonald Trump \u2014  suck a dick. \u201d She also led the crowd of   revelers in a chant: \u201cI\u2019m not your bitch. \u201d Madonna also sent a vulgar message to her and protester\u2019s \u201cdetractors. \u201d \u201cAnd to our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything, fuck you! Fuck You!\u201d she said. Madonna at #WomensMarch: \u201cIt took this horrific moment of darkness to wake the f \u2014   up. \u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) January 21, 2017,  3:11 PM: Good to note that while this strange affair is happening  \u2014   with Madonna dropping   and dancing around like the aging \u201cfairground stripper\u201d Elton John once accused her of being, Ashley Judd spewing vile accusations of incest, and Michael Moore bellowing about \u201cTrump carnage\u201d  \u2014   the Trump and Pence families quietly and reverently attended church today and then the president met with the CIA. 3:02 PM: Breitbart\u2019s Dr. Susan Berry reports: The tens of thousands of women marching in the   Women\u2019s March on Washington demonstration in Washington, D. C. Saturday are \u201cmostly white\u201d and experiencing \u201ctherapy\u201d for their anxiety over Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss to Donald Trump in November, the Washington Post reports. Read the rest here. 2:53 PM: The Fahrenheit   director offered the crowd of   Trump protesters some advice on how to stop the nomination of Betty DeVos, President Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Education.  \u201cOn Monday, call (202)  . Call your representative and your two Senators, and number one we do not accept Betty DeVos as our secretary of education,\u201d Moore told the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s day one. Make it part of your daily routine. \u201d \u201cI want you to make this a part of your new daily routine: Call Congress every single day,\u201d he added. \u201cBrush your teeth, make the coffee, walk the dog and call Congress. \u201d Moore also declared war on the Democratic Party, saying, \u201cthe old guard of the Democratic Party has to go. \u201d \u201cWe have to take over the Democratic Party,\u201d Moore said. \u201cGod bless the Democrats who fought with us. Who\u2019ve done so many good things. It\u2019s no knock on them\u201d he explained before railing against the Electoral College. \u201cTwice now, we won the White House, yet they walked through the door!\u201d At one point during his   speech, Moore held up a copy of Saturday\u2019s Washington Post and ripped it up. \u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d Moore said while holding up the newspaper with a headline that read \u201cTrump Takes Power. \u201d At Women\u2019s March on Washington, Michael Moore rips up front page on Pres. Trump\u2019s inauguration https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   ABC News (@ABC) January 21, 2017,  \u201cLook at what we\u2019ve already accomplish here today,\u201d Moore told the crowd. \u201cThe majority of Americans didn\u2019t want Donald J. Trump in the White House and we\u2019re here today as their representatives. \u201d 2:28 PM: A number of news media outlets are reporting on the numbers at the   protest crowd, speculating that it might be bigger than the inauguration crowd the day before. No hard numbers are available yet. But it\u2019s useful to remember what Breitbart\u2019s Daniel Flynn noted yesterday when he wrote: MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow juxtaposed Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration boasting people as far as the eye can see with Trump\u2019s crowd failing to extend to the Washington Monument. She didn\u2019t mention that Washington, D. C. favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump 91 percent to four percent on Election Day. Nor did she speak of the local welcome wagon, which on Inauguration Eve gored Trump supporters with flagpoles and read \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d on hats as \u201cPlease Throw a Battery at Me. \u201d Sometimes watching at home is the better part of valor. 2:10 PM: Actress Ashley Judd grotesquely accused President Trump of incest, claiming that he has \u201cwet dreams\u201d about his own daughter. Video of her remarks are here. So much for \u201cWhen they go low  \u2026    \u201d 2:05 PM: Photo from Breitbart\u2019s Raheem Kassam below. These folks aren\u2019t the \u201cpicking up after yourselves\u201d types like the Tea Party members who famously left the Mall in DC cleaner than they found it in 2010 during the Restoring Honor Rally.  2:04 PM: \u201cIt\u2019s been a heartrending time to be both a woman and an immigrant in this country,\u201d the Ugly Betty star said. \u201cOur dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack, and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. \u201d  Ferrera, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention last summer, said that the Trump administration and the   Congress don\u2019t represent America. \u201cBut the president is not America. His cabinet is not America. Congress is not America,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are America. And we are here to stay. \u201d Actress America Ferrera speaks at the #WomensMarch in Washington, DC: \u201dOur rights have all been under attack\u201d https:  .   \u2014   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 21, 2017,  \u201cWe march today for our families and our neighbors, for our future, for the causes we claim and for the causes that claim us,\u201d the    actress added. Ferrera told the crowd of protesters that President Trump is not the \u201cmoral core\u201d of America. \u201cWe march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war. He would like us to forget the words, \u2018Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free,\u2019 and instead, take up a credo of hatred,\u201d she said. The Women\u2019s March on Washington coincide Saturday with dozens of   protests around the world. Hillary Clinton took to Twitter Saturday to show support for the protesters marching and rallying against Trump. \u201cThanks for standing, speaking  marching for our values @womensmarch.
