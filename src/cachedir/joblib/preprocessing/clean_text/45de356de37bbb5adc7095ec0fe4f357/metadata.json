It\u2019s one of many questions this    songwriter and   asks of himself in the course of the album. And it\u2019s answered, in some ways, by the songs themselves on Bon Iver\u2019s most diverse, noisiest, shortest, knottiest and most experimental album so far. Due for release on Sept. 30, \u201c22, a Million,\u201d is one more sharp turn in a career that has carried Mr. Vernon from   obscurity in Wisconsin clubs to festival stages and the Grammys, including an improbable detour via   and Kanye West. The songwriter and pianist Bruce Hornsby  \u2014   one of Mr. Vernon\u2019s avowed influences and, lately, a collaborator  \u2014   described Mr. Vernon in a phone interview as \u201ca soul singer who creates these unique and beautiful sonic landscapes on which to perform. \u201d Those landscapes have grown ever more painstakingly inventive. Making the album, Mr. Vernon said earlier this month, was at times spontaneous, at times convoluted and often uncertain. \u201cIt was a long moment, these last few years, thinking: What am I doing? What do I want to do it for?\u201d he said. Mr. Vernon needed five years, three of them concentrated on writing and recording the new album, to clarify for himself what Bon Iver means and sounds like, now that he can count on a worldwide audience to keep him \u201cunhungry. \u201d \u201cI feel both blessed and cursed by the fact that I can do whatever I want at this point,\u201d Mr. Vernon said in a rare extended interview in the recording studio at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, a gallery and performance space in Red Hook where he is on the advisory board. \u201cI have more recognition than I had ever wanted to deal with. \u201d The pressure he felt was not commercial. \u201c22, a Million\u201d is a bumpier ride than Bon Iver\u2019s previous albums. It constantly mixes distorted and manipulated sounds with natural ones, and it deliberately veers away from pop familiarity. But it also progresses toward solace, grounding its closing songs in steadfast melodies and consoling harmonies. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to not pay any attention to questions of, \u2018What\u2019s your legacy going to be?\u2019 or \u2018What are you going to leave behind?\u2019 or \u2018How do you work into the current scene?\u2019 or \u2018How do you relate to the  ? \u2019\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cI find all of that stuff not only distracting but kind of the opposite of what it all means. \u201d Wearing loose pinstriped pants and a dark gray   that revealed some of his many tattoos, with a neatly trimmed beard and casually tousled hair, Mr. Vernon was by no means the introvert his songs might suggest. Affable and articulate, he was eager to delve into and at least partly decrypt his work. The polite   of his Midwestern upbringing came through, but Mr. Vernon battles excessive modesty. \u201cI got in a friendly argument with Kanye West about the word humble once,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Have you ever looked up the word humble?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Actually I don\u2019t know if I have.\u2019 And he showed me the definition of it, and it\u2019s far more   kind of the problematic Midwestern \u2018Sorry!\u2019 mentality, than I realized. \u201d He continued, \u201cI took a lot out of that conversation. Ultimately, I think it\u2019s great to serve others and everything, but I think there\u2019s a certain point where it\u2019s diminishing returns for the people around you if you\u2019re not showing up and being who you are. \u201d \u201c22, a Million\u201d  \u2014   the title reflects Mr. Vernon\u2019s numerological whims  \u2014   is the   successor to the 2011 album \u201cBon Iver, Bon Iver,\u201d which sold more than half a million copies in the United States and won Grammy Awards for best alternative album and best new artist. Grammy recognition \u201cdidn\u2019t change anything about me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt did make me realize that there are people out there that really care about monetary success and recognition for the commodity that is music, like way more than I do. Not to say I don\u2019t care about recognition. I like when people like a song, but I certainly don\u2019t care as much as some folks out there. \u201d The first Bon Iver album, \u201cFor Emma, Forever Ago,\u201d was a nearly solitary work. Mr. Vernon wrote and recorded it after the breakup of both his longtime band and a relationship, in his father\u2019s chilly hunting cabin in Wisconsin during the winter of   and it was full of pensive ballads with translucent layers of guitars and vocals. \u201cFor Emma\u201d quietly won hearts, eventually selling half a million copies. It also brought Bon Iver to the attention of Mr. West, who sampled \u201cWoods,\u201d a song from a 2009 Bon Iver EP, and went on to feature Mr. Vernon at concerts and as a songwriting collaborator on \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\u201d \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d and \u201cYeezus. \u201d The second Bon Iver album, \u201cBon Iver, Bon Iver\u201d was both more expansive and more ambiguous. Mr. Vernon built his own studio, April Base, in his hometown, Eau Claire, Wis. The music was still gracious, mostly     as Mr. Vernon welcomed a broader range of collaborators and instruments, bringing a lapidary detail to the arrangements, while the lyrics posed new riddles. In the interview, Mr. Vernon noted that \u201cPerth,\u201d which opens that album, and \u201c\u201d which concludes it, rhyme with \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath. \u201d The   continue: A song title on the new album, \u201c10 Death Breast,\u201d rhymes with \u201c . \u201d Mr. Vernon found plenty of distractions before settling in to work on \u201c22, a Million. \u201d He toured the world with the large band he needed to recreate \u201cBon Iver, Bon Iver\u201d onstage, an elaborate and demanding project. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever plan on having that much popularity, and being from Wisconsin, whatever amount that I could have dreamt about, I was not prepared for any of that,\u201d he said. One thing that weighed on him was being photographed constantly, he said his face is noticeably absent from the artwork of the new album. \u201cI felt very exposed, with scarred skin from the whole experience. Not that it was all bad, but it wore down these outer layers, and everything kind of hurt. \u201d When the tour ended, he turned to collaborations: producing albums for the Blind Boys of Alabama and the folky English group the Staves, and regrouping and touring with his    band Volcano Choir. He started and closely curated a festival, Eaux Claires, with Bon Iver headlining alongside its influences and favorites. And, gradually, he pushed himself to write new songs. Instead of having his guitar at their center, they largely relied on a portable synthesizer and sampler along with a customized Vocoder and thoughts of the heady blend of Duke Ellington\u2019s saxophone sections one new song, he said, weaves about 150 saxophones into its mix. A turning point came when Mr. Vernon traveled to Greece, alone and  . He found himself singing the line \u201cIt might be over soon\u201d into the sampler, hearing it as a kind of mantra that could suggest relief, loss, mortality or a reason to get to work. \u201cThe bad stuff might be over soon, but maybe the good stuff might be over soon,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019d better figure out how to enjoy this life and participate in it. \u201d Back in Wisconsin, Mr. Vernon worked like both a   and a   producer. He improvised with musicians in his studio, then culled snippets that might engender songs he toyed with loops and effects he let samples lead him to ideas. Where he had organized \u201cBon Iver, Bon Iver\u201d around places, he decided to unify his new album with numbers. Each song title on \u201c22, a Million\u201d begins with a number that holds a private significance for Mr. Vernon. He has always been drawn to the number 22. While growing up and playing sports, he chose it as his jersey number he also, he said, sets   alarms to 22 minutes after the hour. As he chopped up the phrase \u201cIt might be over soon\u201d in the sampler, \u201csoon\u201d began to turn into \u201ctwo, two\u201d: 22. The album opens with \u201c22 Over Soon\u201d and concludes with the hymnlike \u201c1000000, a Million. \u201d \u201cBeing 22 is me,\u201d he said, \u201cand then the last song being a million, which is this great elusive thing: like, what\u2019s a million? The album deals a lot with duality in general and how that works into the math. I was big into Taoism in college, and the paradox of duality, and how it\u2019s always one thing and the other  \u2014   you can never have one thing without the other. So it\u2019s 22 being me and a million being the Other. That was a way to look at it as a circle. \u201d He also delved into sonic manipulation. \u201cA big thing for me on the album was, how do we get something to sound accidental or new or fresh,\u201d he said. When he was dissatisfied with the overly digital sound of \u201c22 Over Soon,\u201d he and his engineer took a cassette (Neil Young\u2019s \u201cUnplugged\u201d) pulled out the tape and crumpled it and wrote on it with a marker. Then they recorded the track onto it, creating distortion and dropouts. Other songs toy with recording speed, ending up between standard pitches. The   that runs through all of Bon Iver\u2019s songs emerged anew in lyrics and song titles that draw on thoughts of consecration, prayer and God. A spacious yet fragile ballad, \u201c666 Upsidedowncross,\u201d presents the singer as an uncertain pilgrim, musing, \u201cI don\u2019t know the path. \u201d The album booklet cites the anguished Psalm 22  \u2014   \u201cWhy are you so far from saving me?\u201d  \u2014   alongside the song \u201c33 \u2018God\u2019,\u201d which includes samples from a gospel choir. \u201cWhen you use enough of that language, it perks some people\u2019s ears up,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cI do love those words, I love the word consecration, these holy words so to speak. I like using them in a way people haven\u2019t heard before, or right next to a bunch of swear words. It\u2019s just fun  \u2014   it puts a smile on my face. \u201d But there was also a more serious undercurrent. He added: \u201cFor me from a very early age, music has been my religion. It\u2019s been my way of understanding, it\u2019s been my way of celebration, it\u2019s been my way of contemplation. \u201d As Bon Iver   Mr. Vernon is thinking hard about  . \u201cWhen I made the last record, actually both records, I very much felt like I\u2019d healed myself,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, I got done, and oh! now I\u2019m better. And this one, I\u2019m smarter than that. Now that this album\u2019s done, as much as I healed a lot of things by making it, I know that it\u2019s an ongoing thing. The river does not end. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564171.8699884}
