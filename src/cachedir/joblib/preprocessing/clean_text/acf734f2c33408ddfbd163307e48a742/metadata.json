He has a decade of proven experience on the court of appeals of being faithful to the Constitution, following the law, protecting the Bill of Rights and our fundamental liberties, and I think that record will yield a swift confirmation in the United States Senate. \u201d He added, \u201cDemocrats are engaged right now in unprecedented partisan obstruction, but I hope on the Supreme Court they will not engage in that practice.   \u2026     Democrats will not succeed in filibustering Judge Gorsuch. They may try, but they will not succeed. \u201d Cruz also addressed whether or not blocking Gorsuch would be fair turnabout for blocking the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland by saying the two nominations took place under a \u201cfundamentally different\u201d set of circumstances because Garland was appointed during an election year.
