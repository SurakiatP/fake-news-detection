Knowing this was a fairly urgent matter, she waited 20 minutes and paged the doctor again. And after another 20 minutes, a third time. \\nFrustrated and concerned, she picked up the phone and called the resident knowing she would be very annoyed at best. But the doctor was not available by phone either. After some astute investigating, Betty Sue eventually found Dr. Jen Willis sleeping in the call room covered in Cheerios and saliva. \\nGiven the grave nature of the problem, Betty touched base with the resident\u2019s attending who ultimately corrected the faulty order. \u201cAnother brilliant batch of new doctors,\u201d grumbled Attending Dr. Bill Wineberg. \\nThe patient is now doing well after receiving the appropriate amount of potassium to correct her cardiac arrhythmia. \u201cDoctors are so brilliant,\u201d the patient stated, \u201cI feel great!\u201d \\nNurse Betty Sue was later interviewed by the hospital\u2019s Sentinel Event committee regarding the near miss error. When asked to comment, Betty Sue stated \u201cI\u2019m just doing my job and keeping my patients safe \u2014 thank you for asking.\u201d When the resident was finally awake, Dr. Jen Willis griped, \u201cThe nurses really need to stop paging us so much.\u201d 1K Shares '"}, "time": 1742564358.6589427}
