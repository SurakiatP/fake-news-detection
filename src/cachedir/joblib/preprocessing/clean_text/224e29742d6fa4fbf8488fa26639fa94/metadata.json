According to conservative radio talk show host Steve Gruber, who posted the email on Facebook, Meteyer wrote: I am concerned about my students and your children being exposed to language and behavior that is not in concert with the most conservative social and family values, I have decided to show the inauguration Donald Trump this Friday, but we will not view Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration speech. The email said Meteyer reached out to Trump\u2019s transition team to request a copy of the speech, but he did not receive a response. \u201cI showed the speeches of Presidents Obama and Bush in 2009 and 2005, respectively, but am anxious about showing Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address, given his past inflammatory and degrading comments about minorities, women, and the disabled,\u201d the email continued. A parent who listens to Gruber\u2019s show forwarded the email to the talk radio host, AOL reported. \u201cWhat kind of message does this send to kids? \u2018This president is a bad guy and kids should not watch him?\u2019 This is a piece of history and the kids should be allowed to watch,\u201d Gruber told Watchdog. org.'"}, "time": 1742561784.5269563}
