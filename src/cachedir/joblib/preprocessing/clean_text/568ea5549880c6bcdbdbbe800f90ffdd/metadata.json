So I don\u2019t want to say whose fault is it. I don\u2019t think it helps.\u201dTrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible it\u2019s not makeable, because don\u2019t forget it has to last \u2014 it\u2019s wonderful to make it and it doesn\u2019t work, but it has to last,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I\u2019m going to give it a shot.\u201d \\nThough he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. \\n\u201cA lot of people say an agreement can\u2019t be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can\u2019t be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,\u201d he said. \u201cI was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it\u2019s impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they\u2019re children to hate Jewish people.\u201dIn the past, Trump has questioned Israel\u2019s commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201ca good friend.\u201d \\nAt a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don\u2019t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.\u201d \\nHe made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: \u201cA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal \u2014 whether or not Israel\u2019s willing to sacrifice certain things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may not be, and I understand that, and I\u2019m okay with that. But then you\u2019re just not going to have a deal.\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s comments Wednesday came hours after a dramatic upset in polls saw Trump fall behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the first time in 31 consecutive polls, coming in at 26% of registered Republican voters nationally, two points behind Cruz at 28%.\""}, "time": 1742562917.2124934}
