I thought I was an Orthodox Jew but he is much more Orthodox than me because every time he talks it\u2019s all about how he could help Jews and protect Jews. And every child he has is looking for someone to marry that\u2019s a Jew. They go to shul [synagogue] even when there\u2019s no reason for it. He creates Jewish holidays that don\u2019t even exist. His    is not only Jewish but he\u2019s Orthodox. And his daughter became even more Orthodox than the husband. So, he can\u2019t even go with them to a restaurant because as soon as they sit down they complain that it is not Kosher enough. \u201cI think he forgot he\u2019s a gentile altogether,\u201d Mason said of Trump. \u201cPretty soon he\u2019ll be wearing that yalmukah (kippah) every time he goes to the White House. \u201d The Borscht Belt legend was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter\u2019s talk radio program, \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d broadcast on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM. Listen to the full audio here.  Mason was asked for his thoughts on what Trump should do during his reported upcoming visit to Israel later this month. The trip has not yet been officially announced but multiple news media reports cite anonymous Israeli and U. S. officials saying the purported trip is slated for May 22. \u201cI would like him to declare that nobody should disturb Israel for the next thousand years,\u201d responded Mason. \u201cAnd I would like him to declare that if anybody makes one bad move against Israel that he would wipe them out in a minute and a half. \u201d Mason continued on Trump and Israel: He is going to be a fantastic contrast to what we went through with Obama. Obama not only resented Israel. He resented Jews in general. He is the first American president who couldn\u2019t tolerate the thought of Israel\u2019s existence. And every time that [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu came to the White House he wound up sitting on a chair outside of a building or in front of the grass or under a sink. [Obama] couldn\u2019t stand the sight of [Netanyahu] and the thought of him being there. He resented any kind of progress that Israel wanted to make to accomplish anything or any effort to find peace there. If he could start his own war against Israel he would have declared war on Israel himself. He just didn\u2019t have a chance to do it.
