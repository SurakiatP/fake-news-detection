S. out of the Paris climate accord  \u2014   by shining green lights on buildings. [Trump announced Thursday that he will pull the U. S. out of the 2015 Paris accord, causing dismay among liberal politicians and media outlets across the globe. Some mayors and governors have said they intend to carry on with the agreement in their cities.  But now, some of those liberal enclaves are expressing their support for the accord by turning their buildings green as a sign of their environmentalism. In New York City, Boston and Washington D. C. buildings turned green at the behest of the cities\u2019 liberal politicians.

Despite Trump\u2019s openness to negotiating the accord, local and world leaders reacted angrily to the announcement. The governments of Italy, France, and Germany on Thursday rejected the offer, saying in a joint statement that the agreement  \u201ccannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies. \u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
