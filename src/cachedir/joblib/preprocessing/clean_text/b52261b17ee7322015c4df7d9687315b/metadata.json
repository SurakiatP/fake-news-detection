It\u2019s been a Western tourist hotspot for many years now. Many people consider it a city \u201coverrun\u201d by the Westerners. Ruined, and no longer worth it.\\nI\u2019ve spent the last month of my travels here in Prague, and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east\u2013 Ukraine. \\nWith that being said, here are 10 observations I\u2019ve made about Prague.\\n1. Yes, It\u2019s Overrun, BUT\u2026 \\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find places that aren\u2019t overrun. Yes, if you choose to stay in Prague zone 1, you\u2019re going to have a drastically different experience. There will be hoards of people with selfie sticks, and fat Western girls wobbling all over Old Town (blocking the already narrow streets).\\nIf you head out to Prague 2, 3, 5, etc., you\u2019ll have a much different experience. You\u2019ll get to meet some locals, try beer other than Staropramen, and avoid the throngs of tourists.\\nOf course, it\u2019s important to note that Prague is a beautiful city. It\u2019s natural to want to see some of the sights. If you choose to go this route, there\u2019s simply no way around it.\\n2. The Reaction From Locals Changes Over Time \\nSimply put, locals are used to Westerners. And most of them roll their eyes at them. However, once they know that you\u2019ve laid down some semi-permanent roots, they\u2019re far more friendly.\\nJust the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete 180 on me in the few weeks I\u2019ve been here. It went from a general coldness that they show all English speakers to genuine warmth.\\n3. The Beauty (Of The City) Is Unreal \\nThis is my third time in Prague, and I\u2019m still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is. From the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings, it\u2019s just a very pleasant place to be. There are a lot of beautiful cities in Europe, but Prague is definitely near the top of all of them.\\nYou can\u2019t really blame people for wanting to come and see it.\\n4. Cheap By Western Standards, Expensive By EE Simply put, if you\u2019re looking for short-term rentals\u2014you\u2019re getting hosed. And there\u2019s not many ways around it. Prague landlords know the power of Western currency and know that the short-term stag parties don\u2019t mind blowing it.\\nIt\u2019s far, far cheaper to sign a lease for a 3, 6, or 12 month period.\\nA meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between $8-12 USD. This is incredibly cheap compared to places like Italy, Spain, or London. At the same time, it\u2019s definitely a bit more expensive than places such as Kiev, Budapest, or some cities in Poland.\\nIf you want actual numbers, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about 30% more expensive than Kiev. Probably about 10-15% more expensive than Budapest (the last time I was there was April 2015, so keep that in mind), and just marginally more expensive than Poland.\\nOf course (as I keep harping on this), it\u2019s going to get cheaper the further you go from the Old Town area.\\n5. The Girls \\nI know this is probably a large part of the reason you\u2019re reading this. So let\u2019s break it down. The girls are hot. They\u2019re not as hot as Ukrainian and Russian girls, but they\u2019re a step above Polish women. \\nAt this point, it\u2019s easy to see that any and all local Czech girls living in Prague are basically immune to foreigners. You aren\u2019t going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the Old Town. In fact, she\u2019d probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area.\\nHowever, being a foreigner will give you some major value if you\u2019re living there. In Colombia, girls will bang you just because you\u2019re a foreigner. In Ukraine, they\u2019ll probably at least give you one date for being foreign. In Prague, they\u2019ll do neither\u2014 especially the high quality ones. \\nHowever, the same things apply if you\u2019re living there (or coming back consistently).\\nPlus, it\u2019s not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around. Just keep your liquor in check, and avoid putting a GoPro on your head\u2013you\u2019ll already be ahead of the game.\\n6. Conclusion\u2014Is It Livable? \\nWhen you come from a place like Ukraine, Prague feels much more like home. The English is better, and it has a more Western feel. You can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the Former Soviet Union countries (Ukraine, Belarus, etc.).\\nThe question is whether or not it\u2019s worth it to deal with what comes with those Western amenities\u2014high amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over. There\u2019s no denying that Prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was 20 years ago.\\nHowever, Prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done. The internet is fast, the city is interesting, and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do.\\nYou could do a lot worse.\\nRead More: 5 Habits All Successful Seducers Share \\n'"}, "time": 1742561753.6109965}
