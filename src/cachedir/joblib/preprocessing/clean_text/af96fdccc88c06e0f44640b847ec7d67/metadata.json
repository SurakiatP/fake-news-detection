But a new analysis by The Wirecutter, a product recommendations website owned by The New York Times Company, has found that half of 30 sets of children\u2019s headphones tested did not restrict volume to the promised limit. The worst headphones produced sound so loud that it could be hazardous to ears in minutes. \u201cThese are terribly important findings,\u201d said Cory Portnuff, a pediatric audiologist at the University of Colorado Hospital who was not involved in the analysis. \u201cManufacturers are making claims that aren\u2019t accurate. \u201d The new analysis should be a   call to parents who thought   technology offered adequate protection, said Dr. Blake Papsin, the chief otolaryngologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. \u201cHeadphone manufacturers aren\u2019t interested in the health of your child\u2019s ears,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are interested in selling products, and some of them are not good for you. \u201d Half of   to    listen to music daily, and nearly   of teenagers do, according to a 2015 report with more than 2, 600 participants. Safe listening is a function of both volume and duration: The louder a sound, the less time you should listen to it. It\u2019s not a linear relationship. Eighty decibels is twice as loud as 70 decibels, and 90 decibels is four times louder. Exposure to 100 decibels, about the volume of noise caused by a power lawn mower, is safe for just 15 minutes noise at 108 decibels, however, is safe for less than three minutes. The workplace safety limit for adults, set by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 1998, is 85 decibels for no more than eight hours. But there is no mandatory standard that restricts the maximum sound output for listening devices or headphones sold in the United States. When cranked all the way up, modern portable devices can produce sound levels from 97 to 107 decibels, a 2011 study found. A team at The Wirecutter used two types of sound to test 30 sets of headphones and earbuds with an iPod Touch. First, they played a snippet of Major Lazer\u2019s hit \u201cCold Water\u201d as a   example of the kind of thumping music children listen to all the time. Second, the testers played pink noise, usually used to test the output levels of equipment, to see whether the headphones actually limited volume to 85 decibels. Playing 21 seconds of \u201cCold Water\u201d at maximum volume, half of the 30 headphones exceeded 85 decibels. The loudest headphones went to 114 decibels. With pink noise, roughly   exceeded 85 decibels the loudest was recorded at 108 decibels. Complete results are available at thewirecutter. com. To pinpoint the earbuds that did reduce volume, the Wirecutter team hooked up a computer to a simulated ear with a microphone inside and a coupler that models the acoustics of an ear canal. Brian Fligor, an audiologist who is a member of the World Health Organization\u2019s working group on safe listening devices, advised the team on how to compare its results to data on the   workplace limit. (Headphones and earbuds are much closer to the ear, obviously the workplace limit was devised with open areas in mind.) Lauren Dragan, an editor at The Wirecutter, also corralled a   children, 3 to 11 years old, to try on each model, choose favorites and compile a \u201chate list\u201d of ones they would never use. In the end, the overall pick for the children was a Bluetooth model called the Puro BT2200 ($99. 99). The headphones were   by both toddlers and tweens, had excellent sound quality, offered some noise cancellation features and adequately restricted volume as long as the cord wasn\u2019t used. The battery lasts an impressive 18 to 22 hours, and the wired connection is used only as a backup. But that cord must be plugged in as labeled, with one particular end to the headphones and the other to the music device. If inserted the wrong way, \u201cit\u2019ll play really loud,\u201d said Brent Butterworth, an audio expert who helped test all the headphones. \u201cIf they are using it in Bluetooth mode, it\u2019s impossible to make too loud,\u201d he added. Most of the other models relied on resistors, which impede electrical currents, inside the cord to reduce volume, but they sometimes failed to work. Both of the overall   were not Bluetooth, however despite the cords, their maximum volumes did not exceed 85 decibels. Toddlers liked the fit of Onanoff Buddyphones Explore ($29. 99) but will most likely outgrow them, the analysis found, and the sound quality didn\u2019t compare to that of the Puro. The corded pick for older children, ages 4 to 11, was JLab JBuddies Studio ($29. 99). The Wirecutter team also assessed the headphones\u2019 ability to reduce ambient noise. Children often wear headphones in noisy places, like car back seats and planes. Without noise cancellation, the natural tendency is to pump up the volume to hear over the background noise. Only four of the 30 sets of headphones tested blocked a significant amount of low frequency sound similar to that in a car or an airplane cabin. A pair of earbuds  \u2014   Etymotic ETY Kids 3 ($49) and Puro IEM200 ($29. 99)  \u2014   did the best job at blocking outside sounds. (The other two were Direct Sound YourTones ($119. 95) and Nabi ($69. 99).) Dr. Papsin recommended buying headphones that both limit volume and cancel outside noise. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the money,\u201d he said. But the analysis based its top three on their   capacity. \u201cUnless you\u2019re on a plane or in a car, you don\u2019t need to worry as much about isolation,\u201d Ms. Dragan said. Even with headphones that effectively limit maximum sound, supervision is crucial. \u201c  decibels isn\u2019t some magic threshold below which you\u2019re perfectly safe and above which your ears bleed,\u201d Dr. Fligor said. Audiologists offered some tips for listening: First, keep the volume at 60 percent. Second, encourage your child to take breaks every hour to allow the hair cells in the inner ear to rest. Nonstop listening can eventually damage them. Finally, Dr. Jim Battey, the director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, offered this practical rule: If a parent is an arm\u2019s length away, a child wearing headphones should still be able to hear when asked a question. Let that sink in: If they can\u2019t hear you, \u201cthat level of noise is unsafe and potentially damaging,\u201d Dr. Battey said. Whether this generation of children suffers greater hearing loss than previous ones is the subject of scientific debate. Studies have shown mixed results. In 2010, a nationally representative study suggested that hearing loss among adolescents had increased to 19. 5 percent in   from 14. 9 percent in  . But those figures included both   loss usually associated with noise and   loss linked to ear infections or even impacted earwax. Most of the hearing loss found in that study was minor, and in one ear. In 2011, a study that used the same data but excluded more adolescents found no statistically significant increases in hearing loss overall. But there was an increase in hearing loss among girls. \u201cBoys and men have always had worse hearing,\u201d Dr. Fligor explained, partly because historically they have been more likely to engage in extremely loud activities. The 2011 study in Pediatrics suggested that girls were catching up. Even if there were an indisputable increase in hearing loss among adolescents, it is not at all clear that the main culprit is cranking Skrillex at full blast. Children are exposed to other hazardous noise: lawn mowers, rock concerts, firearms, sporting events and police sirens. \u201cIt may be premature to blame music players,\u201d Dr. Portnuff said. Still, he added, \u201cwe know that a substantial segment of the population choose hearing levels that put them at risk for hearing loss. \u201d Dr. Papsin, a father of five, argued that it was too late to put the horse back in the barn  \u2014   adults are going to let children wear headphones to watch the   movie and to stay entertained in a dozen other ways. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get on a high horse as an old man and say, \u2018Don\u2019t do this.\u2019 Every parent should have a   flight to themselves. \u201d Still, he said, \u201cyou have to know your free time isn\u2019t costing your child lifelong hearing problems. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563615.2130098}
