In Sunday\u2019s final, Nadal, 30, will face his longtime rival Roger Federer, 35, a nostalgic counterpoint to the women\u2019s championship match between Venus Williams, 36, and Serena Williams, 35. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. Against Dimitrov, Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set, including two at  . With a backhand winner down the line, he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by   and serve for the match. On Nadal\u2019s third match point, Dimitrov\u2019s final backhand landed long to end a   rally, and Nadal fell to the ground in relief. \u201cDifficult to describe the emotions,\u201d he said in his   interview. \u201cFirst of all, I was tired. \u201d That last point was emblematic of how the   Nadal managed to outlast the   Dimitrov, time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges. The two were more evenly matched on shorter points, but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots, Nadal won 39. Dimitrov, 25, had reached only one previous Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon in 2014, but he rarely seemed daunted by the occasion. Already   to start the year and a title in Brisbane to his name, Dimitrov frequently displayed improved power and consistency in the match, even as it wore on into the fifth set, striking 79 winners to 45 for Nadal. But he could not match Nadal\u2019s ability to turn defense into offense few can. Dimitrov\u2019s   backhand was particularly exposed by Nadal\u2019s attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to lose a match like that,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cI\u2019m happy, though, with a lot of things. I\u2019m going to stay positive and keep my head up high. For sure, Rafa deserves pretty much all the credit right now since he\u2019s such a fighter, such a competitor. At the same time it was an honor for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I\u2019m in a good way, I\u2019m on the right path. \u201d Nadal started the match with dominant serving, winning 90 percent of points on his serve in the first set. But in the second set, Nadal dropped serve three times and Dimitrov twice. Dimitrov, former   player who tumbled to 40th last summer, held firm after Nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker. Neither player faced a break point in the fourth set, won by Dimitrov in another tiebreaker. Nadal, a   major champion, last reached a Grand Slam final at the 2014 French Open, which he won. He last reached a final in Melbourne earlier that year, losing to Stan Wawrinka. Nadal has missed large stretches of competition in recent years because of various injuries, including a wrist ailment that forced him out of the French Open and Wimbledon last year. \u201cI never, ever dreamed to be back in a final of the Australian Open, the second tournament of the year, after a lot of months without competing,\u201d Nadal said on the court after the match. \u201cBut here I am, and I feel lucky, and I feel very, very happy. \u201d Sunday\u2019s match will be the ninth Grand Slam final between Federer and Nadal, and their second here. In their previous one in 2009, Nadal beat Federer,       (3)     a match perhaps best remembered for Federer\u2019s tearful   speech in the trophy ceremony. That final was also preceded by an epic semifinal for Nadal, who needed 5 hours 14 minutes to put away Fernando Verdasco in five sets. Federer, the No. 17 seed, needed five sets Thursday to take his semifinal against Wawrinka, but that match was nearly two hours shorter than Nadal\u2019s win Friday. Nadal has won 23 of 34 matches against Federer, and 9 of 11 meetings at Grand Slam events. Nadal\u2019s 14 Grand Slam titles is second among active players, behind Federer\u2019s 17. Federer has not won a major tournament since Wimbledon in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s special to play with Roger again in a final of a Grand Slam,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI cannot lie. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s exciting for me, and for both of us, that we\u2019re still there and we\u2019re still fighting for important events. \u201d The women\u2019s final Saturday night also will feature the two active players with the most Grand Slam singles titles, with the   winner Serena Williams meeting her sister, the   winner Venus Williams. This is the first Grand Slam tournament in the Open era in which all four singles finalists are 30 or older.'"}, "time": 1742564571.1141264}
