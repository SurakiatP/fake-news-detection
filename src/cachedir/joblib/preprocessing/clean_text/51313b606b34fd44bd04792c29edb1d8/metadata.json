Grigg October 26, 2015 2 Comments \\nHalloween looms on the horizon like a rising Harvest Moon, and with its approach comes the perennial onslaught of scare stories about drug fiends trying to poison \u201cThe Children.\u201d \\nThe Jackson, Mississippi Police Department was one of many that used their Facebook page to disseminate a warning about Ecstasy pills that were deviously disguised to look like children\u2019s candy. The message contained a photo of what appeared to be an assortment of what appeared to be Pez-style hard candies in various shapes and colors. \\n\u201cIf your kids get these for Halloween candy, they ARE NOT CANDY!!!\u201d bellowed the Facebook post , which was composed by someone dangerously addicted to punctuation marks. \u201cThey are the new shapes of `Ecstasy\u2019 and can kill kids through overdoses!!! So, check your kid\u2019s candy and `When in doubt, Throw it out!!!\u2019 Be safe and always keep the shiny side up!!!\u201d \\nNo instrument yet invented can measure the infinitesimally small possibility that a child in Jackson would receive Ecstasy or any other drug as part of the Halloween haul. However, parents who follow the police department\u2019s admonition will infect their youngsters with alarm over the supposedly all-encompassing menace posed by fiendish drug addicts who spent considerable sums on expensive drugs that they simply give away to kids whom they will never see again. \\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies across the country have caught people with ecstasy pills shaped like candy,\u201d intoned Memphis CBS affiliate WREG , which also passed along a report from a sister station in Louisville that \u201ca guy got busted last week for having ecstasy pills with Disney characters on them.\u201d Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s deputies contacted by WREG replied to requests for comment about this supposed threat. The Memphis PD insisted that \u201cthey have not heard anything about this, but would ask the Organized Crime Unit about it in the morning.\u201d \\nThe families and the police ignore the fact that many ecstasy pill manufacturers mimic pop culture to brand their specific blend of drugs. The \u201cDisney Characters\u201d on pills are little more than that drug dealer\u2019s logo. It is in no way intended to lure unsuspecting children into eating these pills that cost upwards of $30 each. \\nDr. Jon McCullers, Chief Pediatrician at Le Bonheur Children\u2019s Hospital, introduced an element of sobriety into the discussion, endorsing he common-sense notion that \u201cparents have to remain vigilant\u201d while assuring the public that the specter of drug-tainted candy isn\u2019t \u201con their radar.\u201d \\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that here at Le Bonheur,\u201d Dr. McCullers declared. \u201cIt [the annual scare over adulterated Halloween candy] goes back to when I was a kid. Everybody worried about that sort of thing.\u201d \\nOne supposedly verified incident of children being given marijuana-infused candy took place not during trick-or-treating, but in a government-controlled, \u201cdrug-free\u201d environment: One teenager was arrested and two others may face charges for allegedly giving pot-enhanced Skittles candies to students at the high school in Miller, Missouri. Police were told that five students \u201cate the tainted candy and their parents were immediately contacted,\u201d according to a report from KY3news.com. \\nSchool superintendent Dustin Strom claims that the \u201cpoisoned\u201d candy \u201chas a different color, different look, and a different texture as well.\u201d It\u2019s not clear from available reports, however, that toxicology tests were performed on the candy to confirm that they had been coated with THC (the psychoactive compound in cannabis), and, if this is the case, where the alleged offenders had obtained it. \\nDespite Strom\u2019s assurance that this alleged tampering was \u201can isolated incident,\u201d the Miller Police Department announced that it will provide \u201csafety checks\u201d on Halloween candy at the request of concerned parents. \\nMoral panic of this kind bubbles up every year in mid-October, and the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington \u2013 which can take the form of edibles that resemble brownies, cookies, or candy \u2013 has added a new flavor to that familiar witches\u2019 brew. However, as MTV News reported a year ago , \u201cwe\u2019ve been to this dance before. The myth of poisoned or drugged Halloween candy has been going around at this time of year since at least the \u201860s. Before marijuana candies, Americans have been scared of everything from heroin to metal shards in their kids\u2019 sugary loot.\u201d \\nDespite this annual outbreak of alarm, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a proven case of some random madman intentionally poisoning random trick-or-treaters. In fact, children are more likely to be poisoned by a family member than a stranger around Halloween.\u201d \\n\u201cI have always been skeptical of claims that maniacs try to poison kids\u2019 treats,\u201d observes Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Delaware. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d \\nThe implicit answer, from the perspective of those promoting the panic, is that drug fiends are motivated by a sadistic desire to defile childhood innocence. Just as \u201cwar on terror\u201d propaganda cultivates a directionless fear of swarthy, savagely bearded foreigners who \u201chate us for our freedom,\u201d agitprop conducted in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d endlessly recapitulates similar themes put into circulation decades ago by the arch-prohibitionist Harry Anslinger . \\nIn testimony under oath before Congress in 1937, Anslinger insisted: \u201cMarijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.\u201d As head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Anslinger maintained a \u201cgore file\u201d replete with lurid stories \u2013 many of them entirely fictitious \u2014 of marijuana-crazed people committing hideous crimes, including rape, murder, and \u201cmiscegenation.\u201d Ansligner was endlessly preoccupied with the idea that black people are particularly susceptible to marijuana, and that one particularly acute danger posed by the demon weed was its role in breaking down the barriers against \u201crace-mixing.\u201d \\nThe most important reason to outlaw marijuana, Anslinger insisted, \u201cis its effect on the degenerate races.\u201d Marijuana was nothing less than the drug used to seal the bloody covenants sworn by members of the ancient Order of Assassins, Ansligner tremulously informed a credulous public, and even today it plays a central role in the never-ending plot by dark and devious men who seek to steal the innocence of \u201cOur Children.\u201d \\n\u201cThere are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers,\u201d Anslinger reportedly said on one occasion. \u201cTheir Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others.\u201d \\nFollowing World War II, after it was documented that marijuana did not promote outbursts of violent, aggressive behavior, Anslinger reversed field entirely. By 1948, he insisted that the same drug that turned men into paranoid, predatory criminals and white women into aggressive sluts would somehow turn young people into weak-willed pacifists unwilling and unable to obey the muster call to take up arms against the Communist Menace. \\nParents whose children participate in trick-or-treating should exercise discretion and supervise them carefully, but they shouldn\u2019t fall prey to officially-promoted urban myths. Practicing adults should know better than to be spooked by the ghost of Harry Anslinger.
