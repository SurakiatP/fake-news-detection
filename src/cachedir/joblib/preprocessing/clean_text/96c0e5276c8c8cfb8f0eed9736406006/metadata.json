[I, in turn, heard it straight from the lips of an administration insider  \u2014   Dr Ted Malloch, the business economics professor and prospective US ambassador to the European Union, who advised Trump from the early stages of his presidential campaign, and whom I\u2019ve interviewed for this week\u2019s Delingpole podcast.  Malloch is an ardent conservative of impeccable pedigree. I asked him what message he had for all those NeverTrump conservative types who still maintain that Hillary would have made the better President. Malloch: Get over it and move on. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. And guess what? It\u2019s not for four years  \u2014   it\u2019s gonna be for eight years. He has already instigated his   campaign and I think I\u2019ll break to you what the motto\u2019s going to be. Can you guess? Delingpole: Um  \u2014   Make America Great Again Again? Malloch: Keep America Great. Which has a certain assumption built into it: that during the next four years we\u2019re going to achieve a great deal. And that then we just have to maintain that kind of trajectory. So this argument about what kind of conservative Trump is  \u2014   is he a purist?  \u2014   first of all he\u2019s not a political philosopher and doesn\u2019t purport to be an intellectual  \u2026    This is not your father\u2019s Oldsmobile. This is not your father\u2019s Republican party. This is Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party and it\u2019s going to be a party that is more pragmatic, that is less ideological, that is more oriented towards national identity, towards   international relations and towards a degree of populism. So I would say \u2018Like it or leave it.\u2019 Forthright, supremely   and articulate, Malloch talks a good game. He would, no question, be a very entertaining US ambassador to the EU. But his appointment is being aggressively resisted by the EU establishment, which hasn\u2019t taken kindly to his subtle hint in a BBC interview that, like the Soviet Union, it\u2019s an empire ripe for collapse. I asked him why he thinks the war against Trump and his supporters has become so vicious. Malloch, a keen student of political history  \u2014   he\u2019s currently Professor of Strategic Leadership and Governance at Henley Business School  in the   believes that we are in the throes of a revolution and that the losers (who until recently were the political establishment) just aren\u2019t enjoying losing. The Brexit and Trump shocks of 2016, he believes, are the   to the global takeover by the   in 1968. Malloch: In leftist circles and in academia both in Europe and the United States, the question has often been \u2018Where were you in May of 1968?\u2019 And the question was, of course: \u2018Were you in Paris on the barricades? Were you part of the left? Were you taking that revolution to the streets?\u2019 So we can ask this question, in a few years: \u2018Where were you in 2016 when Donald Trump was elected president?\u2019 Now we didn\u2019t have any barricades on the street  \u2014   although there were protests. We used mostly election booths to bring about our democratic means. But I think there is a significant change  \u2014   both a watershed in world history and a change in the direction of American politics, that people will be writing about, frankly, hundreds of years from now. I\u2019ve jokingly said that there are four faces carved into the mountain in South Dakota called Mount Rushmore. And they might have to find some more rock if this all goes as planned. \u201d Yup, you\u2019re going to enjoy this podcast. Listen to it here.
