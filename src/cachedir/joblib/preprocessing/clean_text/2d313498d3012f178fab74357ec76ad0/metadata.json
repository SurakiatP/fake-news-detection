The first, a streaming   \u201cvisual album\u201d titled \u201cEndless,\u201d was released late on Thursday via Apple Music. It was followed on Saturday by two other ambitious projects:   shops in four cities  \u2014   Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and London  \u2014   that handed out free copies of Boys Don\u2019t Cry, an elaborate art magazine created by Mr. Ocean and \u201cBlonde,\u201d a   LP by the singer released on Apple Music, as a stream and paid download. At its center, the magazine also contained a CD version of the new album. In a note on his personal Tumblr blog, Mr. Ocean\u2019s preferred mode of communication with his fans, he wrote: \u201cI had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of y\u2019all. \u201d \u201cBlonde,\u201d the   to Mr. Ocean\u2019s   2012 debut, \u201cChannel Orange,\u201d had been one of the most anticipated albums of the year  \u2014   and various delays only added to the expectations. He teased that \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d (initially thought to be the name of both his second album and the magazine) would be released in July 2015. Then, the album had a tentative release date of Aug. 5. Mr. Ocean poked fun at his own lateness with an image on his website of a library   slip with multiple dates crossed out. The subsequent delivery of \u201cEndless,\u201d which featured    footage of Mr. Ocean working in a warehouse, set to a continuous flow of 18 perplexing new songs, raised more questions than it answered, and it was not available for download Apple promised \u201cmore from Frank\u201d over the weekend. (On Saturday, in the early morning hours, an additional video for the song \u201cNikes\u201d also appeared on Apple Music.) \u201cBlonde,\u201d which is spelled \u201cBlond\u201d on the album cover and \u201cBlonde\u201d on Apple and elsewhere, hews more closely to what was expected from a sophomore release by one of the most lauded and enigmatic young singers in pop music. Songs titles include \u201cPink + White,\u201d \u201cBe Yourself,\u201d \u201cFacebook Story\u201d and \u201cWhite Ferrari. \u201d Mr. Ocean\u2019s accompanying glossy magazine lists   album contributors including Andr\u00e9 3000, James Blake, Jamie xx, Kanye West, Beyonc\u00e9, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams, Rick Rubin and more. In Manhattan on Saturday, the line to get into Mulberry Iconic Magazines, on the corner of Mulberry Street and Kenmare Street, stretched more than a block just after 7 p. m. Inside the store, the essence of a standard New York bodega remained  \u2014   chips, soda, detergent and so on were still for sale  \u2014   but the shelves also had been stocked with copies of the magazine Boys Don\u2019t Cry in a sealed reflective wrapping. With only a few patrons allowed entry at a time, fans browsed leisurely, helping themselves to one of three editions of the oversized publication (only the covers varied). Among the features inside: an interview with Mr. Ocean\u2019s mother a conversation between Mr. Ocean and the outr\u00e9 rapper Lil B lyrics to the songs on \u201cBlonde\u201d and plentiful photos of sports cars, long an obsession of Mr. Ocean\u2019s. The newest of his new albums played over Sonos speakers that had been installed in the shop. Decals bearing the name of the album and the magazine emphasized the takeover of the ordinary space  \u2014   there was \u201cBlonde\u201d and \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d on the beer refrigerators, the cigar cases, even the deli counter. The everyday essentials, while providing an authentic backdrop, could only be overshadowed.'"}, "time": 1742561918.724559}
