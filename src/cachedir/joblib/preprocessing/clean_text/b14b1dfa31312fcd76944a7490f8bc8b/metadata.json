[In an effort to counter supposed \u201cimplicit bias\u201d within the university police system, activists within the student government at the University of   have demanded \u201ccommunity control\u201d of campus police activity.  The student activists claim there are \u201cmany incidents where students of color and historically marginalized communities are treated differently by police officers. \u201d They cite the Black Lives Matter platform as the blueprint for their draft of the legislation: \u201cThe Black Lives Matter platform calls on [sic] community control of the police because current policing practices  \u2026    demonstrate a lack of voices for communities of color. \u201d The resolution, entitled\u201cUWPD Accountability and Community Control of the Police,\u201d passed by a unanimous vote in the student council and will now be passed on to the faculty senate for confirmation. The resolution argues that \u201cthe treatment and characterization of people of color by UWPD raises questions about their implicit bias and discriminatory policing procedures. \u201d  In response to the allegations of discrimination, the resolution demands that UWM \u201cimplement a community accountability board to review the policies and procedures that discriminate against people of color. \u201d The University of Wisconsin Police Department claims that the resolution is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the department\u2019s goal of carrying out their job in a way that maintains order and safety for all students on campus. The UWPD recently added a \u201cUse of Force Coordinator\u201d who is responsible for documenting all incidents in which an officer uses force.
