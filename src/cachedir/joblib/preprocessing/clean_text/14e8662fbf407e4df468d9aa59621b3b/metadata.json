She claims he sexually abused her in 2000 while she underwent treatment for lower back pain at Michigan State University, where Nassar is a faculty member. \\nAccording to Denhollander, Dr. Nassar assaulted her five times, the first time occurring when she was just 15. \\nAs for why she never came forward, the gymnast stated she not only feared him but was ashamed: \\n\"I was ashamed. I was very embarrassed. And I was very confused, trying to reconcile what was happening with the person he was supposed to be. \\nHe\\'s this famous team doctor. He\\'s trusted by my friends. He\\'s trusted by these other gymnasts. How could he reach this position in the medical profession? How could he reach this kind of prominence and stature if this is who he is?\" \\nIn Denhollander\\'s lawsuit, she claimed that Dr. Nassar inappropriately touched her breast and vagina. She also said he brought up oral sex and even stated he had an erection while meeting with her. \\nSince the allegations were brought to light, the USAG released this statement to The IndyStar: \\n\u201cAs we have made clear when USA Gymnastics first learned of athlete concerns regarding Dr. Nassar, we dismissed him from further involvement and reported those concerns to the FBI. \\nStill, the allegations that have been made are troubling. USA Gymnastics is committed to promoting a safe environment for our athletes. Due to the pending litigation and ongoing investigation, however, we are unable to comment further.\u201d \\nSo far, Dr. Nassar has denied all allegations against him. \\nYou can check out an interview with Denhollander below: '"}, "time": 1742561788.3841524}
