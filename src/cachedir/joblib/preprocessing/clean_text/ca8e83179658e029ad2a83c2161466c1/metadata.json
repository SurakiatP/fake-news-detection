I won\u2019t give away what we\u2019re doing, but Tyler and I are not afraid to do images that make noise,\u201d Griffin said on the tape. The beheading video was inspired by Trump insulting former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, Griffin told a blogger. \u201cI caption this \u2018there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his  \u2026    wherever\u2019 Also @tylershields great   maker,\u201d Griffin tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cOBVIOUSLY, I do not condone ANY violence by my fans or others to anyone, ever!
