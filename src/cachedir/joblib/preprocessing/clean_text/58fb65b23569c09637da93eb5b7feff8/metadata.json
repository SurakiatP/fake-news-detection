[\u201cIt was very important to me for this not to be about a black guy going to the South and going to this red state where the presumption for a lot of people is everybody\u2019s racist there,\u201d Peele told the audience after the film\u2019s midnight screening. \u201cThis was meant to take a stab at the liberal elite that tends to believe that \u2018We\u2019re above these things. \u2019\u201d  Get Out follows the events that unfold when a young black man Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets the wealthy liberal parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) who are carrying out an evil plan to imprison their   suburb\u2019s few black residents.  The idea for Get Out  \u2014   a film which Peele thought \u201cwas never going to get made\u201d  \u2014   came during the 2008 presidential primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \u201cAll of a sudden the country was kind of focused on black civil rights and women\u2019s civil rights movements and where they intersect, and there was kind of this question of, who deserves to be president more?\u201d Peele explained. \u201cWho\u2019s waited long enough? Which is an absurd thing  \u2014   that civil rights are even divided. \u201d Drawing from The Stepford Wives, Peele\u2019s favorite film, the comic was able to develop a plot that exposed what he called the \u201c  lie\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019re past\u201d this \u201cmonster of racism\u201d  \u2014   a lie that Peele admits doesn\u2019t flow from \u201cred states. \u201d One example of this \u201c  lie\u201d in the film is evident when Chris\u2019s girlfriend fails to mention to her neurosurgeon father (Bradley Whitford) that her new boyfriend is black. Rose\u2019s father constantly calls Chris \u201cmy man,\u201d admits that he would have voted for Obama for a third term, and said his father lost at the Olympics to Jesse Owens and has affinity for the Nazis. It all feels like soft bigotry, Peele explains to the audience. \u201cThat is how we experience racism. The monster of racism lurks underneath that conversation. \u201d Get Out, Peele says, is \u201ccoming out in a very different America\u201d than the one in which he wrote the script for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s more important and interesting now,\u201d he says, in the era of President Trump. Peele is perhaps best known for his starring role on the hit Comedy Central series Key and Peele, where his portrayal of a   President Obama became an Internet sensation. The comedian recently reprised the role on Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show for one final time alongside   Key, who played President Obama\u2019s \u201canger translator\u201d Luther. Get Out opens in theaters on February 24.    Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742628351.5306218}
