(See: \u201c . \u201d Or don\u2019t.) But \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d released by Sony Pictures Entertainment, received reviews from top critics that were 94 percent positive, according to Rotten Tomatoes, expanding the movie\u2019s appeal beyond the core horror crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d from the Uruguayan   Fede Alvarez, took in about $26. 1 million at North American cinemas. With a    sales effort that started in March, \u201cwe really treated this film as an experience that you needed to see on the big screen,\u201d Josh Greenstein, Sony\u2019s president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said by phone on Sunday. Mr. Greenstein noted that Sony has now turned three   summer films into moneymakers, with \u201cThe Shallows,\u201d a horror movie, and the animated \u201cSausage Party\u201d as the other two. (Sony\u2019s   \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d on the other hand, not so much.) \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d which cost about $9. 8 million to make, pushed \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d (Warner Bros.) into second place, ending that supervillain film\u2019s   run at No. 1. \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d took in about $12. 1 million over the weekend, for a new domestic total of $282. 9 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Worldwide, \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d has now taken in $636 million, according to Warner. The only other new   movie in the United States over the weekend was \u201cMechanic: Resurrection\u201d (Lionsgate) which collected an estimated $7. 5 million. While the sequel took in 34 percent less than its series predecessor did over its first three days in theaters in 2011, Lionsgate spent only about $9 million to acquire certain rights to the movie, which was produced by Millennium Films for a reported $40 million. Arriving in roughly 810 theaters apiece were \u201cSouthside With You,\u201d which imagines Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s first date in 1989, and \u201cHands of Stone,\u201d about the Panamanian fighter Roberto Duran and his trainer Ray Arcel. Costing a reported $1. 5 million to make and starring two relatively unknown actors, Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter, \u201cSouthside With You\u201d (Roadside Attractions and Miramax) sold $3 million in tickets. On the other hand, \u201cHands of Stone,\u201d starring Robert De Niro and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, collected $1. 7 million it was released by the Weinstein Company and financed by an outside group for an estimated $20 million. \u201cFor this kind of movie, a true story that is also a relatively unknown story, you\u2019ve got to give audiences time to find it  \u2014   to let word of mouth kick in  \u2014   and we think that is happening here,\u201d David Glasser, Weinstein\u2019s president, said by phone, noting that \u201cHands of Stone\u201d received an A grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. Mr. Glasser said plans are for the film to move into wide release starting Wednesday.'"}, "time": 1742563859.7025173}
