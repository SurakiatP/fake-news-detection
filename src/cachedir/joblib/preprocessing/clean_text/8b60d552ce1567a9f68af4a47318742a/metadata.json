Woodward is now the associate editor of WaPo . \\nSpeaking to Fox News Sunday \u2018s Chris Wallace on Oct. 23, 2016, Woodward called Hillary Clinton\u2019s Clinton Foundation \u201ccorrupt\u201d. \\nHere\u2019s the transcript: \\nWALLACE: Then there are the allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay to play, which I asked Secretary Clinton about in the debate, and she turned into an attack on the Trump Foundation. But, Bob, I want to go back to the conversation I was having with Robby Mook before. When \u2014 when you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new \u2014 new revelation about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the foundation, and the king of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this? \\nBOB WOODWARD: I \u2014 yes, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s corrupt . It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a scandal . And she didn\u2019t answer your question at all. And she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done. And she has a case there. But the mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation, and actions by the State Department, which she ran, are all intertwined and it\u2019s corrupt. You know, I mean, you can\u2019t just say it\u2019s unsavory. But there\u2019s no formal investigation going on now, and there are outs that they have. But the election isn\u2019t going to be decided on that. \\nHowever, Woodward said he expects Hillary will win the election, but asked: \\n\u201cI think the issue is what\u2019s going to be the aftermath of this campaign: Can somebody govern?\u201d \\nWriting on Nov. 1, 2016, Alt Media freelance journalist Jim Stone claims that Woodward had \u201csuddenly vanished from the Washington Post , the phone operator says he\u2019s no longer there and no one is giving details or even reporting in the MSM that he is gone.\u201d \\nStone asks if Woodward \u201chas been offed by the Clinton death machine\u201d. \\nIndeed, Woodward\u2019s last article for WaPo was published on April 5, 2016, eons ago in journalism time. Woodward\u2019s personal website is also down.

Bernstein said : \\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no question that the e-mails have always been the greatest threat to her candidacy for president, that her conduct in regard to the e-mails is really indefensible and . . . the one thing . . . actually that could really perhaps affect this election. \\nWe don\u2019t know what this means yet except that it\u2019s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly . . . unless it was something requiring serious investigation . . . . I want to add here that in the last, oh, 36, 48 hours, there has been an undercurrent of kind of speculative discussion among some national security people that something might surface in the next few days about e-mails. . . . [I]t\u2019s very possible that some members of Congress very quickly are going to get an idea of what these e-mails are, and what this is all about, and for whatever purpose put some information out there.\u201d \\nSo if the Clintons \u201coffed\u201d Bob Woodward for calling the Clinton Foundation \u201ccorrupt,\u201d then Carl Bernstein would have to be offed as well. \\nSee also:'"}, "time": 1742561915.3398714}
