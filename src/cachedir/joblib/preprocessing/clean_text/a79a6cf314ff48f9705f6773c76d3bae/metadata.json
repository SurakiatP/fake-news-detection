Time Magazine is now trying to defend the left-wing candidate with a last resort\u2013using the sexism card. \\nAs we get closer to Election Day, the left seems to be running out of excuses for their floundering candidate. Left-wing heads are on the verge of exploding. Not unlike the Galaxy S7. So, in Time Magazine\u2019s latest attempt to play off Hillary Clinton\u2019s FBI investigation , they\u2019re digging deep and pulling out\u2026 the sexism card ?! \\nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s us. \\nNo it isn\u2019t. Emailgate, or my preferred term \u201cDikileaks\u201d is about a candidate mishandling confidential email. A flagrant abuse of the law and our national security. Also, Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t represent all women. But nice try, dummy. 1 \\nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she\u2019s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \\nActually yes, we can imagine this happening to a man. Men cannot hide behind their vagina, or Time readers\u2019 stupidity. Which means they\u2019re usually punished. See also General Petraeus . Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is running for President. She might even win. While under FBI investigation. So \u201cmuh sexism\u201d charges are lazy. And insulting to anyone who has three brain cells (like the writer of the Time article). \\nThe people are demanding Clinton act like moral exemplars, thundering from the pulpit like Jonathan Edwards or Cotton Mather. But Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and their many conservative friends are not remotely Clinton\u2019s moral superiors. They are simply bullies, using gender discrimination to give a veneer of plausibility to their accusations. \\n\u201cMoral exemplars\u201d? \u201cThundering from the pulpit\u201d? No, Time Magazine feminist shill, Robin Lakoff. People are demanding Hillary Clinton not be a criminal liar. Not really that much to ask of someone who wants to lead the country. \\nTrump and the other men on Time Magazine\u2019s list haven\u2019t done anything illegal. That\u2019s the difference, not their sex organs. Not their fashion choices. Evidence is piling up against Hillary more and more each day. Even the mainstream media is turning against her . Which means pantsuits or regular suits enter not into the Hillary is a Criminal equation. Her investigation isn\u2019t about sexism. It\u2019s about Hillary breaking the law. \\nBut desperate Time calls for predictable, desperate measures: SEXISM! Just as any criticism of Obama was deemed RACISM. \\nLeftists are running out of defenses for the pantsuited devil-spawn. So they resort to old hat tactics. Just like they do when they say Wikileaks is the product of Russian hackers. \\nIf we had a brick for every Clinton scandal and misdeed, the wall wouldn\u2019t cost a cent. There\u2019s nothing sexist about holding someone, male or female, accountable for their actions. In fact, it\u2019s kind of the opposite. It would be sexist NOT to hold Hillary to the same standards as all the boys. This is absolutely ridiculous. It\u2019s not that we are against having a woman for president. We\u2019re just against that woman being Hillary because she is corrupt and a pathological liar. Related Items'"}, "time": 1742562127.3171475}
