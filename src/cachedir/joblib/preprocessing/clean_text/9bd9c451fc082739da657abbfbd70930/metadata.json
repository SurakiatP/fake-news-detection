Every comedian tells bad jokes,\u201d the    Seinfeld star told People magazine Tuesday.  \u201cWe all do it. That\u2019s how we find the good jokes. So someone told a bad joke  \u2014   so what, I don\u2019t understand the big deal,\u201d he added. Griffin sparked a firestorm last week when a photo taken during a shoot with L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields was published by TMZ. The photo showed the    My Life on the   star holding a decapitated prosthetic head meant to resemble that of the president in her outstretched arm. Griffin quickly apologized after the viral photo drew strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, writing in a Twitter message that she had gone \u201ctoo far. \u201d In his own response, Trump called the photo \u201csick,\u201d while First Lady Melania Trump described it as \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and \u201csimply wrong. \u201d In a press conference Friday, Griffin fought back tears as she accused the Trump family of bullying her and attempting to ruin her career. The comedian was fired from her role on CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Live coverage in the wake of the controversy, while at least five venues on her   comedy tour scrapped her scheduled performances. The Secret Service also opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Seinfeld wasn\u2019t the only celebrity to come to Griffin\u2019s defense in a speech at the premiere of his new Showtime series last week, actor Jim Carrey advised Griffin to double down on the photo by holding up Trump\u2019s \u201csevered leg,\u201d adding that comics represent the \u201clast line of defense\u201d in a a   environment. Actor and Saturday Night Live Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin also reached out to Griffin on social media following the backlash, and advised her to ignore her critics.
