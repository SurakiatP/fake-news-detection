Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything. pic.twitter.com/x13iWOzILL \\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 9, 2016 \\n\\nAs confirmation of Trump\u2019s victory swept the world, many undoubtedly wondered what was going on in Hillary\u2019s mind. Then, as reports of a Clinton concession came to the forefront, it turned out that Hillary, in an unprecedented move for a losing Presidential candidate, refused to take the stage in front of thousands of distraught party goers who were expecting a coronation and fireworks show.\\nInstead of Hillary, controversial campaign manager John Podesta took the stage to announce that the election wasn\u2019t over and that votes were still being counted, implying that Hillary would not concede.\\nAt that moment, we knew something was wrong:\\nIs something wrong with Hillary? Has she had another health episode? https://t.co/yP3fYWpinL #trump #hillary #vote #2016 #hillaryhealth \\n\u2014 The Daily Sheeple (@TheDailySheeple) November 9, 2016 \\n\\nHad Hillary suffered another health episode? Was she so emotionally destroyed by the loss that she couldn\u2019t handle it mentally?\\nIt turns out, according to Ed Klein who spoke with a close friend and confidante of Hillary, that she did, in fact, have a serious breakdown and was in no condition to speak to America on live television.\\nThe shock of losing after having been a \u201c98%\u201d lock for the Presidency was simply too much to bare. And as you might expect from a Clinton, it was everybody else\u2019s fault:\\nHere\u2019s what I know, not my opinion. About 6:30 this morning she called an old friend. She was crying inconsolably. She couldn\u2019t stop crying. And her friend, her female friend from way, way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard. This is Hillary we\u2019re talking about.\\nEventually her friend said she could make out that she was blaming James Comey, the Director of the FBI, for her loss, and, I don\u2019t understand exactly, the president of the United States for not doing enough.\\nVia Gateway Pundit \\n\\nIf all goes well, Hillary will be crying again when they put the handcuffs on her after President Trump\u2019s special prosecutor recommends charges, that is, so long as Trump didn\u2019t make a secret deal to let Hillary off the hook .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628372.306365}
