The former governor of Texas and ex-rival in the Republican primaries has been mentioned for a number of slots in Trump \u2018s Cabinet, including the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, and Agriculture. \\nThe president also met with a fairly prominent Democrat: U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primaries. A military veteran, Gabbard has been a vocal critic of VA medical services. \\nIn a statement released Monday Gabbard said \u201cwhile the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump , I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. \\n\u201cPresident-elect Trump and I had a frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cI shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world,\u201d Gabbard continued. \\nAlso Monday Trump met with former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. After the meeting Brown told reporters that he spoke with Trump about being head of the VA. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I\u2019m glad that he called. He\u2019s going to obviously meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after Thanksgiving,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think I\u2019m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there and I don\u2019t look at it as a competition.\u201d \\nTrump also met with Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin who said she was not offered a position but that the meeting was just a start. '"}, "time": 1742628578.052911}
