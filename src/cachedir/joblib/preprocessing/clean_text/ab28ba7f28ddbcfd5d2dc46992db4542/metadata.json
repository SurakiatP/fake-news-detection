The    comedian and actress, who played Amy Schumer\u2019s sidekick in the movie \u201cTrainwreck\u201d last summer, grew up in Cleveland and discovered the meaning of \u201ccomic relief\u201d while battling leukemia as a teenager. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it made me funnier, but it was so amazing, how it made everything be O. K.,\u201d she said. Ms. Bayer lives in a   apartment in a West Village   by herself. \u201cBut I just realized there\u2019s a part of my floor that squeaks,\u201d she said, \u201cso it\u2019s kind of like I have a cute pet. \u201d SOFA BOUND I try to get up by 3. I put a sweatshirt on over my PJs and I go down my stairs. It\u2019s like a loft where I live my bedroom is upstairs. My TV is in an entertainment center. You have to open the doors for the remote to work, so I open those and then I sit down on my couch. I\u2019ll forget my slippers upstairs and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cUgh! I have to go upstairs to get them. \u201d It\u2019s like eight stairs. But stairs are stairs. THAT MAKEUP I\u2019ll wash my face because I start to feel like my eyes are stuck together. It\u2019s so much makeup from the show. I usually don\u2019t shower. There\u2019s just no reason. \u2018TOASTED!\u2019 I order food from my couch and I don\u2019t leave my couch again until it comes. I\u2019ll order a bagel. I\u2019ll get really mad because they will forget to toast it. It didn\u2019t happen when I lived further east, near NYU. Those people were really on it. I\u2019d say it takes me a good 10 minutes to get over it. I\u2019ll have a savory or sesame bagel. Sometimes I\u2019ll get a raisin bagel with raisin walnut cream cheese and they\u2019ll use a knife they cut an onion bagel with and then there\u2019s a whole section of the bagel I can\u2019t eat. I usually order coffee with the bagel. My coffee maker isn\u2019t the best, so I like ordering it in. Sometimes the coffee will have spilled onto the bagel, and then of course, you know how upsetting that is. UNREALITY TELEVISION I\u2019ll sit and I\u2019ll watch TV while I\u2019m eating my bagel. It\u2019s stuff I have  . \u201cReal Housewives,\u201d stuff on Bravo. I also weirdly watch \u201cGeneral Hospital. \u201d I used to watch it and then I stopped and now I\u2019ve started watching it again. They have a lot of supernatural stuff. I truly love it, but the level of believability is very low. It\u2019s very refreshing.  PRIORITIES I joined Twitter two years ago. I was late to it. So I am still really into it. I\u2019ll make a tweet. Wait, is that what you say? Post a tweet? I\u2019ll post a tweet and then I\u2019ll call my brother and say, \u201cHey, did you see my tweet?\u201d I won\u2019t talk on the phone too much. It\u2019s usually fun to talk to my parents. I mean, it\u2019s always fun! I don\u2019t want to burn my parents. But I don\u2019t pick up the phone much on Sundays. I like texting with friends, but I find if I am watching TV, I have to focus on the show. CHECKING THE FRIDGE My fridge is usually pretty empty. If I can get it together to order FreshDirect, I will have some fruit and yogurt in the fridge. But there isn\u2019t a ton of stuff you would cook with. I feel like my parents are going to be very proud of me when they read this. NOISES OFF I usually meditate twice a day, Transcendental Meditation. For some reason, I always forget to meditate on Sunday, because it\u2019s such a weird day, and I\u2019ll remember at 5 and meditate for 20 minutes. And it\u2019s great, because I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m getting something done. Even though I am sitting on the couch. DELIVERY At 7 or 8 I decide to order dinner. I try and eat kind of healthy on Sunday nights, to balance out the bagel. Some kind of salad, or sushi sometimes. At dinner, I\u2019ll switch to HBO. I can stay up watching TV so late. The problem is I don\u2019t get tired early because of staying up so late. I might order a snack, popcorn, at 11. Sometimes I\u2019ll order in three times on Sundays. People think New York is crazy and busy, but it\u2019s actually a great place for lazy people to live. You can order microwaveable popcorn! I\u2019ll order, like, those bags of it. But there\u2019s a minimum, so then I\u2019ll order laundry detergent. I wonder sometimes what the doormen think of me.'"}, "time": 1742562287.0014691}
