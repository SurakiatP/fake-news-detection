He doesn\u2019t respect our values and will exercise his power to threaten immigrants and our federal funding. \u201d Murray joined mayors from other cities across the country shortly after Trump\u2019s election in November, Breitbart Texas reported. The move by these mayors puts their cities at risk of losing federal law enforcement grants.   General Lynch stated the \u201cDOJ can take action against jurisdictions receiving grants when they are not in compliance with federal law,\u201d U. S. Representative John Culberson explained in a statement obtained at the time. \u201cIf jurisdictions choose to implement sanctuary policies that prevent them from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, they are putting their federal grant money at risk unless they change their policy to comply with federal law. \u201d Murray doubled down on the City\u2019s sanctuary policies stating, \u201cI want to assure Seattle residents that while they are right to be alarmed about President Trump\u2019s divisive vision, they should not be concerned that this City will be bullied into stepping away from its commitments and values. The City of Seattle will continue to protect the rights guaranteed to the City and its people by the United States Constitution and will challenge any unconstitutional policies that threaten the security of our communities. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
