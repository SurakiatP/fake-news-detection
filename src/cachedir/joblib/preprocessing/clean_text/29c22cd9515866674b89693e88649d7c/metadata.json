[Politico Magazine reports that it was amazing \u201cjust the how white the crowd was\u201d at the booths set up at the Annual Meetings. Yet they spoke to    Dwayne Williams  \u2014   a black man who was at the meetings with this wife  \u2014   as a way to show the NRA has a problem appealing to black gun owners.  The problem with this approach is that Williams told them how he has watched the NRA\u2019s outreach to black gun owners change that he went from uninterested in joining the organization in 2012 to becoming a member in 2014. Williams spoke to the diversity of shooters and spokespersons in NRA ads and commercials. He said, \u201cNow the NRA\u2019s commercials are featuring different shooters. You don\u2019t just see the white guy  \u2014   you see the white women, the Asian guy, the Hispanic guy, the black guy not just the NRA, but the gun industry in general. \u201d In other words, in a column titled, \u201cThe NRA\u2019s Struggle to Prove Black Guns Matter\u201d  \u2014   a column intended to show that the organization is struggling to connect with black gun owners  \u2014   Politico Magazine highlighted a black gun owner who outlined how the NRA had connected with him. This is a very strange way of trying to show that the NRA is not connecting with black gun owners. It is even stranger when you consider that one of the NRA Leadership Forum\u2019s featured speakers was Antonia Okafor  \u2014   a black, female NRA member and concealed carry proponent. And her message was clear  \u2014   the Second Amendment protects rights that belong to every   American, regardless of race: No matter the color of your skin, no matter where you come from, no matter your economic status or your education level, whether you\u2019re young or old or a man or a woman, if you\u2019re a   citizen of this country, you have a constitutional right to your Second Amendment and a   freedom to protect yourself and your family. There is no doubt the NRA is a political success. Truth be told, they are a political powerhouse. But it is equally true that the NRA is diverse, and those who walked the floors of the Annual Meetings this year saw not simply old white men, but old black men too. And there were women  \u2014   black, white, and Hispanic  \u2014   and entire families where parents were pushing their children in strollers or holding onto their hands as they walked the 15 acres of guns.
