S. arrest warrants for twelve of his bodyguards. [\u201cWhat kind of law is this? If my bodyguards cannot protect me then why am I bringing them to America with me?\u201d Erdogan exclaimed, as reported by Hurriyet Daily News.  Washington, DC, police issued warrants for the bodyguards on Thursday, at a press conference decorated with photos of the men stamped \u201cWANTED\u201d in red. The charges involve assault against protesters outside the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence in D. C. on May 16, during Erdogan\u2019s visit to the United States.  \u201cWe all saw the violence that was perpetrated against peaceful protesters, and it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re going to tolerate,\u201d said D. C. Police Chief Peter Newsham. He added that the suspects are all believed to have returned to Turkey and are thus unlikely to land in an American courtroom unless they surrender themselves, but he stated they would be arrested if the ever return to the United States. The U. S. State Department has not ruled out demanding their extradition. In his remarks, Erdogan claimed the protesters were all affiliated with the violent separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) and the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) which is the Turkish government\u2019s name for the followers of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, currently a resident of Pennsylvania. The Turkish government insists Gulen is the mastermind behind last year\u2019s unsuccessful coup attempt against Erdogan. \u201cThe U. S. police did nothing. Can you imagine what the response would have been if a similar incident had taken place in Turkey?\u201d Erdogan asked, insinuating that the protesters were a threat to his safety. It\u2019s something of a trick question because it is not very difficult to imagine how Erdogan\u2019s security forces would respond to a protest by suspected PKK and FETO members that got within 50 feet him. Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry summoned U. S. Ambassador John Bass on Thursday to declare the arrest warrants against Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards \u201cunacceptable. \u201d The statement repeated Erdogan\u2019s allegations that local security authorities were at fault. \u201cThis incident would not have occurred if the US authorities had taken the usual measures they take in similar   visits and therefore that Turkish citizens cannot be held responsible for the incident that took place,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said. The UK Guardian quotes Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Bulent Aliriza, who stressed the Turks are very serious about the matter and worried the U. S. relationship with Turkey could suffer significant damage if the warrants are allowed to stand. \u201cThere will be demands for action that may ultimately damage the diplomatic relationship to the point of ambassadors being yanked back, which is unprecedented,\u201d Aliriza said.'"}, "time": 1742563414.8748143}
