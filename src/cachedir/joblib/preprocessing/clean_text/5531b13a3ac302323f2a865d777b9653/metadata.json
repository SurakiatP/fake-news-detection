Jessica Leeds, watching on TV from home, was so upset by what Mr. Trump said that she wrote a letter to The New York Times the next morning. In the latest episode of The   I speak with my Times colleague and   Megan Twohey, about what happened next. We investigated Ms. Leeds\u2019s claims. And we wrote a story about two women  \u2014   Ms. Leeds and Rachel Crooks  \u2014   who say Mr. Trump touched them inappropriately without their consent. He denies those accounts  \u2014   forcefully. In the episode, Ms. Twohey recounts an animated interview in which the Republican presidential nominee called her \u201cdisgusting. \u201d I spoke as well to Mark Leibovich, the chief national correspondent at The New York Times Magazine, about how Mr. Trump is responding to these women\u2019s accounts and how Hillary Clinton is treating this moment in the campaign. He wrote a major piece about the final weeks of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, for which he interviewed the Democratic nominee. We also talk about the revelations contained in leaked emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and the improbable story of how a single piece of fruit, rolled down an airplane aisle, seems to encapsulate her campaign.
