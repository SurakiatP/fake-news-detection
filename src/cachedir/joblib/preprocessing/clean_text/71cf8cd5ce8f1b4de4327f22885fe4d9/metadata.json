If you\u2019re talking fork, plate and a nice dill sauce, he puts his money on white king salmon. But when he is trying to catch one in midair, with hundreds of people clustered around to watch  \u2014   not an unusual amount on a touristy afternoon  \u2014   halibut, Mr. Kirn says, is the fish without equal. Sure, salmon are sleeker and more beautiful  \u2014   and they are the money fish at Pike Place, clocking in at $46 or more per pound. They glisten like princelings as they go up and up, hurled 20 feet or more, and then down into the waiting, surprisingly gentle hands of a fishmonger. But the ungainly and lumbering   halibut is the real   of the market when it takes off to fly. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big floppy Frisbee,\u201d Mr. Kirn said. \u201cThe crowd loves to see a halibut. \u201d Fishmongers have been throwing fish for decades in this small shop just off Seattle\u2019s downtown waterfront at Pike Place Market. And for a long time, they have allowed amateurs to try their luck at catching, too. (Vanna White, from TV\u2019s \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d tried a few times, with eventual success.) The practice, and the philosophy of   fun that came with it, evolved partly through desperation after a failed expansion in the   the shop\u2019s owner, John Yokoyama, wrote in 2004 in a book called \u201cWhen Fish Fly. \u201d \u201cThe only way I was going to go for being world famous was if it didn\u2019t cost me any money,\u201d Mr. Yokoyama wrote, with his   Joseph A. Michelli. For   here\u2019s the drill: You stand sideways to the fish\u2019s flight path, then think of a football, or perhaps a baby  \u2014   one hand held low, the other high, ready to support the head as the fish comes down. Then you hope for the best. New employees said that the learning curve is steep. Fish fly at you from the first day on the job. There are no corporate retreats, no training sessions out of the public eye. \u201cYou stand back here and they throw a big fish and you say, \u2018Time out, I don\u2019t want to catch this fish,\u2019 but you\u2019ve just got to do it,\u201d said Ryan H\u00e9bert (pronounced  ) 36, who has worked just more than a year with the company. \u201cAnd the more you do it, the more and more you learn,\u201d he added. Mr. Kirn, 33, said the secret of flight is that while the crowd roars at a good catch, especially the   but risky   the real skill is in the throwing, which hardly anyone notices at all. \u201cIt\u2019s like a golf swing, you keep your right arm straight,\u201d said C. J. Conrad, 27, describing the perfect form for tossing. \u201cThen you use your hips. \u201d A   fish does a little   flop halfway to its target, then flattens out into an aerodynamic glide, horizontal but with the head slightly up. If all goes well, the final moments are more like a landing than a catch. Sliminess is irrelevant. Except when it isn\u2019t. \u201cI picked it up so fast, people didn\u2019t even know,\u201d said Zach Swingle, 27, describing a recent miss. They also keep a \u201cpractice fish\u201d behind the counter, which gets tossed around for fun, or when business is slow. At day\u2019s end, a fish that has been thrown too many times looks exactly as you would expect: beaten up by the experience. This fish is then donated to the zoo, where the bears have it for dinner.'"}, "time": 1742563922.9428294}
