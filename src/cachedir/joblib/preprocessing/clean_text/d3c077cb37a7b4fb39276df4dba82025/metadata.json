CLEAR spokesperson David Cohen describes how it works:\\nThey validate their identity using a knowledge-based quiz, they use a government identification that\u2019s validated using technology, and then we link it to their bio-metrics \u2014 we take 10 fingerprints with a digital reader, we take a scan of their iris, and we take a high-res photo of their face.\\nCLEAR has now been deployed in 17 airports, and it will cost travelers $179 annually.\\nIt should be considered that the airport may not keep your records private. Once your biometrics are recorded in the CLEAR database, this information can be sold to third-party companies for use in malls, train stations or department stores.\\nCLEAR could be the \u201csoft sell\u201d strategy to incentivize travelers to provide this information for convenience so that it could be used to identify individuals everywhere they go.
