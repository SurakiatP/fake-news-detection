Trump\u2019s assault on the nominating process. Reince Priebus, the committee\u2019s chairman, did not mention Mr. Trump by name when addressing the group\u2019s members at the party\u2019s spring meeting here, but he devoted much of his speech to the tensions created by the Republican  . \u201cNow I know our candidates are going to say some things to attract attention,\u201d Mr. Priebus said, in a barely veiled reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on what he has called \u201ca rigged\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d nominating process. \u201cThat\u2019s part of politics,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cBut we all need to get behind the nominee. \u201d Mr. Trump is not the nominee yet, but his considerable advantage in delegates and lead in overall votes has prompted some mainstream Republicans to come to terms with the likelihood that he is the favorite, however unthinkable it may once have been, to become their   this fall. Yet the lingering split between those Republicans willing to accept Mr. Trump, however reluctantly, and those ferociously opposed to his nomination was on vivid display at the beachside resort where the party gathered. While Mr. Priebus was speaking to state chairmen and chairwomen and committee members in a   ballroom, officials from the     group were briefing reporters a floor below about its efforts to deny Mr. Trump delegates in the remaining contests and keep him from clinching a majority before the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland in July. More to the point, Katie Packer, the chairwoman of the group, Our Principles PAC, rejected Mr. Priebus\u2019s implicit suggestion that Mr. Trump was worthy of carrying the party\u2019s banner. \u201cWe\u2019re selling our soul as a party for what?\u201d asked Ms. Packer, arguing that nominating Mr. Trump could imperil Republican control of Congress. \u201cTo lose our majorities for a generation?\u201d Ms. Packer added, \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear he doesn\u2019t live up to our standards as a party. \u201d To drive that point home, she came to the meeting with reporters brandishing the group\u2019s latest mailing: a pamphlet featuring an image of a buxom blonde, a pug and a pig that read: \u201cBimbo. Dog. Fat Pig. This is how Donald Trump publicly refers to women. \u201d Whether the shock value of such language still has any resonance this deep into the nominating fight is an open question, however. Mr. Trump\u2019s commanding victory in New York this week and his expected successes in a series of   and Northeastern states this Tuesday has put a damper on the effort to stop him. It has also stoked concern among some that, if Mr. Trump falls just short of a delegate majority but comes close, the small universe of unbound delegates, wanting to end the party\u2019s long and ugly nomination fight, will come his way to hand him the nomination on the first ballot. Some of these political free agents were at the party meeting, and Our Principles PAC distributed a     page memo to them and the rest of the committee members, who are all delegates, making the case against Mr. Trump and arguing that it was not too late to stop him. \u201cWe believe they\u2019ll follow their heart before they follow the herd and the pressure,\u201d Ms. Packer said, adding that Mr. Priebus should not \u201cmake the decision, \u2018Well, he got close, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and give him the touchdown.\u2019 \u201d But the party chairman, while pleading with Republicans to \u201crally around whoever becomes our nominee,\u201d made clear in his remarks that the R. N. C. would be steadfast in not getting behind a candidate until they receive the needed 1, 237 delegates. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to hand the nomination to anyone with a plurality, no matter how close they are to 1, 237,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cYou need a majority. \u2018Almost\u2019 only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. \u201d Trying to put the best face on a campaign that some Republicans say has been disastrous for the party, Mr. Priebus invoked Abraham Lincoln to note that Lincoln\u2019s intraparty opponents in the election of 1860 joined his administration. \u201cThey didn\u2019t just take their marbles and go home,\u201d he said. But while some of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals for the nomination may endorse him, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, should he become the nominee, many in the party most likely will not. Many of the party\u2019s strategists and staff members, as well as some its elected officials, have said publicly that they will not support Mr. Trump if he wins the nomination. And it was difficult to stroll through the lobby here without encountering Republicans who said privately that they were unlikely to vote for the candidate most likely to be their nominee. Some, but not all, of these feelings could subside should Republicans be faced with a choice between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic  . But for now many of the committee members to whom Mr. Priebus was preaching unity remain uneasy with a candidate who is waging war against the party and its nominating process. \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding in the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Matt Moore, the South Carolina Republican chairman, after meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s top campaign officials, who offered assurances that the candidate is not running against the R. N. C. \u201cThus far, Trump is attacking the party and Reince often,\u201d Mr. Moore said, \u201cand I\u2019d like to see that significantly decrease. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563357.0449584}
