According to an Associated Press report, Zucker said \u201cthe level of threats faced by his journalists is more serious than people realize,\u201d and \u201che lays the blame squarely at the feet of\u201d Trump and \u201cother politicians he says try to delegitimize the press. \u201d Zucker reportedly spoke about the   chants at Trump\u2019s rallies and a Guardian reporter being   by   Montana House candidate Greg Gianforte, who won his race a day after   the   reporter. \u201cThis is what happens when you try to delegitimize an institution that is trying to do its job,\u201d Zucker reportedly said on Thursday. \u201cIt is shameful on the part of the administration and other politicians to cause a frenzy against something that is guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States. It does a disservice to this country and its position in the world and allows a heightened sense of rhetoric against journalists and media organizations. \u201d Zucker reportedly added that it is \u201cunconscionable and dangerous and they should know better. \u201d He made his remarks the morning after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) was shot on a baseball diamond by someone who hated Trump and Republicans. Those associated with CNN have spewed some of the most vicious vile at Trump and his supporters since Trump entered the White House. CNN had to fire Kathy Griffin after she posed with a bloodied severed head of Trump. The network also cut ties with Reza Aslan after he called Trump a \u201cpiece of shit. \u201d The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2017,  Last week, CNN whined after Trump\u2019s White House relegated the network to the \u201cSiberia\u201d section in the Rose Garden for Trump\u2019s joint press conference with Romania\u2019s president. \u201cWe were in the equivalent of Siberia, no pun intended, when it comes to where we were seated,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta said. \u201cThat could be seen as an oversight on the part of the White House staff but it could also be seen as retaliation over the reporting we\u2019re doing over here at CNN. \u201d A Media Research Center report found that on May 12, CNN had a whopping 96   guests compared to just seven   guests during 20 hours of programming.'"}, "time": 1742562337.2121644}
