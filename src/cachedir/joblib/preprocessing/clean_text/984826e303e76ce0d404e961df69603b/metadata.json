An official at the tech event said that someone simply mixed up the robot\u2019s \u2018forward\u2019 and \u2018back\u2019 buttons, sending the robot crashing into a display stand and injuring the unfortunate bystander. \\nSo, not a declaration of war and not even the robot\u2019s fault \u2013 however, the poor thing still looks pretty upset about the whole episode.
