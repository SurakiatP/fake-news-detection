[A press release put out by UW Tacoma\u2019s Writing Center argues that \u201cthere is no inherent \u2018standard\u2019 of English,\u201d and that pressure to conform to proper American grammar standards perpetuate systems of racism.  \u201cLinguistic and writing research has shown clearly for many decades that there is no inherent \u2018standard\u2019 of English,\u201d claims the writing center\u2019s statement. \u201cLanguage is constantly changing. These two facts make it very difficult to justify placing people in hierarchies or restricting opportunities and privileges because of the way people communicate in particular versions of English. \u201d The university\u2019s Writing Center Director, Dr. Asoa Inoue, suggests that racism has produced certain unfair standards in education. \u201cIt is a founding assumption that, if believed, one must act differently than we, the institution and its agents, have up to this point,\u201d Inoue claimed. While overt racism is usually easily identified, more elusive are microaggressions, forms of degradation which manifest on a subconscious and casual level. As the statement reads \u201cRacism is pervasive. It is in the systems, structures, rules, languages, expectations, and guidelines that make up our classes, school, and society. \u201d The university\u2019s Vice Chancellor, Jill Purdy, claimed that the Writing Center\u2019s new statement is a great example of how academia can fight back against racism. \u201cLanguage is the bridge between ideas and action,\u201d she claimed. \u201cSo how we use words has a lot of influence on what we think and do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563015.5189657}
