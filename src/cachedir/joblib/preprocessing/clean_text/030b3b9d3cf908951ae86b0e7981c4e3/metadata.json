Trump, former chief strategist for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns David Axelrod said Trump\u2019s speech was a \u201cpopulist manifesto\u201d and \u201che lit this town on fire. \u201d  Axelrod said, \u201cThis was a   \u2014  as has been said \u2014  populist manifesto, and he lit this town on fire. He made very clear that he believes it\u2019s America first. We\u2019re going to protect our borders. We\u2019re going to protect our jobs. We\u2019re going to essentially draw a line around this country and fight that fight, and he laid down the gauntlet. He continued, \u201cHe also said one thing that I think will be remembered by others, which is we\u2019ll no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it, and said we\u2019re going to change everything for the better. And he took it on his shoulders to say he\u2019s going to do this. He\u2019ll be held accountable for that in years to come. \u201d (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563051.1240838}
