S. in the hundreds every week could include an ideological test. [The Trump Administration is looking at a number of ways to vet foreigners entering the U. S. through a more rigorous, extensive process that would include asking whether or not an individual has the same values as American citizens, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.  Officials working on the vetting process also said foreigners could be asked to disclose their social media passwords, past financial records and cell phone data \u2014  coupled with questions on ideology. Director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) Mark Krikorian told Breitbart Texas that he thinks the   vetting process being considered is \u201cnecessary. \u201d \u201cThe idea is that we shouldn\u2019t just screen people who may commit violence against us, but that we should also be keeping out people who hate our values,\u201d Krikorian said in an interview. \u201cEspecially for immigrants, people who are going to be here. It\u2019s less important for foreign tourists. But, we should try to keep people out from our society who hate us. \u201d Krikorian said that unlike Trump\u2019s twice   executive order which halted travel flow into the U. S. from specific countries, the vetting process would need to apply to all newcomers. \u201cIt can\u2019t be   because you could have people who hate our values coming from any country,\u201d Krikorian said. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Trump\u2019s promise of extreme vetting remained important, predominantly as a national security issue. \u201cIf there is any doubt about a person\u2019s intentions coming to the United States, they should have to overcome \u2014  really and truly prove to our satisfaction \u2014  that they are coming for legitimate reasons,\u201d Senior Counselor to Secretary John Kelly, Gene Hamilton told the Wall Street Journal. Most recently, Breitbart News reported how the State Department is increasing the number of refugees that are admitted into the U. S. pushing that figure to about 900 per week. Refugee resettlement expert Ann Corcoran told Breitbart Texas that major reforms to the refugee program are imperative under the Trump Administration. \u201cThis is our only opportunity right now to reform the refugee program,\u201d Corcoran said in an interview. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen now, it will never be reformed. \u201d Corcoran says an executive order to slow the flow of refugees being resettled from primarily   nations is not necessary, telling Breitbart Texas that Trump \u201chas enormous power over this issue. \u201d \u201cI am particularly concerned that the Trump Administration doesn\u2019t understand the program,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re being rolled by the bureaucrats. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
