That was a 17.7 percent increase in value and 10 percent rise in weight compared to a year earlier. \\nDuring the sanctions years, Iran partially compensated for its loss of market share in the United States and Europe by finding new buyers in Russia, China, South Africa and some Latin American countries, the report added. It still holds about 30 percent of the global trade in handmade carpets, Kargar further told Reuters. \\nIran shipped its first cargo of hand-woven carpets \u2013 globally considered the crown jewel of its handicrafts industry \u2013 to the US in February after the sanctions against the country were lifted. \\nThe cargo was sent to Los Angeles from Hamburg.
