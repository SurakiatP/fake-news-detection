{"duration": 1.7201366424560547, "input_args": {"text": "'This week, when The Times ran a photograph depicting an assassin standing next to the body of his victim, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, readers wrote to the public editor with questions. Some wanted to protest the photo\u2019s publication, some simply were curious about the thinking behind the decision to run it so prominently. We took these concerns to The Times\u2019s standards editor, Phil Corbett, and because the comments section on the resulting interview was particularly lively, we decided to highlight some of the conversation here. Many commenters stood behind The Times\u2019s decision. Others worried that the photo\u2019s prominence lionized the killer and would inspire similar acts. Still other commenters wondered whether the dead ambassador ought to have been included in the photo. An astute commenter immediately answered the question: The commenter also included a link to a blog post by the public editor\u2019s predecessor on the subject, which addressed that choice, and stood by the editors\u2019 decision. In other news, Donald Trump held an    holiday party for the press at    on Sunday, and a Times journalist was in attendance. Readers wrote in to object to The Times\u2019s presence at the meeting. Elisabeth Bumiller, the Washington bureau chief, discussed The Times\u2019s attendance at the gala with Erik Wemple of The Washington Post earlier this week. \u201cOur policy on    with presidents and   is to push long and hard to do things on record,\u201d she said. \u201cWith journalists, you need some insight into the  \u2019s thinking. We have found in the past that this has helped us with Obama,\u201d and she said    sessions gave The Times \u201cthought and direction to pursue stories afterward. \u201d The public editor\u2019s take: This is a case where I believe The Times was right in agreeing to the meeting. Such    sessions with the president are somewhat infrequent but common through the history of White House reporting. They offer a chance for the media to get to know the president they cover a little better, without sacrificing that much. After all, it isn\u2019t that often that some information of great public import is revealed at these sessions. That said, pressing for    sessions is always the preferred route. After the terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, a reader wrote in concerned about The Times\u2019s use of the word \u201cmigrant\u201d rather than \u201crefugee. \u201d We asked Corbett whether there have been internal discussions around these terms. \u201cThe International desk has indeed wrestled with this question, which is complicated and sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cMigrants is the broader term, including both refugees and others. \u201d Joe Kahn, the current managing editor and former international editor, also addressed this question in a blog post the public editor\u2019s predecessor wrote last year. \u201cWhile imperfect, it is accurate to refer to both migrants and refugees as \u2018migrants,\u2019 because they all belong to the class of people moving from one place to another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not accurate to refer to all migrants as refugees, however, as refugees have a special status under international law that does not apply to all migrants. \u201d Another reader noticed an issue with a story about a nightclub in T, The New York Times Style Magazine. The reader, Danny Cohen of Los Angeles, put it bluntly: \u201cHow could you not mention the problems with Tenants of the Trees?\u201d He linked to a story that reported that multiple men and women claim to have been drugged at the nightclub earlier this year. The public editor\u2019s take: I\u2019m with the reader on this one. Seems like a shadow hanging over the place that the readers should have been told about. Happy holidays to our loyal readers. The public editor\u2019s office will be shuttered next week as we take a quick breather. See you in the new year.'"}, "time": 1742564510.2845}
