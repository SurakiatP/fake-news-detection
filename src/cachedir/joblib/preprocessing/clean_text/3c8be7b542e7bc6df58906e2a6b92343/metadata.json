But over the past few years, the company has repositioned itself as a   camera company. One of the products that Snap has worked on to bolster that direction is a drone, according to three people briefed on the project who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential. A drone could help Snap\u2019s users take overhead videos and photographs, and then feed that visual data to the company. It is unclear when or if Snap\u2019s drone would become available to consumers. Like many technology companies, Snap often works on experiments, many of which are killed or repurposed into other projects. A Snap spokeswoman declined to comment. The work on a drone builds on Snap\u2019s unveiling last year of Spectacles, sunglasses that record short video clips. The company also changed its name  to Snap from Snapchat to reflect that it intended to branch out into myriad products. The drone gives a glimpse into what kind of future products Snap may be considering, which would affect the company\u2019s growth. How the company plans to grow is on the minds of investors as Snap goes public this week. Snap priced its initial public offering on Wednesday and the stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, in what is set to be the biggest technology I. P. O. since the Chinese   company Alibaba in 2014. Snap set its I. P. O. pricing at $17 a share  \u2014   higher than the expected range of $14 to $16  \u2014   valuing the company at $24 billion. Getting more visual data such as photographs and video is important to Snap because it helps bolster people\u2019s interactions with Snapchat. Communicating on Snapchat is a highly visual process, intended to create an intense engagement among people with the app. Snap said in its public offering prospectus that the average Snapchat user opened the app more than 18 times a day, and that more than 2. 5 billion messages and images were sent each day with the app. Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, has been vocal about his company\u2019s ambitions around cameras. In a video for investors about Snap\u2019s public offering this month, Mr. Spiegel said cameras augmented the way a person communicates, rather than a person\u2019s memory. \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of what cameras can do,\u201d Mr. Spiegel told viewers of the video. When Spectacles appeared, Snap faced questions from critics about why it would enter the realm of hardware products. The product is designed to make taking videos a fun and seamless part of everyday life, which dovetails with the company\u2019s goal of getting users to feed Snapchat a steady stream of images and videos. \u201cWe believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way that people live and communicate,\u201d Snap said in its public offering prospectus. \u201cOur products empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564165.1220374}
