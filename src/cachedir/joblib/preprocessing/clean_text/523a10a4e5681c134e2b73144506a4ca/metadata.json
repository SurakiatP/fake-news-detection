Ms. Barbizet will hand over the reins to Guillaume Cerutti, who left Sotheby\u2019s in 2015 to join Christie\u2019s as president of Europe, Middle East, Russia and India operations. \u201cI came to do a number of things,\u201d Ms. Barbizet said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey are now done. \u201d Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, the French luxury goods magnate and the owner of Christie\u2019s, will assume the role of chairman. Ms. Barbizet will become vice chairwoman and will remain chief executive of the Art\u00e9mis Group, the investment company founded by Mr. Pinault. Mr. Cerutti, 50, is taking over at a time when the auction houses are struggling to fill their sales with inventory, given a hesitation among sellers to consign their prize artworks in light of political and economic uncertainty. \u201cThe demand is very strong and has remained very strong from new buyers and emerging buyers,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said. \u201cThe supply side is more challenging. We have to be ready to face this part of the cycle because we know we are in a cyclical business. \u201d Mr. Cerutti\u2019s experience in Asia will be important at a time when the region is the focus of increasing attention as fertile ground for new buyers. (Its rival, Phillips, recently had its first full   sale in Hong Kong.) Ms. Barbizet, 61  \u2014   a longtime top aide to Mr. Pinault  \u2014   represented something of what she recently called a \u201ccustodian\u201d for the house, after Steven P. Murphy stepped down as Christie\u2019s chief in 2014. \u201cMy primary assignment is C. E. O. of Art\u00e9mis,\u201d Ms. Barbizet said. \u201cI act when it is necessary. I accepted to take charge because of the team, because the team was there and I was sure we could position the team. I kept my function as C. E. O. of Art\u00e9mis. \u201d \u201cThe time has come for me to go back to different assignments,\u201d Ms. Barbizet continued. \u201cBut I will remain close to Christie\u2019s, as I was before. I will support Guillaume. \u201d Art\u00e9mis is the controlling shareholder of the   conglomerate Kering, which includes the brands Gucci, Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga. Ms. Barbizet is   of the Kering Group. In January, Christie\u2019s announced total sales of $7. 4 billion for 2015, down 5 percent over the previous year. The company is not required to report profitability on its sales, which can carry large guarantees, or promised minimum prices. Over the last two years, the teams at the three main auction houses  \u2014   which include Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips  \u2014   have been in flux. Most notably, Mr. Gorvy announced last week that he was leaving to join forces in private sales with the dealer Dominique L\u00e9vy, at her Madison Avenue gallery which will now be known as L\u00e9vy Gorvy. But Mr. Cerutti said that he had confidence in the remaining team, which includes Stephen Brooks as deputy chief executive and Jussi Pylkkanen as global president  \u2014   and was pleased that Mr. Gorvy would continue to work closely with Christie\u2019s from the outside. \u201cBrett is a great individual but he was also a member of the team and the team remains in place,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said, \u201cI\u2019m confident they will take over. \u201d Ms. Barbizet ran Christie\u2019s from Europe, where she lives in Paris. Her other residence is in Manhattan on West 57th Street, but she spends much of her time on airplanes, visiting companies from America to Asia. Previous chief executives, including Mr. Murphy, have not been based in New York. Mr. Cerutti said he, too, planned to remain in London, but to travel frequently to New York and to Asia, where Christie\u2019s recently opened a new Beijing office. \u201cLondon is the historic center of our company,\u201d he said, adding that he would be traveling shortly to New York to meet with the team there. \u201cI love New York,\u201d he said. \u201cI love being in the United States, you can be absolutely sure. \u201d Mr. Cerutti has served as managing director of the Centre Georges Pompidou and chief of staff to France\u2019s minister for culture and media. He also held positions in the Ministry of the Economy and Finance before joining the auction world in 2007 as chief executive of Sotheby\u2019s France. In September 2011, he was appointed deputy chairman of Sotheby\u2019s Europe. Ms. Barbizet said she has known Mr. Cerutti for more than 20 years and brought him on in part because of his \u201cskills with people as a manager and as a team leader. \u201d Mr. Cerutti started at Christie\u2019s this year, after a noncompete period. \u201cHe\u2019s very   for winning all the battles,\u201d Ms. Barbizet said. \u201cI\u2019d rather have him winning the battles for us. \u201d Mr. Guillaume said he looked forward to continuing Christie\u2019s strength in a market that is changing. \u201cThe company is in a good place,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will try to maintain the company at this level. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561935.7463806}
