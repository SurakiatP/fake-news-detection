In any event, it appears there was no visible evidence Brooks suffered bodily distress as the lethal drugs were administered, prompting Alabama Prison Commissioner Jeff Dunn to say that the execution with the controversial sedative drug midazolam \u2018went exactly as planned[.]\u201d ( See \u201c Executions are hardly an exact science ,\u201d on February 8, 2016, and \u201c Courts denied phone to attorneys of man condemned to death ,\u201d on February 9, 2016). \\nBoy, was I wrong. I was wrong just like Commissioner Dunn, and every media representative and Alabama law enforcement official in attendance was wrong \u2013 for painting Mr. Brooks\u2019 execution as a peaceful passing, like he just curled up in a comfy hammock and dozed off \u2013 never to wake again. \\nIn a federal court filing on April 15, 2016, that has been inexplicably unreported in the media, Mr. Brooks\u2019 federal defenders, who additionally represent Ronald Bert Smith (scheduled for execution on December 8), allege that after Mr. Brooks was injected with the controversial drug midazolam \u2013 the first in Alabama\u2019s three-drug execution cocktail which is supposed to anesthetize the prisoner so that they are \u201cinsensate\u201d (completely lacking any physical sensation) \u2013 a witness to Brooks\u2019 execution, a federal investigator, Ms. Terri Deep, saw that \u201cMr. Brooks\u2019 left eye opened after the consciousness assessment and, assuming they even noticed, no one from the ADOC [Alabama Department of Corrections] took any action.\u201d \\nThe filing further alleges that: (1) \u201c[t]he fact that Mr. Brooks\u2019 eye opened indicates he was feeling sensation contemporaneous with, or prior to, injection of the paralytic. Therefore, he was sensate at the time he was executed by injection of potassium chloride,\u201d (2) \u201c[t]he final drug, potassium chloride, disrupts the normal electrical activity of the heart and induces cardiac arrest by stopping the heart from pumping blood. Potassium chloride traveling in the blood stream from the site of injection towards the heart causes an extreme burning sensation as it moves through the body destroying the internal organs,\u201d and (3) in the event the inmate is not properly anesthetized, \u201cpotassium chloride will cause excruciating pain\u201d (citing a 2016 report by the National Institutes of Health). \\nIn \u201c The death penalty in Alabama: What\u2019s it really like ?,\u201d published by The Montgomery Advertise r in April, I discussed in graphic detail what it means when lethal drugs are administered to a condemned person who is not \u201cinsensate,\u201d a word commonly used in the death penalty context to, as the Supreme Court put it, \u201celiminate any meaningful risk that a prisoner would experience pain from the subsequent injections\u201d ( Baze v. Rees , 553 U.S. 35, 49 (2008)). \\nI wrote: \\n\u201cThat first drug is supposed to put you down, painlessly, like a dog \u2013 your eyes just close and you \u2018go to sleep\u2019 forever. Except often, it don\u2019t work like that. Because when that first drug don\u2019t do the trick and your eyes close like your sleepin\u2019, but really, you\u2019re not, they inject them next drugs and then your muscles stop workin\u2019, your lungs can\u2019t breathe, and your beaten broken-down heart goes bust. And then, Jesus H. Christ have mercy, you feel it, every sharp stinging step of the way. Like your insides are melting, \u2018cause they are \u2026 they\u2019re melting from the inside out \u2026 they\u2019re burnin\u2019, bubblin\u2019, liquefyin\u2019 \u2026 like a bonfire raging inside of you \u2026 and you\u2019re the witch. You ever hear that expression a death by a thousand cuts? The needle, the \u2018big jab,\u2019 the \u2018stainless steel ride,\u2019 \u2013 whatever you want to call this lethal injection business \u2013 it may be worse.\u201d \\nAttached to their filing pending before The Honorable Chief District Judge W. Keith Watkins, Smith and Brooks\u2019 federal defenders have attached a sworn affidavit from Ms. Deep about her observation that \u201c[b]efore the curtains were closed, Mr. Brooks\u2019 left eye opened, and was still open when the execution chamber curtains were closed.\u201d Medical experts, they allege, indicate that it is medically impossible for Mr. Brooks\u2019 eye to have opened during his execution unless he was experiencing exactly that type of \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids. \\nAlabama\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office, beleaguered Governor Robert Bentley, and ADOC have not, to this date, offered any substantive response to the federal defenders\u2019 claims about what now appears to be yet another shameful example of a botched U.S. execution \u2013 in which a death row inmate was forced to suffer cruel and unusual punishment \u2013 in the name of justice. \\nTommy Arthur\u2019s execution in Alabama, scheduled for November 3, will mimic Mr. Brooks\u2019 gruesome demise if allowed to proceed. Ronald Bert Smith\u2019s execution date follows closely after on December 8. Will the people of Alabama allow these executions to go forward in their name, or will they, in the name of all that is good, and all that is right, demand that Governor Bentley immediately declare a halt to all state executions? \\nWhy? Because Alabama may have just burned a man alive.
