Hundreds of police officers in Thessaloniki, the country\u2019s   city, began knocking on doors early in the morning to remind residents within a radius of two kilometers, about 1. 2 miles, to leave their homes. Though residents had been given several days\u2019 warning, with leaflets posted around the city and an online campaign by the local authorities, some were reluctant to leave and had to be convinced by the police that their properties would remain intact. \u201cThe security measures might be excessive, but it\u2019s better to be excessive and be safe,\u201d Greece\u2019s public order minister, Nikos Toskas, warned in a televised message. The bomb was found last week under the gas station during excavation work aimed at expanding storage tanks. It was about five feet long and weighed about 550 pounds  \u2014     of which was explosive, and the rest casing. The bomb had been dropped onto Thessaloniki by Allied forces in 1943 or 1944, toward the end of Greece\u2019s occupation by Nazi Germany, according to the Greek news media. On Sunday, residents were transported by bus to schools and sports venues. Greek television broadcast images of bemused pensioners, many of whom lived through the Nazi occupation of Greece, sitting on plastic chairs and drinking bottled water provided by the local government. Others carried pet cats in boxes through empty streets or led   children by the hand as army officers stood guard near the   gas station. Hundreds of refugees who have been living at a former toilet paper factory, including many Syrians who fled strife in their country, were taken by aid workers to the city\u2019s archaeological museum for the day. They were given snacks and taken to see the artifacts, aid workers said. \u201cThe refugees accepted the situation with stoicism and understanding,\u201d Vassilis Karambidis, who runs the center, told Greece\u2019s   news agency. \u201cThere were no protests, and those who were reluctant initially ultimately came round to the need to vacate the center. \u201d Over the course of an hour and a half, three Greek military pyrotechnic experts defused the bomb in an operation that \u201cwent very smoothly,\u201d Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the regional governor, told reporters. He had declared a state of emergency in the city for the operation, suspending train routes and church services. The bomb was loaded onto an army vehicle and taken to a military shooting range near the city to be destroyed, Mr. Tzitzikostas said. About five hours after the defusion, residents started returning home. A local military spokesman, Colonel Nikolaos Fanios, played down the operation, noting that army experts had defused similar bombs found near the city\u2019s international airport in the past. \u201cThis is a routine event for the army,\u201d he told the Greek news media. The discovery of the bomb in a densely populated area, however, made Sunday\u2019s evacuation necessary, he said, noting that an accidental explosion would have resulted in deaths within the   radius.'"}, "time": 1742564064.8721092}
