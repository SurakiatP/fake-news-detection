Four of   Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet choices faced aggressive questions, but avoided any major stumbles. Here are 10 highlights: \u25a0 Representative Tom Price of Georgia, picked to be health secretary, said repealing the Affordable Care Act would not leave millions without health insurance. \u25a0 Mr. Price offered lofty goals for replacing the law but gave few details about the administration\u2019s plans. \u25a0 He did not rule out cuts to Medicare or Medicaid. \u25a0 Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and the pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said he disagreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s statement that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d but hedged when asked how much of it is caused by human activity. \u25a0 He defended what he called \u201ccommon sense\u201d environmental regulation, arguing that farmers, ranchers and business had been hurt by intrusive federal rules. \u25a0 Mr. Pruitt said he would not deny the government\u2019s finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a threat: \u201cThat is a law of the land. \u201d \u25a0 Wilbur Ross, selected to be commerce secretary, had a message for Mexico and Canada: Be ready to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u25a0 Some Republicans said they were taken aback by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose big tariffs, but Mr. Ross assured them that the   was merely being a good negotiator. \u25a0 Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for ambassador to the United Nations, criticized the international body\u2019s treatment of Israel. \u25a0 Ms. Haley said there would not be a Muslim registry in the United States. Mr. Price tried to offer reassurance that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would not leave millions of people suddenly without health insurance, but Democrats challenged him repeatedly on that point. \u201cOne of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that nobody\u2019s interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody,\u201d Mr. Price said. But Mr. Price gave up few details about Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who ran for president as a Democrat, pressed Mr. Price on whether he viewed health care as \u201ca right. \u201d Mr. Price deflected. \u201cWe\u2019re a compassionate society,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not a compassionate society,\u201d Mr. Sanders shot back, lamenting the United States\u2019 treatment of some of its neediest citizens. Mr. Sanders also parsed Mr. Price\u2019s remark that Americans deserved \u201caccess\u201d to   health care. \u201cI have access to buying a $10 million home,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the money to do that. \u201d Mr. Price, who has faced intense scrutiny and criticism from Democrats over his stock trades while in Congress, found a defender in Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cTo question your motives, I think, is insulting,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cTo question whether you\u2019re honest is insulting. \u201d Democrats have made clear their deep discontent with Mr. Price\u2019s nomination. But one of them, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, found a silver lining with the nominee, who happens to be an orthopedic surgeon. \u201cI have never shown a knee, my knee, to any nominee before Dr. Price came to my office,\u201d Mr. Bennet disclosed when it was his turn at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cBut he gave me some free medical advice and I\u2019m grateful. \u201d \u201cHow you doing?\u201d Mr. Price chimed in, showing a glimpse of his bedside manner. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, but I\u2019ll talk to you after it\u2019s over,\u201d Mr. Bennet said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of you. \u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, pressed Mr. Price to address Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid. \u201cDo you believe he was telling the truth?\u201d she asked. \u201cI believe so, yes,\u201d Mr. Price said. Ms. Warren went on to ask Mr. Price to guarantee that he would \u201csafeguard\u201d that pledge and not use his administrative power to \u201ccarry out a single dollar of cuts to Medicare or Medicaid eligibility or benefits. \u201d Mr. Price did not provide such an assurance. Mr. Pruitt, whose hearing attracted dozens of protesters to the Capitol, defended his   position that excessive government regulation was hurting business and energy development. Mr. Pruitt said his \u201cfirst and primary goal\u201d as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency would be \u201cto return the agency to that core mission of protecting the American people through common sense and lawful regulations. \u201d He said that \u201cfarmers, ranchers, landowners and   owners have recently felt hopeless, subject to a   torrent of new regulations that only a lawyer can understand. \u201d \u201cThey fear the E. P. A. and that just shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d he said. \u201cIf confirmed, I will work tirelessly to ensure that the E. P. A. acts lawfully, sensibly and with those   Americans ever in mind. \u201d But several senators challenged him. Lead came up repeatedly in the hearing, and Mr. Pruitt has come under fire for his answers. In an one round of questioning, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, asked, \u201cDo you believe there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body, particularly a young person? Mr. Pruitt responded: \u201cThat\u2019s something I have not reviewed nor know about. I would be very concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water or obviously human consumption, but I\u2019ve not looked at the scientific research on that. \u201d As the writer Susan Matthews at Slate noted, the E. P. A. says there is no safe level of lead in the bloodstream, though its regulations still allow extremely small amounts of lead in plumbing systems. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s statement led to a strong reaction online: There was also a forceful response among the Democratic members of the Senate in the hearing room. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois asked incredulously, \u201cYou are seeking to be the E. P. A. administrator and you\u2019ve not looked into the issue of lead in our drinking water supply?\u201d She called that, in the aftermath of the water crisis in Flint, Mich. \u201ca serious oversight on your part. \u201d Mr. Pruitt responded that the E. P. A. had power to address problems with lead in water and that the agency should have done more in Flint. \u201cThe E. P. A. has emergency order authority\u201d to respond to incidents of contamination, he said, \u201cand I think the E. P. A. should step into these situations in a very meaningful way. \u201d Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, had a feisty exchange with Mr. Pruitt over climate change and ethics. Mr. Markey started out by revealing a bit of daylight between the positions of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt on climate change. Mr. Markey noted that Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax created by \u201cthe Chinese. \u201d\u201d Mr. Markey asked whether Mr. Pruitt agreed with the president elect on that point. \u201cI do not believe that climate change is a hoax,\u201d Mr. Pruitt replied. \u201cO. K. that\u2019s important for the president to hear,\u201d Mr. Markey responded. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, the nominee for United States ambassador to the United Nations, was the subject of rather mild questioning, but that did not mean the hearing was  . \u201cI am concerned with your lack of foreign policy experience,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. But he then praised Ms. Haley for leading the fight to take down a Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina statehouse property. For her part, Ms. Haley pivoted to an issue of central concern to Republicans, and many Democrats: the United Nations\u2019 relationship with Israel. \u201cAny honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with U. S. interests,\u201d Ms. Haley said, noting the body\u2019s 20 resolutions against Israel, more than against Syria, Iran and North Korea. \u201cThis cannot continue,\u201d she said, also criticizing the United States\u2019 abstention from the latest such resolution against Israel. \u201cI will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the United States,\u201d she said. She also was asked whether she agreed with sanctions on Russia. \u201cI think that Russia has to have positive actions before we lift any sanctions on Russia. \u201d What about a Muslim registry? Nope, Ms. Haley said, not going to happen. Mr. Ross kicked off his confirmation hearing by taking a tough stance on China, describing the country as protectionist. \u201cThey talk much more about free trade than they actually practice,\u201d he said. Mr. Ross\u2019s stance echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s own   approach. The   rankled many by accepting a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan, challenging the   One China principle and heightening tensions with the country before he even takes office. In an unexpected revelation, Mr. Ross admitted he had unknowingly employed an undocumented household worker, a fact he said he discovered while preparing for his Senate confirmation process. Mr. Ross said the employee had presented a Social Security card and a valid driver\u2019s license, both bearing that individual\u2019s name, when hired in 2009. But during a check over the past month, the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation. He fired the employee immediately, he said. \u201cWe did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment, and it turned out that was incorrect,\u201d Mr. Ross said. During that roughly   period, Mr. Ross said he paid all applicable taxes without incident on that employee, using the Social Security number he had been given.'"}, "time": 1742563591.3804948}
