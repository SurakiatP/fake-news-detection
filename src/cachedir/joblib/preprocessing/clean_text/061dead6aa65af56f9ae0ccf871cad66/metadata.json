[Announcing the arrests Monday, an incredulous Carabinieri Gen. Giuseppe Governale summarized the scam by saying: \u201cThe welcome center and \u2018Mercy\u2019 were the ATMs of the mafia. \u201d  Investigators said the Arena clan of the Calabrian \u2019ndrangheta mob had secured a lock on servicing the Isola di Capo Rizzuto migrant center in Crotone for the past decade, thanks in part to its links to \u201cMercy\u201d and its head, Leonardo Sacco. Sacco is a   Italian, and his arrest took on political implications given the number of politicians  \u2014   and even Pope Francis  \u2014   who have been photographed with him. Investigators said \u201cMercy\u201d subcontracted catering services to companies run by the Arena clan, which allegedly skimmed some 36 million euros ($39. 5 million) of the 103 million in public funds destined for migrant care between  . Part of the scam involved putting in for more meals than were actually provided, and then using the money to buy real estate, fancy cars and luxury boats, said Catanzaro prosecutor Nicola Gratteri. Police said the Rev. Edoardo Scordio, a parish priest affiliated with \u201cMercy,\u201d was the \u201corganizer of a true system of exploitation of public funds destined for the migrant emergency. \u201d Scordio in 2007 pocketed 132, 000 euros for his spiritual services that he offered the refugees, police said in a statement.'"}, "time": 1742561945.6064742}
