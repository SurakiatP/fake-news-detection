[\u201cThe recent testimony of the director added that last straw to the camel\u2019s back and proved that he\u2019s unfit to serve, and that he\u2019s lost the confidence not only of the president but of the agents that serve under him,\u201d Gorka said of Comey.  \u201cBefore I came into the White House, I spent many years training and educating FBI agents, so I have lots of connections with them,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhen they tell you from one of the field offices that when the director gave that infamous press conference, where for 13 minutes he built a watertight case for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton, and then in the last minute punted and said \u2018no, I\u2019ve decided not to recommend prosecution\u2019  \u2014   when half of the agents in that field office stood up, as I was told by a reliable source, put on their jackets and left the office for the next four days, then you know your situation is untenable. You\u2019ve lost the institution, Raheem,\u201d he told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam. Kassam asked if it was wise for the Trump White House to get into a \u201cwar of words with somebody who will be testifying in front of committees, probably for the foreseeable future, who will become a face on the national media, who will write his memoirs now about his time there and his experiences with the new president. \u201d \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I am a lowly deputy assistant. I\u2019m not going to give Donald J. Trump advice on strategic communications,\u201d Gorka responded. \u201cRemember, on the day of the election the Huffington Post said Hillary Clinton has a 98 percent chance of victory. The New York Times said Hillary Clinton is going to win. I don\u2019t think anybody has anything to teach the president about communications, what to tweet, what to say in a press conference. He\u2019s broken the whole mold of strategic communications, and he\u2019s done so despite the old ways of doing business. So I think he\u2019s pretty secure in what he does, and he will weather any consequences admirably. \u201d Kassam asked for Gorka\u2019s response to those who imply there is a \u201cwhiff of fascism,\u201d as MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews put it, around the Comey firing. \u201cI think they should go and live in a real fascist state like Venezuela,\u201d Gorka suggested. \u201cGo live there for a few weeks and check that out. It\u2019s an insult to people like my parents who lived under fascism, and then under communism. It\u2019s just outrageous, absolutely outrageous. \u201d \u201cThis is a man who, in every speech he\u2019s given since January the 20th, has made it patently obvious that he is a president for all Americans, whether or not you voted for him,\u201d Gorka said of Trump. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing with regards to national security, the economy, revitalizing our international relations  \u2014   they\u2019re not partisan political. They\u2019re really about the bumper sticker that was the election campaign platform: MAGA, Make America Great Again. If you see any whiff of anything totalitarian or fascist in that, you need to look in the mirror yourself first, and look at how fascist your tendencies may be. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
