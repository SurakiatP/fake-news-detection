Senator Ted Cruz says the party\u2019s nominating rules have been in place from the beginning. Mr. Cruz is right, and he may be losing the public argument anyway. With polls showing a strong preference for nominating the candidate with the most popular votes  \u2014   even if he fails to secure a majority of delegates before the convention in July  \u2014   Mr. Cruz has brushed up this week against an uncomfortable reality: His only road to victory is a messy one. As he slogs through a merciless stretch of the primary calendar, straining to pick off delegates from Northeastern voters who seem disinclined to embrace his   conservatism, Mr. Cruz, of Texas, has appeared increasingly frustrated amid questions about his path. He has lashed out at Sean Hannity of Fox News, a onetime friend in conservative news media whom Cruz allies have accused of cozying up to Mr. Trump. \u201cI cannot help that the Donald Trump campaign does not seem capable of running a lemonade stand,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in a radio interview Tuesday, after telling an angered Mr. Hannity that his questions about the delegate system were a concern only to \u201c  Donald Trump supporters. \u201d Mr. Cruz has struggled to formulate a concise argument rebutting Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the top   deserves the nomination, alternately citing the number of former Republican presidential hopefuls now supporting him, general election polls and Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201chard ceiling\u201d of support. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz told reporters at the Republican National Committee\u2019s spring meeting in Florida that only Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalists believed that the candidate with the most votes should be awarded the nomination. When it was pointed out that a majority of Republican voters seemed to agree  \u2014   62 percent, according to an NBC   Street Journal poll last week  \u2014   Mr. Cruz largely ignored that fact. \u201cWe want to win, Republicans want to win,\u201d he said, before turning to a new talking point: Even Abraham Lincoln, the greatest Republican of them all, lagged in delegates at the outset of the party\u2019s 1860 convention. Mr. Cruz and his aides have also chafed recently at what they view as insufficient news media attention to his success in state delegate elections  \u2014   feats of organizational strength that have heightened his chances of beating Mr. Trump at a contested convention. (If no candidate wins 1, 237 delegates on the first convention ballot, which largely reflects the primary and caucus votes, many delegates will be unbound and able to switch on subsequent ballots.) At a rally in Maryland on Thursday, Mr. Cruz knocked the \u201cbreathless coverage\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s blowout victory in New York. \u201cGoodness gracious!\u201d he said, impersonating television networks. \u201cDonald Trump won his home state!\u201d For the most part, the Cruz campaign has dismissed concerns about the public\u2019s perception of the nominating process, with aides questioning whether the wording of the NBC   Street Journal survey truly captured voter sentiment. Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa religious leader and a national chairman for Mr. Cruz, said Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints had heightened doubts about his managerial acumen. \u201cThey\u2019re just completely irrelevant. They\u2019re a waste of time and money,\u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said of the polls. \u201cIt is not being stolen. Every state has their own rules. If anything, I think it\u2019s an admission on Trump\u2019s part that he went into a presidential campaign without understanding the rules. \u201d Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, said that many aspects of the primary process  \u2014   holding the first contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, for instance  \u2014   would appear widely unpopular if posed to voters in a poll. \u201cNone of this tests well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bowling league. Do the rules of bowling make sense?\u201d But other Republicans, even those disinclined to support Mr. Trump initially, have worried about the appearance of denying Mr. Trump the nomination on technical grounds. Anthony Scaramucci, a member of Mr. Romney\u2019s New York finance team in 2012, said his party remained in denial about its voters\u2019 preferences. \u201cThere\u2019s the spirit of something, and then there\u2019s the letter of something,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a Scott Walker supporter. And then I was a Jeb Bush supporter. So I feel like I have some level of credibility. Donald Trump may not have been my first choice, but if he is in fact the people\u2019s choice, I think my establishment friends are making a very big mistake by not acknowledging that. \u201d Mr. Cruz, who had argued for months that he could win a majority of delegates before the summer, has bowed to the math this week, acknowledging that a convention is his only option as he seeks to keep Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination. Mr. Cruz has targeted Maryland and Pennsylvania, two of the five states that vote on Tuesday, as potential sources of delegates, and is holding rallies in both states. But his campaign views two other contests as more critical: Indiana, which votes on May 3, and California  \u2014   \u201cthe big enchilada,\u201d Mr. Cruz said  \u2014   which votes on June 7, the last day of primaries. In a sign of Indiana\u2019s importance, Mr. Cruz campaigned there Thursday, ordering a pastrami sandwich at an Indianapolis deli and quoting the movie \u201cHoosiers\u201d at a state party dinner. He also met with Gov. Mike Pence. The senator has warned reporters against underestimating him. \u201cAt every stage in this primary, folks in the press have reported that we couldn\u2019t win,\u201d he said in Florida, \u201cand then we won over and over and over again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563067.5969605}
