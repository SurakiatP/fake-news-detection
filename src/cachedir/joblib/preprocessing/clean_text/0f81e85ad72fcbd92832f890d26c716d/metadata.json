I cannot, with certainty, predict the outcome, although my gut tells me that Hillary will APPEAR to win, via massive vote and electronic machine rigging and hacking, but that Donald Trump CAN successfully litigate to prove this and thus reverse such an outcome. Rest assured there is more than enough skullduggery to go around (on the Democratic side, and limited on the Republican side to the Bush Dynasty and their neo-con front.) I admit my gut feeling may be absolutely wrong: Donald Trump may win by such a landslide that the Soros-Hillary strategy may be \u201caborted.\u201d This would be good! (I would also relish the humiliation of the Bush Machine! I want to see them gnash their teeth!) I also follow Dr. Steve Piecenzik, who declared on Alex Jones\u2019s radio show on Tue., Nov. 1st, that a \u201csilent coup\u201d is under way in America. He announced that various intelligence sources in the U.S. have been the source of the Wikileaks program. He said that there are certain elements in the intelligence community that have made it clearly known to the Hillary Camp that she will not be allowed to serve. Let us hope that this maintains. \\nIn the meantime, we still have our own bubbles to pop out of. I admit I do. There is so much more to study and learn. And it shall be HIGH TIME for the former Goldwater Girl (gone Mad!), Hillary, the Klownish Koughing Kween, to be dumped into the Ashbin of History. Once this happens, the bubble her supporters are living in will finally be popped. For this, History \u201cdon\u2019t need no stinking Supreme Court!\u201d IT\u2019S COMING.'"}, "time": 1742628388.6676939}
