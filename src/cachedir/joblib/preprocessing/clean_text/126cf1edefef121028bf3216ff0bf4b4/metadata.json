I read the information contained in today's news about US and Britain deployment of fighter planes, infantry, tanks and artillery to Romania and Poland . There are multiple other news stories available on the latest reactions of NATO to continue to ratchet up East-West tensions . Through pure coincidence (visiting the property of a new Estonian friend where I might volunteer in future months to plant a medicinal herbal garden, establish a Baltic Ecovillage retreat, or host an international Finland-Estonia-Russia children's summer camp for art and music) I was less than 5 miles from Amari Air Base where there is an ongoing rotation of NATO aircraft for Baltic Air Policing . Outside this former Soviet Air Base I was able to visit a graveyard for fallen Soviet airmen and pay my respects. an_open_letter_of_friendship_and_mutual_respect_for_patriots_of_all_countries.docx_google_dokumenty.png Many of these flyers who had died in aircraft accidents in the 1970's and 1980's were of the same age as me, or my brothers who were flying for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy during the same times. I salute these fallen warriors, and hope that in the near future all those dedicated to the Golden Rule (reciprocity) and Brotherly Love (communal concern) can overcome old and outdated Cold War stereotypes to build a fear free world dedicated to Human Security or other regenerative principles .\""}, "time": 1742628585.9895587}
