Trump spent the campaign repeating a phrase that horrified the elites \u2013 especially the foreign policy Establishment \u2013 even adopting it as his official campaign theme: \u201cAmerica first.\u201d The elites were aghast because the phrase evokes the legacy of the biggest anti-interventionist movement in American history: the America First Committee , a coalition of conservative businessmen and progressive activists (including the socialist Norman Thomas) who not only opposed US entry into World War II, but also pointed to the authoritarian tendencies of the Franklin Roosevelt administration, which they feared would be exacerbated in wartime \u2013 as indeed they were . Smeared by pro-war liberals and their Communist party allies as \u201cNazi sympathizers\u201d \u2014 in the same way antiwar activists were later accused of being pro-Communist, pro-Saddam Hussein, pro-terrorist, etc. \u2013 the AFC has not fared well with historians, who, for the most part, are Roosevelt partisans, and globalists in any case. The America Firsters are the original \u201cisolationists\u201d the War Party warns us about, \u201cdangerous\u201d subversives who saw that in the quest for a \u201cworld order,\u201d Americans would lose their old republic. Which is precisely what happened . Whether consciously or not, Trump has revived this long-disdained trend in American politics, and, what\u2019s more, he has won. So how does \u2013or should \u2013 he translate this kind of rhetoric into reality? What follows is the first of a series of columns on what a foreign policy that puts \u201cAmerica first\u201d would look like. Today we deal with US-Russian relations. Stop the new cold war \u2013 Hillary Clinton\u2019s unhinged accusation that Trump is a \u201cRussian puppet\u201d gave us a scary preview of what Russo-American relations would be like if she had won. These crazed charges were in response to Trump\u2019s polar opposite view, exemplified when he repeatedly said \u201c Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could get along with Russia? \u201d Given a clear choice between a new cold war and rapprochement, voters clearly preferred the latter. Now it\u2019s time to translate rhetoric into reality. Trump should immediately meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and begin negotiating a comprehensive accord to settle all outstanding issues, including: Unilaterally lifting US sanctions against Russia \u2013 This is the prerequisite for productive negotiations, a signal that we don\u2019t consider the Russians our enemies, and that the vindictive policies pursued by the previous administration are a thing of the past. Renewing arms limitations \u2013 Several arms reduction treaties have been allowed to lapse , or have been nullified , increasing the danger of open conflict that could end in disaster. Of particular importance is reviving the joint anti-proliferation efforts designed to locate and secure \u201cloose nukes\u201d floating around the post-Soviet regions. Pulling back US troops from provocative \u201cmilitary exercises\u201d \u2013 This is another prerequisite for mutually advantageous relations. The Russians rationally perceive a threat to their security as long as NATO troops are mobilizing at the gates of Moscow . Removing this provocation is essential to normalizing relations. Abjuring a \u201cmissile shield\u201d in Eastern Europe \u2013 The rationale for a \u201cmissile shield\u201d has always been the alleged threat of an attack on Eastern Europe by \u2026 Iran . Aside from being a lie, this is not a very convincing lie: indeed, it is nonsensical. The reality is that a) the real target is Russia, and b) Russia\u2019s military budget \u2013 now undergoing reductions \u2013 is dwarfed by Europe\u2019s: Russia\u2019s GDP is the equivalent of Spain\u2019s . The idea that they\u2019re going to invade and conquer Europe is pure fiction. Recognizing the referendum that overwhelmingly voted to reunite Crimea with Russia \u2013 The regime change operation that overthrew the democratically elected government of President Viktor Yanukovich and plunged that country into chaos was sponsored and succored by the US , acting in concert with Germany and other European powers. And it was a mistake, one that could have just as far reaching consequences as our disastrous policy in Iraq. Crimea was handed to Ukraine before the fall of the Berlin Wall by then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 : it had been an integral part of Russia since the days of Catherine the Great. This thorn in the side of US-Russian relations must be pulled. Setting up a US-Russian working group, also involving regional stakeholders, to resolve the \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in South Ossetia, Transnistria, Abhazia, and Nagorno-Karabakh - These are all tripwires that, due to our membership in NATO, and other commitments,could result in open conflict between the US and Russia. Do we really want to go to war with a nuclear-armed country in order to defend Moldova\u2019s claims to rebellious Transnistria ? Neutralizing Ukraine \u2013 Ukraine, formerly part of the old Soviet Union, is now an independent nation, and a sore point between the US and Russia. The current regime is unstable, corrupt, and dependent on US aid. We have no legitimate national interests in propping it up: we do have an interest in reducing tensions in the region. Ukraine should be \u201cneutralized,\u201d i.e. kept out of NATO. Furthermore, US troops currently on \u201ctraining\u201d missions there should be withdrawn in exchange for a pledge guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. Resolving the Syrian conflict \u2013 The cries of the War Party to \u201csolve\u201d the Syrian civil war in favor of Islamist rebels have drowned out all sensible realistic solutions to the horrific conflict that has torn that nation apart. It\u2019s time for a fresh approach. First on the agenda is abandoning the bankrupt policy of regime-change that has led to tragic consequences in Libya, Iraq, and now Syria. Funding for the rebels must be ended: as Trump has said \u201c We have no idea who these people are ,\u201d and he is absolutely right. All too often we have wound up swelling the ranks of al-Qaeda and its sympathizers by trying to micro-manage the future of that country. Russian intervention on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has complicated the conflict and risks involving US \u201cadvisors\u201d in direct confrontation with both Russian and Syrian government forces. We should immediately reestablish diplomatic relations with the Syrian government, appoint an Ambassador, and begin trilateral negotiations with Russia and the Assad government about how to deal with ISIS. While the Iraq and Afghan conflicts have eaten up most of the energy and attention of US policymakers, relations with Russia have suffered \u2014 and have been allowed to dangerously degenerate under President Obama. The famous \u201cRussian reset\u201d consisted of a series of demands made by Washington \u2013 e.g. overflight of Russian territory to resupply US troops in Afghanistan \u2013 without any corresponding concessions except on the margins. The main issue \u2013 NATO\u2019s relentless eastward march and the continuing US regime change campaign in Syria \u2013 were ignored in spite of Russian entreaties. The core of contention is the undefined role of NATO in the post-Soviet world. As President-elect Trump said during the campaign, the alliance is \u201c obsolete \u201d \u2013 and a financial burden on the US. An \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy worthy of the name must reevaluate NATO, and be prepared to abandon it if it cannot or will not be fundamentally transformed. NATO\u2019s original mission was to protect Western Europe from a Soviet invasion that never came \u2013 and now that the Soviet Union is no more, and the nations of the former Warsaw Pact are out of the Russian orbit, it\u2019s high time Europe began to stand on its own. We have to ask ourselves: Is defending the \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d of, say, Estonia, really worth risking World War III with nuclear-armed Russia? Poland\u2019s borders have changed many times over the previous decades, as have the borders of most of the states in the region. Are we committed to going to war to ensure that they remain forever immutable? This is one of the most volatile regions on earth, with obscure ethnic conflicts that go back centuries: while we have an interest in peace, we cannot guarantee the security of its governments and peoples. That\u2019s their job. The job of our policymakers and military leaders is to put distinctly American interests first \u2013 and that cannot mean policing the world.
