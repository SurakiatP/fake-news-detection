But after Wednesday night\u2019s debate and moving through these last few days, desperately missing my babies that were lost either by miscarriage or stillbirth, NOT by my choosing \u2026 I can\u2019t help but pen these words,\u201d Andrews wrote. \\n\u201cFor the first time in over a year, I watched and heard Donald Trump be sympathetic, dare I say, convicted even, of what he was saying. When he said (concerning abortion), \u2018That\u2019s not OK with me\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019s not acceptable,\u2019 and that he would appoint pro-life Supreme Court Justices \u2026 that was it. As a Christian, my choice was clear,\u201d she continued, referring to the GOP nominee\u2019s stance against abortion that he asserted during the Oct. 19 presidential debate. \\nAt the debate, Clinton voiced her support for abortion , including partial birth abortion. Previously she had stated that a fetus does not have constitutional rights.   \\nClinton\u2019s stance on abortion is not something Andrews takes lightly, as she has seen and held a fetus outside the womb. \\n\u201cGabrielle was small, but even at 20 weeks she had all 10 fingers, all 10 toes, she had a beautiful face with a nose, lips, eyes and ears \u2026 she even had a cute little bum,\u201d Andrews explained. \\n\u201cShe was loved and she was wanted. Unfortunately she couldn\u2019t be saved. But thousands more, just like her, can be \u2026 just not under a Clinton presidency. Hillary Clinton would probably call this post \u2018scare rhetoric\u2019\u2026 So be it. The idea of dismembering a human child SHOULD be scary.\u201d \\nAndrews continued to explain why the government should protect all human life.  '"}, "time": 1742563908.8215292}
