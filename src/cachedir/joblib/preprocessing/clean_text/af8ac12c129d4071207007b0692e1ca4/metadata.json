It\u2019s the perfect time to wake up and see the corrupt ruling elite in action and in real-time. Mass deception is at an all-time high. Every day the deceivers speak on TV, boldly telling us more and more lies without shame. Your enslavement is at stake and they are the chosen mouthpieces to make this happen. These master deceivers and sorcerers are the reason humanity is where it is today. They are the reason why the 9/11 criminals got away with it and they are the reason for the post-9/11 march toward the new world order that we are in now. They (the deceptive mainstream media) are the reason for the alternative media and for the truth movement. I\u2019m sure most readers already know this very well. It only follows then that historic revelations and leaks of corruption and lawlessness call for historic lies, deceit and counter propaganda in order to implement some level of damage control. And frankly that is exactly what we are seeing coming from CNN and the rest of the (Hillary supporting liberal left) corporate media in response to the recent Project Veritas Action bombshell revelation of corruption videos produced by James O\u2019Keefe. The video tells a very clear story of corruption going all the way up to the DNC and now Hillary herself. The video conversation cannot expose Hillary and the DNC any more right? We\u2019re all thinking, there is no way around these very damning videos right? Actually, there is one thing about the ruling elite and their play-along stooges, there is no situation, no accusation, no video or audio proof, no firsthand testimony, no form of evidence that is too much for them to outright deny, discredit, downplay, ignore or deflect. None whatsoever. So as truth seekers, rather than getting upset with the tactics employed by the criminal elite and their minions, let\u2019s admire them and list them for all of us to see. The following are just some of the excuses and tactics being employed by the talking heads; in this case I will only quote two individuals from a recent CNN panel discussing the topic of the new revelations of Clinton, DNC corruption. First there\u2019s Gloria Borger- CNN Chief Political Analyst who appears to be the \u201cexpert\u201d propagandist being rolled out in front of the CNN cameras. The other being Van Jones- Clinton supporter and former Obama senior adviser. The quotes from these two individuals are not just a display of propaganda but examples of professional political damage control. That is, lies to keep the masses confused and in the dark to what is really happening: Below are some of Gloria Borger\u2019s recent statements followed by my responses. 1- \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the video was gotten\u201d Since when does CNN carefully check their sources? Truth seekers that challenge the mainstream media\u2019s sources all the time get accused of being \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d, of \u201charassing\u201d fake victim\u2019s families and they get treated like criminals. All that aside, sorry Borger, but the source of the video is not the issue here to begin with. What is seen happening in the video and what is being said in the video is the main issue. We\u2019re talking about DNC-Hillary associated criminals talking in front of the camera about things no one is supposed to know about corruption inside the Hillary-DNC team but now they do. 2- \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it (the video) was edited\u201d With this statement, senior CNN political analyst Gloria Borger attempts to push the conspiracy (without her actually saying it) that perhaps these videos are a fabrication with carefully constructed fake voice-overs, perhaps photoshopped images and video special effects that make this situation look like it\u2019s really happening when it\u2019s not. You know. The kind of stuff that THEY (the controllers) would do. Again, the authenticity of the video is not the issue. Remember this is the same CNN that tried to sell us on the laughable Bin Laden death hoax videos of 2011 and the fake ISIS beheadings in 2014. Did CNN question the authenticity of these videos? Now all of sudden all videos are hoaxes until somehow confirmed by CNN to be \u201cauthentic\u201d. This may quietly be the most stunning thing Borger says here. Notice how they are slowly ushering a world where a firsthand video produced by we-the-people or the average person which SHOWS you their corruption is by default not \u201cauthentic\u201d until proven otherwise by them (the mainstream media)! 3- \u201cThere are so many unanswered questions to this story\u201d Really? What unanswered questions? This is Borger\u2019s way of suggesting that there is a pile of \u201cquestions\u201d out there that are not being asked that would immediately change the context of the reality of these damning videos. Of course we\u2019re never told what are these \u201cquestions\u201d. It\u2019s like they are borrowing this term from the truth movement to defend themselves. When critical thinking truth seekers say they (we) have \u201cquestions\u201d our questions are concrete and definitive. Borger thus floats the idea of \u201cunanswered questions\u201d without the need to be specific knowing that the concept of having \u201cquestions\u201d sounds fundamentally very reasonable. 4- \u201cYou see this story, um, it first appears in Breitbart\u2026\u201d Again, Borger is appealing to the viewers emotions and hearts instead of their critical thinking mind by resorting to the notion that if the story first appeared on a website that our viewers are told not to believe or trust (\u201cone of our enemies\u201d) then the whole story is questionable solely on this premise. These are all tactics from a pro who knows how to twist the narrative to deceive the viewers who follow them. Of course Borger knows she\u2019s blowing smoke at her viewers and that attacking the messengers in this case has no merit given the context of these videos but that\u2019s all part of the propaganda tactic. 5- \u201cI think however this is a story that needs a lot more reporting on it\u201d As mentioned earlier, Borger is implying without actually saying it that since CNN or the Hillary-mainstream complex hasn\u2019t acknowledged the videos then as a whole we are far from the point of being able to say these videos and thus the evidence in the videos are authentic. Because of this previously suggested delusional lie Borger adds to the point by suggesting that THEREFORE \u201ca lot more reporting\u201d needs to be done. In other words she\u2019s saying- yeah, we\u2019ve seen the videos but since CNN hasn\u2019t approved it yet, who knows how real it actually is ? Now here is a statement made by Van Jones who adds his own layer of super damage control propaganda: 6 \u2013 Jones states that because the report comes from James O\u2019Keefe that ALONE (get this) is \u201creason to withhold judgment\u201d! Throughout the CNN report O\u2019Keefe is repeatedly referred to as \u201cdiscredited\u201d and a \u201ccriminal\u201d by several members of the CNN panel including Democratic strategist Maria Cardona and CNN Senior Investigative Correspondent Drew Griffin who tries to sound official when he announces the DNC official response that: 7 \u2013\u201cThere is no evidence that anything described on these tapes actually took place\u201d It\u2019s amazing how the professional liars attempt to side-step reality in a generation (today in 2016) where the ruling elite are desperately trying to keep the masses dumbed-down smack in the middle of a historic information age where all corruption is now being fully revealed. How do you side-step reality under these circumstances? Question the authenticity of any evidence that exposes what you are doing. This is apparently the strategy including brushing off the revelations as \u201clocker room talk\u201d , another new term we can expect to see used much more frequently in the future (including \u201cbar room talk\u201d etc). The \u201clocker room talk\u201d tactic allows them to take anything said on camera and insert it into this imaginary box, the \u201clocker room talk\u201d box. The sheep will accept the new term not even knowing why. Because it\u2019s what George Orwell described as newspeak . This was the biggest thing that jumped out at me after watching this CNN segment posted by Project Veritas Action. It doesn\u2019t matter how much corruption and evil they (we) expose. We now know exactly how the establishment will respond every time. They will question the authenticity of that new revelation, they will demonize the messenger who exposes them, they will look to press criminal charges if possible on whoever exposes them, and they will present the evidence as \u201cunproven\u201d until they themselves approve of it. Then they will ratchet up their own counter \u201cleaks\u201d and allegations (beware, we should be expecting a huge counter propaganda move very soon!!) as a counterattack and to distract the public from the Clinton leaks that are coming out seemingly every day now. This, my friends, is how professional political propaganda works. This is similar to the careful skill and delicacy involved in the \u201cplausible deniability\u201d tactic described by Scott Foval in the recent videos. It\u2019s subtle and it\u2019s a skillful way of doing something without showing the strings that connect to the puppet master giving the orders, in this case Hillary and the DNC. What all of this means is that it really is time for everyone to wake up and realize once and for all that the mainstream media is constantly lying to us and we can\u2019t expect them to turn on their own kind. We can\u2019t expect the mainstream media to take our side and help us expose the corruption when they themselves are a large part of that corruption. It really is time to spread this awareness and to truly prepare for a new paradigm which is already well underway. Let\u2019s signal to these liars at CNN that they are exposed and their time is coming. There is too much goodness in humanity for the dark and oppressive mainstream media led machine to continue doing what its doing to humanity. Their lies and deceit must be exposed. Endless wars must stop. The US empire and their global propaganda and information control must be acknowledged for what it is. Thankfully, one of the little things all of us can control which is very effective is our ability to share this information and help spread it across the globe. Let\u2019s do that!
