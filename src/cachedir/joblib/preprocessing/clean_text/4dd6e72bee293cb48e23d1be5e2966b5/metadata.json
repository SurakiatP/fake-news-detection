This is New York Tonight, a   evening roundup of the day\u2019s most important New York stories. We are running it for a week as an experiment, so tell us what you think at nytonight@nytimes. com or in the comments. Forget the debates. It\u2019s been quite a busy news day in New York and across the river. An   explosion destroyed a home in the Kingsbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, killing a fire chief and injuring at least a dozen other people. Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered flags to be flown at   to honor the fallen battalion chief, Michael J. Fahy, a   veteran of the Fire Department who was the father of three young children. The site of the blast is being investigated as a possible drug den. But now, it\u2019s little more than rubble. Soon afterward, a    man was shot in   Brooklyn, by a police officer. The shooting, which did not result in   wounds, is under investigation. In Newark, the trial continued over the 2013 lane shutdown at the George Washington Bridge. David Wildstein, the confessed mastermind of the scheme, returned to the stand to tell all. Takeaways from his testimony: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was told of the plot during a Sept. 11 memorial service, and the news made him happy. In fact, it made him laugh. Just delightful. Amid all that\u2019s going on, though, there\u2019s one place where things are looking up: Penn Station. Yup. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced today a $1. 6 billion face lift for the transit hub, used by more than 600, 000 travelers each day. Expect a new home for Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road, prettier platforms and even some shopping  \u2014   though we\u2019re just fine filling up on Krispy Kreme. We\u2019ll believe it when we see it, and that might not be until 2020. \u2022 New York City agreed to pay $5. 75 million to settle a suit over a Rikers inmate\u2019s death.

[RSVP@thedooronline. com] \u2018Talking Parades With the Police\u2019 Dear Diary: On my first Halloween in Gotham City, an old boyfriend and I retreated to the warmth of a deli on 50th Street. We had tried to go to the parade, but I was too cold in my flowy, black,       skirt. We were dressed as Batman and Batwoman. I had spent hours perfecting a Batwoman mask painted onto my forehead and cheeks. When I was two bites into my deli cheeseburger, three police officers approached the section where we were seated. One of the officers nonchalantly invited himself to our table, pulling up a chair. He asked us what seemed like 20, 000 questions: how old we were, how we met, our plans for the night and so on. I felt confused, nervous and slightly ridiculous in my costume. The officer\u2019s female partner, sitting a few tables away, laughed. She eventually yelled at him to leave us alone. The tension broken, we talked with the three officers for a while. We asked if they knew the best spot if we wanted to try another parade come Thanksgiving. They got a call on their radios and had to rush away. Just when I thought I had survived my first New York Police Department questioning, the woman officer pulled out her notebook and asked for names and phone numbers. My heart skipped a beat. Were we being given a ticket? Detained? For what? She smiled and said they would give us a call if they had any leads on good viewing spots for Thanksgiving morning. We never heard back, and left the Macy\u2019s parade early because of the cold, too.'"}, "time": 1742564443.1673625}
