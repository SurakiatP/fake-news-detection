In what will be their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office, he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intended to talk by telephone on Saturday about areas of possible cooperation, particularly in fighting terrorism in the Middle East, a collaboration that would represent a significant turnabout from years of friction between the two countries. At the direction of the White House, American officials in recent days have been preparing memos outlining possible common ground, including the prospect of removing some or all of the sanctions imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to officials briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has suggested lifting the punitive measures in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and Russian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State. Asked about sanctions on Friday, Mr. Trump played down the possibility of quick action, but did not rule it out. \u201cAs for sanctions, very early to be talking about that,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. \u201cBut we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. \u201d As for Mr. Putin, he offered a far more distant assessment after months of praising the Russian president for his leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t know the gentleman,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI hope we have a fantastic relationship. That\u2019s possible, and it\u2019s also possible that we won\u2019t. We will see what happens. \u201d Standing at Mr. Trump\u2019s side, Mrs. May warned against easing sanctions unless Russia abides by a peace settlement for Ukraine negotiated in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. \u201cWe believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk Agreement fully implemented, and we\u2019ve been continuing to argue that inside the European Union,\u201d she said. Any talk of lifting sanctions is all but certain to spark the first serious conflagration between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who have largely given the president a pass on myriad policy areas where they disagree. Republican lawmakers have been bracing for Mr. Trump to make this move, and their concerns deepened Friday when his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said in an interview that removing sanctions was under consideration. Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting sanctions and vowed to push legislation reinstating them if he does, a measure that already has strong bipartisan support, including from Republicans like Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who has largely shunned confrontation with Mr. Trump, has been a longstanding opponent of lifting sanctions, a position he forcefully reiterated on Friday. In a scathing statement against Mr. Putin, Mr. McCain cataloged all of Russia\u2019s controversial actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere and said it could not be trusted as a partner. \u201cPresident Trump should remember this when he speaks to Vladimir Putin,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cHe should remember that the man on the other end of the line is a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn. For our commander in chief to think otherwise would be na\u00efve and dangerous. \u201d Mr. Portman concurred, saying in a statement, \u201cWe must stand by our allies in the region, including Ukraine. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mrs. May was his first with a visiting foreign leader since taking office with a promise to pursue an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. For Mr. Trump, it was a debut on the world stage that took on additional meaning after a scheduled White House visit by Mexico\u2019s president next week fell apart in a dispute over the border wall Mr. Trump wants to build. Mr. Trump appeared comfortable and confident with Mrs. May standing to his right. He offered a brief opening statement that referred twice to the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two countries, a phrase Britons take seriously. He offered crisp answers, in contrast to Mr. Obama, who tended to talk at length. While Mr. Trump did not demonstrate detailed policy knowledge, he went out of his way to emphasize commonalities with Mrs. May. He also tried to reassure Europeans who view him with deep skepticism. When a British reporter referred to him as a \u201cbrash TV extrovert,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not as brash as you might think. \u201d Mrs. May, eager to forge a relationship with him akin to Margaret Thatcher\u2019s alliance with Ronald Reagan, reciprocated the warm sentiments, praising his \u201cstunning election victory\u201d and conveying an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for the president to make a state visit, which he accepted. Addressing one area of disagreement, Mrs. May said that the president had privately expressed his support for NATO, despite past comments disparaging the alliance as \u201cobsolete. \u201d \u201cMr. President,\u201d she said, \u201cI think you said, you confirmed that you\u2019re 100 percent behind NATO. \u201d Mr. Trump embraced the decision by British voters to exit the European Union, a referendum known as \u201cBrexit\u201d that he and others have seen as a precursor to his own election. \u201cI think Brexit\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when it irons out, you\u2019re going to have your identity and you\u2019re going to have the people that you want in your country. \u201d Mr. Trump and Mrs. May talked about negotiating a new   agreement between the two countries. Ms. May is not the only European leader worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s blossoming friendship with Russia, which United States intelligence agencies have concluded hacked Democratic email accounts to influence the American election last year. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been a leading voice of keeping the pressure on the Kremlin, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to talk with her by telephone, too. The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russian officials and companies, mainly in response to the seizure and annexation of Crimea and the separatist war fomented in eastern Ukraine. Before leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed additional sanctions in response to the Russian election hacking. In an interview with The Times of London shortly before taking office, Mr. Trump suggested a bargain that would ease sanctions on Russia in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State. One topic that may come up on Saturday\u2019s call is the fate of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012. Mr. Trump may ask Mr. Putin for help in pressuring Russia\u2019s ally, President Bashar   of Syria, to release Mr. Tice, according to an official briefed on the matter. Syria has never acknowledged holding him, but Mr. Trump has considered dropping support for the Syrian opposition.'"}, "time": 1742561779.043165}
