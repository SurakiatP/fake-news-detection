[For his January 10 article on biracial Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, Reyes found Prescott\u2019s playing stats far less interesting than the fact that Dak is somehow amazingly able to be friendly with both the black players and the white ones on his team.  \u201cBeasley is a    white receiver from Houston. Gathers is 24 and from LaPlace, La. but black. The gift Prescott has is the ability to bond with both,\u201d Reyes writes seemingly in shock. \u201cI grew up in Haughton, Louisiana,\u201d Prescott told Reyes. \u201cI go to my white grandparents\u2019 house, and then I cross the railroad tracks and hang out with my black grandma. We have English teachers on my white side. My grandpa is a principal. And then you go to the other side and people have been in jail. \u201d Reyes goes on for hundreds of words and over a dozen paragraphs immersed in his amazement over Prescott\u2019s apparently unusual ability to be nice to both blacks and whites. Reyes waxes poetic over how Prescott knows the words to rap songs yet can also sing the chorus of a country music tune, and marvels at Prescott\u2019s ability to \u201cget approval\u201d from players of all races. \u201cBeing   and being from the country, I can talk to guys like Travis Frederick from Wisconsin and Doug Free from Wisconsin,\u201d Prescott says of two offensive linemen on the Cowboys. \u201cAnd then I can go over and talk to Dez Bryant. I mean, think about the two different standpoints you need to have a real conversation with both, to really understand what they\u2019ve been through. I don\u2019t think many can do it. For me, it\u2019s not hard. I\u2019m blessed because it\u2019s natural. \u201d After over a dozen paragraphs delving into the racial aspect of Prescott\u2019s rise on the Cowboys, Reyes finally gets around to discussing his   activities and playing record. \u201cAn outside contender for MVP, Prescott completed 67. 8% of his passes for 3, 667 yards, posted a 23:4    ratio, and ran for 282 yards and six rushing scores,\u201d Reyes belatedly notes. And from there Reyes gives a serviceable bio on Prescott\u2019s football career. But since it took up half of a very long review of the player\u2019s career, clearly the sports writer found the racial aspect far more interesting than anything approaching actual sports news.
