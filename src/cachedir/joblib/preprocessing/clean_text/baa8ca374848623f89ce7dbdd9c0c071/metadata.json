He is not being held hostage inside his Hollywood Hills mansion, he and his publicist insist, contrary to suspicions of several longtime associates. He is not transitioning and becoming a \u201csoftly spoken woman named Fiona,\u201d as the National Enquirer claimed last summer and Mr. Simmons rebutted on Facebook. So what happened to the most loquacious, flamboyant, visible and rambunctious exercise evangelist this world has ever seen? Why did Mr. Simmons, now 68, suddenly drop out of sight without warning, baffling his friends and colleagues and disappointing his many fans? Those are the questions that Dan Taberski, a former producer of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and a friend of Mr. Simmons, has turned into a cultural phenomenon with his podcast, \u201cMissing Richard Simmons,\u201d which is currently the most downloaded podcast on iTunes. The back story: On Feb. 15, 2014, Mr. Simmons didn\u2019t show up to teach his class at his gym, Slimmons, in Beverly Hills, Calif. He stopped answering emails or phone calls. He no longer sprinted out of his home to greet tour buses, delighting onlookers with his glittery costumes. After an article in The Daily News  suggested last year that Mr. Simmons might not have control over his life, the mystery took such hold in pop culture that even Donald J. Trump weighed in from the campaign trail, promising to liberate Mr. Simmons if he became president. \u201cWe have to get him out,\u201d Mr. Trump, laughing, said in a radio interview. Mr. Simmons hasn\u2019t been heard from since phone interviews last March, though the Los Angeles Police Department visited him recently and said he was fine. A spokesman for Mr. Simmons said the same to The New York Times last week and declined to discuss the podcast. Mr. Taberski\u2019s storytelling and sense of wonder on \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d have drawn comparisons to \u201cSerial,\u201d the podcast about a murder case that inspired a bevy of conspiracy theories and captured the country\u2019s imagination. But mostly, it is a love letter from Mr. Taberski to Mr. Simmons: He said that he wanted to show Mr. Simmons that people who care about him are worried. PJ Vogt, the host of \u201cReply All,\u201d a popular podcast that explores the internet, said that \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d was well served by a narrator so close to its subject. \u201cMore so than in other media, podcast reporting is really filtered through the person doing the reporting,\u201d Mr. Vogt said. \u201cTheir relationship to the story feels very inescapable. \u201d Mr. Taberski spoke about the podcast in a recent telephone interview. This conversation has been edited and condensed. How did you find out that Mr. Simmons had stopped showing up at Slimmons? Richard and I were still friendly. We were still calling and emailing. He stopped returning my emails. I just thought: \u201cBummer. I guess, he\u2019s not interested anymore. \u201d Then I realized that he had stopped returning everybody\u2019s calls. Then it was just a gradual process of talking to people and reading the odd   news report and realizing that he had disappeared. How did the idea to do a podcast come together? Richard and I were talking about doing a documentary from the very first day we met. We met at Slimmons. I asked him if he would ever do a documentary with me. Did you go to the class to work out? Or to pitch the documentary? Or both?  I went to the class because I heard you could. I thought, \u201cWell, I have to do this. \u201d I thought he was amazing, and I couldn\u2019t believe he was still teaching a class for $12 a class. But I was a producer for 15 years, and I was looking to do a feature documentary, and the minute I took the class, I knew that was something I wanted to pursue with him. And so we started talking about it right away. What made you decide to shift from the original intent of doing a documentary to going into the podcast realm? I didn\u2019t want to do a   documentary. I think it\u2019s really hard to pull those off without them being  . It just didn\u2019t feel right. But a podcast is superflexible as a format, and it needs a narrator. It needs somebody to tell the story. And so it was a way for me to show that it was coming from a place of love and coming from a place of real concern, and show my point of view without making it about me. It\u2019s still about Richard. The four theories of his disappearance: 1. He is being held hostage by his housekeeper. 2. He is recovering from knee surgery. 3. The death of his dog sent him into a depression. 4. He just wants out of public life. Anything I\u2019m missing? The podcast explores all the possible reasons Richard Simmons would stop being Richard Simmons. And some of them are outlandish. Some of them make total sense. And some of them are a little sad. What do you think is going on? I\u2019m not limited to those four. The podcast is us exploring many theories of what they are. I have my own theory, but we get to that toward the end. And it\u2019s not really something that people have discussed, and it speaks less to this sort of weird mystery that nobody ever wanted in the first place. What have Mr. Simmons\u2019s representatives said? Richard\u2019s people say very little. But what they do say is that he\u2019s fine. One theory, pushed by Mr. Simmons\u2019s former masseur, is that he is being held hostage by his housekeeper. Tom Estey, his representative, forcefully denied this claim. Is he correct? It\u2019s possible, for sure. I think our skepticism of the more outlandish parts of that theory are clear in that episode. It had been reported before, and others who know Richard didn\u2019t dismiss it out of hand, so we clearly needed to raise it. But I also think Richard\u2019s friends are genuinely, deeply concerned for Richard and the eerie wall of silence around him. That is very real. And Richard\u2019s rep pretending that everything is normal  \u2014   \u201cnothing to see here\u201d  \u2014   feels a little false, too. Why do you think people are so intrigued by Mr. Simmons and the podcast? It\u2019s people who have been reminded or are being just told for the first time that Richard Simmons is a special, important and fascinating person. And I think people feel for him. I think he\u2019s always been this way. He just exudes kindness and genuineness. If Mr. Simmons truly wants to be out of the spotlight, as he told the \u201cToday\u201d show a year ago, then should you just leave him be? The concern is that he is not just taking time off. He\u2019s not just retired. He\u2019s not just stepping away from the spotlight. The concern is that he\u2019s cut off every person he knows. It\u2019s impossible not to be concerned about that. And every person I\u2019ve talked to, every friend who\u2019s known him for years, everybody is concerned.'"}, "time": 1742563964.3116684}
