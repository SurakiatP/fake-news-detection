For traditional geothermal projects, hot rocks produce steam for turbines. Over in Iceland, however, a consortium of researchers and companies want to dig much, much deeper into Earth\u2019s crust in order to explore the renewable energy potential of molten magma.\\nThe Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) is drilling a 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) hole into old lava flows in the Reykjanes, a region in southwest Iceland filled with geothermal sites. Once drilling is complete by the end of 2016, the Nordic nation will be home to the hottest hole in the world with temperatures between 400 and 1,000 degrees Celsius (or 752-1,832 degrees Fahrenheit), according to New Scientist .\\nThis effort is being led by Icelandic energy companies such as Hitaveita Sudurnesja, Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita Reykjav\u00edkur, as well as the National Energy Authority of Iceland.\\nSince Aug. 12, the IDDP\u2019s rig\u2014actually named \u201cThor\u201d \u2014has been drilling deep into a landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an underwater mountain range that extends above sea level through the center of Iceland.\\n\u201cPeople have drilled into hard rock at this depth, but never before into a fluid system like this,\u201d Albert Albertsson, assistant director of a geothermal energy company involved in the project, explained to New Scientist.\\nAt this depth, seawater that has penetrated the ocean bed has not only been superheated by magma, it\u2019s also highly pressurized (more than 200 times atmospheric air pressure). The team expects to find water in the form of \u201c supercritical steam ,\u201d aka \u201c dragon water ,\u201d which is neither liquid nor steam but holds more heat energy than both.\\nCan \u2018Dragon Water\u2019 Power the Planet With Renewable Energy? https://t.co/P4wmMRVk61 @RenewablesNews @Good_Energy \\n\u2014 EcoWatch (@EcoWatch) November 6, 2015 \\n\\nAlbertsson said that a well capable of harnessing this steam has an energy capacity of 50 megawatts, about 10 times more than a conventional geothermal well. Theoretically, IDDP\u2019s new well could power 50,000 homes compared to the 5,000 homes powered by a single geothermal well.\\n\u201cIf they can get supercritical steam in deep boreholes, that will make an order of magnitude difference to the amount of geothermal energy the wells can produce,\u201d Arnar Gu\u00f0mundsson from Invest in Iceland, a government agency that promotes energy development, told New Scientist.\\nIf this project this sounds a little dicey, as Motherboard explained, this isn\u2019t the first time IDDP has tapped into Icelandic lava power:\\n\u201cIn 2009, an IDDP rig located in Krafla, northeast Iceland, accidentally struck a magma reservoir just over a mile underground. Excited about the prospects of new geothermal energy, the project partnered with Iceland\u2019s National Power Company, and installed a perforated steel casing at the bottom of the well. This successfully allowed the flow of magma to create superheated, extremely pressurized steam at temperatures exceeding 800\u00b0F\u2014at the time, a world record for geothermal heat.\\n\u201cPower created by the Krafla borehole was never fed back into the grid, and the project was shuttered in 2012 after a critical valve needed repairing.\u201d\\n\u201cIn the future, the success of this drilling and research project could lead to a revolution in the energy efficiency of high-temperature geothermal areas worldwide,\u201d said Wilfred Elders, a professor emeritus of geology at the University of California, Riverside who was involved in an earlier IDDP project.\\nAccording to DeSmogBlog , New Zealand, Indonesia, the Philippines, the U.S. and Mexico already have commercial geothermal plants.\\nIceland, known for its numerous bubbling hot springs and geysers, already heats up to 90 percent of its homes and supplies about a third of its electricity with geothermal.\\nLorraine Chow is a reporter for EcoWatch.
