Jesse Jackson called for President Obama to issue a blanket pardon to Hillary Clinton before he leaves office, just like Ford did for Richard Nixon. \\nStopping short of saying Clinton did anything wrong , Jackson told a large crowd of University of Michigan students, faculty and administrators gathered at daylong celebration of his career that Obama should short-circuit President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promised attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton for use of a private e-mail server. \\n\u201cIt would be a monumental moral mistake to pursue the indictment of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Jackson said. He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon did. Would Obama pardon Clinton before he leaves office? \\n\u201cPresident Ford said we don\u2019t need him for trophy. We need to move on. President Nixon wasn\u2019t convicted of a crime. He didn\u2019t apply for a pardon. (Ford) did it because he thought it would be best for the country. \u201cHillary Clinton has not been tried, but there are those who want to drag her for the next three years. It will not stop until they find a reason to put her in jail. That would be a travesty.\u201d \\nIn 1974, Ford, a University of Michigan alumnus, issued a full and complete pardon of Nixon for any crimes he may have committed. He said the pardon was in the best interests of the nation. \\nJackson\u2019s comments came at the end of a long day in Ann Arbor, which included him dropping in on an anti-Trump rally held by students on campus. Jesse Jackson: Obama should pardon Hillary Clinton \\nJackson comes to a campus that is full of strife over race. Numerous racist flyers have been posted and students have alleged they have been attacked because they are Muslim or a minority. There have been anti-Trump marches on U-M\u2019s campus, along with campuses across the nation. A large demonstration marched through a series of U-M buildings even while Jackson was speaking. \\nStudents \u201care growing up in an America that is in an identity crisis,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThese demonstrations are born out of fear. Fear that the Klan will ride again. Fear that violence (against minorities) is coming back. \\n\u201cIn this election, voters voted for fear. I think hope will defeat hate, but it\u2019s a battle.\u201d In a conversation with the Free Press at the beginning of the day, he blamed Trump for the environment of fear. \\nDonald Trump saw an America that was a dry field, and instead of watering it to get the grass growing again, he threw a lit match on it, Jackson said. \\nNow it\u2019s up to Trump to take action, Jackson added. \\n\u201cThe one who set the field afire must be the one to put it out,\u201d he told the Free Press in a one-on-one interview. \u201cHe had the option to pour water on it (the dry field) and let it grow. He didn\u2019t do that \u2014 he chose to light it on fire. One of my concerns is that we see the division in America now because of that. We see classmates, roommates in a conflict over the way the campaign turned out. \\n\u201cHe knows Mexicans didn\u2019t take jobs from us. It was the corporations. He knows you can\u2019t deport 15 million (immigrants). It\u2019s not just about the adults, but also about the children who were born here, grew up here and go to school here.\u201d \\nJackson told students not to give up the struggle. \\n\u201cStudents, don\u2019t let them take your hope. Deep water doesn\u2019t drown you. You drown because you stop kicking. There is a tug of war for the soul of America. Do we want to be an aristocracy or a democracy? To be silent is to betray your conscience. You must not be silent in the face of violation of human rights.\u201d source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  '"}, "time": 1742561961.5764654}
