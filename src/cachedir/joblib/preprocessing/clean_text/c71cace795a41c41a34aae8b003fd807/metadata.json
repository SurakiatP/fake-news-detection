The best way to do it is to keep us ignorant and uneducated, and thats how its working,\u201d said Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun, a member of FAM incarcerated at the Donaldson Correctional Facility.\\nThis violence and other related issues, like overcrowding, recently motivated the United States government to announce an investigation into the Alabama prison system. Officers at one facility refused to go to work in recent months in protest against an administration they believe failed to protect them from an unruly population.\\nAccording to statistics [ PDF ] from the Alabama Department of Corrections, the number of prisoners graduating General Education Development (GED) courses and completing drug treatment has fallen since 2007-08. Eight hundred and seventy-two people received their GED while incarcerated in Alabama in 2007, a number that was at 412 in 2014 before rising to 694 in 2015.\\nAlabama Department of Corrections GED recipients, 2007-2015. Data provided by Alabama Department of Corrections; Graph by Shadowproof.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s no intervention between the issues that [a person] had when they came to prison and the time that they\u2019ll spend in prison,\u201d Bennu said.\\n\u201cRight now, you got a block where, inside of the dorms, you got 100-200 people. There\u2019s not a single bookshelf in there,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s not a writing table. There\u2019s no magazines. There\u2019s no dictionaries. There\u2019s no pictures on the walls, ABC\u2019s, 1-2-3\u2019s.\u201d\\n\u201cYou remember when we go to school? You know that you\u2019re in an educational environment. There\u2019s pictures and books on the walls, \u2018A mind is a terrible thing to waste\u2019\u2014these reinforcements. They don\u2019t have any of that. In these blocks, there\u2019s a TV, a microwave, and a coffee pot, and then there\u2019s just a bunch of bodies strewn all over the place,\u201d Bennu said.\\nSuch programs can make a real difference in the environment inside a prison. \u201cIn the Convicts Against Violence Program, we had conflict resolution classes, we had mediation classes. We had peer leadership for gang members to teach them not to be leading guys down the wrong path. So we can make them better leaders by teaching them from a book called, \u2018The 21 Laws of Leadership.\u2019 We teach from that book and taught guys leadership skills. So we were able to occupy these guys time.\u201d\\n\u201cThese are guys that normally are laying around waiting on the next joint to come through, waiting for the next batch of heroin to fall in, waiting on the next batch of ice to come in,\u201d Bennu said. \u201cBut instead of that they\u2019re in class. They\u2019re watching educational DVDs They\u2019re in leadership classes. They\u2019re in group circles.\u201d\\nPrisons that do not provide much programming and rehabilitation commonly do so for punitive or budgetary reasons (or both). But Bennu argued doing so comes with the cost of a volatile population. \u201cWe\u2019re filling that time, creating new habits, creating new patterns, creating new thought processes, and so we\u2019re making people more responsible, more mature. But if they don\u2019t allow us to do that, then they\u2019re time is filled with nothing. Whatever happens, they\u2019re gonna jump in and get involved.\u201d\\n\u201cThey changed the rule now,\u201d Bennu said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to school no more until you\u2019re within 5 years of your [end of sentence] date. So you come to prison, and you can\u2019t read or write and you don\u2019t have a skill or trade, and you got 20 years. You\u2019ll do 15 years in prison before you go to school. So you gonna develop these bad habits for 15 years, and now they think you\u2019re gonna change with five years to go, but you\u2019re going home anyway. So you don\u2019t even need that shit.\u201d\\nAlabama Department of Corrections Statistics show the number of people completing drug treatment has fallen by more than one half since 2008\u2014from 4,807 to 2,567 in 2016.\\nAlabama Department of Corrections prisoner completing drug treatment, 2008-2015. Data provided by Alabama Department of Corrections; Graph by Shadowproof.\\n\u201cIf you have heroin problems, you still got it. Now you\u2019ve got 15 more years of heroin addiction and they\u2019re talking about going to GED\u2014how you gonna get a heroin addict, a full blown heroin addict into a GED class? And he\u2019s not 19 now, he\u2019s 34 now,\u201d Bennu said.\\nBob Horton, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections, responded to questions about declining numbers of GED graduates by stating, \u201cThe average [GED] completions over the span of years cited is 617 annually. The report reflects 694 completions in 2015, which is actually a substantial increase. FY 2014, which runs Oct 2013 through September 2014, saw a decline, and it is our understanding the requirements for completion was substantially changed during that timeframe.\u201d\\n\u201cThe drug treatment numbers have declined for a couple of reasons,\u201d Horton said. \u201cOne, because of a shortage of counselors, and two, inmates not meeting the criteria by testing positive for drugs while participating in the program.\u201d\\nHorton said the DOC was short 20 counselors twelve months ago, but through an \u201cintensive effort to hire the needed professionals to administer the program,\u201d that number has improved. The department is working toward filling the twelve remaining counselor positions, he said, while also implementing an \u201cevidenced-based method for evaluating the success rate of the Substance Abuse Treatment program offered to offenders.\u201d\\n\u201cEffective rehabilitation and education programs have been proven to reduce violence in prisons, which are of course occupied by a large number of inmates in a confined area, and who have documented violent backgrounds,\u201d Horton agreed.\\n\u201cBeyond the obvious portals of perimeter security elements and building design, construction, and layout, effective classification and segmentation is the primary means to accomplish our primary mission of protecting the public, staff, visitors, and inmates themselves. Also inherent in our mission is the effort to provide rehabilitative tools, which the ADOC has done for decades.\u201d\\n\u201cThere are a plethora of programs,\u201d Horton said, such as psycho-social, educational, religious, and hybrid programs, \u201cwhich exist in every ADOC prison. They are not all reflected in the statistical reports.\u201d\\nBennu agreed the statistics don\u2019t provide the full picture of the options available to those inside Alabama prisons, but not in the same way Horton was suggesting. \u201cSome of these numbers are skewed by the fact that some of these people bought their certificates,\u201d Bennu said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy.\u201d\\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I go to a prison, and they got a program,\u201d he offered as a hypothetical example. \u201cI go down there, I see one of the people who\u2019s over there in the program. I\u2019m gonna pull up on him and I\u2019m gonna say, \u2018Hey man, how\u2019d you get into this program?\u2019 Well you got to fill out these applications. I fill out the applications so I can go on the waiting list.\u201d\\n\u201cOr, I can pull back up on that guy and say, \u2018Man, I got two bags of coffee, now go on and get me in the program.\u2019 Boom, he\u2019s getting me in the program and that\u2019s that.\u201d\\n\u201cOnce I get in the program, they got tutors and stuff looking over classes,\u201d Bennu continued. \u201cSo I pull up on the tutor\u2014he might be a heroin addict, he might be a weed head\u2014and I say I\u2019m not gonna come to class, you just mark me present every day for six weeks and then give me the certificate. And I can pay him $25-50, whatever the cost may be, and then I\u2019ve bought my certificate.\u201d\\nBennu argued the system works this way intentionally because the state has no incentive to rehabilitate prisoners. The cycle of recidivism that results from not helping prisoners get better is essential to maintaining the labor force.\\n\u201cAs long as we get back out and can force other people into a lifestyle of crime and to keep that culture alive that they\u2019ve created through this rap music and through these movies and this Scarface\u2014As long as they have us to keep this culture alive, it\u2019s a self perpetuating process,\u201d Bennu contended.\\nAn educated prisoner poses a threat to the system, he said, because they have the power to learn about and challenge their conditions of confinement. \u201cI\u2019ll just give you an example. I\u2019m in a cell right now. The lights are out. The vents are full of filth. The cell is small. Well, if I can\u2019t read or write, then I don\u2019t know that there are health codes against this. I don\u2019t know that I have human rights and some of these things.\u201d\\n\u201cWhen you have a fully educated and engaged population, you can\u2019t get over on us the way that you can when we don\u2019t know any better. It serves their interest for us not to know what the health department says about the way that they\u2019re serving the food in the kitchen or the labor conditions that we have or how we were violated in court.\u201d\\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want us to get out and become competitive in the job market,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey want to keep these jobs in prison where they don\u2019t have to pay us anything so its cheaper for them. It\u2019s just the cost of doing business. That\u2019s what it boils down to for these people, it\u2019s the cost of doing business.\u201d\\nBennu said this practice parallels the time of chattel slavery in America, when it was illegal for a slave to learn to read and write.\\n\u201cIn prison today, I\u2019m in solitary confinement. The rules say I cannot receive any books, I got people on this block with me that can\u2019t read and write. They won\u2019t let them even get a GED book back here, but they\u2019re sitting in the cell all day doing nothing,\u201d Bennu suggested. \u201cNo books. No newspapers. No magazines. No reading material. No education material. And we\u2019re just sitting in here. So there\u2019s no way, and when I asked them about it they say, \u2018Well we don\u2019t want to reward them for bad behavior. We want to make sure they\u2019re punished.'\u201d\\n\u201cBut show me scientifically where punishment has been proven to be an effective method because if punishment worked, we wouldn\u2019t have recidivism. They\u2019re punishing us beyond the pale. So it\u2019s obvious that it doesn\u2019t work. They know it doesn\u2019t work, but it\u2019s rhetoric that has been used so long that even they believe.\u201d\\nBennu pushed back on the notion that punishing prisoners by restricting their participation in such programs is in the best interest of society. \u201cIt is not mandatory that I get anger management. It is not mandatory that I get treatment for my addictions. It\u2019s not mandatory that I get a GED. It\u2019s not mandatory that I get a trade.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s only mandatory that I go to work in the kitchen or go to work in the farm or wherever they tell me to. When I get back to society, I still can\u2019t read and write. I still don\u2019t have a skill or trade. I still got an anger problem. I still got a drug problem. How am I better for society?\u201d\\n\u201cOn top of that, if I get a 15-year sentence, I can earn good time in the Alabama Department of Corrections. How can I earn good time and I can\u2019t read or write and it\u2019s not mandatory for me to go to GED school?\u201d\\n\u201cSee, if they wanted to make that person better by the end of their sentence, they\u2019ll say you\u2019re eligible for good time but you can\u2019t get it unless you enroll in school. And when you get your GED you have to go get a trade. But then they\u2019ll be making that person better and they don\u2019t have any incentive to make that person better.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s little things like that that shows that if the system was concerned about public safety, which person is better? This person earning good time, which means he\u2019ll be out soon, is it making him better to make him get a GED in order to earn that good time? Make him get that trade to get that good time, make him get anger management, make him get drug treatment\u2014Is that gonna be the better person when he gets out?\\n\u201cOr is that person gonna be better \u2019cause you\u2019re making him go to work in the kitchen every day and he\u2019s gonna get back out with all of the problems that he had when he went to prison?\u201d\\nThe post Free Alabama Movement Links Prison Slavery To Lack Of Access To Education, Rehabilitation appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n\""}, "time": 1742628531.019883}
