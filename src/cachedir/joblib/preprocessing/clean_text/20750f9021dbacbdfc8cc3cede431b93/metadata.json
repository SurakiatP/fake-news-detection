[Kristin Gunckel, a professor at the University of Arizona, argued on behalf of introducing \u201cqueer theory\u201d into American elementary school curriculum in a recent lecture that took place last month.  \u201cQueer theory,\u201d according to Gunckel, examines why heterosexuality is portrayed as the \u201conly normal and natural form\u201d for human beings. \u201cIt challenges categorical thinking and specifically aims to disrupt the   binary,\u201d she wrote. \u201cQueer theory examines how the social construction of sexuality is normalized so that heterosexuality is portrayed as the only normal and natural form of being human. \u201d \u201cQueering science education means exploding binary gender and sexuality constructions, collapsing heteronormativity, and opening spaces within science education for the marginalized identities,\u201d she adds. Heteronormativity is defined as \u201cdenoting or relating to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation. In an academic research paper, Gunckel wrote that \u201cschool science plays a strong role in silencing queer identities and limiting science knowledge and learning. \u201d \u201cIn elementary school, it means not hiding sexuality from children. At all levels, it means providing space within the curriculum for students to see themselves and their families. Queering science education means making the invisible visible,\u201d Gunckel wrote.
