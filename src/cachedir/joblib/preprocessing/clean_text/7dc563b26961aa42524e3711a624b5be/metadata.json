[Shawn Sadri, a    immigrant from Iran, who practices in Los Angeles and Manhattan, was returning to New York from Hollywood after a week of performing cosmetic dental procedures for his clients attending the Oscars, the New York Daily News reported.  He sat next to an unaccompanied \u201c  or    boy\u201d of Latino descent, who was crying and nervous before takeoff. \u201cI asked the boy, \u2018Are you OK? Are you traveling alone? \u2019\u201d says Sadri, who has served   clients such as actor Aaron Paul and athletes Jose Canseco and Gabby Douglas. \u201cHe didn\u2019t speak a word of English and no one was with him,\u201d Sadri said. \u201cOut of nowhere, he runs down the aisle and starts screaming!\u201d When a flight attendant came over to assess the situation, Sadri told the flight attendant jokingly that \u201cmaybe Trump is trying to deport\u201d the boy. \u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d the flight attendant snapped back at him. Sadri, who moved to Iran from the U. S. when he was three, thought that by making a \u201cjoke\u201d he might diffuse the situation, but things only escalated even further. \u201cFine, you must be a Trump supporter,\u201d he told the flight attendant. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018What if I am?\u2019 So I said \u2018If you are, you are, but you\u2019re also incompetent and need to do your job. Why am I dealing with this kid? \u2019\u201d Two other flight attendants came to the aid of their colleague, and an argument between Sadri and the flight attendants ensued, according to Sadri. \u201cI wasn\u2019t yelling, I wasn\u2019t swearing, it was 6 a. m. I hadn\u2019t been drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker  \u2014   I\u2019m not going to back down  \u2014   and I was born a Muslim in Iran. I do think all those things played into it. \u201d Sadri said security was \u201cnice\u201d when they kicked him off American Airlines Flight 292 and put him on the next flight to New York leaving an hour later. American Airlines said he was asked to leave the flight because he failed to follow crew members\u2019 instructions. Sadri said he has flown by private jet in the past but did not get lucky enough to do so Sunday, the Daily Mail reported.'"}, "time": 1742561855.066793}
