They broke the law to enter the country. They spoke little English. They strained schools and public services. But as talk of a border wall and a Muslim ban overtook the presidential campaign, Mr. Wielenga, the agronomy manager of a farmers\u2019   here in northwestern Iowa, had a change of heart. He heard dairy farmers say they couldn\u2019t get their cows milked without immigrants. \u201cYou can put an ad in the paper and you won\u2019t get two white guys to apply,\u201d said Mr. Wielenga, who grew up on a dairy farm himself. He heard of the ruinous damage an immigration raid had done to families. \u201cSome of these kids were born in the U. S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThese families had lived here 10 years, and all of a sudden, Dad\u2019s gone, Mom\u2019s gone. When you think of it from that perspective, what\u2019s the lesser of two evils?\u201d Mr. King, a Republican who has displayed a Confederate battle flag on his desk in Washington, shows no sign of budging in his views. His latest   tirade  \u2014   \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies,\u201d he said  \u2014   once again drew wide condemnation and critical attention to Iowa\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, whose voters overwhelmingly   him to an eighth term in November. Sioux County, Mr. Wielenga\u2019s home, provided the largest margin in the   district, Iowa\u2019s most conservative. And there is no shortage of voters who echo Mr. King\u2019s contention that \u201cculture and demographics are our destiny,\u201d as he said earlier this month to cheers from white supremacists. But in conversations over four days with residents who voted for Mr. King, a new chorus of earnest naysayers could also be heard in many corners of the district. Some said the congressman\u2019s latest provocation  \u2014   uttered in support of a   Dutch politician  \u2014   was finally more than they could brook. Several said they were rethinking their support. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted for him, but I think this was way out of line,\u201d said Bill Kooi, a retired farmer, sipping coffee at a Hardees in Orange City, as the friends who shared his table  \u2014   to a man, older white conservatives  \u2014   all nodded. Again and again, voters brought up how much Mr. King\u2019s district has changed since his election 15 years ago. Though still overwhelmingly white, it has absorbed a sizable population of Hispanics who have taken    jobs and opened small businesses in the empty storefronts of struggling towns. As a generation of   white children leaves for college and seldom returns, immigrants are keeping many of those communities alive. Denison, in Crawford County, is one. Eric Skoog, a county commissioner and owner of Cronk\u2019s restaurant in Denison, where Mr. King, 67, sometimes stops on his way home, said the community had been successfully assimilating a steady stream of Hispanics for years. \u201cOne of our claims to fame is we don\u2019t have a Hispanic neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Skoog said. Rather, immigrants and their families live throughout the community. Before the 2010 census, city officials worked hard to persuade immigrants to allow themselves to be counted so Denison could receive its share of federal dollars. Mr. Skoog said that Latino newcomers had flocked to Denison to take jobs in meatpacking plants that Iowa farmers had once filled  \u2014   but that those native Iowans wanted better for their children. \u201cThe next generation, there was not a supply of male white farmers around here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo all of a sudden you saw the influx of the Hispanic population. \u201d Mr. Skoog counts himself a friend of Mr. King\u2019s, but offered no explanation for the lawmaker\u2019s   and racially inflammatory statements, which go back years, including a 2013 description of undocumented teenagers with \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d from carrying drugs across the border. Selecting his words carefully, Mr. Skoog said of Mr. King: \u201cThere\u2019s a personal relationship there. I don\u2019t want to damage that by saying too much negative. \u201d Others describe an ethos that is changing day by day. Libbie Schillerberg has three children in the Denison schools, where more than half the students are Hispanic. Her oldest, Ethan, 15, plays guitar in a high school mariachi band. Her youngest, Addison, 6, is one of four   whites in her class. \u201cI\u2019m on our youth soccer board,\u201d Ms. Schillerberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t used to see as many Hispanic parents volunteering to coach. We\u2019re seeing more and more. When your kids are such good friends at school, people are getting to know each other better. They\u2019re trusting each other, wanting to be around each other. \u201d Mario Flores, a   loan officer at Bank Iowa in Denison, said Hispanics there were buying homes, investing in apartment buildings and otherwise injecting economic vitality into the community. \u201cI believe both groups, the Anglo and   are learning from each other,\u201d he said. Mr. King has survived past denunciations: Last year, he drew a rare primary challenger, who accused him of being so toxic that his name on a  bill rendered it \u201cdead on arrival. \u201d But Mr. King won easily and went on to crush his Democratic opponent, Kim Weaver, an advocate for the elderly. Over the weekend, Ms. Weaver, who received a small gusher of donations after Mr. King\u2019s latest remarks, announced she would challenge him again in 2018. It will not be easy. Last summer, Douglas Burns, an owner of The Times Herald in Carroll, Iowa, headlined a column: \u201cKing could use   daily, still get   here. \u201d Mr. Burns has branded Mr. King as a racist, but he recoiled from calling the district\u2019s voters bigoted. Rather, he said in an interview, they embraced Mr. King for blackening the eyes of Washington and Des Moines elites. \u201cI think people feel condescended to so much from urban forces that, while they may not like the racist tactics that King uses, if forced to choose sides, they\u2019re going with King,\u201d Mr. Burns said. But there are plenty who don\u2019t seem to quibble much with Mr. King\u2019s way of thinking. Sitting at the Hardees in Orange City last week, Don Engeltjes, 76, said he agreed with Mr. King on the need to clamp down on immigration. He said he believed new arrivals were a drain on taxpayers\u2019 money, lumping immigrants from Mexico in with those from the Muslim world. \u201cIt\u2019s just handout, handout, handout,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Don, your dad is an immigrant too,\u201d another man piped up, noting that Mr. Engeltjes\u2019s father, like many forebears of the district\u2019s voters, had come over from Holland at age 9. \u201cYou bet he was,\u201d Mr. Engeltjes replied. \u201cBut the way it\u2019s going nowadays, man, they\u2019re outproducing us. We\u2019re going to be the minority in a few years. \u201d Asked by a reporter who he meant by \u201cwe,\u201d Mr. Engeltjes said: \u201cThe white people. The American people. \u201d Mr. Engeltjes said he did not oppose all immigrants. He described a successful prostate procedure he had not long ago in Sioux Falls, S. D. performed by a Korean doctor. But he complained that homes occupied by several Hispanic families living together were running down his neighborhood. On Sundays, he said, he picks up trash in the street from parties he believes are held by his Hispanic neighbors. Interviewed at his home later, where his wife, Alma, said her husband had occasionally made enemies by being outspoken, Mr. Engeltjes praised the same quality in Mr. King, for whom he said he would vote again. \u201cEnough of this \u201d he said. \u201cThe man\u2019s got a pair. \u201d Mr. Wielenga, the agronomist, suggested that northwestern Iowa, with its proud Dutch heritage, may have grown too insular, too complacent, during Mr. King\u2019s tenure in Congress. He called it a safe community and a great place to raise children. He has four daughters and is the board president of Hull Christian School, where Mr. Wielenga said only one of the 100 families who send children to the private school is Hispanic. He said some of the area\u2019s churches were entirely white. \u201cWe talk about this at school,\u201d Mr. Wielenga said: \u201cAre we living in a bubble? And is that what God is calling us to do  \u2014   to live in a bubble?\u201d \u201cThis has been going on now for 20 years,\u201d he said of the Hispanic influx. \u201cNow you want to fix it by kicking people out?\u201d He gently shook his head.'"}, "time": 1742628370.0583158}
