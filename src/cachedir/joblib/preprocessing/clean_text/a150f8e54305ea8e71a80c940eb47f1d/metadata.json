Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. \\nWhen passed, Proposition 227 overthrew the previous norm of bilingual education. \u2026 \\nBut now, with California\u2019s immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. \\nPolls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for \u201cdual immersion\u201d programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage. \\nDual immersion is legal already, it just requires parents\u2019 consent. What these disputes are about is which is the default: English or Spanish? \\nSupporters also claim that returning to bilingual education will improve students\u2019 English acquisition; favorable ads emphasize that Proposition 58 will ensure that \u201call students learn English.\u201d \\nBut the primary thrust of the proposition is clear: Students from non-English homes will find it far easier to have their children be primarily taught in their native tongue, while spending far less time learning English.'"}, "time": 1742628481.0501668}
