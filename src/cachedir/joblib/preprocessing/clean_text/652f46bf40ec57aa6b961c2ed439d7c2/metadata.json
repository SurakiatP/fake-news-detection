I loved it, I still can\u2019t enough of it. But it\u2019s tearing my life apart\u201d. \\nSuch was Buster\u2019s preoccupation with the trampoline, he lost interest in walks and even stopped marking his territory. \\n\u201cThere was a time you couldn\u2019t stop me from pissing on a tree. You name a tree in my area and I\u2019ve cocked a leg over it, but once I took to bouncing nothing else mattered, I even lost contact with my mates in the dog park. My life is being controlled by this addiction,\u201d woofed Buster, flanked by his owners. \\nDistraught, his owners contemplated removing the trampoline, but Buster would growl at any mention of it. \\nCautioning all owners and dogs not to make the mistakes he has made, Buster warned that there are many gateway hobbies which can lead to an all out trampoline addiction. \\n\u201cTennis balls, they seemed fun at the time, but I see now that my constant fetching of them was a troubling sign of things to come\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742563954.8458335}
