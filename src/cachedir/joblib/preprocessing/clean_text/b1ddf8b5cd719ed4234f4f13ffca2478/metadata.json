[Ross recommended such a trade deal for several reasons.  \u201cFirst of all, Europe has much higher trade barriers than we have,\u201d Ross said. \u201cFor example, in automotive, their tariff on American cars going into Europe is ten percent. Our tariff on European cars coming into America is     percent. That\u2019s a     percent disadvantage that our exporting companies are at, relative to the European ones. \u201d  \u201cProblems like that, we would like to address because those are part of the reason why we have a trade deficit with Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other part of the reason is currency,\u201d Ross continued. \u201cThe euro has been very, very weak relative to the dollar. That, therefore, makes their competitive position much better than it would have been if the euro had stayed stable. \u201d \u201cThere are quite a lot of issues that we have with Europe, and we would like to try to negotiate them,\u201d said Ross. \u201cIf we cannot make a sensible deal, we obviously won\u2019t go forward with it. \u201d Ross looked beyond European complaints about the United States\u2019s pulling out of the Paris accords to see tough negotiations would be required to convince Europe to lower its tariffs. \u201cThe reality is, we do have a big trade deficit with Europe. The other reality is, a lot of that comes from automotive, and no small portion of that is this difference in tariff rates,\u201d he contended. Ross explained that coal was another U. S. industry disadvantaged by the Paris accords in favor of foreign competitors. \u201cBoth India and China, who are the two huge users of coal for electric utilities, both of them were permitted to use more   plants in the years going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of China, on a total basis, they were able to increase their emissions for 13 years, and a lot of that would be coming from coal. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous that U. S. coal would be shut down because we were agreeing to these very strict things, whereas even   more pollutive coal in countries like China would be allowed to flourish. That doesn\u2019t strike me as very balanced,\u201d said Ross. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. '"}, "time": 1742563336.6679108}
