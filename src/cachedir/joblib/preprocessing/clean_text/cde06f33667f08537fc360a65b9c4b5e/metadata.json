Israeli Minister of the Interior Aryeh Deri and Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan announced in August that they were forming a joint task force to \u201cexpel and ban the entry of BDS activists\u201d into Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. \\n\u201cWe must not allow BDS activists to enter the state of Israel. This is a necessary step, given the malicious intentions of these activists to delegitimize and spread lies and distortions about the reality in our region,\u201d Erdan was quoted as saying in a statement released at the time, adding that the boycott movement against Israel \u201cmust have a price.\u201d \\n\u201cFighting against Israeli boycotts starts by fighting those who undermine the state of Israel,\u201d Deri also said at the time. \\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to do everything possible to crush any boycott and to state clearly that we will not allow the State of Israel to be harmed. Forming the task force is an important step in that direction.\u201d \\nWithout citing any names, the statement estimated that \u201chundreds\u201d of pro-Palestinian activists and dozens of organizations were currently in Israel \u201cto gather information and use it to boycott Israel, and harm its citizens,\u201d and that the task force would also try to prevent the entrance of activists in the future. \\nThe statement also alleged that BDS activists traveled to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem to \u201cincite\u201d Palestinians. \\nThe announcement led to outcry from groups like the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), which believed they were the targets of the newly-formed task force.\u201cIsolation of Palestinians by denying access and/or deporting human rights activists aims to make Palestinian communities already vulnerable and suffering from abuse\u2026even more vulnerable,\u201d ISM said in a statement in response to the plans of forming the task force .\u201cWe condemn Israeli suppression of Palestinian nonviolent resistance. This recent attempt to further isolate Palestinians indicates the occupation authorities\u2019 unwillingness to do the only thing that will actually bring an end to Israel\u2019s isolation \u2014 to adhere to international law, end the occupation and grant Palestinians their rights.\u201dISM argued that its foreign activists play a crucial role in trying to prevent Israeli army violence against Palestinians.\u201cAs a civilian population living under military occupation Palestinians in the occupied territories are promised protection under International law,\u201d the group said in its statement. \u201c(Foreign) civilians have been attempting to fill in the gap created by the failure of governments and official international bodies to provide protection and fulfill their obligations.\u201cWe find that our presence sometimes results in reducing the level of lethal force used by the Israeli military against unarmed Palestinians.\u201dThe boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel has gained momentum over the past year, with activists targeting companies that act in compliance with Israel\u2019s illegal occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. \\nIn late July, the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 which denounces police violence against African-Americans in the United States \u2014 came out in support of BDS , stating that it was committed to \u201cglobal struggle, solidarity, and support of the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement to fight for freedom, justice and equality for Palestinian people and to end international support of the occupation.\u201dThe Israeli government, meanwhile, has grown increasingly concerned about the growth of the BDS movement, as the movement\u2019s support base has expanded to include companies, universities and religious institutions around the world divesting from organizations complicit in Israel\u2019s violation of Palestinian rights. \\nIn January, the Israeli Knesset held a conference to discuss ways to combat BDS , and dedicated 100 million shekels ($26 million) of the government\u2019s 2016 budget to the issue.In May, Israel issued a travel ban on BDS cofounder Omar Barghouti , a permanent resident in Israel, as Mahmoud Nawajaa, the general coordinator of the Palestinian BDS National Committee, stated at the time that the decision reflected \u201cthe lengths [Israel] will go to in order to stop the spread of the non-violent BDS movement for Palestinian freedom, justice and equality.\u201d \\nMore recently, Israel\u2019s Parliament, the Knesset, passed a controversial NGO \u201ctransparency bill\u201d into law on July 12 , compelling organizations to reveal their sources of funding if more than half came from public foreign entities \u2014 a law which human rights groups and opposition Knesset members condemned for seeking to \u201csilence criticism\u201d of Israel and delegitimize left-wing groups .Opposition leader in the Knesset Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Camp party then slammed the law for \u201csymbolizing the budding fascism that is rising and flourishing in Israeli society\u201d and making a \u201cmockery\u201d of the \u201cright to organize, which is a sacred founding principle of a democratic society.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562833.0965283}
