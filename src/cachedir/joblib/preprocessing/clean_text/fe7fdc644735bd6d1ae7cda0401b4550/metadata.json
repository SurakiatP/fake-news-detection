The   movie, which received mediocre reviews, has generated an additional $111 million overseas. \u201cTaking a video game and bringing it to life as a film brand is a very difficult thing to do, and we\u2019re thrilled to have launched a new franchise,\u201d Josh Greenstein, Sony\u2019s president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said by phone on Sunday. Most of the \u201cAngry Birds\u201d financial risk fell to Rovio, the Finnish video game company, which paid $173 million to make and market the movie. As such, Rovio will receive the bulk of any profit. Sony, working hard to move beyond a prolonged   rough patch, distributed \u201cAngry Birds\u201d in return for an 8 percent slice of ticket sales. Rovio also paid Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate the film. \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d (Disney) fell to second place, taking in about $33. 1 million, for a   domestic total of $347. 4 million, according to comScore, which compiles   data. \u201cCivil War\u201d has collected an additional $706. 1 million overseas. Despite receiving good reviews, \u201cNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising\u201d (Universal) fizzled in third place, collecting an estimated $21. 8 million, or 55 percent less than its series predecessor generated upon its 2014 arrival. Comedy sequels often falter, although the   \u201cSorority Rising,\u201d which cost about $35 million to make, seemed ready to break that curse. For whatever reason  \u2014   the story line, a crowded marketplace  \u2014   fans did not buy in. Similarly disappointing was \u201cThe Nice Guys\u201d (Warner Bros.) an action comedy set in the 1970s that cost a reported $50 million to make. Starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, \u201cThe Nice Guys\u201d took in $11. 3 million. Funding for the film was raised by the producer Joel Silver Warner then bought domestic distribution rights.'"}, "time": 1742562244.7538583}
