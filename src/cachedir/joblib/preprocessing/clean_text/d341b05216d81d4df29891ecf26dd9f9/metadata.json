Sheriff Bear Ellison finds himself increasingly isolated as he is forced to decide between risking his life protecting a local hero, or reneging on his oath and handing him over to federal prosecutors\u2026 \\n\\nChapter 8 \\nCold winds poured down off the mountains and swirled in the valley, heralding the end of Indian summer. Billowing cumulonimbus clouds boiled upwards into the stratosphere, dwarfing the fourteen-thousand-foot peaks to the west. The aspen on the northern slopes had lost the last of their leaves and the cottonwoods and willows that clustered in the arroyos and flood plains had turned yellow. The elk had made their way down off the high meadows, and the mule deer were more common, grazing along the shoulders of the highway, sizing up their prospects of safe crossing. \\nSheriff Ellison drove his patrols with a heavy heart. Nguyet had made her decision. She was leaving for Atlanta, and he would soon be alone. He wished his term was over so that he could jettison his responsibilities and join her and his new granddaughter. The visit with Acevedo had cured him of any lingering political aspirations. Despite the DEA\u2019s wishes, he never did give a press conference on the accidental shooting. \\nWhat would be the point? he thought. Acevedo was right in one sense. The sheriff would have been held responsible for the shooting, regardless of how he framed it for the public. \\nEllison conceded that he would not be able to reign in the feds. He knew that the populace had most likely also realized this by now, and this painted him in a pastel hue of weakness. He noticed that people in general had become less social and cordial towards him since the botched raid. \u201cGood morning, Sheriff. How are things?\u201d was replaced with a cursory \u201cHowdy\u201d or a perfunctory nod, followed by averted eyes. This, along with his wife\u2019s looming departure, filled him with a feeling of isolation. The DEA raids would continue, despite his protest. Nguyet had begged him to resign, but he just couldn\u2019t. Not at such a chaotic time in his career. \\nEllison\u2019s hope was that the county might turn against the DEA occupation. Monte Turcot was a hero, after all, and the shooting of him and his wife was a lightning rod. He hoped that the citizens were beginning to question the value of the DEA\u2019s mission, but without effective leadership and organization, they would be helpless to foment any real resistance. \\nEllison knew Acevedo was disappointed that he did not do the requested damage control on the DEA\u2019s behalf. He learned of this through a phone call with the governor\u2019s office, whom the DEA had contacted to voice their displeasure. They had called him demanding an explanation. \\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for my department to communicate,\u201d Ellison had explained over the phone. \u201cWe were not involved in that operation\u2026 We have asked DA Chalmers to launch a grand jury investigation\u2026 We expect their decision any day\u2026 I\u2019ve ordered Special Agent Acevedo to suspend operations\u2026 No, he has not complied\u2026 I respectfully disagree with your assessment\u2026 I will take the governor\u2019s position under advisement\u2026\u201d \\nThe DEA continued according to their plan. It didn\u2019t matter to them what the sheriff or a constituency of \u201crancheros and hippy flameouts\u201d thought of their operation. Their mission was ordained by the president. Provincial resistance was futile. Those who stood athwart them would be ignored or swept aside. Acevedo and his agents conducted three more raids after the Turcot shooting, adding to their tally of minor victories in the War on Drugs at a taxpayer cost of over $100,000 per arrest. Thankfully, no one else was shot. \\nOne afternoon, while on patrol, Ellison received a text on his cell phone. He glanced at it quickly, then turned off the road to change direction. An email from DA Chalmers came moments later. \\n\u201cRe: Turcot Shooting,\u201d it read. \u201cGJ has decided not to pursue.\u201d \\nEllison stepped on the gas. He turned west onto County Road 306 and north just after the golf course, taking Gun Club Road for two miles and over Michigan Ditch where it ended at the intersection of a dirt road running east and west. Ellison turned west, his cruiser\u2019s tires throwing up rocks and a plume of dust as he accelerated up the road that led into the hills and evergreen forest. Ten minutes from when he had received the email, he was pulling into Monte Turcot\u2019s driveway. He shut off his cruiser, looked at his watch, took a deep breath, then got out and walked up to the door. As he raised his hand to knock, the recognizable pop of gunfire echoed through the trees. Instinctively, Ellison reached down towards his holster. Another shot rang out, then another, and another, in deliberate succession. The sounds were coming from behind Turcot\u2019s trailer, where it abutted the woods. \\nCautiously, the sheriff made his way around the trailer, ready to draw if necessary. As he stepped out from behind it, the source of the shooting finally came into view. It was Monte Turcot himself, now bearded and thin, firing rounds into a tree trunk with a small pistol. His back was turned to the sheriff, and a half empty bottle of Jim Beam sat clasped in his other hand. \\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot me, Monte. I\u2019m right behind you,\u201d Ellison called. \\nMonte staggered a few steps back and lowered his gun. \\n\u201cListen, I came out here to talk to you.\u201d \\nWithout even acknowledging the sheriff\u2019s presence, Monte took a swig from the bottle, his pistol now dangling in his hand like a toy gun at his side. Ellison kept his hand close to his holster and made a quick glance about, looking for cover in the event that Monte had in fact lost his marbles and was mulling over the idea of suicide by cop. \\n\u201cCan we talk?\u201d asked Ellison. \\nMonte stared into the woods, wobbling, his back still turned to the sheriff. After another swig, he lowered his bottle, holding it so loosely that Ellison wondered if it might slip out and crash on the rocks at his feet. \\n\u201cMonte?\u201d \\nMonte didn\u2019t move. \\n\u201cOkay, Monte,\u201d Ellison explained slowly. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to my car and check my messages and call in. That\u2019ll take me about five minutes or so. Then I\u2019ll be on my way. If you want, you can come over and talk. Or call me later. Does that sound okay with you?\u201d \\nMonte didn\u2019t respond, swaying in the autumn air. A gust of wind blew pine cones off the trees, which landed with a thunk on his trailer\u2019s metal roof. Ellison backed away behind the trailer and walked back to his cruiser. Inside, he radioed a quick status report to dispatch and then checked his messages. Nguyet was wondering when he would be home for dinner. His son had emailed pictures of his granddaughter. A reporter from the Gazette wanted to talk about his reelection campaign. Someone had sent a note about a roadkill carcass on the highway north of town. \\nSomething moved in the corner of his eye. Ellison glanced up and was startled to find the ragged Monte Turcot framed in his windshield. He looked pale, his hair was matted, and his filthy sweatshirt was stained with blood. Ellison looked at his hands. Monte was no longer wielding the pistol, but he still clung to the bottle. From the looks of it, he\u2019d had a few more drinks since the sheriff had arrived. \\nRelieved but still cautious, Ellison rolled down the passenger window. \u201cGet in, Monte.\u201d \\nMonte stared back, his blank expression evoking that of a zombie\u2019s. Ellison clipped his cell phone into its mount on the dash, then reached over and opened the passenger door. Monte slowly shuffled towards it and got in. \\n\u201cHow are you holding up, Monte?\u201d Ellison asked. \\n\u201cStill here,\u201d he answered in a raspy tone. \\n\u201cThis is a terrible thing you\u2019re going through. I wish there was something I could do to help.\u201d \\n\u201cThanks,\u201d murmured Monte. \\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that blood from, on your shirt there?\u201d \\n\u201cTore my hands up chopping wood.\u201d \\n\u201cDid you cut yourself?\u201d \\n\u201cNo.\u201d Monte set his bottle down on the floorboard and presented the palms of his hands to the sheriff. They were covered in blisters, some of which had burst. The tender layer of skin beneath had torn open. \\n\u201cYou should take care of that,\u201d Ellison warned him. \u201cIt could get infected.\u201d \\n\u201cYeah\u2026you\u2019re probably right.\u201d \\n\u201cLooks like you did a lot of chopping.\u201d \\n\u201cFour cords,\u201d Monte stated quietly. \\n\u201cHow long did that take you?\u201d \\n\u201cI split it all yesterday.\u201d \\n\u201cThat ought to be plenty to get you through winter in that trailer of yours.\u201d \\nMonte stared out the passenger window. The mountains appeared through a break in the ponderosa that lined his drive, their peaks sheathed in the purest of white. \\n\u201cIt certainly is beautiful out here this time of year,\u201d the sheriff observed. \\n\u201cI think I might just walk myself up into those mountains and never come back down,\u201d Monte answered in a quiet, resigned sigh. \u201cYou ever think about doing something like that, Sheriff?\u201d \\n\u201cI think about that a lot, Monte. Maybe not exactly like you describe it, but there are a lot of days \u2013 too many days \u2013 when I think about dropping everything and going away, going away for a while.\u201d \\n\u201cI ain\u2019t talking about for a while . I\u2019m talking about for good.\u201d \\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be planning on bringing that gun along with you, would you?\u201d asked Ellison. \\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t really plan anything, anymore.\u201d Monte looked down at his ravaged hands. \u201cThe future changes day by day. Sometimes I think about going back to active duty again, volunteering for all the action. I thought for sure that was going to be my future yesterday. But then today, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea. Today, I think I\u2019ve seen enough killing for one lifetime. I don\u2019t want any part of that no more. Right now, I wish I\u2019d never joined in the first place.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut then again, who knows? Tomorrow, I\u2019ll probably wish I never came home.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be tough, dealing with everything you\u2019ve been through,\u201d Ellison answered. \u201cIt\u2019s too much for one man.\u201d \\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Monte nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of the things that I thought about doing yesterday.\u201d \\n\u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about you, Monte.\u201d \\n\u201cWhat do you know about anything, Sheriff?\u201d \\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know much about what you\u2019re going through. I just worry.\u201d \\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d \\n\u201cMonte,\u201d Ellison said, wary of the direction he was about to take the conversation, \u201cI came out here to check up on you. It doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re doing well. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of line or anything, all things considered. I just think you\u2019re out here all alone, and that it\u2019s not good for you. Is there any way I could talk you into staying with some family for a while? You\u2019ve got a sister, don\u2019t you? Maybe she could come out and stay with you, or you could go visit her.\u201d \\n\u201cShe lives in Connecticut. She\u2019s got four kids.\u201d \\n\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d \\n\u201cThey\u2019re old, worn down, worn out. I\u2019d be a burden on them. I don\u2019t want to deal with them right now, anyway.\u201d \\n\u201cMonte\u2026I wouldn\u2019t feel right about just leaving you out here without knowing you\u2019re going to get some help. Everyone needs help, sometimes. There isn\u2019t any shame in that.\u201d \\nMonte turned from the window and looked at Ellison. \u201cSo what happened with the grand jury? That\u2019s really why you came out here, isn\u2019t it? To tell me about that?\u201d \\nEllison felt relieved that Monte had broached the subject first. He hadn\u2019t been able to figure out a way to get there gracefully by himself. \\n\u201cThey concluded that, under applicable law, no criminal charges will be filed against the DEA agent that shot you and your wife. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He watched as Monte\u2019s eyes dimmed in helpless frustration. \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s the DA\u2019s language, not mine. I think it\u2019s wrong.\u201d \\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Monte replied. He picked his bottle off the floorboards and opened the door. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go back inside and lay down for a while.\u201d \\n\u201cOkay, Monte. I\u2019ll stay out here for a few minutes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d \\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sheriff. I\u2019ll be all right,\u201d answered Monte. \u201cI just need to get some rest. These hands are hurting real bad, and I\u2019m pretty drunk.\u201d He stumbled out of the cruiser and staggered slowly back into his trailer, letting the door slam shut behind him. \\nSheriff Ellison waited outside with his window down, listening for a gunshot for over an hour.'"}, "time": 1742562167.3373227}
