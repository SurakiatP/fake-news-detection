I stand here to tell you that I have no doubt, none whatsoever, that in the Trump administration there will be no diminution of support as a consequence of this transition. Even if the new administration were inclined to reduce the commitment, which it is not, Congress would never let it happen; the American people would never let it happen.\u201d \\nFurthermore, Biden told the crowd, \u201cYou measure your influence on how well you influence me, presidents, vice presidents, secretaries, senators, congressmen. But your influence on the American community at large has been profound. That\u2019s the ultimate guarantor that every American president, and every transition, will never dare, even if they\u2019re inclined \u2014 and the Trump admin is not inclined \u2014 to reduce\u201d US support for the Jewish state. \\nEarlier in his remarks \u2014 given at an event at which he received the WJC\u2019s Theodor Herzl award for his \u201ccontributions to the well-being of Israel and the Jewish people\u201d \u2014 Biden equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.'"}, "time": 1742563104.559146}
