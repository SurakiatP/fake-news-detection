Trump\u2019s encouragement of Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails to the Watergate scandal, which led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation. Mr. Kaine, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, made the remarks on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d while he was being questioned about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, an issue that has dogged her throughout her campaign. Mr. Kaine used the moment to attack Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his income tax returns and to attack his comments this summer that Russia should make public anything they might have stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, remarks he made in the wake of the disclosure that hackers had accessed emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cHe has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyberhacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyberattack on the D. N. C. was likely done by Russia,\u201d Mr. Kaine said of Mr. Trump on Sunday. \u201cA president was impeached and had to resign over an attack on the D. N. C. during a presidential election in 1972,\u201d Mr. Kaine added, referring to the Watergate scandal. \u201cThis is serious business. So contrast the Hillary situation, where the F. B. I. said there\u2019s no need for legal proceedings, with an attack that is being encouraged by Donald Trump on the D. N. C. by Russia, similar to what led to resignation of a president 30 years ago. \u201d During a news conference in July, Mr. Trump said he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. \u201d Mr. Kaine wasn\u2019t the only candidate to invoke Mr. Nixon\u2019s name in an attack. In a taped interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that aired Sunday, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, called Mrs. Clinton \u201cthe most dishonest candidate for president of the United States since Richard Nixon. \u201d Yet Mr. Pence also opened the door for more criticism of Mr. Trump by vowing to release his own income tax returns within the next week. Mr. Trump has refused to release his own returns, but Mr. Pence said his running mate would eventually disclose them as well, although he did not say when that might happen. Last week The Washington Post revealed that Mr. Trump had to pay a $2, 500 penalty to the I. R. S. because his charitable foundation had made an improper political donation. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers, suggested that Mr. Trump had backed away in his speech on Wednesday from his proposal to carry out mass deportations of people who are in the country illegally. Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump\u2019s speech \u201cleaves a very big opening for what will happen with the people who remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure. \u201d \u201cDonald Trump, as he expressed in one of his interviews recently, would find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that\u2019s been here for, you know, 15 years and they have three children, two of whom are citizens,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThat is not the kind of America he wants. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564424.170904}
