These territories, which became Russian after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, saw a rift between the two countries preventing them from signing the peace treaty to formally end the war. Tokyo insists the four islets are not part of the Kuril chain and should be returned under its control. \\nIn September, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bloomberg that Russia does not \u201ctrade territories.\u201d But ahead of his visit to Tokyo in mid-December, Japan\u2019s diplomatic sources told Kyodo News that Moscow would hand over Shikotan and Habomai islet group following the peace deal, as stated by the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. \\nThe sources, however, said Russia may be concerned that the US military could be stationed on the territories after Japan gets them back. According to Article 5 of the Japan-US security treaty, Washington is allowed to station its troops in areas administered by Japan. \\nThe Japanese government is now looking into the potential consequences, should they exclude the islands from Article 5, the sources said, with one of them adding that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could go as far as announcing that the islands do not fall under Article 5. \\nOther sources, however, think that \u201ca realistic scenario is that the prime minister shows his political will and seeks consent from the United States.\u201d \\nAt the same time, \u201cRussia won\u2019t agree to hand over [the islands] unless the possibility of stationing the US military there is ruled out,\u201d a source familiar with the Japanese-Russian ties told The Japan Times over the weekend. \\nNevertheless, convincing the US to okay such conditions seems very difficult, a Japanese government source said, adding that \u201cIt could even shake the foundations of the [Japan-US military] alliance.\u201d \\nFor Russia, the area around the disputed islands is of \u201cextremely high importance\u201d because it faces the Sea of Okhotsk, a Japanese government source said, and a foreign military in these waters could hamper both essential military drills and the use of a major access route to the Pacific Ocean. \\nTokyo has already rejected the report, saying they are not planning to review Article 5, TASS news agency said, citing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated it, adding that the Japan-US treaty \u201capplies and will apply\u201d to all territories and waters which are administered by Japan. \\nEarlier in the month, Tokyo also denied Nikkei\u2019s report that Japan and Russia were discussing joint administration of the Kuril Islands. \\n\u201cThere is no change in Japan\u2019s fundamental position that Japan will conclude the peace treaty with Russia by resolving the issue of the possession of the four northern islands,\u201d Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yasuhira Kawamura told Reuters in an email at that time. \\nRussia has always insisted that any change in the status of the islands is out of the question, as it would constitute a reassessment of the results of World War II, which is expressly banned by international treaties.'"}, "time": 1742628580.5309467}
