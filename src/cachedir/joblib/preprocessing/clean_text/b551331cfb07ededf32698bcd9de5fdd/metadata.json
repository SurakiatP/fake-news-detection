He no longer writes for The New Yorker or contributes to \u201cRadiolab\u201d on NPR. With this project  \u2014   his shot at redemption, provided to him by Simon  Schuster after his public tumble from grace  \u2014   Mr. Lehrer could have written something complex and considered. Books are still the slow food of the publishing business. Yet here is Mr. Lehrer, once again, serving us a nonfiction McMuffin. I wasn\u2019t expecting it. I was one of those weirdos who thought Mr. Lehrer would make a respectable comeback. He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s a decent stylist. He languished in the public stockade for weeks for his sins. Why wouldn\u2019t he try something personal, something soulful, something new? No clue. But he didn\u2019t. His book is insolently unoriginal. For those who don\u2019t know the author\u2019s story: Mr. Lehrer, 35, was once one of our culture\u2019s cuddliest pop intellectuals, specializing in neuroscience. From almost the moment he published his first book at 26, magazine editors couldn\u2019t get enough of him. He wrote two more books and became a   speaker on the guru rental market. But in the summer of 2012, he was caught recycling old material for his new blog at The New Yorker. Then it was discovered he\u2019d plagiarized several blog posts while working at Wired magazine. And then the journalist Michael Moynihan found that Mr. Lehrer had invented quotes from Bob Dylan for his third book, \u201cImagine,\u201d and misused the words Mr. Dylan actually did say. Later investigations showed that \u201cImagine\u201d contained many other factual errors. The book was pulled from shelves. So, too, was his second book, \u201cHow We Decide. \u201d Errors in even the finest works of nonfiction are ridiculously common. Gay Talese, who\u2019s been writing for almost twice as long as Mr. Lehrer has been alive, just had to concede that parts of his coming book, \u201cThe Voyeur\u2019s Motel,\u201d could not be wholly accurate after a reporter from The Washington Post phoned to point out he\u2019d missed essential information about his subject. What rankled about Mr. Lehrer was his \u201ccavalier attitude about truth and falsehood,\u201d in the words of the writer Charles Seife, who reviewed his work for Wired. In retrospect  \u2014   and I am hardly the first person to point this out  \u2014   the vote to excommunicate Mr. Lehrer was as much about the product he was peddling as the professional transgressions he was committing. It was a referendum on a certain genre of canned,   social science, one that traffics in bespoke platitudes for the middlebrow and rehearses the same studies without saying something new. Apparently, he\u2019s learned nothing. This book is a series of duckpin arguments, just waiting to be knocked down. Perhaps the flimsiest: that Shakespeare\u2019s famous   teenagers have come to define our understanding of love. \u201cBut this description of love  \u2014   the Romeo and Juliet version  \u2014   is woefully incomplete,\u201d he writes in the introduction. Love is not just lust, madness, or a great tidal flow of dopamine, he is quick to tell us. \u201cLove is a process, not a switch. \u201d Fine. But is there really any evolved adult who believes otherwise? When a widow wakes up sobbing in the middle of the night, mourning the loss of her husband of 50 years, is she mourning the loss of passion, giddy infatuation and great sex? No matter. Mr. Lehrer bangs this same note throughout the book. On Page 53, he says we wrongly assume that \u201cwhat we feel at first sight\u201d will help us predict   relationship outcomes on Page 104, he reminds us that our psychological needs have little to do with the romance of   songs. On Page 246, he\u2019s still saying it\u2019s commonly believed that \u201conce we fall in love, the love is supposed to take care of itself. \u201d But no: \u201cThis is wrong on every level. \u201d You know what he says love requires? Hard work. \u201cWhen a relationship endures,\u201d he explains, \u201cit is not because the flame never burns out. It is because the flame is always being relit. \u201d There\u2019s a lot of   counsel in this book, often followed by academic citations. It\u2019s like reading an advice column by way of JSTOR. To the extent that he has one, Mr. Lehrer\u2019s argument is that humans crave connection. He borrows heavily from attachment theory to explain how we approach relationships. We seek secure attachments to our parents, to our spouses, even to God, the ultimate \u201csecure base. \u201d The more securely attached we are, the healthier and more productive we are. He then hurls one   study after another at us to build his case, which really never required much building. At times, his book becomes such a dense plague of studies, I had no idea where Mr. Lehrer was heading. He devotes an entire subsection to the plasticity of our memories, noting how they alter every time we recall them. I fail to see how this relates to love, exactly. He says it\u2019s because \u201cif our memories never changed, then we might adapt to their pleasures. \u201d But I suspect it\u2019s really because Mr. Lehrer can phone this material in, having already riffed on it ad nauseam: In his first book, in a segment on Radiolab, in a number of blog posts and columns. It\u2019s his secure base. Most criminally: Love, we must assume, was Mr. Lehrer\u2019s salvation during his time of crisis. But he never once explains how. He barely  \u2014   and I mean barely  \u2014   mentions his wife. In a couple of places, he mentions that his brief exile made him a better father, but it\u2019s all terribly perfunctory. The most he\u2019ll say is that he\u2019s become \u201ca little more aware of what matters. \u201d He\u2019s written a book about love that has no heart. As for the question that\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind  \u2014   did Mr. Lehrer play by the rules in this book?  \u2014   I think the answer is complicated, but unpromising. In an author\u2019s note, Mr. Lehrer says that he sent his quotes to everyone he interviewed and that his book was independently  . And it\u2019s true that this book contains far more citations than his previous work. But I fear Mr. Lehrer has simply become more artful about his appropriations. At one point, for instance, he writes: \u201cWe don\u2019t love our kids despite their demands we love them because of them. Caregiving makes us care. \u201d I stopped dead when I read that sentence. Reread it. And read it again. It sounds to me like a clever adaptation of one of the most beautiful lines in \u201cThe Philosophical Baby\u201d by Alison Gopnik: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that we care for children because we love them as that we love them because we care for them. \u201d I\u2019m pretty certain Mr. Lehrer read Ms. Gopnik\u2019s quote. Why? Because I cite it in my own book  \u2014   which he cites, twice. (Though not for that.) He also wrote about \u201cThe Philosophical Baby\u201d for The Boston Globe. In his chapter on memory, I noticed a similar rewrite of a phrase from Sarah Bakewell\u2019s \u201cHow to Live. \u201d Though at least he credits Ms. Bakewell\u2019s ideas. These may seem like minor offenses. But what they betoken is a larger sort of intellectual dishonesty. If you squint, you\u2019ll see that Mr. Lehrer often rehashes arguments made by others, both in structure and content, when writing parts of his book. Sometimes he credits these people sometimes he doesn\u2019t. But the point is, he\u2019s relying on their associations and connections. I\u2019m guessing media reporters and other diligent reservists in the press corps will find a number of such examples. It suffices, for now, to say this: Mr. Lehrer devotes many pages in \u201cA Book About Love\u201d to how we grow and evolve. \u201cPeople change,\u201d he writes in his Coda. \u201cThat simple fact is one of the great themes of the longitudinal studies in this book. \u201d Perhaps Mr. Lehrer has changed  \u2014   personally. But not sufficiently as a writer. I fear it may be time, at long last, for him to find something else to do.'"}, "time": 1742564057.7957962}
