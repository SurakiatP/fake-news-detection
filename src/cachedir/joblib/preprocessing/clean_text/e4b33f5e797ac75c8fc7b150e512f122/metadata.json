A bunch of crybabies who say that they\u2019re going to oppose the Supreme Court nominees before they even know the person\u2019s name and academic credentials and impeccable judicial record. They are holding up our nominees to the cabinet. I was told yesterday this is the longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury at least in modern times, if not the longest, it\u2019s darn close to it. \u201d \u201cWe need a secretary of Treasury, folks, for those who actually go to work in the morning and need the dollar to flourish,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe need a secretary of Treasury to be running things. This obstinateness and obstruction is a modern Democratic Party. I think it\u2019s going to cost them because they\u2019re hysterical about everything now. There\u2019s no gradation of hysteria, everything makes them cry and scream. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564569.7354445}
