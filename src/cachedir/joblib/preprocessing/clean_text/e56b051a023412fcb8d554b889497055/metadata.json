October 27, 2016 Dr. Majid Rafizadeh \\nUnder Iran\u2019s Islamic laws, women are prohibited from performing basic day-to-day activities. I had firsthand experience of witnessing many of these strange and bizarre bans while living in Iran and other Muslim countries. Millions of women, including my relatives in Iran and Syria, continue to face these injustices. Some of the following rules, which are derived from Iran\u2019s Islamic constitution and moral police codes, were recently reported on by Deutsche Welle Farsi . They exist in may other Islamic countries as well: \\n1. Women are prohibited from taking selfies with soccer players. Specifically, Iran\u2019s \u201cmoral committee\u201d has banned women from taking selfies with famous soccer players. \\n2. Iranian women are prohibited from riding bicycles. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently issued an Islamic fatwa regarding officially banning women from riding bicycles. He argued that \"riding bicycles often attracts the attention of men and exposes the society to corruption, and thus contravenes women\\'s chastity, and it must be abandoned,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s state-run media. \\n3. Coffee shops are prohibited from hiring women. According to Iran\u2019s police, women are banned from working in any caf\u00e9s. \\n4. Iranian Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men. But Iranian Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women. \\n5. It is forbidden for women to wear boots over their pants. (Why? I am not sure what is Iran\u2019s Islamic logic behind this.) \\n6. Women are not allowed to wear hats instead of veils to cover their hair. \\n7. Women are not allowed to wear tight clothes that show their body curves. \\n8.

According to Iran\u2019s moral police, women are banned from wearing leggings. \\n13. Women are prohibited from showing strands of their hair on any side.

Article 1105 of the Civil Code states, \u201cIn relations between husband and wife, the position of the head of the family exclusively belongs to the husband.\u201d In addition, when it comes to employment laws, Article 1117 of the Civil Code indicates, \u201cThe husband can prevent his wife from an occupation or technical profession which is incompatible with the family\u2019s interests or the dignity of him or his wife.\u201d \\n23.
