As if this singular bill, passed by George W. Bush, wasn\u2019t invasive enough, allowing big banks to demand our internet data, and more \u2014 the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( CISA ) makes cyber-spying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it, a forgone conclusion. \\nAs with most shadow government legislation, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances. CISA was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will. It also allows companies to mine data, under the auspices of government-created urgency. \\nThe mere fact that this act passed in late 2015 is monumental, since it has been before Congress in different forms for over a decade . The election seems to have offered the perfect cover, as Americans and activists were too busy arguing over Trump vs. Hillary. \\nScott Talbott, senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of \u2018cyber threats\u2019 outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties. Talbott states , \\n\u201cThe value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore CISA, corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage. CISA allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy.\u201d \\nWho exactly would be determining if someone is a \u2018threat\u2019 is the meat of the sandwich, though. CISA is ripe for abuse, just as the Patriot Act has been. \\nThe Patriot Act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people, without probable cause \u2013 to enter their homes, or even to strip search them before they\u2019ve been to court, had the opportunity to argue a case, or given \u2018authorities\u2019 a motive for this type of interrogation. \\nThe stated purpose of the Patriot Act was to deter terrorist acts in the United States, but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country? CISA simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law. \\nMore importantly, who specifically is CISA targeting? After multiple hack\\xaders have in\\xadfilt\\xadrated com\\xadputer sys\\xadtems at the White House , the State De\\xadpart\\xadment , the Pentagon , and the Of\\xadfice of Per\\xadson\\xadnel Man\\xadage\\xadment, along with the Democratic National Committee , and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal, is the shadow government simply trying to create a stop-gap before their most elusive, yet damning information is made public? \\nCISA certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the National Security Agency (NSA) before former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed it. \\n\u201cI think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start,\u201d said Justin Harvey, CSO of Fidelis Cybersecurity, adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill \u2013 to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur \u2013 will result. \\nUnder the guise of \u2018sharing cyber threats\u2019 CISA allows companies to wholesale-collect information that may not even be a threat \u2013 and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is, indeed a threat. If this sounds like circular logic \u2013 it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill. It\u2019s justifications for entering every possible orifice for data-gathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket. \\nThe government can already enter your personal property including your home, your body , your cell, and your computer , but now they will have a legal in-roads to declare you a cyber-threat, simply for sending an email . This begs the question \u2013 who is the real cyber-bully? CISA seems to be nothing more than a prevarication, covering the acts of an elite few who don\u2019t want their secrets exposed.
