C. Metro trains and blocking roads. [The video adds a layer of deep detail to a story by Ryan Lovelace in the Washington Examiner earlier this month, \u201cHow protesters plan to wreck Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u201d which first reported the efforts of \u201c#DisruptJ20. \u201d  One activist leader is captured on the Project Veritas video saying: \u201cSo simultaneous to the checkpoint blockades in the morning, we are also doing a series of clusterfuck blockades, where we are going to try to blockade all the major ingress points into the city. \u201d The blockade plan allegedly included stopping the D. C. Metro, according to an audio recording: So we figured out this, um, the trains pull up, one person is going to lock one end of a chain to an edge, and on the other end of the chain the end of the car, so on and so forth, done. It takes 15 seconds and everyone can leave and literally it can\u2019t go anywhere at that point, its anchored. And you can use a really thin chain  \u2014   you don\u2019t need a heavy chain  \u2014   that would require like a bolt cutter to undo, basically to shut down that line   \u2026     Metro Center, Gallery Place, and L\u2019Enfant Plaza, they are all close enough to walk to and that\u2019s every single line in the city. Another plan allegedly involved using setting up tables, ostensibly for distributing charitable donations for the poor and homeless, to block roads to the inauguration: \u201cSo, we want to encourage you all to give to the poor and the homeless. Go right down to 2nd and D, help us to block the vehicle traffic and the pedestrian traffic flowing to the inauguration. And set up tables, food, give out whatever,  right there, there 2nd and D a block from either direction and help to block traffic. \u201d One of the more creative plans apparently discussed was to move protesters into position near a park by posing as members of a yoga class. Other apparent discussions involved violent tactics to use in street battles with police. One activist expresses the desire to see the inauguration moved inside because of the protests. The Project Veritas video is Part Two of a series on   protests of the inauguration. Part One, released on Monday, showed activists planning to set off stink bombs at an   party. Joel B.
