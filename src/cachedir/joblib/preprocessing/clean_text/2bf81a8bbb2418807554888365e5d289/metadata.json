But they did not expect to have a   seat to an annual   event. For two years in a row, Dr. Dubroff said on Tuesday, she has spotted a whale swimming outside her living room window. Last year, she didn\u2019t quite believe the sighting was real. But she saw a whale again on Saturday  \u2014   and in the same spot again on Sunday  \u2014   and news reports confirmed her hunch: The Hudson River has a resident humpback. \u201cIt was general excitement and shock,\u201d Dr. Dubroff, 39, said, \u201cand how thrilling that a whale can be in the Hudson, based on what we see float by sometimes. \u201d Indeed, the Hudson, as scenic as it is, does not scream \u201cwhale habitat. \u201d But experts say cleanup and conservation efforts have led to cleaner waters and an abundance of fish, amenities that have attracted at least one humpback whale to the river waters off Manhattan this month. There are other humpbacks in waters nearby. According to Jen Goebel, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whales have been spotted near New York. And the Coast Guard said in a statement on Monday that it had fielded reports of a whale sighting in northern New Jersey waters, swimming from Sandy Hook to Raritan Bay. The   whale that Dr. Dubroff saw in the West 60s last weekend is thought to be the same one that has traversed the waterway, traveling to Liberty Island and to the George Washington Bridge, since it was first sighted around Nov. 9, according to the Coast Guard. Paul Sieswerda, the president of Gotham Whale, an organization that tracks marine life around the city, said the whale had been seen by New Yorkers who have captured photos and videos of it feeding and swimming. Mr. Sieswerda said that it was common to see humpbacks in the waters off New York at this time of year, as the whales finish up their feeding season and begin to think about heading south to breed in warmer waters. \u201cThe whales found this spot as a feeding ground,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than go all the way up to Massachusetts and Maine, they\u2019ve found a good feeding ground right here in New York. \u201d The Hudson whale, which Mr. Sieswerda nicknamed Gotham, seems to be healthy and has been exhibiting a behavior called lunge feeding, in which a whale swims forward, mouth agape, as it captures thousands of gallons of water. Inside the gulps, Mr. Sieswerda said, are likely sizable amounts of menhaden, a small forager fish that fishermen call bunker  \u2014   a veritable fish buffet. A whale appearing in the Hudson is very rare, Mr. Sieswerda said, which is why he thinks this one is a solo traveler. But the whale still faces significant danger because it is swimming in   waters. \u201cIt\u2019s in a very busy area of   activity, and it\u2019s going up and down the Hudson, inside the harbor where big ships are,\u201d Mr. Sieswerda said. \u201cSo far, it seems to be O. K. and, hopefully, can detect the boats. \u201d The Coast Guard has urged boaters and fishermen to slow down to avoid distressing the humpbacks, which can grow to 60 feet and can weigh around 40 tons. \u201cWhen you have whales chasing the bunker, and fishermen chasing the stripers that chase the bunker, accidental interactions between whales and vessels can occur,\u201d Jeff Ray, a deputy special agent with NOAA\u2019s law enforcement division, said in the Coast Guard\u2019s release. Kayakers and boaters should take extra care to steer at least 100 feet clear of any whales in the area, according to Ms. Goebel, the NOAA spokeswoman. Elsewhere, trouble can lurk for whales in shallow waters. About 80 miles from Manhattan, a humpback whale spent a week stuck in Moriches Bay, off the southern coast of Long Island, and over two days stuck in a sand bar in four feet of water. It was euthanized on Wednesday afternoon by a veterinarian with NOAA\u2019s Marine Mammal Stranding Network, Ms. Goebel said. She added that NOAA will work with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to remove the whale\u2019s body. Chuck Bowman, the president of the Riverhead Foundation, was among those who had helped to monitor the stranded whale while awaiting guidance from NOAA. \u201cThe good thing was 30 years ago you\u2019d see maybe one whale off of Long Island a season,\u201d Mr. Bowman said. \u201cNow you see them all the time due to conservation efforts. \u201d But, he added, \u201cYou get a bigger population and you get a greater chance of things like this happening. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563502.792078}
