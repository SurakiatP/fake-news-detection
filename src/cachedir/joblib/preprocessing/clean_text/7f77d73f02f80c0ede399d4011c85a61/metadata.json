The US election result has convinced many Britons they are dreaming but something even more bizarre and implausible will happen soon and make them wake up. Office worker Tom Logan said: \u201cTrump\u2019s the president apparently, so I expect some proper dream weirdness will happen soon, like being chased through Asda by a cyberman. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd dream though because I\u2019m at work and it\u2019s all very detailed, almost like real life. Still, at least I\u2019m not naked or I\u2019ve got some stressful task to do that\u2019s really illogical. \u201cI\u2019m sure any minute now I\u2019ll be able to laugh at this whole Trump business when Holly Willoughby turns up and takes me for a sexy ride in her helicopter.\u201d Accountant Donna Sheridan said: \u201cThis is a long dream but nothing totally incongruous has happened yet like taking my childhood dog to get his nails clipped by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. \u201cTrump can\u2019t have won the election though because that\u2019s insane. Frankly I\u2019ll feel better if it turns into a proper nightmare where I\u2019m being made to re-sit my A-levels by a witch. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t won, has he? Maybe I should wait a bit before going for a fly out of the window.\u201d \\nShare: '"}, "time": 1742563891.4511652}
