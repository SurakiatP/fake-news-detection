They started giving Bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches, and even pooled their allowances to buy Bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he wouldn\u2019t go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled. \\n\u201cBryce didn\u2019t have anything to eat, so we knew we had to help him out,\u201d said Willow Creek student Kali Summers. \u201cWe gave him our lunches every day, even if we got really hungry. We knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we wouldn\u2019t have to go to school.\u201d \\nThe plan worked perfectly. In a matter of months, Bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on 115 pounds, got stuck in the door, and school got canceled. The students were so successful in plumping Bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out. \\nMission accomplished! \\nDue to these kids\u2019 selfless dedication, not only did Bryce not go hungry, but all of the kids and teachers were able to stay home from school to play, watch TV, and relax instead of going to school for a full two days. They aren\u2019t stopping there, either: Even though Bryce is now bigger than any other student in the district, the kids are going to continue to give him lunches in hopes that he can get stuck in the door so tightly that school gets canceled for a full week. \\nBeautiful! Adults could learn a thing or two about kindness and commitment to your dreams from these remarkable kids.'"}, "time": 1742563120.3094}
