His movie company, troubled by executive departures and   misfires, had neither the money nor the manpower needed to sustain an awards campaign, Hollywood conventional wisdom held. And Mr. Weinstein\u2019s primary contender this time around, \u201cLion,\u201d an adoption drama set in India and based on an astonishing true story, was generating virtually no tastemaker buzz. What a difference the Toronto International Film Festival can make. The festival, which runs until Sunday, has shaken up the coming film season in multiple ways. \u201cJackie,\u201d starring Natalie Portman as President John F. Kennedy\u2019s traumatized widow, was thrust into the Oscar conversation on Tuesday, when Fox Searchlight  \u2014   perhaps hedging its bet on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d now surrounded by controversy  \u2014   bought the film after its screening here. The studio plans to release \u201cJackie\u201d on Dec. 9. Footage from \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about black female mathematicians who helped NASA put Americans on the moon, made a boisterous debut. \u201cSing,\u201d a coming animated movie about a   vocal competition, may have elbowed its way into the race for best   cartoon, an unusually competitive category this year. But few used the festival to better advantage than Mr. Weinstein, who is credited with inventing and perfecting the modern awards game, even if his Oscar entrant last season, \u201cCarol,\u201d came up short. \u201cLion,\u201d which stars Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara, had its premiere here on Saturday  \u2014   most major films, including \u201cJackie,\u201d had already been seen elsewhere  \u2014   and generated a stream of euphoric responses from entertainment reporters and some critics. \u201cHarvey\u2019s baaack,\u201d Scott Feinberg, a longtime Academy Awards handicapper for The Hollywood Reporter, said on Twitter. In a subsequent article analyzing \u201cLion,\u201d Mr. Feinberg wrote, \u201cThe nature of its story and reception suggests, to me, that embattled Harvey is headed back to the place where he\u2019s most at home: the Oscars. \u201d \u201cLion\u201d is based on Saroo Brierley\u2019s   memoir (with Larry Buttrose) recounting his days on the streets as a boy, adoption and eventual quest to find his birth mother. Pundits are not critics, of course, and   from trade publications were mixed. Some saw a     crowd pleaser in \u201cLion,\u201d which is set for release on Nov. 25 and directed by Garth Davis in his   debut. (Until now, Mr. Davis has been primarily known for commercials, including \u201cNinja Kittens\u201d for Toyota.) But a few other critics were underwhelmed, with Peter Debruge of Variety especially cutting. Mr. Weinstein was not available for an interview, according to David Glasser, the Weinstein Company\u2019s president and chief operating officer. For his part, Mr. Glasser, speaking by telephone on Monday night, said that his studio made a strategic decision to keep as much of a lid on \u201cLion\u201d as possible ahead of the Toronto event. \u201cBring it in, and let the audience discover it  \u2014   that was the goal,\u201d Mr. Glasser said. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that people responded so favorably. \u201d But a nagging question remains: Does the Weinstein Company have the resources required to make a real splash for \u201cLion\u201d on the awards circuit? Oscar campaigns can cost millions of dollars. Although the studio found various levels of success last year with \u201cSouthpaw\u201d and \u201cWoman in Gold,\u201d recent releases like \u201cHands of Stone,\u201d a boxing drama, and the period musical \u201cSing Street\u201d have failed to connect with ticket buyers. In July, the company rescheduled two releases virtually at the last minute, prompting speculation about its financial health. Executive departures have also raised eyebrows in Hollywood. Mr. Glasser grew indignant when asked whether the Weinstein Company could afford to mount a   awards campaign for \u201cLion. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the most ridiculous comment I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have the wherewithal? Yes. Absolutely. Unconditionally. \u201d Along with \u201cLion,\u201d the Weinstein Company is gearing up for the    releases of \u201cThe Founder,\u201d about Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) and his creation of the McDonald\u2019s   empire, and \u201cGold,\u201d starring Matthew McConaughey as a prospector who runs into trouble in the jungles of Borneo. But \u201cLion\u201d is the studio\u2019s primary hope for an   hit. While it faces obstacles at the box office  \u2014   a large portion of the film, for instance, is in Bengali with English subtitles  \u2014   Mr. Glasser said he was confident that a strong campaign and positive word of mouth would help \u201cLion\u201d strike a chord with ticket buyers, not to mention awards voters. (\u201cLion\u201d comes from a producing team that includes Iain Canning and Emile Sherman, two of the forces behind \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d which won best picture for Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob, at the 2011 Academy Awards.) And the Weinsteins may well have another \u201cLion\u201d trick or two up their sleeves. Expect them, for instance, to connect the film to philanthropic efforts to help young Indian orphans. \u201cNot only is this an amazing true story,\u201d Mr. Glasser said, \u201cbut it also brings attention to an incredibly relevant social cause. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628470.5689547}
