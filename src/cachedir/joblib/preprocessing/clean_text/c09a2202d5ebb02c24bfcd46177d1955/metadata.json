Margarita: \\nNot many (probably) remember that the largely successful effort to gut tort laws around the country started in mid-80s by insurance companies, after they lost money in the early 1980s real estate boom/bust. Not satisfied with the current tepid tort laws, they are at it again. \\nAnd Adam Levitin via e-mail: \\nI love that the arbitration is getting priced. This is a great example of what I\u2019ve tried to teach in contracts for years: the law only looks at the one-off contract. But the insurer doesn\u2019t give a shit about the individual contract. It\u2019s all actuarial tables. And that creates a total mismatch. The consumer is a one time player, while the insurer is a repeat player. The consumer will rationally value the arbitration clause at basically nothing (there\u2019s an optimism bias too\u2013no one gets married thinking that they\u2019re going to get divorced), because the odds of it being important are so low and there\u2019s only one contract. But because the insurer is doing multiple contracts, even low odds matter. As a result consumers will never properly price for arbitration clauses and the like. \\nNotice, btw, that the CFPB cannot stop this because it doesn\u2019t have authority over home insurance. That\u2019s all state level regulation. \\nSamsung recalls 2.8 million washing machines in U.S. over injury risk Reuters.
