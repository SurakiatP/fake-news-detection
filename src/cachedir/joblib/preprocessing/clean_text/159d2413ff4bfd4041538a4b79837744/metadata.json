Trump\u2019s visit to a black church here on Saturday will be a major moment for a candidate with a history of offending the sensibilities of black Americans. His team was leaving nothing to chance. Instead of speaking to the congregation at Great Faith Ministries International, Mr. Trump had planned to be interviewed by its pastor in a session that would be closed to the public and the news media, with questions submitted in advance. And instead of letting Mr. Trump be his freewheeling self, his campaign prepared lengthy answers for the submitted questions, consulting black Republicans to make sure he says the right things. An   draft script obtained by The New York Times shows 12 questions that Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, the pastor, intends to ask Mr. Trump in the taped    session, as well as the responses Mr. Trump is being advised to give. The proposed answers were devised by aides working for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, according to an official who has been involved in the planning but declined to be identified while speaking about confidential strategy. The document includes the exact wording of answers the aides are proposing for Mr. Trump to give to questions about police killings, racial tension and the perception among many black voters that he and the Republican Party are racist, among other topics. The official said the answers could change based on feedback from the black Republicans they are consulting with. After this article was published online Thursday night, Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s plans had changed and that he would address the congregation for five to 10 minutes after the interview. Mr. Trump will then visit neighborhoods with Ben Carson, a onetime campaign rival, who supports Mr. Trump and grew up in Detroit. \u201cIf you know anything about Mr. Trump, it\u2019s that he will want the opportunity to take his vision and message of opportunity directly to the people on Saturday,\u201d Mr. Miller said. It is not uncommon for a candidate to request interview questions in advance aides to Hillary Clinton do it from time to time. But it is unusual for a campaign to go so far as to prepare a script for a candidate\u2019s own responses, and highlights the sensitivity of Mr. Trump\u2019s first appearance at a black church. A series of slights, including his questioning of President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, has not endeared him to black voters. The interview will air about a week later on the Impact Network, Bishop Jackson\u2019s Christian cable TV channel. The official said several Trump aides would work with the network to edit the taped interview so that the final version reflected the campaign\u2019s wishes. (On Thursday night, Mr. Miller said the campaign would not edit the interview.) The arrangements had angered several black Republicans, who urged Mr. Trump, widely seen as distant from the black community, to speak for at least 10 minutes at the service, the official involved in the planning said. The official added that the campaign had been uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s speaking before the congregation and had insisted on a private interview. On Thursday night, the campaign said Mr. Trump would indeed address the congregation for a few minutes and would spend a   casually speaking with church members individually. Mr. Trump is well known for veering from prepared remarks or throwing them away entirely. That could happen on Saturday: Many of the answers being prepared for him do not sound much like Mr. Trump as his usual self. When asked about his vision for black Americans, the script suggests that Mr. Trump stay positive, advising that he use lines such as \u201cIf we are to make America great again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country\u201d and \u201cI want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. \u201d To a question submitted by Bishop Jackson about whether his campaign is racist, the script suggests that Mr. Trump avoid repeating the word, and instead speak about improving education and getting people off welfare and back to work. \u201cThe proof, as they say, will be in the pudding,\u201d Mr. Trump is advised to say. \u201cComing into a community is meaningless unless we offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. \u201d To the first question, \u201cAre you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?\u201d the scriptwriters have a response they hope will keep Mr. Trump from repeating previous stumbles when asked about his faith. \u201cAs I went through my life, things got busy with business, but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God,\u201d the script has Mr. Trump saying. \u201cI treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an   God. \u201d Bishop Jackson said Thursday that he saw no problem with the campaign\u2019s asking to screen his questions, and noted that in the past he had given advance text of prayers he planned to deliver at the White House. \u201cWe want this to be as peaceful as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I promised would happen. I promised that: You are coming into a place to be interviewed and we don\u2019t want anybody to be hurt or anybody to be misused, so that\u2019s it. \u201d Of all the proposed answers, the most   might be his reply to the final question of the interview: What he would say to undecided black voters? \u201cIf you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down,\u201d Mr. Trump is directed to say, adding, \u201cBy the way, my support is now up to 8 percent and climbing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563037.2648902}
