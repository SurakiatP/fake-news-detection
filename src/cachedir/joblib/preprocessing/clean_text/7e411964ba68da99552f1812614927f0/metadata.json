As the chief executive of Mylan, the owner of the severe allergy treatment EpiPen, Ms. Bresch is at the center of the latest public outrage over high drug prices, excoriated for overseeing a fourfold price increase on EpiPen while taking a huge pay raise. From talk shows to Twitter, her name is being mentioned alongside Martin Shkreli, the   Pharma Bro who ignited anger last fall over raising the price of the drug Daraprim, and J. Michael Pearson, the onetime McKinsey consultant who took over Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and sharply raised prices on lifesaving drugs. But Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Pearson were outliers trying to upend the industry. At one point, the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s main lobbying group disavowed them. Not so with Ms. Bresch. In many ways, she is an ultimate insider. Her father is a United States senator. She runs one of the largest generic drug companies in the world. She also oversees the Generic Pharmaceutical Association  \u2014   the generic industry\u2019s lobbying group. Now the question is whether her different position will give her a different result. Both Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Pearson were forced out of their companies. Already, Ms. Bresch, 47, has moved more quickly than they did to quell public furor over prices. On Thursday, she announced that the company was increasing financial assistance to patients to reduce their    costs. But the company did not say it would lower the list price  \u2014   which has risen to about $600 for a pack of two EpiPens, from about $100 when Mylan acquired the product in 2007. In an interview, Ms. Bresch said the price increases on EpiPen weren\u2019t even in the \u201csame hemisphere\u201d as what Mr. Shkreli did when he raised the price of Daraprim by 50 times overnight. Over the years, her brash leadership style has bruised egos but also, some say, improved access to drugs and raised quality standards. Her company, Mylan, also has a reputation for   tactics that have angered competitors and investors alike. \u201cI think we mean what we say: You can do good and do well, and I think we strike that balance around the globe,\u201d Ms. Bresch said. Still, she was unapologetic that Mylan\u2019s actions were driven by profit. \u201cI am running a business. I am a   business. I am not hiding from that. \u201d How the company, and Ms. Bresch, strikes that balance seems to be quickly changing. Generic drug companies once dealt almost exclusively in making cheap copies of pills and railed passionately against the anticompetitive tactics of   competitors. Now, through a series of acquisitions and mergers, the handful of large generic companies that are left are increasingly investing in expensive   drugs, and in doing so, are embracing many of the tactics they once scorned. \u201cIt\u2019s like talking out of both sides of your mouth,\u201d said Dinesh Thakur, an advocate for generic drug quality. \u201cTo me, I think, it\u2019s opportunistic. \u201d In the interview, Ms. Bresch said the company\u2019s latest actions would do the most to help patients where it mattered, by reducing their    costs. And she said that the $600 list price was necessary for the company to recoup its investment in the EpiPen, which includes raising awareness for severe allergic reaction and making improvements to the way the product works. But she also sought to shift blame away from Mylan, saying that patients are feeling the pain in part because insurers have increased the amount that customers must pay in recent years. \u201cWhat else do you shop for that when you walk up to the counter, you have no idea what it\u2019s going to cost you?\u201d she said. \u201cTell me where that happens anywhere else in the system. It\u2019s unconscionable. \u201d To some, the company\u2019s response seemed to ring hollow. \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge to understand how a management team sits around a board table and makes a decision to raise the price of a lifesaving medication over and over and over, and when the P. R. storm hits, decides to blame someone else for that price increase,\u201d said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo. He had warned investors in June that Mylan\u2019s price increases on EpiPen and other drugs could soon draw unwanted media scrutiny. The company is not a stranger to controversy. Robert J. Coury, Mylan\u2019s chairman who served as chief executive until 2011, came under scrutiny in 2012 for using the company\u2019s corporate jet to travel to his son\u2019s music concerts. And last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that one of the board members had undisclosed ties to the land where the company built its new Pittsburgh offices. Ms. Bresch has also weathered her share of controversy, like when it was discovered that West Virginia University awarded her a business degree 10 years after she had attended the school, even though she had completed only about half of the coursework. A report by the university later concluded that officials wrongly awarded her the degree because she was the daughter of the   Joe Manchin, now a Democratic senator representing West Virginia. Mr. Manchin and Ms. Bresch have said they did nothing wrong. The company also angered shareholders when it switched its headquarters to the Netherlands, and then used a   provision in Dutch law to block a takeover by the pharmaceutical giant Teva, which many investors had favored. The move to the Netherlands in 2014, called an inversion, also reduced the company\u2019s tax rate. Mylan is one of a string of pharmaceutical companies that have done inversions in recent years, prompting outcry in Washington and calls to limit the practice. Ms. Bresch\u2019s rising salary has also fueled anger over the EpiPen price increase. Since 2007, when EpiPen was acquired and she was the company\u2019s chief operating officer, she earned about $2. 5 million in total compensation. In 2015, her compensation was nearly $19 million. Mylan\u2019s board has said in company filings that it believes her pay is justified because she has contributed significantly to the company\u2019s growth in recent years. Ms. Bresch, who has worked at Mylan for 25 years, said her West Virginia upbringing had informed her approach to serving as chief executive. \u201cThere is a work ethic and grit about that that allows me to help make a difference,\u201d she said. Some of the chafing at her style, she said, is because people are resistant to change. Her top accomplishments, she said, include getting a federal law passed that required more inspections of overseas drug manufacturers, and improving access to AIDS drugs for patients overseas. \u201cTo make change happen, to make a difference, mediocrity doesn\u2019t get you there,\u201d she said. Even as they have ruffled feathers within the industry, Ms. Bresch and Mylan have earned measured praise from consumer advocates, who said she wielded her influence in ways that helped consumers. James Love, director of the consumers group Knowledge Ecology International, said Ms. Bresch opened doors at the Office of the United States Trade Representative when his group and others were working to change provisions in the proposed   Partnership that they said would have limited access to drugs by people overseas. Mylan, as a seller of generic drugs, shared their interest, he said. \u201cThey came in with some very talented people in the negotiations, and they knew what was going on politically,\u201d Mr. Love said. Still, he said, he opposes their position on the EpiPen and said his group was composing a letter of complaint to the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cI\u2019m appalled at the price increase,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sugarcoat that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563543.301642}
