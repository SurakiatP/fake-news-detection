[In an extended interview with the leftist Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, the Pope reaffirmed basic Catholic doctrine regarding immigration, namely, that sovereign nations have the fundamental right to maintain secure borders and to receive immigrants in an orderly and controlled fashion.  \u201cYes, every country has the right to control its borders, who comes and who goes,\u201d Francis said Friday, \u201cand those countries at risk  \u2014  from terrorism or such things \u2014   have even more right to control them more. \u201d The one qualification to this right, the pontiff continued, is that \u201cno country has the right to deprive its citizens of the possibility to talk with their neighbors,\u201d as often has occurred in the case of totalitarian states such as East Germany and the U. S. S. R. Over and over again the Pope has made it clear that he does not believe in illegal immigration, and that states must maintain secure borders for the safety of their citizens. At the same time, he has often insisted that individuals as well as nations should keep their hearts open to people who migrate from their homelands in search of a better life. In Friday\u2019s interview, Francis stated that \u201ceach immigrant constitutes a very serious problem,\u201d since they are often \u201cfleeing their country, because of hunger or because of war. \u201d Often, too, they are \u201cexploited,\u201d he added, citing Africa as an example of where this often occurs. The pontiff praised the examples of Italy and Greece, holding them up as models of welcoming migrants. \u201cEven now, Italy, with all the problems caused by the earthquake and all that, still cares for them. They welcome them,\u201d he said. As he has done on other occasions, the Pope also highlighted the problem of integration, that is, the possibility of successfully assimilating immigrants into the existing culture. \u201cWhere there is no integration,\u201d Francis said, immigrants become \u201cghettoized,\u201d and do not become part of the culture of their host country. As an example of this, Francis said that the perpetrators of \u201cthe atrocity in Zaventem,\u201d the Belgian airport, \u201clived in an immigrant neighborhood, a closed neighborhood. \u201d Last fall, he warned nations that they should not be taking in more immigrants and refugees than they can reasonably assimilate. As models of successful integration of migrants, Francis held up Sweden and the Catholic community of Sant\u2019Egidio in Italy. In his interview, the Pope once more underscored the right of Catholics and others to contradict him. \u201cThey have the right to disagree,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the right to think that the path is dangerous, that the outcome may be bad, they have that right. \u201d At the same time, Francis said that such opposition should be carried out openly, and not in secret. \u201cHiding behind others is inhumane, it is a crime,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has the right to debate, and I wish we all would debate more, because it creates a smoother connection between us. Debate unites us. \u201d Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome'"}, "time": 1742563309.0148814}
