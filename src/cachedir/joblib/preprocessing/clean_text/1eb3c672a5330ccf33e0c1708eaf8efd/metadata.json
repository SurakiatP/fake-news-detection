DENK is also proposing a 1,000 strong \u2018racism\u2019 police and national anti-immigration registry which will target anyone who says anything \u2018Islamophobic\u2019 against Muslims. Legal Insurrection is reporting ( h/t Truth Revolt ) that the Netherlands\u2019 pro-Muslim immigration Denk Party is pushing for a thousand-strong \u201cRacism Police\u201d to go after thought and speech crimes against Muslims which would result in a registry for offenders, fines, and re-education camps. The party, dominated by members of Turkish and Muslim origin was founded in 2014 by two former-socialist Turkish politicians but it already sits in the Dutch parliament and is hoping to mobilize the country\u2019s million-strong mainly Muslim immigrant population (out of about 17 million overall) and growing Muslim population, currently at about 7 percent, in the parliamentary elections to be held early next year. Tunahan Kuzu and Sel\u00e7uk \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Among the Denk Party\u2019s latest proposals are the renaming of streets and tunnels suggestive of Dutch colonial and slave trading history, changing the term \u201cforeigner\u201d to \u201cTurkish and Surinamese Dutch person,\u201d creating a thousand-man \u201cRacism Police,\u201d establishing stricter sentences for \u201cracist and discriminatory behavior,\u201d and listing offenders on a nationwide \u201cRacism Register\u201d \u2014 you know, just like child molesters. This multicultural champion has close ties to Erdogan\u2019s Turkish-Islamist AKP party and it refuses to recognize the genocide of Armenian Christians. According to a recent Dutch poll, nearly 90 percent of young Turkish-Dutch sympathize with ISIS \u2014 90 percent . This is the Denk Party\u2019s political base. Denk Party stands in the tradition of George Galloway\u2019s Respect Party in UK, a new mutant ideology taking root in Europe that fuses leftist \u201csocial justice\u201d issues with political Islam, dipped in fierce hatred for Israel and Western heritage. Last month, the Denk Party attracted media attention when party\u2019s leader and Dutch MP Tunahan Kuzu refused to shake hands with the visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu. What should worry the freedom-loving people \u2014 on the either side of the Atlantic \u2014 is not just the outrageous nature of Denk Party\u2019s proposals, but the determined effort already underway in Europe to criminalize \u201cundesired\u201d speech and political dissident. The E.U. has long been pressuring its media to omit mentions of Islam when Muslims are involved in terrorism. UK Express DENK proposes a ban on words like \u2018native\u2019 and \u2018immigrant\u2019 would be introduced, alongside a national holiday to celebrate Muslim diversity. The party aims to reinvent Dutch national identity, and the program is geared towards tackling the institutional racism/Islamophobia it says is endemic in the Netherlands. And part of that is scrapping the government\u2019s ideals of integration, claiming this should not be expected of Muslim migrants, but rather an atmosphere of \u2018mutual acceptance\u2019 should be adopted. (In other words, forcing Dutch natives to give up their customs and culture and accommodate the Muslim way of doing things) Tackling racism/Islamophobia should begin in schools, with pro-Islam attitudes promoted in the classroom through citizenship classes, and that students are regularly tested to see if they are meeting the required benchmark.'"}, "time": 1742628535.253558}
