Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times.\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,\u201d Carville claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,\u201d he said. \\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he added. \\nCarville was very upset that Comey\\'s announcement thrust Clinton\\'s behavior back into the spotlight. \"It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn\\'t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that\\'s what happened here \u2014 there\\'s nothing else that\\'s going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\" he said. \"To me that\\'s something we ought to be talking about.\" \\nUnfortunately for Carville, fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI in the GOP\\'s pocket certainly make for interesting entertainment \u2014 but they pale in importance to the real-life stories of Clinton\\'s brazen lawlessness. \\nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI\\'s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. \\n\"When the facts change I change my mind,\" Carville said. \"Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\" he asked. \\n\"This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\" Carville repeated. \"And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about [how] our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.\"'"}, "time": 1742564570.687683}
