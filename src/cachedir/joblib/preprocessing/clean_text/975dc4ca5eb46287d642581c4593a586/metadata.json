Trump won the 2016 presidential election and now sits in the oval office as the 45th president of the United States. [\u201cThere will be some people who will say, \u2018Just go coach your basketball team,\u2019\u201d San Antonio\u2019s head leftist said. \u201cJust go do this, go sit in your sauna, just go run the football, whatever it might be. \u201d  But that\u2019s not his style, reported WTHR 13. How can he relax when America has been taken over by an outside force? \u201cSome days, I feel like we\u2019ve been invaded by another power and taken over [by people] who don\u2019t feel the same. It\u2019s a strange land,\u201d the   NBA     laments.  Popovich continued: We all hope President Trump is successful. We hope he does some good things for everyone, but he didn\u2019t start the presidency by mollifying any groups he disparaged during the campaign. He didn\u2019t say anything about women, or black people, or Mexican people, Hispanic people, LGBT people, handicapped people. [He] acted like it never happened,\u201d Popovich said. So that willingness to do whatever it took to get elected, to say and act the way he did, I thought was unacceptable and really disgusting, so I said it. Even people who voted for him can see that, but for some reason, they feel they can ignore that or forget about it. His personality, [his] inability to get over himself, informs his words and his decisions, and that\u2019s what\u2019s scary. Of course, Popovich is not alone when it comes to NBA coaches dumping on President Trump.  Detroit Pistons losing coach Stan Van Gundy expressed his sentiments in January, saying that America \u201ctook a major step back\u201d when voters elected Trump. He added, \u201cWe elected a man who said some of the worst things ever, and people still voted for him. It\u2019s been over a month and I still can\u2019t believe so many were willing ignore racism, sexism, and mistreatment of the LGBTQ community. \u201d Plus, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr is on record for saying, \u201cThe man who\u2019s going to lead you has routinely used racist, misogynist, insulting words. That\u2019s a tough one. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562342.5774302}
