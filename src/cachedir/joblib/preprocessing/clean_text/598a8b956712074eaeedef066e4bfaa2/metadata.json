But once you\u2019re done watching the news, might I suggest \u201cThe Americans\u201d? Yeah, it\u2019s a cheap joke. But if television\u2019s best drama finally gets the buzz it deserves because evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election served as viral marketing  \u2014   well, as Comrade Trotsky once said, \u201cThe end may justify the means as long as there is something that justifies the end. \u201d If you\u2019re new to the series (the first four seasons are on Amazon Prime) it follows Elizabeth and Philip Jennings (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) married K. G. B. agents posing as travel agents in suburban Virginia during the Reagan era. While raising two American children, they\u2019ve donned fabulous wigs, ferreted out military secrets and killed innocents in service of the fading Soviet empire  \u2014   all to a     soundtrack. When the first season, in 2013, had Elizabeth and Philip bug the home of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, it seemed outlandish enough. A writer who suggested a successful   to help install Russia\u2019s preferred United States presidential candidate would have been laughed out of the room. In the light of today\u2019s headlines, this Cold War drama feels newly relevant  \u2014   but also almost comfortingly  . In the 1980s of \u201cThe Americans,\u201d the    lines are at least clear. Ronald Reagan denounced the \u201cEvil Empire,\u201d whereas President Trump\u2019s top adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, has been quoted comparing himself to Lenin. But the series\u2019 nuanced depiction of espionage as grinding emotional labor is still enthralling. Season 5, which begins Tuesday on FX, finds the Jenningses\u2019 entanglements deepening. Their teenage daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor) having learned that her parents are spies, is being groomed for the family business. She\u2019s also dating the son of their neighbor Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) who happens to be an F. B. I. agent. (Philip also has a   grown son, who unbeknown to Philip is wending his way to America for a surprise family reunion.) Philip and Elizabeth, meanwhile, have been assigned to befriend a Soviet defector who consults for the United States Agriculture Department. There\u2019s a grain shortage in the Soviet Union, and the Russians suspect American sabotage. This is hardly the first time these spies have had to create false intimacy: They\u2019ve made friends and betrayed them, had sex with contacts  \u2014   Philip even married an F. B. I. secretary (Alison Wright) under another identity. Love, in \u201cThe Americans,\u201d is a kind of biological weapon. Over four seasons, \u201cThe Americans\u201d has used relationships as a window into geopolitics. For Elizabeth and Philip, whose very marriage was arranged by the state, there is no boundary between family and service. That\u2019s become true for Paige as well. Season 5\u2019s   story line inverts this dynamic by framing the Soviet Union as a kind of vast, dysfunctional family. If Mother Russia can\u2019t put food on the table, her children are bound to start asking questions. Sometimes, as with Elizabeth  \u2014   the more militant of the couple  \u2014   the impulse will be to defend and rationalize. Philip, on the other hand, loves his homeland, wants to believe in it, but can\u2019t deny the evidence. The Soviet Union is a massive country, he says: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we grow enough grain ourselves?\u201d He\u2019s a little like Paige  \u2014   growing up, realizing his parents are complicated and imperfect. \u201cThe Americans\u201d has always had a   melancholy, partly because of the historical setting. We knew, after all, that Elizabeth and Philip, even if they were America\u2019s enemies, were fighting for a doomed cause. But how doomed was it? The election scandal, Russia\u2019s muscle flexing in Europe and, well, whatever is going on between Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump, inevitably make the series play differently. For instance, when \u201cThe Americans\u201d began, one would have assumed things would end badly for the Jenningses. They still might. Communism did fall, after all. But Mr. Putin was a K. G. B. officer, and he landed on his feet. And the series\u2019 premise was based partly on the case of the Russian sleeper agent Anna Chapman, who was arrested and deported from the United States in 2010. She\u2019s resurfaced as a model, posting glamour photos with nationalist and   captions on Instagram. \u201cThe Americans\u201d is scheduled to end after its sixth season. Maybe it can write Elizabeth and Philip a   epilogue, now that it turns out there are second acts in Russian lives.'"}, "time": 1742561768.959081}
