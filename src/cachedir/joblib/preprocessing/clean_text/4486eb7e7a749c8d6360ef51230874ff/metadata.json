[\u201cIt\u2019s great to see Americans are waking up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cSharia is the most brutal and extreme system of governance ideology on the face of the Earth. It is misogynistic. It is  . It is  . It is  . It is   speech. \u201d  She said \u201camputations, stonings, and sex slavery\u201d could be found in Muslim countries living under sharia law. \u201cIt is, as Sam Harris said, the motherlode of bad ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, it\u2019s been slow in educating the American people because you have this enormous machine, this   machine that controls much of the information battlespace  \u2014   if it\u2019s media or culture, movies, entertainment, and even in the coverage of these marches, it was enormously and wildly slanted, which, of course, we\u2019re used to. \u201d \u201cBut the American people are waking up. Clearly, they\u2019re waking up in Europe as well, although, of course, I was disappointed, unquestionably, in the U. K. elections because I just think Labor and Corbyn are so to the left of bad,\u201d said Geller. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a fight,\u201d she stressed. \u201cWar is in the information battlespace. It\u2019s sort of David vs. Goliath, but we know how that wound up. There\u2019s hope. \u201d Kassam pointed out that the U. K. government was quick to block people like Geller, Robert Spencer, and Michael Savage from entering the country because their speech was classified as unacceptably divisive, while 23, 000 jihadis were greeted with, \u201cSure. Whatever. Don\u2019t worry about it. \u201d \u201cOh, I completely agree. The fact is, you\u2019re not going to have me advocate for May. She did ban me and said Muslims might get violent if I was to appear,\u201d Geller said, referring to actions British Prime Minister Theresa May took as home secretary. \u201cWell, you know, how did that work out for you, PM May?\u201d \u201cBut Corbyn is, you know, it\u2019s an abomination,\u201d she added, as Kassam interjected to highlight Corbyn\u2019s past support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and the IRA. \u201cIt\u2019s really shocking that these were your two choices. France was an enormous disappointment as well. \u201d She zinged Muslim activist Linda Sarsour, whom she described as \u201cthe icon of the left\u201d for \u201crunning down the marches and praising sharia the whole day, the whole of the weekend. \u201d \u201cThis is who the left holds up as their leader? This is who feminists hold up as leader of the Women\u2019s March?\u201d she asked. Geller and Kassam ribbed Sarsour for affecting speech patterns that make it sound as if she is an authentic voice of the Arab world or Palestinian territories, when, in fact, she was born in Brooklyn. \u201cThat\u2019s her schtick,\u201d said Geller. \u201cBut she is the product of an arranged marriage. She never speaks against it. She advocates for this sharia. She supports it. Many of the things she said about really brave women  \u2014   you know, Ayaan Hirsi Ali is truly a singular, brave woman. For her to run her down that way, this to me shows that the left is off the rails. \u201d  \u201cOf course, there are going to be women like Linda Sarsour. There are going to be women that hold down their children to be cut in female genital mutilation. But for her to be held up and asked to keynote the CUNY commencement address and speak at Dartmouth while my colleagues and I are blacklisted!\u201d she exclaimed.  \u201cThis is really the blacklist, not McCarthyism, because everybody worked. They still worked. They changed their names a little bit, they tweaked it, but they still worked. This is the real blacklist, and the objective is so that the message does not get out. And it\u2019s worked, which is why we see people waking up across the world, not just America. Very encouraging,\u201d Geller said. Kassam wondered if the left was in danger of \u201cdisappearing up its own backside\u201d by holding up people like Linda Sarsour and Jeremy Corbyn as leaders. \u201cThey want war,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about it. Listen, we held a massive protest against Linda Sarsour, and then you have their puppets, so to speak, in politics like Mayor de Blasio for example, who, generally, when there\u2019s a   it\u2019s always  \u2014   listen, I\u2019ve been doing this 15 years  \u2014   it\u2019s always across the street or it\u2019s catercorner. He put them not three feet away from us, and they were violent, abuse,     \u2014   a small group, but very, very dangerous. Afterwards, they attempt to incite to violence, to fisticuffs. We saw this even yesterday after the rallies, you had the left  \u2014   and it\u2019s always portrayed in the media as if the violence is on our end. It never is. \u201d Kassam noted the same media narrative is employed when Palestinians are portrayed as having been shot by Israeli soldiers for no particular reason or in the case of demonstrations against the Manchester atrocity, assaulted by     but reported by the BBC as \u201cViolence Breaks Out at   Rally. \u201d \u201cThe BBC cut out the references to Allah in that attack on the nursery school employee, where she was attacked by this Muslim mob that was screaming, \u2018Allah,\u2019\u201d Geller pointed out. \u201cThe BBC is the enemy. If anybody thinks this is merely a left vs. right  \u2014   this is some kind of a passive war  \u2014   Rip Van Winkle, you better wake up. \u201d  \u201cThis is real war, and I believe the left is evil,\u201d she said. \u201cThey use ridicule, the Saul Alinsky tactics, the whole arsenal of weapons. You saw them destroy the Tea Party. You saw them destroy the EDL, okay? This is what they do, through ridicule, through smear, through defamation. But I think people are shrugging and saying, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m not having it. My children are not safe. My community is not safe. My kids can\u2019t walk to school. \u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s literally a matter of life or death. It\u2019s not politics. It\u2019s life or death,\u201d Geller stressed.
