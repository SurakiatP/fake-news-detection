Trump: renting movies with her husband on Amazon, and shopping at Nordstrom, Macy\u2019s and other retailers that sell Ivanka Trump\u2019s products. A Nordstrom bag sat on a nearby table. It represents a victory lap of sorts for Ms. Coulter, who has almost   spearheaded a retail revolt against the president and his family. She was wearing a new silver Elizabeth and James lariat necklace purchased at the department store soon after it scrubbed Ms. Trump\u2019s name from its website. \u201cThe goal,\u201d Ms. Coulter said, \u201ccame originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience. \u201d It\u2019s been a wild ride these past few months for Ms. Coulter, who runs her shoestring movement from her home, or from cheerfully decorated work spaces like this one  \u2014   surrounded by   furniture, clam chairs and decorative pillows that feel more Silicon Valley than   war room. Enraged by a video that emerged last October of Mr. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, Ms. Coulter began a boycott of any sort of product connected to Mr. Trump. At first, it was just a tweet  \u2014   a list she had compiled of companies that sold Trump products  \u2014   but the ember quickly turned into a    blaze. Thousands of people have contacted the stores Ms. Coulter has on her boycott list, including Macy\u2019s and Amazon. Retailers including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and T. J. Maxx have backed away from products connected to Ms. Trump, the president\u2019s oldest daughter, since Ms. Coulter\u2019s efforts began. A herd of activists and celebrities, including the feminist writer Gloria Steinem, the Olympic diver Greg Louganis and the actress Lucy Lawless of \u201cXena: Warrior Princess,\u201d have expressed support. The attention has transformed Ms. Coulter, 45, a digital marketing specialist, into the unlikely general of the digital army now supporting her campaign, Grab Your Wallet. \u201cPeople describe me as an activist in media coverage, I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything this organized or structured or purposeful. \u201d The new role has taken up much of her time, and has made her the target of criticism and attacks from Trump supporters. She\u2019s lost count of how many times she has been called a \u201cbully\u201d or a \u201cdisgrace. \u201d The abuse gets more menacing with each victory a recent email included her mother\u2019s name in the subject line, with threats to publish more of her personal information. In the latest twist, the boycott has drawn Ms. Coulter, a   progressive liberal, into a growing debate over whether targeting Ms. Trump is sexist. And she said she worries that people will think she is profiting from the venture. Ms. Coulter was particularly upset when a knockoff \u201cGrab Your Wallet\u201d group sold clothing and other merchandise on Facebook. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a   we don\u2019t have stickers, nothing,\u201d she said, adding that she does not accept compensation from companies, or donations. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us envisioned that some of the things that have happened would happen,\u201d said Sue Atencio, who helped Ms. Coulter get the site started. In many ways, Ms. Coulter has embraced her new position. She answers emails at all hours and scours Twitter for tips on companies to add, or remove, from the boycott list. Then there are the phone calls  \u2014   lots and lots of phone calls  \u2014   from angry Trump supporters or journalists or the companies that want to get off her list. There is no doubt that it has changed her life. She doesn\u2019t sleep or socialize as often as she used to. Most of her work on Grab Your Wallet is done after she eats dinner with her husband, taking up what free time she has. \u201cShe went underground, basically,\u201d said Amie Penwell, a fellow San Francisco resident who hasn\u2019t seen much of her friend of seven years recently. The negative attention has made Ms. Coulter careful about her privacy. She insisted on meeting at the work space for an interview, to avoid having a reporter at her home, out of fear that it could be targeted. She would not let her husband, whom she met online in 2010, be interviewed. Born in Indiana, Ms. Coulter studied journalism at Penn State. She said she began her career by \u201cpiggybacking\u201d on the Bay Area\u2019s technology boom, helping   with their email marketing. A year ago she started her own agency, DoubleKnown, which helps executives and small businesses build their online presence through blog posts, social media feeds and other digital tools. The company has one other employee and a handful of education and technology clients, but has stopped taking on new accounts since Grab Your Wallet took off. Political activism has not been a big part of Ms. Coulter\u2019s life since college, when she spoke at a rally raising awareness about violence against women. Her most recent organized effort came after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015, when she circulated a list of lawmakers who had voted against tougher gun control measures. \u201cMaybe that gave me a taste of what something like this would be like,\u201d she said, describing herself as a chronic list maker. \u201cI like the efficiency of them. \u201d After becoming incensed by the video, Ms. Coulter began searching retailers\u2019 websites for   products and collecting the names on a spreadsheet. Wondering who else might be interested in a boycott, she looked at Twitter, and found Ms. Atencio, who had tweeted \u201cfashion not fascism. \u201dMs. Coulter contacted her and suggested they announce the boycott together. Since then, most of the work has fallen to Ms. Coulter, though she refers to Ms. Atencio as her \u201cspiritual guide\u201d and sounding board. Ms. Atencio, 59, sees herself as the less visible half of a musical duo. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the Garfunkel and Shannon is Paul Simon,\u201d Ms. Atencio said. Grab Your Wallet now includes a list of places to shop and not shop, and a short script for people who want to call companies to complain. As many as 32, 000 people visit her site in an hour, Ms. Coulter said. When the women\u2019s marches took place across the country in January, 350, 000 people arrived during a   period. In early February, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus removed Ms. Trump\u2019s name from their websites. Employees at T. J. Maxx and Marshalls were instructed not to display Ivanka Trump products and to throw her signs in the trash. None of the retailers credited Grab Your Wallet with their decision  \u2014   the department stores blamed poor sales  \u2014   and it is not possible to know to what degree Ms. Coulter and her followers have influenced the companies\u2019 decision making. But in the waning days of January,   complaints, many of which mentioned Grab Your Wallet, were Nordstrom\u2019s most common customer feedback, according to a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to speak publicly. Nordstrom said it did not have \u201cspecific numbers\u201d on the number of customers it had heard from. \u201cI attribute it directly to the Muslim ban,\u201d Ms. Coulter said, referring to the executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump issued on Jan. 27. \u201cI can see when the numbers spike when certain news events happen. \u201d Monitoring those spikes, updating her list and responding to emails, tweets and press inquiries have become Ms. Coulter\u2019s second   job. \u201cMy life is so completely here,\u201d she said, gesturing to her MacBook, \u201cthat it all just sort of overlaps and is an endless stream of emails and tweets and Facebook posts. \u201d She does get some help from volunteers, like the woman who helps run the legitimate Grab Your Wallet Facebook group, which has more than 12, 000 members. But for the most part, Ms. Coulter is on her own. That means the threats and negative attention are also directed largely at her. People ask her why she\u2019s \u201cattacking another woman,\u201d or call her a bully. People like the Fox host Jeanine Pirro have argued that Ms. Trump\u2019s brand has nothing to do with the White House, and that she is being unjustly targeted. Defenders also point to a proposed maternity policy that Ms. Trump developed with her father\u2019s campaign, and her brand\u2019s hashtag, WomenWhoWork, as examples of how she promotes women. \u201cWe have to stop destroying women based on the men in their lives,\u201d Ms. Pirro said during a recent episode of her show. S. E. Cupp, a conservative author and commentator, stopped short of calling the boycott of Ms. Trump\u2019s products sexist. But in an email, Ms. Cupp said that it seemed \u201cmisdirected. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m never a fan of going after the kids, grown or not, of presidents,\u201d she said. \u201cNor does it feel consistent with the   argument  \u2014   that he\u2019s \u2018 \u2019  \u2014   to economically punish his daughter, a working wife and mother. \u201d A spokesman for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand declined to make someone at the company available for an interview. In a statement, the company said it had been \u201cswept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others\u2019 efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do. \u201d Ms. Coulter finds such comments perplexing. She pointed out that Ms. Trump moved to Washington and has taken on an informal advisory role in the White House. She frequently sits in on her father\u2019s meetings with foreign leaders. Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, the real estate developer Jared Kushner, is a top adviser to President Trump. In addition, Ms. Coulter said, Ms. Trump played a prominent role in the presidential campaign. \u201cSomeone who passionately campaigned for a man who likes to grab women by the genitals will never convince me that she\u2019s on the side of women,\u201d she said. \u201cEver. \u201d Ms. Steinem also said that Ms. Trump was fair game, particularly after the election, when it can no longer be argued that she is just doing her \u201cfilial duty\u201d on the campaign trail. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to boycott her not because he is her father,\u201d Ms. Steinem said, \u201cbut because she supports his policies. \u201d Ms. Steinem specifically faulted Ms. Trump\u2019s proposed   policy for its exclusion of fathers and   mothers. Despite the long hours, Ms. Coulter said she could continue running Grab Your Wallet indefinitely. She\u2019s considering turning the campaign into a nonprofit and running it full time, and is struggling to figure out what to do with her fledgling business. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand what the right next step is,\u201d she said. \u201cI think as long as he\u2019s in office, this will be alive. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562083.903195}
