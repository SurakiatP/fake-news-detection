[According to Dr. Phyllis Chesler, emerita professor of psychology at City University of New York and a bestselling author, following Israel\u2019s 1967 defensive war, Palestinians replaced women as \u201cthe favored victims of the month\u201d in liberal circles.  \u201cNow, it was formerly colonized Arab men of color, symbolized by the Palestinians, that became an obsession,\u201d she told Breitbart Jerusalem. Even feminists themselves, Chesler noted, were no \u201clonger concerned with the occupation of women\u2019s bodies worldwide, but rather with the alleged occupation of a country that had never existed: Palestine. \u201d Chesler, considered a second wave feminist leader, said her generation was focused on \u201cthe sexual objectification of women economic parity abortion rights and on all the violence that took place mainly against women: rape, incest, sexual harassment,   pornography, and prostitution. \u201d But then, \u201c  and postmodernism swept the Western Academy,\u201d she said. Indeed, organizers of Wednesday\u2019s Women\u2019s Strike published on their website that they \u201cstand for an uncompromising   and   feminism\u201d first and foremost the \u201cdecolonization of Palestine. \u201d As Chesler notes, women\u2019s rights have been pushed out the picture in favor of a warped   view. \u201cThe West, including Israel, became the world\u2019s worst colonialists. Israel, not Islam, was accused of practicing apartheid. In reality, Islam is the largest practitioner of both gender and religious apartheid, but Israel served as the scapegoat for all the crimes perpetrated by Muslims including slavery,   racism, conversion via the sword, persecution of   religious minorities, imperialism, colonialism  \u2014   and the most barbaric abuse of women,\u201d Chesler said. \u201cFeminists and other Western academics and progressives simply do not want to know about Islam\u2019s history or current nature. Those who critique Islam, however mildly, are accused of being racists and Islamophobes and may be sued or killed,\u201d she added. Chesler said that feminists today should be focusing on combating \u201cforced   forced child marriage, female genital mutilation, polygamy, and femicide, or honor killing. \u201d \u201cSadly, tragically, the feminists who are being funded by Soros the   feminists who proudly wore the hijab at the   march simply do not understand that girls and women are killed for refusing to wear the hijab,\u201d she said. She praised Israel for having robust feminist and gay rights movements and mused that any activists hoping to spearhead similar movements in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan, would end up being \u201cjailed, tortured, raped, and murdered, perhaps beheaded. \u201d Women like Rasmea Odeh and Linda Sarsour, the faces behind Wednesday\u2019s women\u2019s strike as well as January\u2019s Women\u2019s March, are not feminists, Chesler said. As Breitbart Jerusalem reported, Odeh, who together with other strike organizers are calling to \u201cdecolonize Palestine\u201d and protest the \u201cwhite supremacists in the current government,\u201d is a convicted terrorist accused of bombing attacks in the late 1960s that killed two Israeli university students and injured nine more. In 1980, Odeh was freed from an Israeli jail as part of a prisoner exchange deal, and a decade later emigrated to the U. S. She recently made headlines again after being charged with immigration fraud for lying about her terrorist background when applying for U. S. citizenship. For her part, Linda Sarsour is an     activist who made headlines for becoming the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration.'"}, "time": 1742562210.120384}
