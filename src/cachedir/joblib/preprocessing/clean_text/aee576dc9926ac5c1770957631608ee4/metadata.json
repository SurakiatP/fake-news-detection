It was the first Bourne movie in nine years to star Matt Damon, and his   return helped \u201cJason Bourne\u201d collect a stout $60 million over the weekend at North American theaters  \u2014   roughly 50 percent more than initial results for \u201cThe Bourne Legacy,\u201d which was released in 2012 and starred Jeremy Renner. Nonetheless, turnout for \u201cJason Bourne\u201d (Universal) was lighter than for Mr. Damon\u2019s previous two outings in the lead role. \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201d arrived to about $80 million in ticket sales in 2007, after accounting for inflation. \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d had about $67 million in 2004. Overseas, \u201cJason Bourne,\u201d which cost about $120 million to make, collected an additional $50. 1 million, a strong result. \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d (Paramount) was second at the domestic box office, taking in an estimated $24 million, for a   total of $105. 7 million, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. The raunchy comedy \u201cBad Moms,\u201d which cost STX Entertainment and its financing partners about $20 million to make, arrived to $23. 4 million in ticket sales. Starring Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn (in what many critics described as a breakout performance) \u201cBad Moms\u201d received an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, the first   comedy to achieve that result since \u201cThe Hangover\u201d in 2009. Coincidentally  \u2014   or not  \u2014   \u201cBad Moms\u201d and \u201cThe Hangover\u201d were both written by the screenwriting duo of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. \u201cBad Moms\u201d attracted an audience that was overwhelmingly female (82 percent) STX said on Sunday. If positive word of mouth can persuade men to attend in the coming weeks, as STX hopes, \u201cBad Moms\u201d could well become a sleeper hit.'"}, "time": 1742564398.3393342}
