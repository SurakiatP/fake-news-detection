For example, though analysts often say that Russia \u201chacked the election,\u201d this shorthand refers to something much subtler than altering the vote itself  \u2014   just one of many points of growing confusion. What follows is a guide to what is known and is not, and to separating fact from misconception. \u2022 Russian security agencies infiltrated Democratic National Committee email servers last year and again this spring, according to American intelligence assessments and several independent security firms. The Russians also hacked a private email account belonging to John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. \u2022 This summer, intermediaries linked to the Russian government passed the emails to WikiLeaks and to an anonymous WordPress blog called Guccifer 2. 0. Those outlets released the emails publicly, generating weeks of unfavorable coverage of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u2022 Initially, many analysts believed that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow confusion and undermine Americans\u2019 faith in their government  \u2014   a common Russian tactic  \u2014   rather than to steer the election\u2019s outcome. \u2022 However, after the election, the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Russia had released the emails with the primary goal of bolstering Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u2022 No information has emerged suggesting that the C. I. A. believes that Russia\u2019s involvement decided the election\u2019s outcome. \u2022 There is no evidence that hackers, from Russia or elsewhere, tampered with the vote tallies. \u2022 Mr. Trump has said there was widespread voter fraud that favored Mrs. Clinton, and some liberal commentators have suggested that the election was hacked. Independent analysts say there is overwhelming evidence against both claims. \u2022 A widely circulated New York magazine article reported that two voting experts had urged Democrats to push for a recount, on fears that hackers had manipulated the vote. But one of those experts disputed that article, writing in a post on Medium that he had urged a recount but had doubted hacking. \u2022 The White House and election officials have said the vote shows no sign of tampering and accurately reflects popular will. \u2022 A recount effort led by the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, is unrelated to the revelations that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails. \u2022 It is impossible to say for sure. Because the email leaks unfolded over weeks, and concurrently with many other election dramas, polls cannot easily isolate the impact of the leaks. \u2022 Mr. Trump won three crucial Midwestern states by very small margins. So even if the leaks swung only a small percentage of votes, that could have been enough to change the election outcome. \u2022 But this same logic applies to dozens of factors, including the F. B. I. \u2019s   investigations related to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server. Political scientists have demonstrated that even changes in weather and the performance of sports teams can alter how people vote. \u2022 All available evidence suggests that voters freely selected Mr. Trump on Election Day in sufficient numbers for him to win the presidency under the Electoral College system. But that does not diminish the seriousness of Russia\u2019s intervention in the election, which appears to be unprecedented. \u2022 The C. I. A. \u2019s assessment is not public, but is thought to turn on another alleged hack. Russia also hacked data from the Republican National Committee but declined to release whatever it found, intelligence agencies told Congress. That has given credence to theories that Moscow actively favored the party\u2019s candidate. \u2022 Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to realign the United States with Russia and has praised its president, Vladimir V. Putin. Many in Moscow view Mrs. Clinton as hostile to Russia. \u2022 The evidence in any assessment of Russian government motives is circumstantial, and not all American intelligence agencies share the C. I. A. \u2019s view. \u2022 The timing suggests that, if Moscow decided to help Mr. Trump, it did so only after hacking the servers of both parties\u2019 national committees. Both were infiltrated well before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. \u2022 Mr. Trump, at a July news conference, publicly urged Russia to hack Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. But this could not have precipitated or encouraged the Russian hacks  \u2014   they had taken place months earlier. \u2022 Russian state media outlets have favored Mr. Trump and opposed Mrs. Clinton, but their reach in the United States is limited. (Their influence in Europe is much stronger.) \u2022 A firm called PropOrNot claimed that the Russian government had flooded American social media with fake election news. But several independent analysts challenged the report\u2019s methodology, which classified mainstream sites as Russian propaganda and did not demonstrate a link to Moscow. \u2022 Fake news is a growing problem, at times driven by companies in Eastern Europe that write and spread the articles. But those companies appear to be motivated by   rather than any political agenda. \u2022 There are two schools of thought: first, that Russia sought to weaken the United States by stirring up uncertainty and miring Mrs. Clinton, who seemed all but certain to win, in scandal and second, that Russia sought specifically to elevate Mr. Trump to the presidency. \u2022 Those theories are not mutually exclusive. For instance, Moscow may have started with the first goal and then added the second as a   bonus. \u2022 Russia is waging similar campaigns across Europe, at times through cyberattacks and selective leaks, with the apparent goal of undermining Western unity. \u2022 The Kremlin sees itself as under siege by a hostile West that it perceives as bent on Russia\u2019s destruction. Russian military leaders advocate shadowy \u201cnew generation warfare\u201d  \u2014   through propaganda and cyberattacks, for example  \u2014   to destabilize adversaries from within. \u2022 Not all misconceptions are directed by Moscow, however. Social media rumors that overstate Russia\u2019s involvement in the United States election risk playing into Moscow\u2019s goal of undermining Americans\u2019 faith in the legitimacy and integrity of their democracy.'"}, "time": 1742563084.1113858}
