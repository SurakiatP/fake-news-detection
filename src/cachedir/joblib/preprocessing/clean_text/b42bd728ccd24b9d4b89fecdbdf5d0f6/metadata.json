Trump, pundits with their eyes glued to Twitter believed they\u2019d finally deciphered the master plan behind the  \u2019s tweeting. Every time he detonated a   bomb on Twitter, they suspected, it was a sly bid to divert the public eye from more serious news about his impending administration. So when Mr. Trump reignited the dormant debate over flag burning one morning  \u2014   tweeting that those who set fire to the flag should suffer \u201closs of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d  \u2014   New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait quickly produced a column decoding the message. He called it a \u201cstrange fight\u201d and a \u201cclassic   nationalist distraction\u201d that proves Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdangerous and authoritarian politics is calculated, and not merely crazy. \u201d But soon a competing theory emerged: Minutes before Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d one of the  \u2019s favorite shows, ran a segment referencing an American flag burned on a college campus to protest his victory. He wasn\u2019t carrying out some strategy. He was   his TV. Twitter is an impulsive medium. Log in and you\u2019re greeted immediately with a text box asking \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d  \u2014   as in, right this second. Mr. Trump, who is set to become the nation\u2019s 45th president on Friday, is a master of Twitter, but also in its thrall. Theories of some grand Trump Twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting has been a habit of Mr. Trump\u2019s for years. He famously avoids alcohol Twitter is his vice. And after eight years of     posts from @BarackObama, equally   journalists are transfixed by Mr. Trump\u2019s timeline, too. Mr. Trump has always been hooked on recognition. He is obsessed with his television ratings. His office is festooned with   magazine covers featuring himself. Even negative attention can be a win he\u2019s thrilled to be named Time\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d even if the cover might evoke images of both Hitler and Satan. But today magazine covers and TV hits lack the cultural dominance they once held. (As Mr. Trump tweeted in 2013, Time \u201clooks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot! \u201d) Now he\u2019s found a medium where recognition arrives every fraction of a second, and his reach is quantified in real time  \u2014   ratings, but for every sentence you ever write. Scroll through the list of accounts Mr. Trump follows and you\u2019ll find a tightly curated crew of Trump relatives (like Ivanka)   properties (Trump Waikiki)   celebrities (Roma Downey, wife to \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d producer Mark Burnett) and reliably   outlets (\u201cFox  Friends,\u201d naturally). It\u2019s a remarkable picture of social media restraint for Twitter\u2019s most uninhibited star, and it gives a glimpse at the image Mr. Trump intends to project: devoted family man, tremendous business magnate, friend to Gary Player. But Mr. Trump\u2019s dominant posture is reactive, and his real focus is on who follows him. He almost exclusively retweets praise from fans. He tweets about all the credit he deserves (\u201cThank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night\u201d) then waits for more virtual credit to roll in. He brags to journalists about the rate at which likes and retweets hit. He gets high on his own supply. Part of the peculiarity of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets is that he tweets like a celebrity, not a politician or a businessman. Even his handle, @realdonaldtrump, suggests his full immersion in the most basic of our celebrity culture. Though he\u2019s preparing to assume the presidency, he tweets like a Hollywood social climber  \u2014   he fans celebrity feuds with Graydon Carter (\u201cno talent\u201d) and Meryl Streep (\u201c \u201d) and posts product endorsements (\u201cBuy L. L. Bean. \u201d). The highest office in the land has afforded Mr. Trump his most prominent celebrity perch. His account has risen from a few million followers to nearly 20 million in the past year. There was a time when some assumed that Mr. Trump\u2019s public persona would evolve as he rose in the political ranks. But there\u2019s just one Trump, and that\u2019s been key to his success. As Kim Kardashian once said, the secret to social media dominance is authenticity and consistency. Mr. Trump\u2019s projection of realness relies on him being reliably   and wildly inappropriate. That may seem like a liability for the leader of the free world, but it\u2019s an asset in the   celebrity roles that have led him to this moment: reality TV boss, Howard Stern guest,   heel. Eight years ago, Barack Obama was the social media wonder headed to the White House, and his tech savvy was heralded as a bright light for democracy. The tweets he posts to @POTUS never seem impulsive they seem made for posterity. Even his jokes are calculated to be minimally offensive and maximally educational. When the NASA rover Curiosity carried Mr. Obama\u2019s signature to the surface of Mars, Mr. Obama responded in the form of a dad joke: \u201cThat is out of this world. \u201d If Mr. Obama came to power in a time of great optimism for Twitter, Mr. Trump lords over a waning platform. What was once a hopeful place for global connection and resistance has become a site for coordinating harassment campaigns, connecting with white supremacists and accelerating unverified and sometimes dangerous rumors. Its growth has slumped and its stock price has stagnated. But the place suits Mr. Trump\u2019s purposes fine. For the guy who\u2019s all about appearances, Twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming press secretary, has suggested that Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions, where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fans instead of the scrutiny of the press. The social media platforms that were once heralded as democratic tools could also be used to undermine democratic norms. All of this works because one group is as intoxicated by Twitter as Mr. Trump is: journalists. It\u2019s hard to explain to a normal person  \u2014   one of the 79 percent of American adults who don\u2019t use Twitter  \u2014   why the platform mesmerizes the news media. Its   search function means you can conjure material on any kind of news topic  \u2014   or just spend your time searching for your own name. Reporters still crave the ego rush of a published byline, but that pales in comparison to the animated feedback loop that Twitter offers. The more time you spend, and the more tweets you send, the bigger your following becomes. But Twitter provides little actual reach  \u2014   compared with Facebook or Google, it hardly drives any traffic to articles. It\u2019s like a video game for professional validation. Mr. Trump expertly exploits journalists\u2019 unwavering attention to their Twitter feeds, their competitive spirit and their ingrained journalistic conventions  \u2014   chiefly, that what the president says is inherently newsworthy. As a developer and reality show star, he lobbied the news media for coverage. Now journalists feel obligated to pay attention to him. Mr. Trump overwhelms the media with boatloads of what was once a rare commodity: access. He creates impressions faster than journalists can check them. By the time they turn up the facts, the news cycle has moved on to his next missive, leaving less time (and reader attention) for the stories Mr. Trump does not highlight on his feed. Mr. Trump may not follow a deliberate distraction strategy, but he doesn\u2019t need one. He distracts instinctively. All he needs is a phone, the press and whatever thought just entered his mind.'"}, "time": 1742562992.9754777}
