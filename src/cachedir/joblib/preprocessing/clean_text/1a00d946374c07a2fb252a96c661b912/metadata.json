It was sold by the Obama administration as healthcare reform when in reality it was forced adherence to an already corrupt, profit driven healthcare system. Even if the ACA fails, which is almost a certainty now, it will act as a poison pill, giving opponents of single payer or govt administered healthcare plenty of ammunition to claim govt has no place in health care. It has delayed, and will continue to delay, true reform for years. Obama should be ashamed for selling out.'"}, "time": 1742562986.781702}
