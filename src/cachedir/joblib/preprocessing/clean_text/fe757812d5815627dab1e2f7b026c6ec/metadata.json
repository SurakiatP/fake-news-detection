In the same way that the cinema and TV screen made \u201cthe opera and the novel\u201d much smaller, something else might be on the way to do the same thing, the Netflix boss said at a Wall Street Journal event. \\nThose challenges could come from anywhere, he said. They might not be another form of screen: \u201cIs it VR, is it gaming, is it pharmacological?\u201d Mr Hastings asked the event. \\nHe went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like Netflix. Apparently making reference to The Matrix, he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back. \\n\u201cIn twenty or fifty years, taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable,\u201d Mr Hastings said. \u201cAnd if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological we\u2019ll be in real trouble.\u201d \\nHis references to The Matrix \u2013 and to being in \u201ctrouble\u201d \u2013 recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe \u2013 something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world, but could just as easily be the result of a drug-induced hallucination. \\nMr Hastings didn\u2019t indicate whether or not Netflix would look to make such drugs itself, or how it would fend off any companies that did. But it does sound a little like something out Black Mirror, which Netflix is showing the new season of at the moment.'"}, "time": 1742562231.9843647}
