The one that changed his life was inked on June 16, 2015. On that day, Mr. Valena placed a white dot on a woman\u2019s middle finger. It took him about a second. \u201cIt was that little white dot that blew things up,\u201d Mr. Valena, 36, said recently. \u201cThe phone started ringing off the hook. Talk about God\u2019s grace. \u201d Mr. Valena once thought he had to choose between his love for tattoos and his love of God. But in this case, his good fortune may have more to do with another   force in the universe: the   family. The finger that Mr. Valena tattooed belonged to Kendall Jenner, a model and younger sister of Kim Kardashian. One Instagram post later, he found himself hailed as the latest cool tattooer, a Dr. Woo of the East Coast, a Sailor Jerry for the young Hollywood and fashion crowd. In the last year, he\u2019s put a tiny cross near Justin Bieber\u2019s left eye, the letters PR and AY on the hands of the model Hailey Baldwin and \u201cJanette Duke\u201d on the   flesh of Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, an actress who wanted to honor her grandmother. His trademark style is     tattooing, what his fans simply call tiny tattoos: hearts and flowers and city skylines etched in black ink and shrunken to emoji size the names of loved ones and inspirational mantras rendered in his squiggly, miniature cursive. Many tattoo artists don\u2019t like doing little tattoos because they are difficult to apply and can rub away. But Mr. Valena, sensing an attractive market, has made them his specialty. He is a favorite of models and actresses, who appreciate the delicacy and   of his work. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything big on me,\u201d said Sofia Richie, a model. \u201cI\u2019m shooting a lot. It\u2019s important that it\u2019s something I can hide. \u201d She has five tattoos by JonBoy, including her brother\u2019s initials, the word \u201cclarity\u201d on her neck and the numerals 13:4, a reference to her favorite Bible verse, in First Corinthians. Ms. Richie, who described herself as \u201cnot the kind of person to have tattoos,\u201d said that Mr. Valena\u2019s etchings are nevertheless feminine and artistic, and that he\u2019s a gentleman. \u201cThe first time I got tattooed by him we hung out for hours,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made it an easy process where I felt relaxed. \u201d Like all newly successful people in Manhattan, Mr. Valena is on everyone\u2019s invitation list. There he was with Coco Rocha and the Misshapes at a party celebrating Jeremy Scott\u2019s collaboration with Google for its Pixel smartphone. And brands like Schott NYC and Coach have hired him to tattoo at store events and for social media campaigns. In recent weeks, he\u2019s taken his needles and ink on work trips to Los Angeles and South Korea. \u201cI feel blessed,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people out there that can do the same thing I do, even better. It just so happens that I got to tattoo some famous people. \u201d Still, for all his accomplishments, Mr. Valena said at times he has struggled with his professional and life choices. Tattoo artist to the stars was not his original calling. He planned to join the ministry. \u201cThere\u2019s almost that guilt of, you were going to be a youth pastor,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cI fell away from church, and I really just wrestled with it. Just feeling, like, \u2018Man, where am I? \u2019\u201d On a recent weekday afternoon, Mr. Valena was at his work station at West 4 Tattoo, the Greenwich Village shop that is his base. Loud club music thumped as customers waited in chairs by the front desk. The place resembled a thousand other tattoo parlors, except for the wall of photos of Mr. Valena posing with celebrity clients, a paper collage of his Instagram account. Mr. Valena, who described himself as \u201ca little Filipino guy,\u201d sat   on a chair. He wore black shorts and a black   that revealed heavily inked arms and legs, and a black trucker hat that made him a few inches taller. His tattooed hands were weighted by two fistfuls of chunky gold rings by Gucci and Versace. A fluffy Pomeranian he named Gucci and is raising with his girlfriend and manager, Lauren Ledford, yipped at his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved fashion,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cAnd now living in New York City and being part of it is just a dream. \u201d On a break between appointments, Mr. Valena reflected earnestly on his life\u2019s journey so far. There was a      aspect to his storytelling, an emphasis on redemptive moments. The first came when Mr. Valena, who was raised outside Chicago in a divorced family, said he had a   drug overdose at 17. He embraced Christianity and enrolled at a Bible college in Rhode Island. Two years later, he found himself working as a youth pastor and church coffeehouse barista in Decorah, Iowa, population 8, 000. \u201cIt was a college town, there were a handful of things to do, but it got old,\u201d Mr. Valena said. He had a few tattoos already, and was interested in the art form. He started hanging out at a local parlor, Valhalla Tattoo and Piercing, run by a   Irish biker and   who taught him the ropes. \u201cYes, I had to start by doing grapefruits,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cBut the feeling you get when you have that vibrating piece of machinery in your hand and you\u2019re creating something permanent on someone\u2019s body  \u2014   it started there. \u201d Some church leaders thought he was doing the devil\u2019s work. There was pressure put on him to quit tattooing, he said. Instead, Mr. Valena quit the church and honed his craft at biker rallies throughout the Midwest. In short order, he followed a girl to Wisconsin and then Minneapolis, married, fathered a son, became a successful local tattooer, grew restless, had an affair, got divorced and made an impulsive leap with his young mistress to New York City, where he had trouble acclimating and became \u201cthe insecure JonBoy who is rarely tattooing because I had no clientele out here. \u201d After an altercation in the subway with a romantic rival, he was arrested and jailed, Mr. Valena said, prompting a dark night of the soul. \u201cI felt, man, I failed at everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI failed my marriage. I failed my family. I\u2019m failing this relationship here. I\u2019m failing in New York City. I failed becoming a youth pastor. I felt lost. \u201d After being released from jail, he remembered being told about Hillsong Church, a global megachurch popular with celebrities like Mr. Bieber. It was through Hillsong that his life turned around, Mr. Valena said. He began inking the church\u2019s hipster leadership, who approved of tattoos. And he met Ms. Baldwin, the daughter of the actor Stephen Baldwin and a Hillsong congregant, who asked Mr. Valena to give her a tattoo and recommended him to Kendall Jenner. A few years ago, Mr. Valena was so desperate for work that he took a job tattooing at a nightclub in the meatpacking district while drunk people cavorted around him. Now he sets his own schedule, sees as many as eight clients a day and charges a minimum of $300 an hour. In the Kardashian kingdom, Mr. Valena is pretty much official court scribe, having tattooed Kendall Jenner again (\u201cmeow\u201d on her inner lip) as well as her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, repeatedly (most recently a miniature red \u201cM\u201d on her pinkie) and a family friend, Jonathan Cheban (\u201cFoodgod\u201d on his forearm). He has cemented his relationships with celebrities by asking many of them to tattoo him, which he likened to \u201cgetting their autograph, but not in a crazy fan way. \u201d Mr. Valena held out the crowded canvas of his arms, showing the spot where Kylie Jenner inked a tiny K with a crown and Ireland Baldwin tattooed a   \u201cL. A. \u201d \u201cAnd Chlo\u00eb Moretz  \u2014   she\u2019s, like, \u2018I\u2019m really good at doing stick figures with big penises,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valena added. He shrugged. \u201cI give them liberty. When Hailey or Kylie come in here, I want to remember those times. \u201d Fridays are Mr. Valena\u2019s day off, but an actress and model named Sabina Gadecki was in New York for a movie premiere and wanted a tattoo. So Mr. Valena, dressed in black and carrying Gucci the Pomeranian, rolled into the shop from his East Village apartment around 2 p. m. Soon Ms. Gadecki arrived with hugs, accompanied by her parents and her    boyfriend. She wanted a tiny \u201cR,\u201d her father\u2019s first initial, behind her ear, which would be her third JonBoy tattoo (like Happy Meal trinkets, tiny tattoos encourage a collection). Ms. Gadecki, who also belongs to Hillsong, was referred to Mr. Valena by a friend after an unpleasant experience with another tattoo artist. \u201cI felt like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do it.\u2019 JonBoy listened. He realized it\u2019s important to me. \u201d After the letter design was agreed to, Mr. Valena began placing the stencil onto Ms. Gadecki\u2019s skin. He stopped abruptly because he wasn\u2019t feeling the music. \u201cI need a new song!\u201d he yelled, then ran to the front desk, cued up a track by Mr. Bieber and returned to his work, singing. Ms. Gadecki sat on the tattoo chair while her entourage watched. The actual tattooing took Mr. Valena exactly six minutes. Posing Ms. Gadecki afterward for his Instagram account took longer. \u201cI never thought it would be like this,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cI never thought putting a little white dot on Kendall Jenner would come to this. I\u2019m living the dream. \u201d And what of his planned career as a youth pastor? Is his soul still divided? He answered, sounding at peace, \u201cYou have a path and a journey, and your life is going to take you where it\u2019s supposed to take you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628389.704604}
