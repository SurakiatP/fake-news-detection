[\u201cTo be honest, the idea of a \u2018trophy girl\u2019 has felt antiquated for some time now,\u201d Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, said in a statement Friday. \u201cWho wrote that rule anyway? The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one\u2019s gender. \u201d  Viewers watching Sunday\u2019s Grammys will see three trophy handlers, including transgender model Martina Robledo, actor Derek Marrocco, and model and actress Hollin Haley. The change is the latest move by The Recording Academy, which presents the annual event, to diversify the awards ceremony, from rap to country to jazz to classical, with Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele among the top contenders this time around. Beyonc\u00e9 leads all artists with nine nominations, including Album of the Year for her Black Lives   album Lemonade. Singer Rihanna and rappers Drake and Kanye West each earned eight nods. British pop queen Adele was tipped in top categories, including Album of the Year for her commercial juggernaut 25. James Corden will host the ceremony, which airs live on CBS at 8 p. m. Eastern.
