By incorporating the \u201cHillary\u201d sign into a sentence, the people in the building next door made the liberal regret hanging their stupid sign. \\nUnlike the sea of Donald Trump signs that fill neighborhoods throughout the country, it\u2019s exceptionally rare to see a sign supporting Hillary Clinton for president. Perhaps this person of the top floor of a small apartment building was making up for that by being loud and proud of their criminal candidate, but the people parallel to them won the war of words in a big way. \\nJohn Nolte posted a photo of the opinionated neighbors, noting that he\u2019s not sure where these buildings are, but the message they made was very clear. Rather than ripping the Hillary sign down, setting it on fire, or any other destructive act of vandalism that liberals have done to Trump signs, the clever conservative simply completed what the liberal should have said, adding \u201cIs A Liar\u201d to their windows so passersby read the overall display as \u201cHillary Is A Liar.\u201d Photo of the war or words between neighbors, Tweeted by John Nolte \\nThis statement is not only true but also proves the difference in each candidate\u2019s followers when they disagree with something. The Trump supporters didn\u2019t make a big deal about the Hillary-loving idiots, they had a sense of humor about it. \\nIf it was the other way around, the outcome would have been damaging to the resident\u2019s personal property and possibly even their person, because ignorant liberals get violent when they feel \u201coffended\u201d by something. Conservatives fight with facts, as these people did here by pointing out that Hillary is a liar and why they aren\u2019t voting for her.'"}, "time": 1742562742.4564402}
