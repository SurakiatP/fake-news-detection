Humanitarian access to hundreds of thousands of Syrians in other combat zones has been blocked by fighting, security concerns and the Syrian bureaucracy, Mr. O\u2019Brien said, despite an international agreement reached in May to permit truck convoy deliveries. As a result, Mr. O\u2019Brien said, no convoys were dispatched in August, despite some successful, if limited, deliveries in July. \u201cWe unfortunately appear to be, once again, in reverse gear,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. He described the crisis in Aleppo, portrayed in images of dead and wounded children like that of a    boy pulled from the rubble last week, as \u201cthe apex of horror at its most horrific extent of the suffering of people. \u201d While he said efforts were still underway to secure the proposed     in Aleppo, Mr. O\u2019Brien expressed little hope of avoiding \u201ca humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed and carnage in the Syrian conflict. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561654.7888565}
