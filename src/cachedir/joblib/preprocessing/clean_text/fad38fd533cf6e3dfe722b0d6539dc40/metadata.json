When he was a younger man, the rage flowed out of him as the scowling frontman for Black Flag, the pioneering Southern California punk band. Today, Mr. Rollins may no longer scream to get his point across. But as a spoken word performer, radio host and, notably, a widely read columnist at LA Weekly, he has reinvented himself as a political voice that is similarly hard to ignore. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the most popular regular features that we run,\u201d his editor at LA Weekly, Andy Hermann, said of his writing. \u201cHe\u2019s just a great commentator and satirist. \u201d (Here are a couple of pieces that Mr. Hermann said struck a big chord with readers.) We caught up with Mr. Rollins by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: Q. What\u2019s your approach to the column? A. As far as political writing, to use the baseball idea, if you can\u2019t hit them where they ain\u2019t and score, then  \u2014   basically don\u2019t be obvious. And if you\u2019re going to make a point, if you can\u2019t bring some humor into it  \u2014   I mean obviously someone getting shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo. there\u2019s no fun there. But anything with Donald Trump, where there\u2019s so much to say, if you don\u2019t bring some humor in, it\u2019s going to be unreadable. Q. Have you mellowed with age? A. Not really. I\u2019ve just been able to prioritize and direct my energies with a little bit more care and aim, where I don\u2019t need to scorch the entire forest because I\u2019m angry. I can just pick out the three trees and that turns into a column or that turns into something on stage. Q. You\u2019ve said you cultivate your anger. Why? A. Because it turns into good things. I saw the HBO documentary on the West Memphis Three and I said, \u2018Oh, O. K. you\u2019ve officially pissed me off. Arkansas we\u2019re coming for you.\u2019 And it was out of anger. I was concerned for guys in jail, yeah, but it was anger that got my civic muscle going. And I started calling rich, famous people I knew  \u2014   \u2018Hey can I have a thousand dollars [to donate to a legal fund]?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was like a member of Congress dialing for dollars. Q. Do you ever think about making music again? A. No. For me it was a real time and place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was never fun. It was necessary. I really had to say those words. But I never enjoyed it and I\u2019ll be the first to admit I was never all that good at it. But it was real.

The small,   dog inhaled a lot of smoke after a fire erupted at a Santa Monica apartment on Tuesday. The fire was quickly put out. Nalu, a    bichon   tzu mix, was limp and not breathing. \u201cHe was essentially dead,\u201d said Andrew Klein, the firefighter who pulled the dog from the burning home. Mr. Klein set Nalu on the grass and began delivering oxygen with a specialized pet mask and performing    resuscitation. Minutes passed. Nothing. Kneeling nearby, the dog\u2019s owner, Crystal Lamirande, who had been running errands when the blaze broke out, was distraught. She put her hand on the dog\u2019s belly. \u201cCome on Nalu,\u201d she said. Then, an improbable 20 minutes after efforts to revive him began, Nalu blinked and, slowly, his chest rose. Ms. Lamirande, 35, a nurse, had just lost her home. Yet for the moment she was elated. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t stop saying, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d said Billy Fernando, a   who watched the drama. Speaking by phone Thursday, Ms. Lamirande said Nalu was back to his old self. \u201cHe\u2019s so lovely. People just love him,\u201d she said. Ms. Lamirande said she lost sentimental objects in the fire, whose origin was unknown. But she was coping, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s just stuff. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
