Lee Hennessee. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nAccording to this report, Mr. Braverman was scheduled to return to the Russian Embassy in New York City yesterday for an in-depth interview related to the request he made last week for \u201curgent and immediate\u201d political asylum in Russia\u2014and as we had previously reported, sent shockwaves through the Kremlin as some Federation intelligence analysts believed his request was for the purpose of \u201cprotection by publicity\u201d due to his fears that the Clinton Crime Family wanted him killed.\\nFears that he was being targeted for death by the Clinton Crime Family, specifically Hillary Clinton, this report continues, was due to Mr. Braverman\u2019s past association with the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization that he headed as CEO after being installed there by Chelsea Clinton who discovered for herself the massive corruption of this supposed to be charity.\\nWith the American press widely reporting (though skeptically) Mr. Braverman\u2019s asylum request (\u201ca simple \u201chere I am\u201d could quiet the waters \u2013 but there has been none\u201d), however, this report notes, Federation intelligence analysts contributing to this report note that not only did he fail to keep yesterday\u2019s interview date at the Russian Embassy in New York City, he has yet to publically deny his actions, and since 12 October has failed to even update his Twitter page account.\\nTo why Mr. Braverman has gone silent and missing, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is attributing to yet another Clinton Crime Family related mysterious death\u2014this one being Donald Trump\u2019s longtime billionaire money guru E. Lee Hennessee, age 64, found dead this past week in her Trump Plaza home, located in West Palm Beach, Florida\u2014with one media account suggesting it was related to a domestic harm case involving her husband and longtime business partner, and another saying she died of a stroke\u2014but with no autopsy having yet been performed.\\nDonald Trump\u2019s money guru E. Lee Hennessee, this report explains, was one of the most powerful women financiers on Wall Street whose company, Hennessee Group LLC, achieved a staggering 2,132% increase of profits between 1987-2015 and was co-run by her husband Charles Gradante.\\nAs to why Hillary Clinton feared and hated E. Lee Hennessee, this report says, is due to her having created for Donald Trump an \u201cextraordinary/unique\u201d investment portfolio that, in essence, has allowed him to run his revolutionary presidential campaign entirely debt free costing him virtually nothing as for every dollar he spent, he was able to gain back two more\u2014thus making it the first US presidential election run in history to turn a profit.\\nWith what is infamously called the Clinton Body Count rapidly increasing through this US presidential election cycle, this report concludes, there now appears to be a breaking of support of Hillary Clinton among America\u2019s elites, with even the Chicago Tribune this past week saying Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside as the American political system is breaking down and their warning that it\u2019s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they\u2019re properly frightened\u2014and is most assuredly going to get worse with the shocking revelation that the FBI has now discovered a staggering 650,000 Hillary Clinton secret emails on the computer of her top aide Huma Abedin\u2019s disgraced pedophile husband Anthony Weiner.\\nSource\\n'"}, "time": 1742564331.659425}
