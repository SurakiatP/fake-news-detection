[The western state of North   which includes Cologne, Duesseldorf and the Ruhr industrial region, is Germany\u2019s most populous and has been led by the   Social Democrats for all but five years since 1966.  It is home to 17. 9 million people, nearly a quarter of Germany\u2019s population. It is also the home state of Martin Schulz, the Social Democratic challenger seeking to deny Merkel a fourth term in the Sept. 24 national election \u2014   though he wasn\u2019t on the ballot Sunday. #BREAKING  \u2014   Merkel\u2019s CDU leads big after initial exit polls in a critical regional election#nrwltw17 #Germany #NRW pic. twitter.   \u2014   dwnews (@dwnews) May 14, 2017,  Projections for ARD and ZDF public television, based on partial counting, showed Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union beating the Social Democrats by about 34 percent to a bit over 30. 5 percent. They gave the Greens, the junior coalition partners in the outgoing state government, only 6 percent. That means governor Hannelore Kraft\u2019s coalition with the Greens lost its majority in the state legislature. And it puts conservative challenger Armin Laschet, a   deputy leader of Merkel\u2019s party, in a position to replace her. Herzlichen Gl\u00fcckwunsch @ArminLaschet  @CDUNRW_de! Der SPD ist die Kraft ausgegangen. Tolle Stimmung in @ ! @BerlinGestalter   pic. twitter.   \u2014   CDU Berlin (@cduberlin) May 14, 2017,  \u201cThe CDU has won the heartland of the Social Democrats,\u201d said the conservatives\u2019 general secretary, Peter Tauber, calling it a \u201cgreat day\u201d for the party. \u201cThis is a difficult day for the Social Democrats, a difficult day for me personally as well,\u201d Schulz told reporters in Berlin. \u201cI come from the state in which we took a really stinging defeat today. \u201d #SPD\u2019s Schulz says his party suffered a crushing defeat (in state election in SPD\u2019s homeland NRW). pic. twitter.   \u2014   Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) May 14, 2017,  But he urged the party to concentrate now on the national election. He said that \u201cwe will sharpen our profile further  \u2014   we have to as well. \u201d \u201cWe will continue fighting the result will come on Sept. 24,\u201d Schulz said. The Social Democrats\u2019 national ratings soared after Schulz, a former European Parliament president, was nominated in January as Merkel\u2019s challenger. But defeats in two other state elections since then had already punctured the party\u2019s euphoria over Schulz\u2019s nomination, and its ratings have sagged. Sunday\u2019s election was the last before the national vote. So sehen Sieger aus! @bodoloettgen @ArminLaschet #nrwgehtvor #ltwnrw17 #ltwnrw pic. twitter.   \u2014     (@CDUNRW_de) May 14, 2017,  Kraft announced that she was stepping down as the Social Democrats\u2019 regional leader. The projected result is the party\u2019s worst in North   since World War II. The projections put support for the   Free Democrats, who are eyeing a return to the national parliament at September, at a strong 12 percent. The party  \u2014   whose national leader, Christian Lindner, led its election effort in North    \u2014   has tended to ally with Merkel\u2019s conservatives over recent decades. The nationalist Alternative for Germany was seen winning 7. 5 percent, giving it seats in its 13th state legislature, and the opposition Left Party around 5 percent. A likely outcome appeared to be a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of the biggest parties under Laschet, though it was also possible that a slim   majority for the CDU and Free Democrats would emerge. A \u201cgrand coalition\u201d would mirror Merkel\u2019s national government, in which the Social Democrats are the junior partners. After a blaze of publicity earlier this year, Schulz  \u2014   who chose not to join the government when he returned to Germany after being president of the European Parliament  \u2014   has struggled to maintain a high profile. In the North   campaign, Merkel\u2019s conservatives sought to portray Kraft\u2019s government as slack on security, and also assailed what they said is regional authorities\u2019 poor handling of education and infrastructure projects. Health Minister Hermann Groehe, a conservative, said his party had \u201ctailwind\u201d from the national level, but Sunday\u2019s vote was \u201ca decision about state politics. \u201d \u201cThere was no tailwind from Mr. Schulz that could have balanced that out,\u201d he said. Merkel\u2019s party seemed keen not to appear too euphoric. Asked about Germany\u2019s government after September her chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, said that \u201cwe always have to keep a cool head   \u2026     we shouldn\u2019t talk about coalitions before the harvest is in. \u201d National polls show the Social Democrats trailing Merkel\u2019s conservatives by up to 10 points after drawing level earlier this year.'"}, "time": 1742562121.4699278}
