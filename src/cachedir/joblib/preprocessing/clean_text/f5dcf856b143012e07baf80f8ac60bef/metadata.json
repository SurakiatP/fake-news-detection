Videos By Amy Moreno November 11, 2016 \\nIt looks like President-elect Trump\u2019s HISTORIC WIN is great for his business! \\nDonald Trump bested Hillary Clinton on election day (well the next day, actually) with the political \u201ccomeback\u201d of our lifetime! \\nTrump has seen a 20% increase in hotel bookings at some of his most prominent hotels. \\nFrom Fox News : \\nBookings at Trump hotels in Washington, DC, and New York \u2014 which plunged during Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 have spiked since his victory. \\nThe Trump International Hotel Washington, DC, just blocks from the White House, has seen a 20 percent increase in reservations and is sold out for Inauguration Day weekend in January. \\n\u201cWow. Demand is definitely up,\u201d said Jack Ezon, president of Manhattan-based travel agency Ovation Vacations. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to happen so quickly.\u201d \\nBookings at the Trump International Hotel & Tower New York are up 18 percent since Election Day, and there has been a 15 percent rise at the Trump Soho New York, Ezon told The Post. \\nA check on the Expedia travel site Thursday showed the Trump New York was sold out for Friday night, while similarly priced hotels, like The Plaza and The Mark, had vacancies. Rooms were available at the Trump Soho for about $500. \\nBut reservations at other Trump-branded hotel and resorts remained virtually unchanged.
