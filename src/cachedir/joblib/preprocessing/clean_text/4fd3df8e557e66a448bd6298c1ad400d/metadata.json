Carter on Thursday removed one of the final barriers to military service by lifting the Pentagon\u2019s ban on transgender people serving openly in the armed forces. \u201cEffective immediately, transgender Americans may serve openly,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cThey can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military just for being transgender. \u201d The decision pushes forward a transformation of the military that Mr. Carter has accelerated in the last year with the opening of all combat roles to women and the appointment of the first openly gay Army secretary. He made his feelings on ending the transgender ban clear last year, when he called it outdated and ordered officials across the military to begin examining what would need to be done to lift it. When Mr. Carter ordered that assessment, there were already thousands of transgender people in the military. But until Thursday, most had been forced into an existence shrouded in secrecy to avoid being discharged, a situation much like that faced by gay men, lesbians and bisexuals before the lifting of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy in 2011. Transgender people have \u201cdeployed all over the world, serving on aircraft, submarines, forward operating bases and right here in the Pentagon,\u201d Mr. Carter told reporters. \u201cThe lack of clear guidelines for how to handle this issue puts the commanders and the service members in a difficult and unfair position. \u201d For many transgender people, the lack of clarity described by Mr. Carter has resulted in them being forced out of uniform. Army Capt. Sage Fox, 43, was in the reserves when she told her unit that she was transgender in November 2013. A month later, she was placed on inactive status and has not done any reserve duty since. She called the end of the ban \u201cthrilling news,\u201d and said she expected to be reactivated as a reservist in the coming weeks. She was confident that the military would adapt. \u201cWe\u2019re military officers. We are trained to be adaptable, and I get so frustrated when people think we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with this,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re on the battlefield, the situation changes in the blink of an eye, we adapt and overcome. That\u2019s what we do. \u201d Mr. Carter said the Pentagon would cover the medical costs of those in uniform who are seeking to undergo gender transition, though it would expect new recruits who are transgender to spend at least 18 months in their transitioned gender identity before joining the military. The Pentagon also plans to begin a broad, yearlong training program about the changes for service members up and down the ranks. The military\u2019s top leaders, including Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were on board with ending the prohibition, Mr. Carter said, although none of the military\u2019s top brass appeared with him for the announcement. Lifting the ban on transgender people has faced resistance from some at the highest ranks of the military, who have expressed concerns over what they consider to be a social experiment that could potentially harm the military\u2019s readiness and effectiveness in combat. When Mr. Carter in July 2015 first ordered the military to begin examining how to lift the ban, he indicated the work would be completed earlier this year. But as winter turned to spring and the ban remained in place, \u201cI think everyone was raising questions about what was going to happen,\u201d said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, a research institute that has studied the effects of having gays, lesbians and transgender people in the military. Still, the announcement on Thursday came faster than Mr. Belkin would have predicted when he began to press for lifting the transgender ban three years ago, after the end of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. \u201d \u201cI thought it would take 10 or 15 years\u201d he said. Mr. Belkin said that the end of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d the opening of combat roles to women and the lifting of the ban on transgender people were \u201call about the same idea  \u2014   that job assignments should be based on merit, not about gender identity or sexuality. \u201d Those within the military who did not feel similarly were unsurprisingly silent on Thursday. Republicans in Congress were not. Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for the new policy to not be carried out until Congress could convene hearings. And Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, released a statement saying he would examine \u201clegislative options to address the readiness issues associated with this new policy. \u201d \u201cOur military readiness  \u2014   and hence our national security  \u2014   is dependent on our troops\u2019 being medically ready and deployable,\u201d Mr. Thornberry said. \u201cThe administration seems unwilling or unable to assure the Congress and the American people that transgender individuals will meet these individual readiness requirements at a time when our armed forces are deployed around the world. \u201d But several studies on the issue have concluded that lifting the ban is unlikely to have any appreciable effect on the readiness of the armed forces. Estimates of the number of transgender service members have varied, but the number most often cited comes from a study by the RAND Corporation and commissioned by Mr. Carter. It found that out of the approximately 1. 3 million   service members, an estimated 2, 450 were transgender, and that every year, about 65 service members would seek to make a gender transition. Providing medical care to those seeking to transition would cost $2. 9 million to $4. 2 million a year for the Pentagon, which spends about $6 billion of its $610 billion annual budget on medical costs for   service members, according to the report, which was completed in March. The report also said that if the Pentagon did not cover medical procedures like hormone therapy and surgery, transgender service members would probably not seek medical care and could have higher rates of substance abuse and suicide. Making the announcement on Thursday, Mr. Carter said the Pentagon had studied the experience of allied countries that already allow transgender people to serve in their militaries, such as Britain, Australia and Israel. He also cited the experience of companies such as Boeing and Ford, which offer health insurance policies that cover the costs of gender transitions. \u201cThat\u2019s up from zero companies in 2002,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cAmong doctors, employers and insurance companies, providing medical care for transgender individuals is becoming common and normalized in both public and private sectors alike. \u201d But as much as any practical concern played into the decision, Mr. Carter said it was also \u201ca matter of principle. \u201d \u201cAmericans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, our   force is built upon having the most qualified Americans. And the profession of arms is based on honor and trust. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562204.6458879}
