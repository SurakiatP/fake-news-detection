Rick Scott. The Trump campaign\u2019s latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio\u2019s firm says it is still owed for polling. \\nTrump\u2019s decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trump\u2019s history of not paying for services performed; it won\u2019t be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isn\u2019t surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. \\nAnybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald Trump\u2019s version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket. \\nTrump Is Deadbeating On His Campaign Debts By Refusing To Pay His Own Pollster added by Jason Easley on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016'"}, "time": 1742561761.1594696}
