In January, after screening in some movie theaters, being made available free to some academic institutions and streaming on Netflix, the movie received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature. \u201c13th\u201d was one of several pictures produced by streaming services to make it to the Oscars this year, but Ms. DuVernay (who was coming off an intensive Oscar campaign for her 2014 film, \u201cSelma,\u201d when she first spoke to Netflix) said that awards weren\u2019t her concern when making the film. Nor could she pursue them after \u201c13th\u201d was out she had already begun her next film, the fictional \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d adapted from the Madeleine L\u2019Engle book. She also didn\u2019t make press junket rounds ahead of awards season. What secured the nomination were two things: the movie\u2019s extraordinary quality and the perspicacious marketing department at Netflix\u2019s documentary division. A couple of months back, I wrote about some of Netflix\u2019s original films, lightweight comedies of varying quality. Several developments suggest a widening of the company\u2019s ambitions in documentaries. The service began streaming the Sundance Film Festival\u2019s Jury Prize winner, the dark drama \u201cI Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore,\u201d a month after the movie won that prize. And, in what movie business journalists are almost unanimously terming a major coup, Netflix announced its acquisition of the rights to \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d a   return to the gangster genre from Martin Scorsese, in late February. The documentary division, though, has been moving from hit to hit since the   series \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d which, along with HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and the podcast \u201cSerial,\u201d gripped the public imagination with innovative approaches to true crime. Ms. DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th\u201d made the   lists of many film critics in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t the only   documentary to be nominated for an Oscar this year \u201cWhite Helmets,\u201d about the war in Syria, actually took home a statuette in the Documentary Short category. Netflix also presented \u201cThe Ivory Game,\u201d a Leonardo   expos\u00e9 of elephant poaching. Flexibility of formatting is one component of this success story. On March 28, Netflix will premiere \u201cFive Came Back,\u201d about a group of prominent Hollywood directors and how they were changed by World War II, in three episodes. Mark Harris, the film\u2019s screenwriter and the author of the book on which it is based (who is a longtime colleague and friend of mine) noted that had the project been picked up by a television network, \u201cthe directive would have been, \u2018Please fill this   slot.\u2019 Whereas with Netflix, the first thing they asked was \u2018What should this be? \u2019\u201d Ms. DuVernay recalled that Netflix\u2019s commitment to making \u201c13th\u201d what she thought it should be remained consistent for the entire process. \u201cAfter I started it, I realized that it needed to be about more than the immediate situation, and I wanted to add historical perspective\u201d she said. \u201cThat meant an expanded budget, and expanded time. \u201d She noted that she wanted a      cut reduced to 100 minutes. \u201cLisa told me, \u2018It can be two and a half hours.\u2019 The   length was something I wanted. \u201d Ms. DuVernay added, \u201cThe division is filled with people who are real filmmakers, who have made documentaries, been in the editing room. \u201d What it looks like to the creator is borne in mind throughout the process Netflix\u2019s goal over all, according to the filmmakers working with them, is to create distinctive stories. \u201cIn this line of endeavor, you hear about things like network notes, and that\u2019s always a kind of vicious punch line,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cWe kept waiting for that moment, but it never came. [Netflix] was always constructive and supportive. \u201d Ms. Nishimura, the executive making all this possible, said she was lucky \u201cto have come from a professional background that supports creators first. \u201d Before joining Netflix almost a decade ago, she worked with Chris Blackwell, the music entrepreneur who founded Island Records, at the indie film company Palm Pictures. When she joined Netflix, it was a DVD rental entity, and she was buying up titles and \u201coverseeing relationships with creators worldwide. \u201d In the process, she discovered that audiences had a hunger for documentaries not always reflected at the box office. \u201cTelevision ratings exist because of ads, which we\u2019re free of, and box office has become so reliant on Friday night returns that it\u2019s warped perceptions of what audiences want,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said. \u201cJust because a person doesn\u2019t go see a documentary on a Friday night, it\u2019s not a reflection on the film it\u2019s just a reflection that maybe a documentary isn\u2019t a film that a couple is going to want to see on date night. What we\u2019ve discovered is that we can elevate storytelling and bring it to a global platform and create a cultural moment. \u201d (According to a Netflix spokeswoman, 73 percent of all subscribers  \u2014   more than 68 million  \u2014   watched at least one documentary on the site in 2016.) \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d certainly created a cultural moment, and \u201c13th\u201d did so on a scale that even its creators did not necessarily expect. \u201cWhen we created it, we wondered whether or not it was a uniquely American story,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said. \u201cReally it\u2019s a story of \u2018the other,\u2019 and how we treat each other as humans, and what can happen when that goes awry. And so it did get a response from a global audience. And will continue to. The docs live on our service forever. We\u2019re allowing stories to continue to find their ceiling over time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562339.4160645}
