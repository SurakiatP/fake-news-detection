[Muggings and assaults in broad daylight have become a regular occurrence in recent weeks, as an influx of \u2018unaccompanied minors\u2019 from Morocco and Algeria have moved into Montpellier, in southern France.  Early on Friday morning, two youths approached a woman as she was leaving a nightclub with friends. She was struck by a male migrant while his female accomplice snatched her mobile phone and debit card. On Sunday morning near the Place de l\u2019Observatoire, 10 migrant youths surrounded a woman, beat her, and ran away with her handbag. When the victim\u2019s friend tried to intervene, she too was physically attacked. When police arrested four of the 10 North African culprits, two other people approached to say that they too had been robbed and assaulted by the youths. The weekend saw a total of eight incidents in which unaccompanied minors, who are housed by local government and given vouchers to buy their own food, mugged pedestrians in Montpellier. Between 20 and 21 March, four women fell victim to the young thieves, including a    grandmother who was robbed of her purse and debit card. While police have grown increasingly concerned about the attacks, the Montpellier Metropolitan notes that H\u00e9rault\u2019s municipal department for public security \u201crefuses to explain\u201d the situation. On Friday, reporting on a case in which a    unaccompanied minor snatched the gold necklace from an octogenarian\u2019s neck as the lady was leaving her house, the newspaper informed readers that \u201cpolice in the city have seen a steep increase in robbery with violence, most often committed by migrant youths\u201d. Last month, Breitbart London reported on how the city of Uppsala in Sweden has been facing similar problems, with unaccompanied minors mugging pensioners in the street for drugs money.'"}, "time": 1742563669.4681027}
