Environmental groups raced to the scene in West Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, to find a charred wasteland: smoldering fires, orangutans driven from their nests, and signs of an extensive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. \u201cThere was pretty much no forest left,\u201d said Karmele Llano S\u00e1nchez, director of the nonprofit International Animal Rescue\u2019s orangutan rescue group, which set out to save the endangered primates. \u201cAll the forest had burned. \u201d Fingers pointed to the Rajawali Group, a sprawling local conglomerate known for its ties to powerful politicians like Malaysia\u2019s   prime minister. But lesser known is how some of the world\u2019s largest banks have helped Rajawali  \u2014   and other global agricultural powerhouses  \u2014   expand their plantation empires. The year before the clearing of trees in West Kalimantan, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured $235 million in loans  \u2014   funds that the Indonesian company used to buy out a partner and bolster its landholdings  \u2014   from banks including Credit Suisse and Bank of America, according to an examination of lending data by The New York Times. The deal forms part of at least $43 billion in loans and underwriting to companies linked to deforestation and forest burning in Southeast Asia alone, according to a tally compiled by the   Rainforest Action Network, the Dutch consultancy Profundo and the Indonesian nongovernmental organization TuK Indonesia. More than a third of that sum comes from American, European and Japanese banks, many of which have sustainability pledges that specifically mention deforestation. That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public. It also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia, or financing provided to other, more global players. And it contrasts with efforts by companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Procter  Gamble to distance themselves from suppliers linked to deforestation. And while there has been a growing movement among endowments and pension funds to divest from the   industry  \u2014   and banks have started to back away from financing coal projects  \u2014   any move away from deforestation has been slower to catch on, experts say. The role of banks has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after environmentalists called out banks like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs for financing the contentious Dakota Access oil pipeline project. The money is aiding a process that scientists say destroys ecosystems, displaces indigenous communities and covers the region each year in a thick, suffocating smog that stretches from Jakarta to Hong Kong. Deforestation  \u2014   and the fires that frequently accompany it  \u2014   also generates   of total global warming emissions, making forestry loss one of the biggest single contributors to global warming, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cDestroying the world\u2019s forests makes fighting climate change almost impossible,\u201d said Andrew W. Mitchell, executive director of the Global Canopy Programme, a forestry think tank. \u201cThe finance sector is really lagging behind in realizing that. \u201d In funding Rajawali\u2019s palm oil plantations, the banks appear to have violated their own sustainability policies. In its forestry and agribusiness policy, adopted in 2008, Credit Suisse says it will not finance or advise companies with operations in \u201cprimary tropical moist forests\u201d like those of West Kalimantan. Bank of America says in a banking policy, adopted in 2004, that it will not finance commercial projects that result in the clearing of primary tropical moist forests. The 2014 deal financed Rajawali\u2019s expansion into palm oil by helping the conglomerate buy out a former partner, invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. Demand for palm oil is surging worldwide, driven by rising incomes in markets like China and India and a switch away from trans fats by Americans and Europeans. Rajawali\u2019s plantations have been accused by environmental and labor groups of deforestation and illegal burning. Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s biggest palm oil producers, and forestry loss there and elsewhere ranks as one of the biggest single contributors to global warming. Sebastian Sharp, a spokesman for Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm, acknowledged that the burning and clearing on its West Kalimantan forest sites might be illegal but said local communities encroaching on its properties and starting the fires were to blame. He said the company did not engage in illegal burning or clearing. Credit Suisse declined to comment on its Rajawali deal or to say whether the deal violated its sustainability policies. A Bank of America spokesman, Bill Halldin, said that the most serious accusations against Rajawali came after the 2014 loan, in which the bank played \u201ca very small role. \u201d \u201cToday, we would certainly consider more information before making any decision on any client,\u201d he said. Brigitte Seegers, a spokeswoman for ABN Amro, declined to comment. Climate concerns have been brought into sharp relief by the impending presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce   carbon emissions. Daily emissions from Indonesia\u2019s forest fires last year at times exceeded emissions produced by all economic activity in the United States. A recent Harvard and Columbia study estimated that the fires caused at least 100, 000 premature deaths across Southeast Asia. The World Bank estimates that the fires cost Indonesia\u2019s economy $16 billion. Although deforestation has slowed in many parts of the world, notably in the Brazilian Amazon, forest clearing is on the rise in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, in particular, suffers the world\u2019s highest rates of forest loss, an average of almost 2. 1 million acres a year, a study published in 2014 found. About 15 percent of the world\u2019s historical forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared or degraded or is in fragments. Rajawali originally operated its palm plantation business, Green Eagle Holdings, as a joint venture with the French conglomerate Louis Dreyfus. But starting in 2014, Rajawali took the first step to consolidate the palm oil business under its control, and invest in new infrastructure. Its loans from Western banks were crucial. In January 2014, Green Eagle attracted a $120 million loan from a group of lenders led by ABN Amro. In July of that year, it scored an even bigger loan of $235 million from a syndicate led by Credit Suisse. Bank of America also took part in that loan. The financing allowed Green Eagle to buy out Louis Dreyfus to invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. In November 2014, Green Eagle merged with another plantation operator, BW Plantation Rajawali is majority shareholder of the resulting company, Eagle High Plantations. The banks issued those loans as Rajawali was being accused of extensive forest and peatland destruction, illegal burning, use of child labor and the use of force against workers at plantations under its control.   mapping by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and satellite imagery from Global Forest Watch, show forest loss at two sites in West Kalimantan from 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, with much of the forest gone by the end of the year. Those sites included around 11, 000 hectares of peat, which, when set alight, can smolder for months underground. Zamzami, who goes by one name, a Greenpeace staff member in Indonesia who visited a Rajawali plantation in West Kalimantan in September 2015, said the burning continued. \u201cIt was difficult to breathe because of the smoke,\u201d he said in field notes. \u201cFar away, on the horizon, I could see the forest wall. \u201d Eagle High is now one of Indonesia\u2019s largest palm oil plantation operators, with more than a million acres in land rights under its control, according to an investors\u2019 presentation dated September 2014. Human rights organizations have reported that children as young as 6 work to support their parents in another   plantation in the Papua province. That plantation has promised to support the abolition of child labor by ensuring that there are no children on plantation sites. In December 2015, a    worker was shot dead at the plantation by state security forces. It was unclear why state forces were on private property. Mr. Sharp, the Eagle High spokesman, blamed local villagers for the forest clearing and burning on its sites. \u201cIt\u2019s being done by local communities, and we have no control over that,\u201d he said. Environmental groups argue that plantation companies are responsible for protecting their sites. Mr. Sharp said that there were instances in which workers brought their children to plantations but that the company was \u201ctrying to brainstorm ways in which we can stop them from doing that. \u201d He also questioned the wisdom of Indonesian labor law. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we hire children at 15? Families need income,\u201d he said. Under the country\u2019s law, the minimum age for hazardous work, including jobs on plantations, is 18. The worker who was killed, Marvel Doga, was \u201cdrunk and violent, poured petrol everywhere and threatened to set fire, and he had with him a bow and arrow\u201d when nearby state security forces tried to incapacitate him, leading to his death, Mr. Sharp said. He said Eagle High paid \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to his family in compensation. Credit Suisse and ABN Amro declined to discuss specific deals. Bank of America declined to comment on the accusations. But in a February 2015 research note, Credit Suisse deemed Rajawali\u2019s palm oil push a success. Eagle High\u2019s increased landholdings and land rights signaled \u201csignificant headroom for expansion\u201d of palm oil production, Priscilla Tjitra, an equity analyst for the bank, said in a report to clients. \u201cThe allocation of finance is so influential in our economy and to our environment,\u201d said Tom Picken of the Rainforest Action Network. \u201cBut there\u2019s little way we can hold financial sectors to account. \u201d The orangutan rescues continue. The world has lost 60 percent of its population of Bornean orangutans since 1950, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In July, the Bornean orangutan was listed as critically endangered. International Animal Rescue, which runs a temporary shelter for about 100 orangutans in West Kalimantan, said its staff had rescued roughly 50 of the primates during the 2015 burning season, twice the number the organization rescues in an average year. \u201cThey were all starving, all skinny,\u201d said Ms. S\u00e1nchez, the orangutan rescue group\u2019s director. So far this year, about 25 orangutans have been rehabilitated. \u201cThe problem is that every time an area is destroyed and orangutans are under real threat, we have to look for areas to release them, and that\u2019s challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of places where we can release these orangutans. \u201d In September, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured a $192 million loan from Bank Negara Indonesia, a state bank, to refinance the debt held by its plantation subsidiaries and to double the capacity of palm oil refineries in Papua and West Kalimantan. Bank Negara Indonesia\u2019s sustainability policies say that its clients must adopt \u201cminimum environmental, social and governance standards. \u201d The bank did not respond to requests for comment.'"}, "time": 1742563273.759016}
