[\u201c[W]e cannot deny the legacy of racism that continues to drive inequality in how the justice system is experienced by so many Americans,\u201d Obama wrote in his 56 page essay.  Obama cited studies from the NAACP showing that   and Hispanics were more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officials and suffer stricter penalties in court. \u201cIf we are to chart honestly the path for criminal justice reform, we must confront the role of race and bias in shaping the policies that led us to this point,\u201d Obama wrote. Obama defended his decision to free 1, 324 prisoners during his presidency, either through pardons or clemency. \u201cWhile not a substitute for the lasting change that can be achieved by passage of legislation, the clemency power represents an important and underutilized tool for advancing reform,\u201d Obama explained.
