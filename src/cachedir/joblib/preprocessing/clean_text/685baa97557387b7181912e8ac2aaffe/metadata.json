This disclosure reopens scrutiny concerning what role the Kremlin might have played in the president-elect\u2019s close and contentious race against Hillary Clinton. \\nTrump repeatedly said during the campaign that he never had contact with the Russian government. \\n\u201cI can tell you I think if I came up with that they\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a conspiracy theory, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u2019\u201d Trump told CBS4\u2019s Jim DeFede during an interview at his golf resort in Doral. \u201cI mean I have nothing to do with Russia. I don\u2019t have any jobs in Russia. I\u2019m all over the world but we\u2019re not involved in Russia.\u201d \\nWhen asked about outstanding loans with Russian banks or investors, Trump replied in July: \\n\u201cAbsolutely not. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \\nMeanwhile, during his campaign, Trump repeatedly refused requests to disclose his tax returns to the American people. \\nExperts still speculate that Trump\u2019s tax returns could contain damaging information regarding his relationship with a foreign government or business interest. \\nDuring an interview with Russia\u2019s state-run Interfax News, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that \u201cthere were contacts\u201d with Trump\u2019s team during the election. \\n\u201cObviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,\u201d Rybakov said. \u201cThose people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives.\u201d \\n\u201cWe have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes,\u201d Ryabkov was quoted as saying. \\n\u201cWe continue this work of course,\u201d he added . \\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Bloomberg that it\u2019s \u201cnormal practice\u201d for Russian Embassy staff to meet with U.S. presidential campaigns. \\nZakharova added that Clinton rejected similar requests to meet during the campaign. \\nFrom Moscow with love comrade Trump. \\nFeatured image via Russia-Insider'"}, "time": 1742561821.9883125}
