Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit about this amount \u2013 this is just about the amount of a teaspoon \u2013 less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001. This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope. \\n\u201cIraq declared 8,500 liters of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon-full of this deadly material.\u201d \\nSource: Colin Powell\u2019s Presentation to the UN on Iraq WMD [26:37 \u2013 27:45] \\nAlthough it is difficult to remember at this point, the anthrax scare of late 2001 was widely seen as a follow-up to the 9/11 attacks, and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the so-called War on Terror. Beginning in late September and continuing for several weeks, multiple anthrax-laced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two US Senators, killing five and injuring 17. \\nIt did not take long, however, for the neocons in the Bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen: Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. \\nIn his book, \u201c The 2001 Anthrax Deception ,\u201d Dr. Graeme MacQueen describes this as \u201cthe double perpetrator hypothesis,\u201d an attempt to blame the attacks on both Al Qaeda and Iraq. He writes: \\n\u201cWhat I call the \u2018Double Perpetrator hypothesis\u2019 held that Bin Laden\u2019s group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores, namely Iraq.\u201d \\nThis hypothesis, insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press, had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently. \\nMACQUEEN1 \u2013\u201cWell the young woman who opened Senator Daschle\u2019s mail\u2026Afghanistan and Iraq\u201d [0:16 \u2013 2:02] \\nThe story of Iraqi collusion with Al Qaeda sounded credible enough to an American public that had no familiarity with the Muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of 9/11. The only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie. \\nWhen key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite, a signature of the Iraqi anthrax program, the Bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between Saddam and the attacks. \\nAs filmmaker Robbie Martin explains in his documentary, American Anthrax , however, that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media. \\nMartin points to disgraced ex-New York Times journalist and Iraqi WMD pusher Judy Miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie Iraq to the anthrax letters. \\nAs we now know, of course, the anthrax attacks were a false flag event. \\nBy early 2002 it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, a key facility within America\u2019s own bioweapons program. Soon suspicion fell on Steven Hatfill, a \u201cperson of interest\u201d identified by the FBI who eventually won a $4.6 million lawsuit against the Department of Justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press. The blame for the attacks was then pinned on Bruce Ivins, a researcher at Fort Detrick who conveniently died before the FBI could identify him or try him in court. The National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office have both cast doubt on the FBI\u2019s scientific investigation of the attacks, however, and a whistleblower within the FBI\u2019s own investigation has revealed that the Bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate Ivins. \\nWhoever the perpetrator may have been\u2013even accepting that Ivins was the attacker\u2013it is a fact that the attacks were a false flag, using crudely forged letters to convince the American public that they were written by Al Qaeda agents. And that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in Iraq. \\nThe legacy of that war remains with us today. The middle east, including Iraq itself, remains in chaos, a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country. An invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications. \\nThe blood of a million dead Iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war, and those who aided and abetted those liars. \\nMeanwhile, the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression.'"}, "time": 1742561753.484921}
