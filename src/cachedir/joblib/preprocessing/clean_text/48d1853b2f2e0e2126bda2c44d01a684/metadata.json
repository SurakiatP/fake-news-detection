Many children leave behind their quirky eating habits as they get older. But \u201cwhat is less certain are the predictors of who will remain a picky eater in adulthood,\u201d said Nancy Zucker, a psychologist and director of the Duke Center for Eating Disorders. She is the lead author of a 2015 study that linked picky eating in some preschoolers with emotional problems. Adults may hang on to their youthful food dislikes  \u2014   at the top of the list are vegetables  \u2014   but then add more restrictions, such as consuming only smooth foods or limiting their diet to bland, white meals. Dr. Zucker said that in a sample of 2, 600 adults who identified themselves as picky eaters, 75 percent reported the pattern started in childhood. The estimates of picky eating in childhood vary widely, ranging from 5 percent to more than 25 percent, depending on the definition of selective eating. But \u201cthere is no consensus on the prevalence in adults,\u201d Dr. Zucker said. One reason is that many adults try to keep their picky eating a secret, a common source of stress that can lead to personal or professional problems. As a child, Stephanie Lucianovic, the author of \u201cSuffering Succotash: A Picky Eater\u2019s Quest to Understand Why We Hate the Foods We Hate,\u201d would hide vegetables or hold her nose during meals. As an adult, her selective eating posed new challenges when she fell in love with a man from a \u201cfoodie\u201d family. \u201cIt\u2019s a really scary thing to overcome,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t choosing to dislike food. There\u2019s a lot of shame involved. There\u2019s not a lot of empathy for picky eaters. \u201d Ms. Lucianovic said the key to ending her pickiness at the table was having the support of a nonjudgmental partner and learning how to cook. She still avoids steamed vegetables, but now enjoys them roasted or saut\u00e9ed. \u201cYou can reset the pattern of likes and dislikes,\u201d she said. \u201cI did it by continuing to try things in different ways. \u201d Researchers at Duke and the University of Pittsburgh are studying adult picky eaters via an online questionnaire. Among the questions: \u201cDo you get anxious about social situations because you will be expected to eat?\u201d and \u201cDo you gag when tasting a disliked food?\u201d About 40, 000 adults have completed the survey. The causes of   picky eating, however, remain poorly understood. In some cases, a childhood dining scare from choking or vomiting may cause lingering fear of one or more foods. \u201cFood memories are very powerful memories,\u201d Dr. Zucker said, adding that social anxiety associated with picky eating seems to increase with age. Other people may have a heightened sensitivity \u201cor even somewhat distorted perception to certain tastes and smells,\u201d said Juyun Lim, an associate professor of food science and technology at Oregon State University whose research has focused on the role of the senses in food preferences. All foods contain tens to hundreds of volatile compounds that determine aroma and flavor, she said. But the same food can be perceived differently by two individuals. \u201cDepending on your genetics, a food can smell pleasant or unpleasant,\u201d Dr. Lim said. While one person may enjoy the taste of cilantro, for example, another might find it soapy. Another example is pork, which contains a compound that some people can\u2019t detect, or describe as pleasantly floral, while others characterize it as smelling like sweat or urine. Sometimes we learn to like something the more we are exposed to it. \u201cThe first time you drink beer, it never really tastes good,\u201d Dr. Lim said. Texture also plays a role in food acceptance. One example is okra, with its slimy quality that many find disagreeable. Jane Kauer, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, was surprised when research revealed that some adults rejected raw tomatoes for reasons that had nothing to do with flavor. Participants described being turned off by the \u201cgross thing that happens when you pierce a tomato and the guts come out of it. \u201d Many adult picky eaters want to change, but they find certain foods too unappealing to even put on a plate. In extreme cases, they may shun nearly all foods, a condition the American Psychiatric Association calls   food intake disorder, or Arfid. Dr. Zucker said some adult picky eaters come to the Duke center for help when they are concerned about being poor role models for their children, for example, or they panic about attending business dinners. Psychologists and social workers help patients gain insight into the biological, emotional and social factors behind their selective eating. \u201cA person\u2019s experiences often need to be validated and fully understood before changes are even considered,\u201d Dr. Zucker said. New foods are then slowly introduced in an effort to expand the palate. Dr. Zucker compared the process to physical rehabilitation for an injury, requiring much work and practice. Patients who have eaten only smooth foods may, for example, need to consult with an occupational therapist to learn how to chew and swallow more effectively. They are also taught ways of handling situations like eating in public or explaining their food preferences to others. One thing experts advise: Don\u2019t push food at adult picky eaters. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly stressful to them, because most of us are perfectly happy to say, \u2018Come on, try it. It really tastes great,\u2019\u201d Dr. Kauer said. While loved ones\u2019 concern is understandable, selective eaters consider it intrusive and an attack on their sense of self, Dr. Kauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting into their space, and it has nothing to do with you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628462.2874205}
