The cost of the damage is estimated to be around $2,500. \\nThe vandal identified himself as \u201cJamie Otis,\u201d to Deadline Hollywood, and explained that he was planning to \u201cextract the star to auction it off and raise funds\u201d for the women who have accused Trump of being sexually inappropriate. He chatted casually with a person who filmed the incident on his cellphone. \\nBy the time that police arrived, the man had already left. He is described as a white male, and left behind the pick, sledgehammer, a construction hat, and vest, USA Today reports. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses and when the case is completed, it will be submitted to the district attorney for filing of a felony vandalism charge,\u201d Officer Norma Eisenman told USA Today. \\nThe star was dedicated in 2007, and sat at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. by the Dolby Theatre \u2014 across the street from the busy Hollywood & Highland shopping and entertainment center. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has said in a statement that Trump\u2019s star will be replaced immediately, and work has already began on it \u2014 though it will have to sit for a couple of days before it can be polished. \\n\u201cWhen people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California state landmark,\u201d Hollywood Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Leron Gubler said. \u201cOur democracy is based on respect for the law. People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property.\u201d \\nGubler added that they intend to prosecute the vandal to the fullest extent of the law when he is located. \\nThe star has been a target of vandalism throughout the election season, by people repeatedly spray painting it \u2014 and even defecating on it. \\nIn February, the star was defaced with a large black swastika. \\nSomeone painted a swastika over Donald Trump\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star https://t.co/FvSKy7CuyY pic.twitter.com/k1Mw5irqcs \\n\u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) February 1, 2016 \\n\\nIn May, someone spray painted a large mute sign over it. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s Hollywood Walk of #Fame star was just enhanced with a muted #sign painted by Norwegian #artist P\u00f8bel. pic.twitter.com/kBqQeJic5l \\n\u2014 All Public Art (@allpublicart) May 9, 2016 \\n\\nIt has disgustingly been covered in both human and animal bodily waste. \\nDonald Trump\\'s star on Hollywood walk of fame \u2026 covered in dog poop https://t.co/xDRH6Wea45 pic.twitter.com/lOB8gV2GjB \\n\u2014 NTXProgressive (@NTXProgressive) April 5, 2016 \\nI spit on Trump\\'s walk of fame star pic.twitter.com/BJ66IiGbQt \\n\u2014 Anna \u0160vercl Hetzer (@anna_hetzer) March 13, 2016 \\nI didn\\'t even know Trump had a star on the Walk of Fame, but we discovered it this weekend\u2026 covered in urine. pic.twitter.com/bTTu0FvXuj \\n\u2014 Ken Peters (@brand_BIG) March 22, 2016 \\n\\n\\nIn June, it was vandalized again. \\nFolks wrote on Trump\\'s star.
