He made the comments during an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that is set to air on Sunday. Mr. Sanders also said he was supporting Tim Canova, a law professor who has begun an insurgent campaign against Ms. Wasserman Schultz for her South Florida congressional seat. They will face off in a primary this summer. \u201cWell, clearly, I favor her opponent,\u201d Mr. Sanders told Mr. Tapper. \u201cHis views are much closer to mine. \u201d For months, Mr. Sanders has accused the party of favoring Hillary Clinton, often calling her the \u201canointed candidate. \u201d He has criticized the party for a debate schedule that his campaign says favors Mrs. Clinton an arrangement under which Mrs. Clinton raises money for the party and the appointment of Clinton supporters as leaders of important convention committees. Most recently, he and the party have sparred over what happened at the Nevada Democratic convention a week ago. There, Sanders supporters disrupted the proceedings in a fight over delegates and the state party chairwoman was later threatened. After the party rebuked Mr. Sanders for not clearly condemning what had occurred, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of \u201cthrowing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning. \u201d This week, Ms. Wasserman Schultz pushed back against the Sanders campaign in an interview with CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama,\u201d she told the network. \u201cThese rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014. \u201d In a statement on Saturday, she said that \u201ceven though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary. \u201d As president, Mr. Sanders would have the ability to appoint the committee chair, though it is not likely he will get that chance, as Mrs. Clinton is close to clinching the nomination. Nevertheless, he can try to draw a little blood from Ms. Wasserman Schultz with his endorsement of her primary opponent, Mr. Canova, the underdog in the race. Mr. Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, has echoed Mr. Sanders\u2019s messages about the need to combat economic inequalities and reform campaign finance. He has also mirrored, on a small scale, Mr. Sanders\u2019s   model by raising more than $1 million through small donations that have averaged about $19 each. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to know that Bernie Sanders favors our progressive campaign,\u201d Mr. Canova said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cLike Senator Sanders, I\u2019m running a campaign that\u2019s truly backed by the people, not big corporations  \u2014   one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them. \u201d Mr. Sanders spent Saturday campaigning across the Western states. At a rally in Vado, N. M. he offered a series of familiar attacks against Mrs. Clinton, criticizing her use of \u201csuper PACs,\u201d her stances on trade agreements and her support of fracking. He also talked about the need to improve the poverty and high school graduation rates in the state. Mr. Sanders then went to California, where he planned to hold an evening rally in National City and where he visited International Friendship Park, an area on the United States border with Mexico. There, he walked along two large walls separating the countries with an immigration activist and Maria Puga, a woman whose husband was killed by border patrol agents as he attempted a crossing from Mexico. Mr. Sanders vowed that if elected, he will push for comprehensive immigration reform. He called a proposal by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, to build a wall along the entire border both \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cimpractical. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561656.188844}
