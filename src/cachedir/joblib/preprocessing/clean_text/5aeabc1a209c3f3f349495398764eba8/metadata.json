Trump\u2019s extravagant behavior is thought-out political strategy \\nDonald Trump \u201chas chosen his own method to get through to voters\u2019 hearts,\u201d Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. \\nRead more \\n\u201cHe [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,\u201d Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. \\nAt the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. \\nEarlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow\u2019s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the \u2018Russian card\u2019 was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. \\nHe also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that \u201cRussia is not going to attack anybody.\u201d \\nPutin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has not only accused Donald Trump of being actively supported by Moscow, but also claimed that WikiLeaks, which repeatedly released documents hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Convention, of working for the Kremlin. \\nVia RT .
