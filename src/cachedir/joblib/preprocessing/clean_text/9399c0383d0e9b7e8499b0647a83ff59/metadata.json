Shh! While every sport has its own custom for when it is appropriate to cheer and when quiet is expected, none of that applies here. The Rio Games have only just begun, but already the exuberance of local fans has collided with athletes\u2019 and officials\u2019 pleas for silence. \u201cWe are not used to this in table tennis,\u201d said Galia Dvorak of Spain, who acknowledged that she had been shocked and unnerved by jeers from Brazilian fans during her match. She added, \u201cIt was just weird. \u201d At the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, an official twice requested silence from the crowd before a   butterfly race that featured the Brazilians Daiene Dias and Daynara de Paula. Fans contained themselves just long enough for the races to start before resuming their screaming. At the beach volleyball court, fans whistled and jeered when a Canadian team served. The   announcer asked them to cheer for everyone. During a men\u2019s fencing event, raucous Brazilian fans tossed aside the sport\u2019s typically convoluted rules of decorum  \u2014   cheering is all right, but only at certain moments  \u2014   as they shook the stands with continuous spasms of celebration and booed anyone who notched a point against one of their own. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible feeling when you enter this arena,\u201d the Brazilian fencer Ghislain Perrier said after losing his bout. \u201cYou feel all the power of the Brazilian people. \u201d The fans\u2019 presence has been most striking, though, at the table tennis arena. Outside a select few countries, the sport struggles to draw fans and generate excitement. Players in the sport value silence, which allows them to hear the way the ball bounces off an opponent\u2019s paddle and to react more smoothly to a shot. The tenor of the match on Sunday night between Hugo Calderano of Brazil and Tang Peng of Hong Kong revealed itself before a single point was played. Calderano, 20, entered the arena like a gladiator, hearing his name bellowed in unison from the stands, and when Tang, 35, hit a   shot into the net, the crowd let out an overjoyed roar of approval. On it went through the match, just like this: every time Calderano scored, an elated scream each time Tang erred, yelps of joy. In the realm of table tennis  \u2014   a subtle sport often likened to chess  \u2014   these were vividly unusual scenes. But such displays had been going on at the Olympic table tennis pavilion all weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s usually a more serious sport,\u201d Anderson Monteiro, 40, a casual table tennis fan from Rio de Janeiro, said as he watched Calderano play. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s typically Brazilian. \u201d Alexandre Ara\u00fajo, a press officer for the Brazilian table tennis squad, tapped his chest as he explained that the fans had \u201ccome with a football heart. \u201d On Sunday, fans hissed when Tang prepared to serve, forcing him on one occasion to step away from the table. That made the fans boo louder. They stopped only to sing to Calderano, \u201cVou te apoiar, Hugo!\u201d (\u201cI will support you, Hugo! \u201d) On Saturday afternoon, while Caroline Kumahara of S\u00e3o Paulo was on her way to losing her   match to an opponent from Luxembourg, the Brazilian fans kept their spirits up, doing the wave, rattling noisemakers and serenading her with encouragement, like \u201ceu sou brasileiro, com muito orgulho, com muito amor!\u201d (\u201cI am Brazilian, with much pride, with much love! \u201d) \u201cBrazilians are like this,\u201d Kumahara said afterward. \u201cThey are always happy, always making fun of everything. This is normal for them. \u201d It has been highly abnormal for the players, though. On Saturday morning, Gui Lin, the other woman representing Brazil in singles, stepped away from the table at one point to motion to the stands to quiet her vocal fans  \u2014   a rather extraordinary move in the wider context of sports. Gui, who said she appreciated the cheers, nevertheless seemed uneasy afterward as she described table tennis as a sport \u201cwhere you have to be quiet\u201d and the noise as a sign of disrespect. \u201cThey have to focus,\u201d Gui said of her opponents, \u201cand there are three other tables playing, and I thought it wasn\u2019t right to disturb the others because of me. \u201d Gui\u2019s opponent, Dvorak, blamed the crowd\u2019s jeers for her   loss in the first game. \u201cLike in other countries, like in China, they cheer a lot, but never against the opponent,\u201d Dvorak said. \u201cThey cheer for their players, but never making this \u2018ooh\u2019 against you. \u201d Noting the atypical atmosphere at his own match Saturday afternoon, Gustavo Tsuboi of S\u00e3o Paulo guessed that, for all their enthusiasm, most of the Brazilian fans on hand were not familiar with the customs of the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual how they react,\u201d said Tsuboi, who said he loved the additional energy. \u201cWe are used to having events only with people who already know our sport. \u201d Not all   were peeved. Tommy Danielsson, the Luxembourg coach, said: \u201cI find it very nice when the audience gets involved. We need this. People can see that this is not just a hobby game you play in a garage at home. \u201d The atmosphere Sunday supported that assertion. The crowd grew more engrossed, and more animated, as the match entered its late stages and it seemed that Calderano, the   player in the world, might produce a    victory over Tang, ranked 15th. Gui had slipped into the stands before the final game, taking a seat in the second row. As she watched the final points  \u2014   Tang banging away to stay alive, Calderano parrying his efforts  \u2014   she rubbed her palms nervously in front of her mouth. When Calderano secured the winning point, sending the crowd into a prolonged roar, Gui jumped out of her seat and pumped her fists in the air. The fans whooped and applauded and pounded their feet, and she clapped along with them, perfectly in rhythm.'"}, "time": 1742563561.7235684}
