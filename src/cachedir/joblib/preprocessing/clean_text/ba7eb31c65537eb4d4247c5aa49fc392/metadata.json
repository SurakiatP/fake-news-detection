In July, her daughter died in Baton Rouge, while her infant   mysteriously ailed in Houston. It was at a hospital there, a week and a half ago, where Ms. Fernandez learned she had lost her home, too, to flooding. She explained this to President Obama on Tuesday afternoon as he walked through that house, emptied of all the furniture except for what was too heavy to haul outside. He hugged her four times and they had their picture taken. Others may have debated the timing of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit and whether he was too late in coming to this   state, but Ms. Fernandez wiped tears from her eyes and said she had not been following any of that. \u201cReally I don\u2019t have time to think when I go home  \u2014   I mean, go to my place in the corner,\u201d said Ms. Fernandez, who turned 69 on Saturday and is staying at a friend\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. I haven\u2019t watched the news. I\u2019ve been doing all this by myself. \u201d Nearly 11 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Mr. Obama came to meet with flood victims in a visit that required him to navigate a delicate mix of compassion and politics. The president landed in Baton Rouge to see the devastation left by  flooding in the last week, and to demonstrate, in part by his presence, that the federal government will deliver help to those who lost everything. Standing amid rubble in front of flooded homes, he lamented that so many people\u2019s lives were \u201cupended\u201d by the floodwaters that swept through communities with devastating force. But he praised the disaster relief response and expressed optimism that the people of Baton Rouge would recover and thrive. \u201cI know how resilient the people of Louisiana are and I know you will rebuild again,\u201d Mr. Obama, dressed in a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up, said after touring several homes. He pledged that the federal government would support the victims of the community for the long run. \u201cThese are some good people down here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got a lot of work to do and they shouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. \u201d Local and state officials from both political parties have praised the federal response in Baton Rouge, drawing a sharp contrast with the   delays by the Federal Emergency Management Agency after Katrina. Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican who frequently criticizes Mr. Obama, said in an interview that federal officials had done \u201can excellent job\u201d responding to the floods. \u201cThey actually do care,\u201d he said. But Mr. Obama arrived four days after Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, visited   areas around Baton Rouge. In a Twitter message on Tuesday, Mr. Trump mocked the president for failing to cut short his Martha\u2019s Vineyard vacation last week. \u201cToo little, too late!\u201d he wrote. Some Republicans and distraught locals have also criticized the president for waiting more than a week to visit the tens of thousands of residents affected by the floods. More than 7, 000 people were forced into 37 shelters across a vast stretch of the state by the rainfall, which has been blamed for 13 deaths. The Advocate, a local newspaper, mocked the president in an editorial last week. And on Tuesday, Representative Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican, added, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame it took the president so long to come to Louisiana, but we are glad he is here. \u201d Frustration over the president\u2019s absence, merging with a widespread sense that the disaster has been unjustly overshadowed in media coverage of the Summer Olympics and the presidential election, has ranged from the hot anger of The Advocate editorial to a more subdued disappointment. Some here said the president had been callously detached for vacationing during a catastrophe, while others said he was respectfully keeping his distance during rescue efforts. But for those most intensely affected, the political debate is a luxury they can hardly afford. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he was here,\u201d said Nita Case, 75, sitting wearily on a folded camp chair inside her gutted home, 11 miles from the neighborhood Mr. Obama had just visited. Florence Lucas, 79, had lost everything in Hurricane Betsy in 1965, lost her home during Hurricane Katrina and then had her home flooded this summer. She stood in the kitchen as a contractor discussed the rebuilding timeline, a needlepoint Home Sweet Home sign still hanging above the door to the hallway. \u201cPolitics should be out of this,\u201d Ms. Lucas said, adding that an earlier visit by the president would have just complicated the work of local responders and the police. \u201cWhat can he do? He can\u2019t come and get rid of the water. \u201d The president praised W. Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator, for overhauling the agency to make it work better, and he announced that the federal government had already distributed $127 million in aid to the flooded communities. Still, Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, issued a statement after meeting with the president saying that he had formally requested additional help for his state. Mr. Edwards, who had urged the president not to visit the state when the rescue operation was in full swing, said the federal government so far has been \u201cresponsive to all of our requests. \u201d Mr. Obama was in Baton Rouge for about three hours before heading back to Washington. White House officials said the president also planned to meet briefly with the family of Alton B. Sterling, the   who was shot while being held on the ground by Baton Rouge police officers, as well as families of officers killed and injured in an ambush in July. In the long run, the success of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit will be judged in two different contexts: first, the political imagery that has become a vital part of White House planning since President George W. Bush was photographed gazing down on New Orleans from Air Force One, and second, the gritty reality on the ground for people struggling to rebuild. As a candidate in 2008, Mr. Obama was eager to focus on the politics of Mr. Bush\u2019s flyover, denouncing him during a rally for being \u201ca president who only saw the people from the window of an airplane instead of down here on the ground, trying to provide comfort and aid. \u201d Now the spotlight has shifted to Mr. Obama\u2019s actions. After touring the damage, Mr. Obama pledged continued help \u201ceven after the TV cameras leave\u201d and waved aside questions about politics. \u201cI guarantee you,\u201d he said, \u201cnobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican. \u201d He could have been referring to Nita Case\u2019s husband, Dennis, 78. A fan of Bill O\u2019Reilly, the conservative talk show host, he had few good words for the government, saying, it \u201cain\u2019t never done enough. \u201d But he also said he had paid little attention to the politics surrounding Mr. Obama\u2019s visit on Tuesday. \u201cI haven\u2019t watched the news for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563662.8373091}
