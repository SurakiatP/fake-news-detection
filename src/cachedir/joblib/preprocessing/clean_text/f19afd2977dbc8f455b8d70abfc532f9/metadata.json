Absolutely. \u201d[\u201cWe\u2019d love to solve things diplomatically but it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d the president added.  China will clearly play a major role in that   diplomatic resolution, as Trump suggested he would not anger Beijing with another phone call to Taiwan\u2019s president. He explicitly stated he wanted to avoid \u201ccausing difficulty\u201d for Chinese President Xi Jinping while he is \u201cdoing everything in his power to help us with a big situation. \u201d He praised Xi as a \u201cgood man\u201d who is \u201ctrying very hard\u201d to avoid \u201cturmoil and death\u201d on the Korean peninsula. \u201cHe is a very good man and I got to know him very well,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWith that being said, he loves China and he loves the people of China. I know he would like to be able to do something, perhaps it\u2019s possible that he can\u2019t. \u201d Trump was also surprisingly sympathetic to North Korean dictator Kim  . \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age,\u201d he said of Kim. \u201cI\u2019m not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he\u2019s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he\u2019s rational. \u201d On the other hand, Trump played hardball with South Korea, saying that he intends to renegotiate its   deal with the U. S. \u201cvery soon,\u201d and seek compensation for the $1 billion cost of deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)   shield to Seoul. \u201cIt is unacceptable, it is a horrible deal made by Hillary. It\u2019s a horrible deal, and we are going to renegotiate that deal or terminate it,\u201d he said of the Korean trade deal, formally known as KORUS, referring to his defeated 2016 presidential opponent and onetime Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He said it would be much easier to terminate KORUS than the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he has also strongly criticized. \u201cWith the Korean deal, we terminate and it\u2019s over. I will do that unless we make a fair deal. We\u2019re getting destroyed in Korea,\u201d he said. According to the Washington Post, the South Korean Trade Ministry stated on Friday that it has no plans to renegotiate the agreement, whose anniversary occurs next week. The United States is currently running a $27. 7 billion trade deficit in goods with South Korea. When Reuters asked when he planned to announce this surprising review of South Korea trade policy, Trump replied, \u201cI\u2019m announcing it now. \u201d This did not go over well in South Korea, where stocks and currency values immediately tumbled. Among other market indicators, shares in Hyundai Motor dropped by as much as 2. 4 percent, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index slid 0. 1 percent, and the South Korean won dropped 0. 2 percent against the dollar. These would seem more like signs of unease than panic. Analysts told CNBC Trump\u2019s remarks came as a surprise, but most of the South Korean market and its foreign investors await firmer announcements of the Trump administration\u2019s intentions before concluding a trade war is brewing. A foreign policy adviser to the favored candidate in the upcoming emergency South Korea presidential election, Moon   said asking South Korea to pay for THAAD was an \u201cimpossible option. \u201d Moon is already known as a skeptic of THAAD deployment, with his campaign describing the decision of his impeached predecessor Park   to install the system \u201cstrongly regrettable\u201d and \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d because she did not properly consult with parliament. Moon has called for an immediate halt to the deployment of the THAAD system, which has increased tensions between South Korea and China. Chinese boycotts over THAAD have cost South Korea enough money to raise concerns about the future of South Korea\u2019s economic recovery. China objects to the deployment because it believes THAAD\u2019s powerful radars will be employed to spy on Chinese activity. The New York Times quotes Moon spokespersons describing Trump\u2019s demand for payment as validation of their criticism that Park\u2019s administration was not honest with the Korean people about the costs and drawbacks of the missile shield.'"}, "time": 1742564504.8785431}
