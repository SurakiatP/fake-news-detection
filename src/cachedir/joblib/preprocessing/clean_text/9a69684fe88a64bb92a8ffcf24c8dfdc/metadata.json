And then the conversation shifts to the Affordable Care Act and what its repeal would mean for the struggling rural workers who have long voted for Mr. Walden, and for children like    Rocco Stone. Because of the health law, Rocco has been able to live at home, attend school and have a nearly normal life despite having autism and a rare genetic disorder. \u201cOur life was completely changed when Oregon and the federal government partnered to provide home and community services through Medicaid,\u201d Rocco\u2019s mother, Dana M. Stone, told the congressman this past week. \u201cWe are deeply, deeply concerned about talk at the federal level about a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201d Mr. Walden, the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is not just another backbench Republican dealing with suddenly energized supporters of the health law at town   meetings. The lanky    congressman will have a large role in drafting promised legislation to replace former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement and a huge say in decisions about the future of Medicaid, which the health law greatly expanded. As a former chairman of the committee responsible for electing Republicans to the House, Mr. Walden knows the politics of health care as well as anyone. But in his new role, he must reconcile the political goals of his party, which is committed to repealing the 2010 health law, and the interests of his state, where officials say the law has been a big success. In 2010, nearly one in five Oregonians lacked health coverage. Today, state officials say, 95 percent of Oregonians have coverage. Since Oregon expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the health law in 2014, enrollment has increased more than 65 percent. Nearly   of the state\u2019s four million residents are now on Medicaid. In Mr. Walden\u2019s district, the percentages are even higher. In some of his rural counties, more than   of the people are on Medicaid. President Trump easily carried those counties. Mr. Walden won a 10th term in the fall with 72 percent of the vote and was victorious in every one of the 20 counties in his district, which is about the size of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined. But that does not guarantee that voters here endorse all the policies of his party. Hospitals are among the leading supporters and beneficiaries of Affordable Care Act. Mr. Walden was a trustee of a   hospital in his hometown, Hood River. \u201cWe are very worried about what \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 might look like,\u201d said David Underriner, who supervises the hospital, Providence Hood River Memorial, as Oregon\u2019s regional chief executive for Providence Health and Services, the large Roman Catholic system that owns it. Mr. Walden grew up on a cherry orchard, worked at radio stations owned by his family, and followed his father into the State Legislature. The political shifts that have turned all three Pacific Coast states reliably Democratic have begun to creep into a few of the conservative inland parts of Oregon. Hood River County, long known for fruit farming, windsurfing and the spectacular scenery of the Columbia River Gorge, has lately become a center for the production of surveillance drones, leading to an influx of software engineers, technology entrepreneurs and other young professionals. Mr. Walden\u2019s margin of victory in November in the county where he lives was just five votes  \u2014   out of more than 10, 590 cast. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little \u201d Mr. Walden allowed. \u201cIt didn\u2019t used to be that way. \u201d Unlike many Republicans in Congress, Mr. Walden has worked productively with Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m a problem solver,\u201d he said in an interview after a town   meeting here near the Idaho border. \u201cI\u2019m not an ideologue. I want to fix things. \u201d And in Oregon, some Democrats and   supporters are glad Mr. Walden is in his position. \u201cI\u2019ve known Greg a long time,\u201d said Andrew S. Davidson, the president and chief executive of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems. \u201cHe is not interested in upending the progress we have made in this state. \u201d Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat whose district includes the southern suburbs of Portland and the capital, Salem, predicted Mr. Walden \u201cwill be mindful of the implications of any legislation for our state, which is leading the nation in the transformation of health care. \u201d Unlike Mr. Walden, Oregon has embraced the Affordable Care Act. State officials say many of the changes proposed by congressional Republicans, including a rollback of federal funds for the expansion of Medicaid, would reverse much of the progress they have made. Oregon has a history of health care innovation that predates the Affordable Care Act. In the early 1990s, it ranked medical procedures according to their costs and benefits, and Medicaid uses this list to decide which services to cover. Under a federal waiver granted in 2012, Oregon treats Medicaid beneficiaries through 16 \u201ccoordinated care organizations,\u201d which are governed by local citizen councils. The organizations have slowed the growth of health spending and improved the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, according to performance data collected by the state. Even as he writes legislation to unwind the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Walden takes pride in Oregon\u2019s success under the law. \u201cOur state of Oregon has had quite a bit of innovation over the years,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the coordinated care organizations in place that have actually brought better health care outcomes at lower cost. There are great ideas out there among the states, but right now, they have to come back and beg permission from a federal bureaucrat to be able to do much of anything innovative. \u201d When Mr. Walden first ran for Congress in 1998, conservatives called him too liberal. Since then, he has taken more conservative positions, and the party has moved to the right. \u201cTimes change,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a terrorist attack. You have different administrations come and go. Culture changes. My bedrock principles have stayed the same. I favor more local   and less Washington  . \u201d Mr. Walden never wavered in his opposition to the Affordable Care Act. On the day the House passed the bill in March 2010, he and other Republicans stood on the Capitol balcony, before a throng of protesters, and held up signs with handwritten letters that spelled out their message: \u201cKill the Bill. \u201d A month later, on the House floor, Mr. Walden announced the goal that he hopes soon to achieve, using words that became the mantra for Republicans: \u201cWe need to repeal and replace this law. \u201d Over the last four years, Mr. Walden has been a genial attack dog for Republicans. As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, he averted a political blood bath for his party and secured the election of Republicans in many districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Many of those House campaigns revolved around attacks on the health law that he is now charged with replacing. Oregon tried to run its own health insurance exchange, but had a disastrous experience and decided, after a year, to use the federal website, HealthCare. gov. The state has a competitive insurance market, but consumers have still seen substantial increases in prices, with the average premium for a popular benchmark plan on the exchange rising 27 percent this year and more than 20 percent last year, according to the federal government. (Subsidies cushion the impact for most consumers.) \u201cMedicaid did better than expected, and subsidized commercial insurance did worse,\u201d said Dennis E. Burke, the president of the Good Shepherd Health Care System in Hermiston, Ore. \u201cWe have seen steep increases in premiums for commercial insurers, and as a result healthy people have dropped out. \u201d People newly covered under the health law \u201cproudly present an insurance card,\u201d Mr. Burke said, but in many cases their plans have high deductibles, and the hospital has difficulty collecting the patient\u2019s share of the bill. But Mr. Burke is not so quick as his congressman, Mr. Walden, to seek repeal. \u201cI think it could be fixed,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe need more of a retooling. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563363.5709171}
