They are not impressed with many of Trump's campaign promises, and threaten the new president-elect with court if he tries to implement them. \\nThe ACLU has a message for Donald Trump. \\nNEW YORK \u2014 In response to Donald Trump\u2019s election as president of the United States, Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , had the following statement: \\n\u201cFor nearly 100 years, the American Civil Liberties Union has been the nation\u2019s premier defender of freedom and justice for all, no matter who is president. Our role is no different today. \\n\u201cPresident-elect Trump, as you assume the nation\u2019s highest office, we urge you to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. These include your plan to amass a deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants; ban the entry of Muslims into our country and aggressively surveil them; punish women for accessing abortion; reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture; and change our nation\u2019s libel laws and restrict freedom of expression. \\n\u201cThese proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed, they are unlawful and unconstitutional. They violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. If you do not reverse course and instead endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of card-carrying supporters are ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights. \\n\u201cOne thing is certain: we will be eternally vigilant every single day of your presidency and when you leave the Oval Office, we will do the same with your successor.\""}, "time": 1742561758.512314}
