The ruling effectively dissolved the elected legislature, which is led by Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents, and allows the court to write laws itself, experts said. The move caps a year in which the last vestiges of Venezuela\u2019s democracy have been torn down, critics and regional leaders say, leaving what many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship. \u201cWhat we have warned of has finally come to pass,\u201d said Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States, a regional diplomacy group that includes Venezuela and is investigating the country for violating the bloc\u2019s Democratic Charter. Mr. Almagro called the move a \u201c  coup,\u201d a term used in Latin America to denote takeovers typical of the 1990s in Guatemala and Peru  \u2014   but virtually   in the region today. Recent months have seen a swift consolidation of power by Mr. Maduro as scores of political prisoners have been detained without trial, protesters violently repressed and local elections postponed. In taking power from the National Assembly, the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the president\u2019s growing power in the country. The court said that lawmakers were \u201cin a situation of contempt,\u201d and that while that lasted, the justices themselves would step in to \u201censure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber, or by the body that the chamber chooses. \u201d It did not say whether it might hand power back. Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday. \u201cThey have kidnapped the Constitution, they have kidnapped our rights, they have kidnapped our liberty,\u201d said Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the body, holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday. Oneida Guaipe, an opposition lawmaker from the country\u2019s central coast, said the body would continue to do its work, even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation. \u201cThis is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people chose us through a popular vote. \u201d The ruling was also a challenge to Venezuela\u2019s neighbors, which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections, and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O. A. S. on the grounds that the country is not democratic. Last week, the United States, Canada and a dozen of Latin America\u2019s largest nations called for Mr. Maduro to recognize the National Assembly\u2019s powers, a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government. \u201cWe consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela,\u201d the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision. Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest. David Smilde, an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said it might now be up to Venezuela\u2019s neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again, given resistance from within the government. \u201cThe Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy,\u201d he said. Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuela\u2019s democracy. Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president, whose popularity is sinking along with the country\u2019s collapsing economy. While such a referendum was permitted by the country\u2019s Constitution, and highly favored in polls, Mr. Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents. In October, a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures. Meanwhile, political prisoners continued to be arrested. In January, Mr. Maduro established a new \u201c  commando\u201d to round up political dissidents accused of treason. The group has taken aim at members of the opposition, arresting many, including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly. In February, after CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, the network\u2019s Spanish language channel, broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuela\u2019s vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East, Mr. Maduro ordered the channel off the air. The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October. But to many, the gradual assault against the National Assembly, more than a year in the making, was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela. \u201cIt has come in fragments,\u201d Carlos Ayala Corao, a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst, said of the court\u2019s actions against the legislature. \u201cThey have been slicing it in pieces. \u201d The conflicts began in December 2015, when rising grievances about the country\u2019s faltering economy propelled Mr. Maduro\u2019s opposition to win control of the legislature. It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Mr. Maduro initially said he accepted the vote. He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year. But the Supreme Court, packed with loyalists to Mr. Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power, was chipping away at the chamber\u2019s powers. It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities. That denied the opposition of a supermajority, which would have given it expanded powers over Mr. Maduro. The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling, but eventually complied. As the National Assembly began to get to work, it continued to clash with the court. By last spring, the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners, only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional. When Mr. Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared, the legislature rejected the effort. But the court sided with the president. In October, the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget, leaving Mr. Maduro in charge of the country\u2019s purse strings. More recently, legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval. In Wednesday\u2019s ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers, the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals. It said its ruling was justified by the Assembly\u2019s choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier. This act, it said, rendered the Assembly itself invalid. With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday, it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public. Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders, given the opposition\u2019s continued defeat by the government. Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall. John Magdaleno, a political consultant, said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr. Maduro in coming weeks, and possibly more arrests. \u201cIn my opinion, from now on, there will be growing pressures against lawmakers,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561633.0325992}
