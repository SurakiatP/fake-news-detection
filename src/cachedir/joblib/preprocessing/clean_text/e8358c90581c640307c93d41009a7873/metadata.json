Within minutes, both women sounded markedly more Texan than they had when they walked into the restaurant. But Texas twangs may be the least of what they have in common. The families of Ms. Bush, 34, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the chief executive of Global Health Corps, a nonprofit organization, and Ms. Richards, 58, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and daughter of former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, go way back. At the 1988 Democratic convention, Governor Richards, who died in 2006, got off one of the best   in memory when she said of former President (and candidate at the time) George Bush: \u201cPoor George. He can\u2019t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. \u201d His son George W. evened the score in 1994 by beating her decisively in the Texas governor\u2019s race. But there was no trace of animosity when the women met for lunch at Gotham Bar and Grill. They are enthusiastic supporters of each other\u2019s work. Before becoming president of Planned Parenthood in 2006, the nation\u2019s leading provider of reproductive health services and sex education for women, men and young people, Ms. Richards founded America Votes, a group that coordinates and promotes progressive issues. Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is now the House minority leader, and worked for many years as a labor organizer. Ms. Bush founded Global Health Corps in 2009 (along with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others) to address disparate health results among rich and poor countries. The organization provides yearlong fellowships to young professionals with diverse backgrounds by embedding them in health organizations in Africa and underserved communities in the United States. The number of fellows has grown from 22 in its inaugural year to 140 in its eighth class, which began this month, from a pool of over 5, 000 applicants. Over black cod (for Ms. Bush) and branzino (for Ms. Richards) the pair discussed the challenges of growing up in political families the politicization of health care, especially for women and the coincidence of appearing in a recent collection of essays, \u201cWhat I Told My Daughter: Lessons from Leaders on Raising the Next Generation of Empowered Women,\u201d edited by Nina Tassler. PHILIP GALANES: Let\u2019s start with Nora Ephron, who said that, as a kid, she dreamt of being the president\u2019s daughter because of all the attention she\u2019d get, especially from boys. Did that indirect spotlight appeal to you? BARBARA BUSH: I really didn\u2019t notice it. I was so young. When I was 8, I asked a friend when her grandfather\u2019s inauguration was. I had just been to my grandfather\u2019s, and I assumed everybody had one. PG: How about when your father ran for president? BB: We were 18 then. At 18, you\u2019re focused on yourself and where you\u2019ll go to college. Our parents wanted that for us. CECILE RICHARDS: I was at a very different time in my life. I was 30 when I moved back to Texas to help with Mom\u2019s campaign. I had a    daughter and was pregnant with twins at her inauguration. BB: You have twins? I\u2019m a twin. CR: Twins are the best. PG: Did you like campaigning for your mother, or was it an obligation? CR: Oh, there was never any question about it. It\u2019s different, running as a woman. And at that point, my mother wasn\u2019t married. We were her support system. But it\u2019s a mixed bag, seeing your parent run for office. There\u2019s a little bit of glamour, but a lot of pain and suffering, watching them go through tough times. BB: I never read the media about my dad. I already had an opinion about him, millions of opinions. I didn\u2019t need another person telling me what to think. And when it comes to attacks, people are attacking a caricature. They don\u2019t actually know the person. I have the luxury of knowing my parents deeply. CR: A lot of people think of Ann Richards as larger than life. She always said: \u201cTake me, warts and all. \u201d But I saw the vulnerabilities that the public didn\u2019t. One of her favorite things was going to the movies and sitting in the dark. No one could bother her there. PG: You also can\u2019t criticize your parents the way we civilians can. The first time I was really aware of Barbara was when you made that P. S. A. for gay marriage. There was a firestorm about your falling out with your father. BB: I didn\u2019t realize how much attention that would get. Whoopi Goldberg had done one. And Julianne Moore. They had about 70 views. I didn\u2019t think mine was going to get many more. But, of course, it did. Because the narrative was that I was breaking with my father. But I had talked to my dad about doing it, and he was very supportive. What surprised me were all the people who said: \u201cHow brave! Betraying your family like that. \u201d But my parents raised us to use our voices for issues we care about, and I feel strongly about marriage equality. The only brave thing is that I\u2019m shy. That was the win: I used my voice. PG: It was your media debut. Meanwhile, everyone alive must know about Cecile\u2019s marathon testimony before Congress last year over the battle to defund Planned Parenthood. Five hours! Lots of coffee or tranquilizers  \u2014   or both? CR: They don\u2019t let you do anything. You just sit there, at the pleasure of Congress, while they go in and out, taking breaks and talking in the hallways. I had no idea that it was going to be   on television, or that so many people would watch. I still have people come up to me on the subway and say they watched all five hours. PG: I couldn\u2019t believe how rude the congressmen were. In a weird way, did they do you and Planned Parenthood a favor? CR: I think millions of people were exposed to the   of health care, and the aggressive attitudes toward women, the disrespect. It happened to be me, but it could have been any woman. There was a real lack of empathy for what women go through to access health care. PG: Did you walk out of the room thinking, \u201cI just knocked it out of the park\u201d? CR: Oh, no. It was more like: I just survived an endurance test. Later, I read a text from one of my twins, Daniel, who wrote: \u201cMom, I\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re doing a great job. And I think raising me really prepared you for this hearing today. \u201d BB: That\u2019s so sweet. PG: It also brings us to your great commonality: women\u2019s and global health. With your connections, I bet you could do anything you want. What led you to health care? The last I knew, Barbara was doing an internship at Proenza Schouler. BB: I still love them and would work for them still. PG: I remember an interview with your mother, Laura Bush, who sounded slightly apologetic that you were taking so long to land on a career. And you were only 25. CR: So, we share that, too: mothers who had high expectations for us. It\u2019s a lot. BB: I still don\u2019t know what my end goal is going to be. CR: Can I say how impressive Barbara is? It\u2019s one thing to work at a    organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it\u2019s another to say: \u201cI see a problem, and I\u2019m going to start an organization to fix it. \u201d BB: Since I was born, in 1981, we\u2019ve had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year. Yet the number of deaths hasn\u2019t dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken. CR: All my life, I\u2019ve been lucky to work in social justice, starting as a labor organizer working with   working women. They\u2019re the same ones we see at Planned Parenthood now: women trying to raise their kids, many of them single moms, working two jobs. And if you don\u2019t have access to health care, women will put their health after everyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s like dinner was in Texas: Women took the chicken legs after everyone else had eaten. Women will go without cancer screenings or family planning, which causes unintended pregnancies. Barbara knows this from global health: If women are healthy, their families are healthy, their communities are healthy. It\u2019s one of the most powerful ways to make social change. BB: Thanks to my parents, I got lots of exposure. I traveled with them when they launched Pepfar, an amazing program that saves the lives of people with H. I. V. around the world. At that time, if you were H. I. V. positive in the United States, it was just another chronic illness. But in a developing country, it was a death sentence. I met people who were mourning the deaths of their children and sisters, because they didn\u2019t have access to drugs that exist. That blew my mind. We have the tools to solve these problems. We just need to use them more effectively. CR: It\u2019s the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it\u2019s not enough unless there\u2019s public policy that supports getting women access to care. PG: I can\u2019t imagine anyone in America disagreeing with the idea that we should all have health care. So, why is this conversation so poisonous? CR: There\u2019s a total disconnect between political rhetoric and where the American people are. They believe folks should have access to health care and family planning. They believe young people should have sex education. No parent wants their child to get an infection, or get pregnant before they\u2019re ready. We\u2019re at a   low for unintended pregnancy in America. In any other moment, folks would go: \u201cWow! Let\u2019s do more of that. It\u2019s good for women and saves money. \u201d But the political environment is tough right now. BB: It\u2019s crazy, and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue, because it\u2019s not a polarizing space. As a human, I hope everyone is healthy. And what happens in other places matters here. We saw that with Ebola. Everyone started paying attention when it seemed like it might impact us. But diseases don\u2019t respect international borders. PG: Do you see big roles for storytelling and empathy? CR: So much shame has been placed on women, for having sex or using birth control or choosing to end a pregnancy. When women tell their stories, it makes a big difference. We learned that from the L. G. B. T. community, in terms of knowing people. Women come up to me all the time and thank me for telling my story, and sometimes they tell me theirs. But I was with three women in Pennsylvania, where they were trying to pass an outrageous, restrictive bill on abortions. These women desperately wanted their pregnancies, but learned at 20 weeks about severe fetal abnormalities. And here they were at a press conference, sharing their anguish in front of clicking cameras. I had two thoughts: What bravery. Then, why should they have to bare their souls? I see empathy every day, but I\u2019m sorry that women still have to share their most personal stories. PG: The   millennials play big roles in both your organizations. BB: We think millennials are great. So many young people want to work on social change. They want to do good. Global Health started because this great talent pipeline was not moving into health care. It\u2019s hard to know how you fit in if you\u2019re not a doctor or nurse. If we can demystify that and create channels into Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations, then we\u2019ll have an army of people working to solve health problems. CR: Ten years ago, when I came to Planned Parenthood, I met these young kids who were called \u201cpeer educators. \u201d They provided sex education in schools and talked to their principals about access to health care. They were in every town. I thought, \u201cWhat you really are is leaders. \u201d And the great thing about bringing in thousands of young people to an organization is they begin to change it. One of the things I\u2019m proud of at Planned Parenthood is the number of health centers providing trans care, which was largely driven by young activists. BB: I didn\u2019t know what was in front of me when we were starting Global Health Corps. We didn\u2019t even know if anyone would apply. We could never have predicted that a few years in, we\u2019d have gotten to work with 600 amazing young people, 97 percent of whom stay in global health or social justice issues related to it. Our challenge is to keep growing as responsibly as we can. But we see a huge demand. CR: My biggest hope is that we can take partisanship out of this arena. Not to get too political, but we have Republican patients and staff members and board members. The need for health care doesn\u2019t come with a party label. Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman who has health insurance gets birth control at no cost. That\u2019s 55 million women. We don\u2019t have to invent a new kind of birth control. We just have to close the lid between needing it and delivering it. And I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re on the cusp of making that happen. BB: You\u2019ve got to be an optimist. PG: Let\u2019s end with Nina Tassler\u2019s book, \u201cWhat I Told My Daughter. \u201d Cecile wrote an essay, and Barbara is the subject of her mom\u2019s essay. So, what would you tell young women on the road to empowerment? CR: My mom used to say she saw too many young women passing up opportunities because they were afraid of failing. Her message to me was: \u201cThis is the only life you get. Take every chance and run with it  \u2014   even if it doesn\u2019t work out. \u201d BB: When I was thinking about starting Global Health, but afraid I wasn\u2019t ready, my mom said: \u201cYou\u2019re in another job, but always talking about Global Health. Are you going to be happy leaving this on your   list forever?\u201d It\u2019s the same with young fellows I speak with. They\u2019re worried about taking the \u201cright\u201d next step at the \u201cright\u201d time. But there\u2019s never a right time. Who knows where life is going to take us? CR: Exactly. Just do it. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?'"}, "time": 1742561754.6153579}
