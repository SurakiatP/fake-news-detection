[The move to suspend campaigning follows the form established after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox during the independence referendum campaign in 2016 when all major parties announced they would cancel events out of respect.  A similar suspension took place during the recent French presidential election campaign after three French police officers were shot, one fatally, in central Paris in a suspected terror attack days before the vote. Fifteen full days remain until the polls open for Britain\u2019s general election. Speaking after last night\u2019s attack, British Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader Theresa May said: \u201cWe are working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. \u201d In a statement, the prime minister said: \u201cI\u2019d like to pay tribute to the emergency services who have worked throughout the night professionally and effectively  \u2014   they have done an excellent job. \u201cLater on this morning, I will be attending Cobra, chaired by the Prime Minister, to collect more information  \u2014   to find out more  \u2014   about this particular attack, and I can\u2019t comment any more on that at the moment. \u201cThe public should remain alert but not alarmed. If they have anything to report, they should approach the police. But I have two further things to add. The great city of Manchester has been affected by terrorism before. Its spirit was not bowed its community continued. \u201cThis time it has been a particular attack on the most vulnerable in our society  \u2014   its intention was to sow fear  \u2014   its intention is to divide. But it will not succeed. \u201d Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said \u201cthe whole country will grieve\u201d after the attack and had agreed to suspend nationwide campaigning \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall joined others in releasing a statement assuring \u201cprayers and thoughts\u201d for those affected and declaring a suspension of campaigning.
