Long before the man\u2019s name was widely known, another passenger on the flight on Sunday said that he had complained of being singled out because he was Chinese. The passenger, Dr. David Dao, was later identified publicly by his lawyers. By Wednesday morning, the hashtag \u201cUnited forcibly removes passenger from plane\u201d was the most popular topic on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter, garnering more than 550 million views and more than 240, 000 comments. Many Chinese social media users accused United of racism, while others called for a boycott. The outrage was furious and sustained over the passenger\u2019s being dragged from his seat by security officers after refusing to be bumped from an overbooked flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. The episode was prominently displayed across the Chinese news media on Tuesday. CCTV, the state broadcaster, showed photographs of the passenger\u2019s bloodied face above the word \u201cSavage!\u201d People\u2019s Daily, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s flagship newspaper, scolded United for initially failing to condemn the man\u2019s treatment. United has said that the passenger and three others were selected to be removed from the flight after no one accepted the offer of a voucher to leave voluntarily. The other three passengers left without incident, the airline said. United\u2019s chief executive, Oscar Munoz, apologized Monday for \u201chaving to   these customers,\u201d called the episode \u201cupsetting\u201d and said the airline was conducting a review. On Tuesday Mr. Munoz went a step further. In a statement he offered his \u201cdeepest apologies,\u201d adding, \u201cNo one should ever be mistreated this way. \u201d Mr. Munoz continued, \u201cI want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right. \u201d The controversy threatened to hurt United\u2019s revenue in China, where the airline began flying in 1986 and has steadily built a loyal customer base. As of last May, United had 96 departures a week to cities in mainland China and Hong Kong. Wang Guanxiong, 40, an angel investor in the technology industry in Beijing who travels frequently to Silicon Valley, said he would never fly on United again. \u201cWhy did they choose an Asian out of so many passengers?\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cObviously Asians are the minorities. \u201d People\u2019s Daily said it was \u201cgravely disappointing\u201d that the airline had \u201cmentioned nothing of the violence against the Asian passenger. \u201d The Chinese news media often highlights episodes of violence and racism directed at people of Chinese descent overseas as evidence of what it considers the hypocrisy of Western democracies on human rights issues. Some of the online discussions took on political overtones, with commentators saying the incident exposed deeper problems in American society. \u201cWhere are the human rights the democratic countries have been advocating?\u201d a Weibo user wrote. Others said the episode showed that people of Chinese descent in the United States faced rampant discrimination. \u201cIn the United States, Asians are often discriminated against,\u201d one Weibo user wrote. \u201cIf it were a Muslim or black person, they wouldn\u2019t have acted this way. \u201d Zhang Zishi, a student from the coastal province of Shandong who lives in Britain, started a petition on the website of the White House calling for a federal investigation into the case, using the hashtag #ChineseLivesMatters. By Tuesday evening the petition had exceeded its goal of attaining 100, 000 signatures. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from the media that there is a lot of racism in the United States,\u201d Mr. Zhang, 18, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI feel that Chinese people are treated unfairly. \u201d Joe Wong, a popular   comedian, was among those urging a boycott of United Airlines. \u201cMany Chinese who have faced discrimination are unwilling to speak out because of their pride,\u201d Mr. Wong wrote on Weibo. \u201cBecause of this attitude, neither mainstream Western media nor the public pays much attention to discrimination against Asians. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562152.8055873}
