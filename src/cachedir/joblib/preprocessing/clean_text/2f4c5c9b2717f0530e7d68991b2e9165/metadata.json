[\u201cNow did not enforcing the red line hurt us diplomatically?\u201d Harf said at a discussion at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D. C. \u201cAbsolutely. \u201d  Harf, who was a spokesperson for Secretary of State John Kerry, said that decision also hurt Barack Obama politically. \u201cDid it give some people the notion that they used politically that we were unwilling to use military action   \u2026     absolutely,\u201d Harf said, noting that Obama\u2019s decision also was affected by the lack of support for such strikes by his fellow Democrats. Michael Pregent, adjunct fellow at Hudson, said that the strike on Assad\u2019s military assets ordered by President Donald Trump after the April 4 chemical attack that killed scores of innocent people, including children, was Trump\u2019s most significant foreign policy win since taking office. Assad denied  \u2014   as he has repeatedly done over the course of the more than   civil war  \u2014   that he was responsible for the attack. But the U. S. has claimed it is certain Assad did carry out the attack. \u201cLast week, Bashar  \u2019s regime killed even more of its own people using chemical weapons,\u201d Tillerson said in the days following the attack. \u201cOur missile strike in response to his repeated use of banned weapons was necessary as a matter of U. S. national security interest. \u201d \u201cWe do not want the regime\u2019s uncontrolled stockpile of chemical weapons to fall into the hands of ISIS or other terrorist groups who could, and want to, attack the United States or our allies,\u201d Tillerson said. The latest development in Syria is a plan brokered by Russia, Turkey, and Iran that would establish four \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria designed to protect innocent Syrians. But participants in the Hudson discussion said it is unclear whether those safe zones would not ultimately help the Assad regime.'"}, "time": 1742628305.9407918}
