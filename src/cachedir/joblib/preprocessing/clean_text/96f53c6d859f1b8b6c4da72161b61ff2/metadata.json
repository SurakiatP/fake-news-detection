People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged. The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . As it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today\u2019s Drudge Report . But don\u2019t worry. These are just \u201cglitches\u201d or \u201ctoo few to make a difference.\u201d 1) Chicago In the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they\u2019ve reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn\u2019t the worst of it \u2013 not only are these people on the rolls \u2013 they\u2019ve repeatedly voted since their deaths. Don\u2019t worry, though. It\u2019s just a few hundred dead voters that they\u2019ve been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia Chicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed \u201cactive voters\u201d for many years since their deaths. Don\u2019t worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply \u201chuman error\u201d and that there aren\u2019t enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland A woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of \u201cvote flipping.\u201d She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. Don\u2019t worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would \u201cundo\u201d the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida Two women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. Don\u2019t worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fern\u00e1ndez Rundle, a Democrat, \u201cAnyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.\u201d ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia A guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. But don\u2019t worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, \u201cSince the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.\u201d ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas Much like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence. Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. But don\u2019t worry. Election officials in the state say it\u2019s not a problem with the equipment. It\u2019s just those silly voters who don\u2019t know how to use it. \u201c\u201cTypically, we\u2019ve found it\u2019s voter error with the equipment. Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates \u2026 or do something with the wheel\u2026.There is not an issue with the equipment.\u201d ( source ) If you\u2019re worried about election fraud\u2026 You can add a smartphone app by True the Vote called VoteStand to report incidents of fraud. Don\u2019t let anything slide. If you are voting, make sure your choice is accurately recorded. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review'"}, "time": 1742562467.0820684}
