BALL: And he\u2019s not using those words in the speech. I today a very important decision has been made by the administration about what kind of President Trump will be to the Muslim world, and it\u2019s not candidate Trump. It goes to the security and decisions and appointments we have seen the White House make on the traditional hawkish side of the Republican party rather than the more isolationist or transactional   ideology he espoused on the campaign. It\u2019s a traditional play to say we\u2019re looking for areas of cooperation. We\u2019re not judging on the basis of religion. That was not candidate Trump at all.
