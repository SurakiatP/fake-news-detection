The place is dead \u2013 no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. \\n\u201cI\u2019m making less than \u20ac60 (\u00a353) a day. A few more weeks like this and I\u2019ll go bust! \\n\u201cFrench people have been kind to them. I know they\u2019re desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.\u201d \\nJeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. \\nShe said: \u201cBrazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by\u2013they\u2019re even stealing bread. I\u2019ve seen them beat people up too.\u201d \\nPolice have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. \\nBut within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. \\nFurious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard \u201cblood-curdling noises\u201d coming from it in the middle of the night. \\nMarie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: \u201cLife here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they\u2019re back. And now that the \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.\u201d \\nAnother local, Monique, said that she was at \u201ca loss for words\u201d and \u201cutterly distraught\u201d over the situation. \\nShe said: \u201cThe streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night.'"}, "time": 1742628344.6496859}
