From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. \\nPresident Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. \\nVideo of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesn\u2019t believe in the possibility: \\n\u201cWell, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that we\u2019ve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too. You know, whenever people are in power, they\u2019re \u2014 you know, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction.\u201d \\nWatch above. \\nThe Freedom Center is a 501c3 non-profit organization. Therefore we do not endorse political candidates either in primary or general elections. However, as defenders of America\u2019s social contract, we insist that the rules laid down by both parties at the outset of campaigns be respected, and that the results be decided by free elections. We will oppose any attempt to rig the system and deny voters of either party their constitutional right to elect candidates of their choice.'"}, "time": 1742628383.1198237}
