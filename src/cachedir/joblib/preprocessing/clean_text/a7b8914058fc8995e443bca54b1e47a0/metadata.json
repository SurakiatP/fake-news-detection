[The parade had been overshadowed for months by the parade committee\u2019s decision to honor L\u00f3pez Rivera, a key member of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) in the seventies and eighties, who fought for Puerto Rican independence. The group conducted more than 100 bombings in the United States, killing five people, injuring dozens, and causing millions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage. L\u00f3pez Rivera was convicted.  President Obama commuted L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s sentence, and he was released this year after serving 35 years for transporting guns and bomb materials. The committee\u2019s decision to honor the militant as a \u201cnational freedom hero\u201d led a wealth of sponsors,  including   the New York Yankees, and Univisi\u00f3n, to pull out, along with NYPD and FDNY officials and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. L\u00f3pez Rivera, who has denied being a terrorist, eventually said he would forgo the honor but would march as a \u201chumble Puerto Rican and grandfather. \u201d But the New York Daily News  reported that, while some at the parade cheered L\u00f3pez Rivera and held signs calling him \u201cour Mandela,\u201d others booed and jeered the convicted terrorist. According to the paper, one Bronx resident yelled, \u201cFuck Oscar! Fuck him! He\u2019s no hero!\u201d as the   leader passed. Nearby cops reportedly shook their heads in agreement. Several cops gave L\u00f3pez Rivera and Democratic City Council Speaker Melissa   who was on the float with him,  \u201csour looks,\u201d according to the Daily News. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I wasn\u2019t working. We gotta do our jobs, man,\u201d said one officer. \u201cThis really pisses me off,\u201d Bronx resident Mark Rivera told the New York Post. \u201cThis is a day for honoring the Republic of Puerto Rico, not honoring a terrorist. This man has no place in our parade. He makes me ashamed to be a Puerto Rican. \u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
