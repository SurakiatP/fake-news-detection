[\u201cFor millions of creators, making videos on YouTube isn\u2019t just a creative outlet, it\u2019s a source of income  \u2026     Today, more creators are making a living on YouTube than ever before,\u201d declared YouTube in the official blog post. \u201cHowever, with this growth we\u2019ve started seeing cases of abuse where great, original content is   by others who try to earn revenue from it. \u201d  \u201cStarting today, we will no longer serve ads on YPP [YouTube Partner Program] videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views,\u201d they continued. \u201cThis new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10k views up until today will not be impacted. \u201d \u201cIn a few weeks, we\u2019ll also be adding a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program. After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we\u2019ll review their activity against our policies,\u201d the company concluded. \u201cIf everything looks good, we\u2019ll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules. \u201d The move appears to be a part of YouTube\u2019s response to   withdrawal from the site and an attempt to bring companies back to the platform.'"}, "time": 1742562768.5910127}
