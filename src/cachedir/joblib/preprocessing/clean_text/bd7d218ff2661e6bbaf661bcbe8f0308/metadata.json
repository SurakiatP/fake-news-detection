But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the \u201cfeverish\u201d state of international relations and lamented: \u201cMy personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.\u201d He complained about \u201cpeople in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice\u201d and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a \u201ccommon front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\u201d\\nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, \u201cMy good friend John Kerry \u2026 is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry\u2019s] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.\u201d\\nDo not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire \u2014 not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals \u2014 were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.\\nRelations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft \u2014 including any stealth aircraft \u2014 over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft.\\nIt seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course \u2014 perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft \u2026 if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.\u201d\\nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia\u2019s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft.\\nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing \u201ca persistent rotational armored brigade combat team\u201d as a \u201cmajor sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.\u201d\\n\u201cThis was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,\u201d he explained, referring to NATO\u2019s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. \u201cThe United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.\u201d\\nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the \u201cmyth\u201d of a \u201cRussian military threat,\u201d calling this a \u201cprofitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets \u2026 expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.\u201d\\nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia\u2019s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against \u201csaber-rattling,\u201d adding that, \u201cWe are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\u201d\\nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia\u2019s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by \u201cmainstream\u201d media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which \u201cYats\u201d (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington\u2019s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev.\\nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, \u201creally the most blatant coup in history.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia.
