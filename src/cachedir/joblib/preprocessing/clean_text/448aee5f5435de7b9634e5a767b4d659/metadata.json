Comey\u2019s letter was almost immediately leaked by Congressman and self-appointed Clinton inquisitor Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and the dominoes began to fall in Trump\u2019s favor. Clinton\u2019s polling numbers began to sink, and the negativity surrounding the allegations of various sex crimes committed by Trump began to dissipate as the nation\u2019s perpetually wandering attention returned to the ersatz email \u201ccontroversy\u2019. \\nOne FBI agent said that Clinton is viewed as \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel\u201d which is why the information about Clinton has been timed to coincide with the election, \u201cthey\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d \\nHowever, not all of the information coming out of the FBI is entirely anti-Clinton. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and former Putinist operative Paul Manafort, is also said to have an active investigation open against him and that the investigation is in its early stages. \\nA former FBI official has a different take on the matter and said, \u201cThere are lots of people who don\u2019t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it\u2019s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician.\u201d \\nThe content of the newly discovered emails, if they even exist at all, are unknown as Comey wrote his letter to Congress before the FBI acquired a warrant to read the emails. This is further evidence of the FBI\u2019s bias against Clinton as the FBI exists to investigate facts rather than spreading propagandistic rumor \u2014 particularly weeks before a presidential election which many have said is a clear violation of the Hatch Act which was enacted to prevent individuals like Comey from using the power of their office to engage in partisan political activities. \\nRudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, hinted towards these actions by the FBI against Clinton two days before they transpired . He said, \u201cI think he\u2019s (Trump) got a surprise or two that you\u2019re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, I\u2019m talking about some pretty big surprises.\u201d Now would Giuliani know the FBI was going to write a vague letter which would shake up the presidential election unless the FBI had already decided to take the action and time the release of the letter specifically to damage Clinton? \\nThe Director of the FBI is a position that can only be appointed by a sitting president, and the director is given a 10-year term. The concern is due to the FBI\u2019s bias against Clinton, and the likelihood of her victory, it would appear all but impossible that James Comey would be capable of fulfilling his duties. The president has the discretion to unilaterally fire an FBI Director. The Congressional Research Service found \u201cthere are no statutory conditions on the President\u2019s authority to remove the FBI director.\u201d If Clinton is able to beat back the FBI\u2019s last-minute attempts to influence the election, it is all but assured that she will fire Comey on her first day in the Oval Office.
