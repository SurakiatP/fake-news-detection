[Urban Myths: A Brand New Collection of Comedies consists of eight episodes featuring some of the most legendary tall tales about celebrities. In the Michael Jackson episode, Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor (Stockard Channing) and Marlon Brando (Brian Cox) take a   road trip after the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Other episodes reportedly tackle     stories about Cary Grant, Bob Dylan, Muhammad Ali, Alice Cooper, Samuel Beckett, the Sex Pistols and even a young Adolf Hitler. Fiennes\u2019 casting as Jackson drew intense criticism when it was announced last year. The actor later defended the role in an interview with the Associated Press, though he said he was as \u201cshocked\u201d as anyone to have been casted in the part. \u201cI deal in imagination, so I don\u2019t think imagination should have rules stamped on them,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cIf it promotes stereotyping, then it\u2019s wrong. I made a distinction that the Jackson project doesn\u2019t do that. \u201d The release of the trailer has done nothing to quell the criticism, judging from the reaction on social media Wednesday. I hope it loses every single dime of its budget. Every single dime. #UrbanMyths https:  .   \u2014   Keith Powell (@KeithPowell) January 11, 2017,  They have Joseph Fiennes playing Michael Jackson. Maybe Tom Hanks will play Berry Gordy in the next Motown movie.  \u2014   Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) January 10, 2017,  I. CAN\u2019T. UNSEE. THIS. https:  .   \u2014   janewells (@janewells) January 11, 2017,  I woke up feeling like it\u2019s going to be a beautiful day and then I remembered this is someone\u2019s idea of Michael Jackson: pic. twitter.   \u2014   Soledad O\u2019Brien (@soledadobrien) January 11, 2017,  IDGAF how pale Michael Jackson became. He was B L A C K and he said HIMSELF he didn\u2019t want a Caucasian to play him in ANY film. Disrespect,  \u2014   Stoney \u03a3avage\ud83c\udffe\ud83c\udf19 (@Stoney_Blu) January 11, 2017,  Okay? But why does Joseph Fiennes as MJ look like the scarecrow you\u2019d find at the edge of a pumpkin patch!?  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Rosalina Watson \u2020 (@AboutRosalina) January 11, 2017,  Urban Myths is due to premiere January 19.
