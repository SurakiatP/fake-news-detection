Average premiums will increase between $50 and $300 per month. Christmas came early for the insurance companies in 2010 when Barack Obama and the Democrats rammed through this give-away to his pals after he took single-payer insurance off the table.

Are we supposed to be surprised that premiums will increase astronomically?\\nEven after this idiotic scheme was implemented there still 20 million people in the US without health insurance. Hillary Clinton's plan to fix this disaster is to issue tax credits for the uninsured to buy Obamacare. She mentioned no alternative for those who had no income. Obviously, tax credits would not help them.\\nMeanwhile, the Green Party is the only political party in the US that proposes single-payer health care in the form of improved Medicare for everyone.\\nhttp://www.wsws.org/en/article...\""}, "time": 1742563876.7767563}
