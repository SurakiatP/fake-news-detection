She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she\u2019s a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn\u2019t win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? \\nOkay, let\u2019s address this \u201cHillary might win the popular vote, isn\u2019t that Electoral College situation just awful\u201d thing head on. \\nNo, it\u2019s not awful. It\u2019s great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It\u2019s also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. \\nFirst of all, she\u2019s probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. \\nStates don\u2019t count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn\u2019t influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren\u2019t counted. \\nWho votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore \u201cwon\u201d the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California\u2019s uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore\u2019s 500,000 popular vote \u201cvictory.\u201d (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You\u2019re kidding.) \\nGetting back to the \u201cwin the popular vote/lose the Electoral College\u201d scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. \\nBut the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. \\nShortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country\u2019s entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. \u2013 American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!'"}, "time": 1742564393.8113346}
