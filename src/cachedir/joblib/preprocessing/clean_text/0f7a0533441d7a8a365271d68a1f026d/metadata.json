[After Kelly\u2019s controversial and   interview with Alex Jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 Minutes and America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos, New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday that NBC is trying to unload Kelly and convince Fox News to take her back.  But a   Fox News source told Breitbart News that there is \u201cno way\u201d Kelly could come back to the network. Quite simply, the source told Breitbart News, Kelly \u201cwould not be welcomed back. \u201d Inside scoop:  NBC now trying to get rid of Megyn Kelly. Even trying to get FOX to buy out her contract and take her back.  \u2014   MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19, 2017,  Simone also suggested that if Kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more, \u201cNBC will have to take her off the network,\u201d and \u201cif they are stuck with her, they\u2019ll give her an MSNBC show. \u201d NBC will have to take her off the network  \u2014   if they are stuck with her, they\u2019ll give her an MSNBC show,  \u2014   MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19, 2017,  Before she bolted to NBC, Kelly anchored The Kelly File on Fox News. During the 2016 election cycle, Kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the first Republican presidential debate in August of 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio. She also gave \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam Trump throughout the election cycle. And as the Daily Beast\u2019s Lloyd Grove noted, Kelly also \u201chastened [Roger] Ailes\u2019 forced resignation last July with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st Century Fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. \u201d New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman reported that Kelly \u201ctold investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. \u201d As Grove pointed out, Kelly, in her book, said there was some \u201cpoetic justice\u201d in the role she played in helping boot Ailes out of Fox News. \u201cI worked my tail off  \u2026     I established myself as a serious person,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cI built my own power. And when the allegations against Roger hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. \u201d NBC reportedly invested nearly $20 million a year to bring Kelly to the network, and NBC\u2019s investment has not paid any dividends at all. After her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. And when HuffPost obtained the full unedited interview in which a \u201cnervous\u201d Kelly lobbed Putin \u201csoftballs,\u201d Kelly was subjected to another round of criticism. Her interview with Jones did not have any news value and may have damaged NBC\u2019s and her reputation more than it helped. Advertisers like J. P. Morgan Chase fled while Kelly lost credibility in the eyes of many when, in a leaked recording that Jones released, Kelly is heard telling Jones, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. \u201d NBC did not help matters when it released a photo of Kelly and Jones that, as The Hill\u2019s media columnist Joe Concha described, looked \u201clike they were on a Tinder date pulling up to a  . \u201d Yet despite all of the hype, Kelly\u2019s interview with Jones still flopped. 60 Minutes and America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos reruns even beat Kelly\u2019s show by nearly 40 percent in the coveted 18 to    demographic, as Concha noted. A television executive told CNN over the weekend that NBC\u2019s \u201cfundamental mistake\u201d was thinking that Kelly was actually a \u201csuperstar. \u201d NBC executives have already reportedly determined that viewers are not going to tune in to Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly just to watch Kelly and are \u201cfreaking out\u201d over the \u201cratings disaster\u201d that is Kelly.'"}, "time": 1742561646.9931798}
