In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the university\u2019s affirmative action system in a 4-3 vote after it was challenged by a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who was denied admission. Fisher argued she was passed over by UT while less qualified minority students were not. \\nThe university considered the Supreme Court decision \u2014 which gives a small boost in admission to black and Hispanic students \u2014 a win. As of 2015, however, black students only made up 3.9 percent of the student population. During the protest, UT student body president Kevin Helgren said the campus has a long way to go in terms of inclusivity and diversity. \\n\u201cInstitutionalized racism exists and affirmative action helps to combat that,\u201d Helgren said during the protest. \u201cThe act of putting financial values on groups of people based on their gender or on their race, in my opinion, is a really prominent way to engage in racism in 2016.\u201d \\nOn the young conservatives\u2019 Facebook event page, the group wrote: \u201cYCT is a truly colorblind organization and believes that all government institutions are constitutionally prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race in all circumstances, including affirmative action.\u201d \\nChristopher Shafik, a 19-year-old member of the young conservatives group, said \u201cpeople assume that because we are in a position against affirmative action that we\u2019re racist.\u201d He said the opposite is true, and that the organization must work to change its image on campus.
