Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. A closer look at the numbers reveals a very sobering reality. Yes, Donald Trump won far more electoral votes than Hillary Clinton did, and that means that he is on track to become our next president . But Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote, and it is likely to be by a very wide margin once all the votes are counted. \\nAs I write this article, Hillary Clinton has a lead of 218,000 in the popular vote, but most of the votes that have not been counted are on the west coast. \\nIn California, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by a 5,482,166 to 2,966,654 margin, and only 68 percent of the vote has been counted so far. So assuming that the ratio stays about the same the rest of the way, Clinton is going to add at least a million more votes to her lead just from the state of California. \\nUp in Washington state, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by more than 370,000 votes, and only 60 percent of the vote has been counted there so far. So she could easily pick up another 200,000 votes in that state. \\nWhen everything is all said and done, it seems very likely that Hillary Clinton will have received well over a million more votes than Donald Trump did in this election. \\nSo the truth is that the American people chose Hillary Clinton, but because of some electoral college magic Donald Trump is the winner of the election. \\nAnd I am certainly very, very happy that Hillary Clinton is not going to be our next president. Four years under her \u201cleadership\u201d would have likely been the final nail in the coffin for our nation. My hope is that she will now disappear from national politics for good. \\nBut just because she is not going to be our next president does not mean that we passed the test. \\nIn this election, the American people were faced with a very stark choice. Hillary Clinton is the most wicked politician that our country has ever seen, and over the past three decades the American people have gotten to know exactly who she is and what she stands for. \\nAnd despite knowing exactly what they would be getting, more Americans voted for her than voted for Donald Trump. \\nIf every vote counted equally, she would be our next president. \\nI certainly don\u2019t mean to rain on the Trump parade. Christians, conservatives and patriots are right to celebrate this victory by Donald Trump. But the truth is that I don\u2019t believe that we did actually pass the test that we were faced with. \\nAs a nation, we willingly chose Hillary Clinton by a pretty substantial margin. \\nAnd don\u2019t think that the radical left is going to forget that Trump lost the popular vote. Already, violence and protests have erupted all over the nation. \\nShortly after Trump declared victory, riots broke out in Berkeley, San Jose and Oakland \u2026 \\n\u201cNot my president! Not my president!\u201d chanted anti-Trump rioters in Berkley, California as they light flares and storm the streets. \\nRiots erupted in Berkley, San Jose and Oakland shortly after the announcement of Donald Trump as president-elect. Rioters are breaking into stores, vandalizing cars and shooting flares. \\nOne woman in Oakland was hit by a car on Highway 24 just after midnight and has suffered serious injuries after. When she pulled over to the right shoulder, she was surrounded by anti-Trump rioters, who vandalized her car and broke the back window, according to CHP officers. \\nThere were reports of protesters burning American flags in some areas of the country, and there were even brawls outside of the White House . \\nAnd once the sun set on Wednesday night, the protests started again. According to USA Today , \u201cthousands of demonstrators\u201d have hit the streets in New York City\u2026 \\nIn New York, thousands of demonstrators blocked off streets around Trump Tower near the busy intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, chanting \u201chey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go\u201d and \u201cp\u2014y grabs back,\u201d a reference to tape of a Trump conversation from years back in which he One woman protester was topless while another climbed on top of a tree to see the activity. Taxis, city buses and passenger vehicles stood at a standstill. \\nIn Boston, radical leftists were organizing a giant protest against Trump \u2026 \\nFar-left organizers are planning a mass protest in Boston against President-elect Donald Trump, citing the need to \u201cimmediately start fighting against him.\u201d \\nApproximately 2,300 people have indicated they will gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston tonight for a \u201cBoston Against Trump Rally.\u201d According to the Facebook event page, another 5,000 people say they may be interested in attending. \\n\u201cDonald Trump is the next President of the United States. We need to immediately start fighting against him. We need to build a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia,\u201d the event description says. \\nSadly, this could be the beginning of a new era of protests, rioting and civil unrest. \\nInstead of coming together behind the new president, the radical left seems ready to go to war. \\nSo even though Trump won the election, the truth is that our troubles may only just be starting. More than half the country didn\u2019t want Trump, our nation was already more divided than it has been in decades before he won, and it won\u2019t take much for many of our big cities to descend into utter chaos. \\nWithout a doubt, we should be very excited that Donald Trump won the election, but an election victory is not going to magically make our problems go away. \\nWhen faced with the most monumental election in any of our lifetimes, Hillary Clinton received the most votes from the American people, and the consequences for that decision may be far more severe than most people are now anticipating. \\nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream.
