Trump in his first days in office. \u201cAny foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, adding, \u201cThe Russians are not our friends. \u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s support for investigating American intelligence findings that Moscow intervened in the election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf could presage friction between the Republicans who control Congress, and who have long taken a hard line against Russia, and the   who has mocked the findings. Mr. McConnell also went out of his way to address Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the C. I. A. could not be trusted because of flawed intelligence before the Iraq war. \u201cLet me say that I have the highest confidence in the intelligence community,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cand especially the Central Intelligence Agency. The C. I. A. is filled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people. \u201d The top Republican in the House, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said he supported a continuing investigation by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In a statement, Mr. Ryan said: \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, any foreign intervention in our elections is entirely unacceptable. And any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests. \u201d Congressional Republicans announced their support for inquiries after Mr. Trump railed for much of the weekend against the intelligence findings. But their remarks, especially Mr. Ryan\u2019s, were far from fiery, reflecting both a fear of offending Mr. Trump, who has taken many positions against traditional Republican orthodoxy, and the Republicans\u2019 belief that Democrats have selectively leaked intelligence information for political gain. Critics from both parties are questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent choice of Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, as secretary of state, particularly because of his longstanding business connections with Russia and his close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin, whom he has known for two decades. Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday night that he would make a formal announcement on the job on Tuesday morning. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, both Republicans, have expressed concern about the reports of cyberattacks, as have numerous Democrats. But Mr. Rubio, in an apparent reference to Mr. Tillerson, went a step further on Monday, writing on Twitter, \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState. \u201d Mr. McConnell said the Senate investigation would be led by Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will add a subcommittee to look into cyberattacks, led by Mr. Graham. \u201cThe first thing we want to establish is, \u2018Did the Russians hack into our political system? \u2019\u201d Mr. Graham said in an interview on Monday. \u201cThen you work outward from there. I have a high degree of confidence Russia did this. \u201d Mr. Nunes, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said in a statement that the Intelligence Committee had been \u201cconducting vigorous oversight of the investigations into   cyberattacks. \u201d Mr. Nunes also noted that his committee would be scrutinizing the review of the Russian effort to influence the election ordered last week by President Obama. Democrats have used the latest intelligence findings to renew their calls for an urgent inquiry. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, demanded on Monday that all information about Russia\u2019s meddling be declassified, and that the Obama administration explain what it knows about the hacking and when it knew it. \u201cWe now know that the C. I. A. has determined Russia\u2019s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. \u201cThis should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. \u201d Three Senate Democrats  \u2014   Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont  \u2014   called on Monday for the creation of an independent, nonpartisan commission to comprehensively investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of calling for a special select committee, saying that the Senate Intelligence Committee was \u201cmore than capable of conducting a complete review\u201d of the matter. While he stopped short of saying whether he agreed that Russia had interfered in the election in support of Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said, \u201cWe need to approach all these on the assumption the Russians do not wish us well. \u201d Mr. McCain was less equivocal, saying Monday that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking\u201d by Russian intelligence services. He called the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and related accounts \u201canother form of warfare\u201d in an appearance on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. And one week before the Electoral College meets to ratify Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, 10 electors have demanded their own intelligence briefing on Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump. For his part, Mr. Trump was dismissive of the intelligence findings and suggested that Democrats were simply stirring controversy. \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the   card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that the administration would support a congressional review. He also rejected the notion that the administration had failed to adequately highlight the Russian efforts before the election, saying it had extensively briefed Congress all year about Russian electoral meddling. \u201cThere has been intensive cooperation between the intelligence community and other national security agencies, and members of Congress in both parties, both before and after the election,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThe briefings have been provided in a variety of settings, both classified and unclassified. \u201d Even beyond the conclusions of the intelligence community, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had widely known and extensive ties to the Russian government. A campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had worked for the   government in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, had consulted for a   media group, Mr. Earnest noted. Mr. Earnest said that Congress had a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, because those connections were widely known before the election. He added that, for Capitol Hill Republicans, how to \u201creconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is something they\u2019re going to have to explain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628606.9835825}
