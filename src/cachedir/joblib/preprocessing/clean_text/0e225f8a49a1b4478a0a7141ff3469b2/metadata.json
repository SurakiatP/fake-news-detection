The administration must seriously put a plan into action to de-gender its facilities,\u201d the message declares. \u201cIn the meantime, maybe they will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on the campus they pay tuition to every single day.\u201d \\n\\nAlthough the objectives of Divest UMass are not directly related to those being pursued by GLU, but leaders of the Divest group explained their interest in the \u201cshit-in\u201d by asserting that all progressive causes are interrelated, saying, \u201cThere can be no climate justice without gender justice. There can no be gender justice without racial justice. There can no be racial justice without economic justice. There can be no economic justice without social justice.\u201d \\n\\nWithin a day of the restroom occupation starting, GLU announced that it had secured a meeting with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Enku Gelaye on Tuesday morning to discuss its demands, and subsequently reported Tuesday evening that administrators had \u201ctentatively agreed to progressive \u2018benchmarks\u2019 put forth by organizers.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cThe administration is definitely listening and the tones of our conversation have changed quite a bit,\u201d one GLU member told Campus Reform , though the group is cautioning its supporters to remain prepared, because \u201cthe need for action may arise at any moment.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cChanging the signage really is not very expensive, and I don\u2019t want to talk bad about the administration here, but that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve had to go back and forth about, is this idea of the cost of it,\u201d another GLU member added. \u201cI and other members of GLU think the numbers they have proposed for what it would cost to change the signage are way beyond what it would really be.\u201d \\n\\nUMass Executive Director of Strategic Communications Ed Blaguszewski, however, told Campus Reform that the university is committed to expanding the availability of gender-neutral restrooms, making no mention of cost concerns while asserting that university officials would continue to meet regularly with transgender students to discuss their concerns. \\n\\n\u201cCurrently, there are more than 200 gender-inclusive, single-user restrooms on campus, and during the coming year more than 50 will be added, either by construction or by converting single-user \u2018Men\u2019 or \u2018Women\u2019 facilities to \u2018Restrooms,\u2019\u201d he explained, adding that \u201cAll new construction and major renovations on campus will include gender-inclusive restrooms.'"}, "time": 1742564516.0564904}
