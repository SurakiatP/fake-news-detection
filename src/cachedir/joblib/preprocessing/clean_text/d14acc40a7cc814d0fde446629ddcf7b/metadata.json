[According to a report in the Daily Mirror newspaper,    Lugman Aslam, of Warren View, Leicester, had gotten into a physical altercation with the men after backing his van into one of them, during which he alleged he was racially abused.  Recorder (circuit judge) Justin Wigoder described how, following this incident, a vengeful Aslam returned to his van, mounted the pavement and ploughed through the group, in order to \u201cget [his] own back\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it on CCTV and you deliberately mounted the pavement and drove straight at them and right through the middle of them at speed,\u201d Wigoder said. \u201cSome were thrown to the side and three were struck by your vehicle   with one going over the bonnet and hitting the windscreen. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable that nobody was seriously hurt or killed and the only injuries complained of were bruises and scratches. \u201cOne indication of the force of the collision was your windscreen was smashed  \u2014   you claimed it had been hit by an animal when you got it repaired. \u201cYou accept your intention, driving at them, was to cause serious injury and that\u2019s what makes this case so serious. \u201cThe motivation was driving at them to get your revenge, to get your own back from the fact they\u2019d assaulted you. \u201d However, the judge then went on to say that he accepted the potentially deadly attack \u201cwas completely out of character\u201d for the perpetrator, whom he praised as \u201ca good family man\u201d with glowing references. \u201cYou\u2019re of very positive good previous character and I\u2019ve received a considerable number of references setting out all the good that is in you,\u201d he said. Nadeem Aullybocus, defending, explained that Aslam \u201cwas fasting [for Ramadan] on that day and had been doing so for about 20 days\u201d when he carried out the attack. He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and attempting to inflict intentional grievous bodily harm, and ultimately received a   sentence and a     year driving ban. With the automatic parole provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, it is unlikely he will serve more than half of his prison term in custody. The relatively light sentence follows a number of deadly   attacks on pedestrians in Britain and Europe, including the Westminster Bridge attack on March 22nd and the London Bridge attack on June 3rd.'"}, "time": 1742563286.4220107}
