[Cox\u2019s talk is currently entitled, \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman: My Journey to Womanhood,\u201d and according to Maura Towey, the chair of CU Boulder\u2019s Distinguished Speakers Board, Cox will \u201cprovide an engaging conversation surrounding   and oppression. \u201d  Leftists at CU Boulder had attempted to shut down MILO\u2019s event, which is being hosted by the CU College Republicans and the CU chapter of Turning Point USA. A petition in favor of banning MILO from the campus reached around 1000 signatures, and claimed that MILO \u201cis not a journalist according to any respectable definition of that word he is a racist, sexist, reactionary opportunist who makes a comfortable living off sensationalism. \u201d \u201cTo deny him the privilege of speaking at our esteemed university is not to infringe on his (or anyone\u2019s) freedom of speech\u201d it continued. \u201cAnd deny him the privilege of speaking at our university is exactly what we ought to do. \u201d However, following a report by Breitbart News, the university administration reassured students that MILO\u2019s event would \u201cgo on as planned. \u201d \u201cWe value free speech and respect our student organizations\u2019 decisions on who they want to invite to events at our campus\u201d proclaimed the university in an email to Breitbart News. \u201cPersonally, I feel strongly that discrimination and harassment have no place on our campus,\u201d said College Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano. \u201cWith that said, we must support the free exchange of ideas. I would hope that any speaker who comes here can present his or her opinions in a respectful manner. We understand that some topics will be supported by some students and denounced by others. Hosting a speaker on campus does not mean the university endorses or has other viewpoints on that speaker\u2019s message. \u201d MILO\u2019s speech, which will be one of the last on the Dangerous Faggot Tour, will start at 7PM in the Mathematics Building, with doors opening from 6PM. Like most other dates on the tour, the event is sold out.'"}, "time": 1742563273.7877953}
