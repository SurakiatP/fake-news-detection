David Knight | Infowars.com - October 26, 2016 Comments \\nEstablishment politicians and press are outraged that Trump would question the integrity of their system. \\nThey say it undermines public trust in political institutions. \\nYet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections, who are shutting down election audit procedures, who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony. \\nOne such person is Texas Director of Elections, Keith Ingram. \\nThis story is specific to Texas, but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting. \\nI went to the Texas Secretary of State offices to ask Mr. Ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in August that would have gone into effect this November. \\nWith camera & mic in hand, we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the Director about the election. \\nWe were told to wait in the lobby and Mr. Ingram would be down. \\nYou can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with Infowars. \\nThe man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions. \\nSo much for transparency and candor. \\nThis unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law. \\nWhat follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in Texas. \\nBut before we get to specifics about his actions & his connection to the Rose Law firm in Arkansas, there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide: \\n\u2022 Why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard? \\n\u2022 Why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers & officials? \\nBurning The Paper Trail \\nIn August 2016, Ingram, Texas Director of Elections, attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming November 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting. His office issued new rules that would: \\nEliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers. \\nEliminate printing of Early Voting Results tapes. \\nEliminate printing of ballot images for recounts. \\nFortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed, with a formal public hearing scheduled after the November election. \\nState Senator Don Huffines said \u201cThe state\u2019s chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more real-time paper records and backups, not fewer\u2026The comfort & convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters\u2019 confidence and election integrity.\u201d \\nBut even though these procedures have been postponed, Ingram\u2019s previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the November election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated. Here are some of the problems\u2026 \\n1) Waiver of laws requiring a Partial Manual Recount audit \\nIngram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1% of the election precincts or 3 election precincts, whichever is greater. This was waived in all 254 counties the day after the March 2016 Primary. The timing is significant because during the primary there were 1,743 move votes than voters in Hill County in the Republican Primary. The margin of victory was 225 in Texas House District 8 that contains Hill County. In calling for a criminal investigation, Ingram noted that it appears \u201c6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times.\u201d Yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures. \\n2) Waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes \\nIngram\u2019s waivers issued in 2014, 2015, and 2016, appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65.004, 65.014, 66.022, 66.023, 66.024 and the Judges Handbook. These rules require \u2013 \u2022 \u201cThree original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates\u201d \u2022 \u201cOn completion of the vote count, the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct\u201d with \u201ctotal number of voters\u201d, \u201ctotal number of votes\u201d with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify. \\nIngram also issued waivers for requirements that a \u201czero tape\u201d be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a \u201ctally tape\u201d printed at the close of election. His letter states that \u201cthe process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day.\u201d \\nSo expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections. And if a favored vendor can\u2019t perform to the law, the law is waived. \\nIf proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state, instead of waived by Ingram, the Hill County issue of 1,743 more voters than votes would not have happened. The vendor in Hill County, ES&S eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying \u201cAn audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning Early Voting or Election Day ballots\u2026There are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error.\u201d \\nBut the Director of Elections is waiving those \u201cestablished election protocols\u201d. Ingram\u2019s waver of legal requirements & his improvised solution of \u201cprinting a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day\u201d opens the door for error and fraud. \\n3) Ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts \\nThe Secretary of State Election Division claims that \u201ccast vote records\u201d are equivalent to \u201cballot images\u201d. As you can see, the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered. \\nThe Texas Constitution, Article 6 \u2013 Suffrage, Section 4 says \u201cIn all elections by the people, the vote shall be by ballot, and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box.\u201d \\nYet the machines by vendors Hart InterCivic and ES&S, certified by Ingram, do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and don\u2019t provide other components of a legal Texas ballot. \\n4) Ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion \\nTexas Election Code, Sec 33.056 says a \u201cwatcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving.\u201d \\nAffidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in Dallas County (with official Poll Watcher signed forms) detail how they were \u201crepeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the Dallas County Central Counting Station such as ballot scanning, vote transfer, ballot transfer, computer activities, ballot tabulation, and viewing the elections computer line printer.\u201d They state that they were \u201crepeatedly treated disrespectfully, obstructed and blatantly ignored\u201d by the election officials, and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the Texas Secretary of State Elections office. \\nHostility to election monitors, like Ingram\u2019s refusal to answer our questions, destroy the public\u2019s confidence in the honesty of the process \u2014 and rightfully so. \\nIngram\u2019s Connections To Arkansas, Kutak Rock, Rose Law Firm & Hillary Clinton \\nAccording to a public information request of Ingram\u2019s Secretary of State personnel file, Ingram left private practice and moved to Little Rock Arkansas, taking a job with the law firm, Kutak Rock, LL. At Kutak Rock, he worked under the managing partner, Gordon Miller Wilbourn who had been a partner with Hillary Clinton, Vince Foster and Webster Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in the 1990\u2019s. The Wilbourn family is a large donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton campaign. \\nIngram left Kutak Rock to return to Texas when he was hired by Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts, boards & commissions. \\nIngrams\u2019s career moves are interesting. In just 10 months, his journey from private practice in Texas through Arkansas Clinton-cronies and back to Texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half. In 2012, Ingram, was promoted to Director of the Election Division in the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s Office where his salary was still 40% less than private practice. \\nIngram\u2019s determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big Clinton donors. \\nEstablishment Of Both Parties Don\u2019t Appear To Want Election Integrity \\nIn one lawsuit contesting election results for Austin City Council, the County could not produce ANY ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount. Computer logs had multiple \u201ccorruption/invalid\u201d errors. During discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district. One precinct had 100% voter turnout, another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100% in spite of only 32% and 17% county-wide turnout in the general and runoff elections. \\nThe County Democrat Party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a Republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities. \\nThere are some positive developments, however. The Republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly Republican County and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by Governor Abbott\u2019s office. \\nState Senator Bob Hall said, \u201cDue to an increasing number of complaints, it is time for the Texas Elections Division Office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that office\u2026and instruct all Texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws\u2026\u201d \\nVoters, regardless of political affiliation, should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest, transparent elections. For example, Chambers County in Texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. It\u2019s time to remove Keith Ingram as Texas Director of Elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots. \\n '"}, "time": 1742628547.4525347}
