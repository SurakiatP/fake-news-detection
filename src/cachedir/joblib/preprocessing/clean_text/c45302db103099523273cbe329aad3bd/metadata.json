During the question and answer session, Ryan was asked about the prospect of another stab at repealing and replacing Obamacare, to which he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. \u201d Partial transcript as follows: I don\u2019t know what else to say other than Obamacare\u2019s the law of the land. It\u2019s going to be remain the law of the land until it\u2019s replaced. We did not have quite the votes to replace this law. And so, yeah, we\u2019re gonna be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s gonna take us to replace this law. My worry is Obamacare is  \u2014   is going to be getting even worse. Actually, I think we were probably doing the Democrats a favor. I think we are doing the architects of Obama a favor by passing this law before it gets even worse. Well, I guess that favor\u2019s not going to be given to them and it\u2019s going to get worse. And so, I don\u2019t think the architects of Obamacare  \u2014   I\u2019m sure they may be pleased right now. But when they see how bad this thing gets, they said all the projections were being told by  \u2014   by the plans that are participating in Obamacare. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna like that either. Look, five states you got one plan left, one choice. Over a third of the counties in America, one plan left. And the kinds of projections we\u2019re being told from the people providing health insurance to these people in plans, it\u2019s gonna get even worse. And so, I don\u2019t think the architects of Obamacare envisioned this future. It\u2019s certainly not one we want for the American people. And I wish we had the kind of consensus we needed to bring a bill to the floor to pass and replace it but we just don\u2019t have that right now.
