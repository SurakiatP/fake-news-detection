In addition, the company\u2019s brand fell 24 spots since 2014. [According to calculations by Brand Finance\u2019s Brand Directory, Kellogg has been steadily falling at least since 2014. According to the group\u2019s ratings, the cereal giant figured in as the 60th most valued company in 2014. But over each of the ensuing years, that assessment has dropped.  In 2015, Kellogg was the 68th most valued company in the country in 2016, it fell eight more slots to 76 and with its latest measurement, Brand Finance says Kellogg has fallen eight more slots to 84. The company has seen a drop of 24 slots in just four years. Brand Finance calculates a company\u2019s brand on its earnings, stock, and profits and then measures all that to determine how much a given company would pay to license its brand as if it did not own it. The Brand Finance rating isn\u2019t the only example of trouble for the breakfast food company. The   company has also seen its stock falling since last year. Kellogg\u2019s stock closed last week at $72. 61 per share, down from its   high of $87. 16. Kellogg has been experiencing major business contractions, too, especially over the last year. The company has been desperately cutting its work force and downsizing facilities at least since last December. In January, Kellogg announced that it was cutting another 250 employees from its U. S. workforce, and by February, it had closed 39 distribution centers and laid off its entire U. S. sales force. The company\u2019s contraction came after Kellogg decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart\u2019s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November, Kellogg noted that the conservative readers at Breitbart News are not \u201caligned with our values as a company. \u201d While the decision by Kellogg to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House. After the cereal maker turned its back on conservative customers, Breitbart News launched its #DumpKelloggs petition, which has been signed by more than 450, 000 people. Finally, according to advertising industry watchdog, Adweek, Kellogg\u2019s decision to pull advertising from Breitbart and the ensuing controversy over the move inflicted massive,   damage to the cereal company\u2019s brand online.
