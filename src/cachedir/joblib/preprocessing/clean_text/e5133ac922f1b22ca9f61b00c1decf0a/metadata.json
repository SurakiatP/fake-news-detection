Announces Shock \u201cDatabase\u201d to Monitor Cops \\nHowever, after a county Democrat official who was also a gay activist received one complaint about Walsh, Walsh was summarily fired by the agency. \\nWalsh responded by filing a lawsuit against the state, alleging discrimination, which in turn met with an official demand that he turn over all of his sermons , related notes and a host of other documents, a demand he is resisting and that his legal team called \u201can excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church.\u201d \\nA statement from Walsh read: \u201cNo government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that \u2018(i)njustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\u2019 still reverberate today \u2013 especially as we witness the Gestapo-like tactics of his native state.\u201d Advertisement - story continues below'"}, "time": 1742562723.037941}
