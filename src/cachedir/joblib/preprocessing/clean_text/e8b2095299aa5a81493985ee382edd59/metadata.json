According to the Toronto Star, not everyone could afford to see the man calling for the end of income inequality. \u201cA   hall laid out for a rock star, a   stroll for giddy VIPs and video screens for the rest of the roughly 6, 000 who were neither sufficiently wealthy nor connected to get a   seat,\u201d the Star reported. \u201cThis was the scene here at a   appearance nine months in the making: Barack Obama\u2019s first   address on Canadian soil \u2014  one of the few appearances he\u2019s made anywhere since handing power to U. S. President Donald Trump in January,\u201d the Star reported. \u201cHotly contested, planned and negotiated until the final days and beamed across North America, it was a strategic investment that may have topped half a million dollars and was meant to put on the map a city in the throes of its 375th anniversary celebrations,\u201d the Star reported. The Star speculated Obama may have been persuaded to speak through his friendship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who tweeted about the former president\u2019s visit: How do we get young leaders to take action in their communities? Thanks @BarackObama for your visit  insights tonight in my hometown. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) June 7, 2017,  Other dignitaries attending Obama\u2019s speech included the federal cabinet minister and former astronaut Marc Garneau, Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard. \u201cAll were seated at the table of honour, surrounded captains of Quebec\u2019s business world, sipping wine at corporate tables,\u201d the Star reported. \u201cThe more reasonably priced $375 seats started at a distance where Obama was just a   spec on a faraway stage. \u201d Michel Leblanc, president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, \u201crefused to say how much they paid for Obama\u2019s visit or what other conditions might have led to their winning bid,\u201d according to the Star. \u201cObama has reportedly demanded a $400, 000 (U. S.) speaking fee for at least two other speeches,\u201d the Star wrote. \u201cOne Canadian source, who was unaware of the payment details, said such a price tag \u2014  which works out in Canadian dollars to roughly $7, 700 for every minute Obama spent on the Montreal stage \u2014  would not be a great surprise,\u201d the outlet continued. Meanwhile, NBC\u2019s report reveals Obama is now striving to be an international community organizer. \u201cObama said that in times of economic uncertainty it can be tempting to turn to isolationism and \u2018the politics of  . \u2019 and said World War I and World War II were the result,\u201d NBC reported. \u201cHe said the U. S. and other nations showed there was a better way \u201cin creating an international order that was based not just on   but also on principles. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561864.0683224}
