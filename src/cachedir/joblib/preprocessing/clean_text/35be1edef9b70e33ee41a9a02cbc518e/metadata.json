The entire state is rapidly becoming a bright, shining example of everything that is wrong with America. It is so sad to watch our most populated state implode right in front of our eyes. Like millions of Americans, I was quite enamored with the state of California when I was younger. The warm weather, the beaches, the great natural beauty of the state and the mystique of Hollywood all really appealed to me. At one point I even thought that I wanted to move there. But today, hordes of Californians are racing to get out of the state because it has become a total nightmare. It is the worst state in the country in which to do business, taxes were just raised even higher, unemployment is more than 20 percent higher than the national average and the state government is drowning in debt. Meanwhile, poverty, gang activity and crime just seem to get worse with each passing year. On top of everything else, the insane politicians in Sacramento just keep on passing more laws that make the problems that the state is facing even worse. Unfortunately, what is happening in California may be a preview of what is coming to the entire nation. The old adage, \u201cas California goes, so goes the nation\u201d, has been proven to be true way too many times. \\nIn dozens of different ways, the state of California is showing the rest of us what not to do. Will we learn from their mistakes, or will we follow them into oblivion? Please share the list below with as many people as you can. In addition to a large amount of new research, this list also pulled heavily from one of my previous articles and from outstanding research done by Richard Rider . The following are 55 reasons why California is the worst state in America\u2026 \\n1. One survey of business executives has ranked California as the worst state in America to do business for 8 years in a row . \\n2. In 2011, the state of California ranked 50th out of all 50 states in new business creation. \\n3. According to one recent study, California is the worst-governed state in the entire country. \\n4. Thanks to Proposition 30 , California now boasts the highest state income tax rate in the nation. \\n5. Even though California just raised taxes dramatically on the wealthy, state revenues are falling like a rock . State revenue for November 2012 was 10.8 percent below projections. \\n7. California has the 8th highest corporate income tax rate in the country. \\n8. California has the highest \u201cminimum corporate tax\u201d in the country. Each corporation must pay at least $800 to the state even if a corporation does not make a single dollar of profit. \\n9. California is tied with New York for the highest gasoline tax rate in the country. \\n10. California is the only state in America that taxes carbon emissions . \\n11. The state of California issues some of the most expensive traffic tickets in the nation. This is another form of taxation. \\n12. As of October, only Nevada and Rhode Island had higher unemployment rates than California. \\n13. The unemployment rate in California is more than 20 percent higher than the overall unemployment rate for the rest of the nation. \\n14. The state of California requires licenses for 177 different occupations (the most in the nation). The national average is only 92. \\n15. California teachers are the highest paid in the nation, but California students rank 48th in math and 49th in reading . \\n16. California accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. population, but a whopping 33 percent of Americans that receive TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) live there. \\n17. Only the state of Illinois has a lower bond rating than the state of California does. \\n18. Including unfunded pension liabilities, the state of California has more than twice as much debt as any other state does. \\n19. Average pay for California state workers has risen by more than 100 percent since 2005. That is good news for those state employees, but it is bad news for the taxpayers that have to pay their salaries. \\n20. More than 5,000 California state troopers made more than $100,000 last year. \\n21. One highway patrol officer ended up bringing home almost $484,000 in 2011. \\n22. One state psychiatrist in California was paid $822,000 in 2011. \\n23. Since 2007, the number of children living in poverty in the state of California has increased by 30 percent . \\n24. Sadly, an astounding 60 percent of all students attending California public schools now qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches. \\n25. The American Tort Reform Association has ranked the state of California as the worst \u201cjudicial hellhole\u201d in America. \\n26. Businesses all over the state of California are being absolutely suffocated to death by ridiculous regulations. \\n27. According to the Milken Institute, operating costs for California businesses are 23 percent higher than the national average. \\n28. According to CNN , the state of California had the worst \u201csmall business failure rate\u201d in America in 2010. It was 69 percent higher than the national average. \\n29. The number of people unemployed in the state of California is roughly equivalent to the populations of Nevada, New Hampshire and Vermont combined . \\n30. Residential customers in California pay about 29 percent more for electricity than the national average. \\n31. So many poor people and illegal aliens have taken advantage of the \u201cfree\u201d healthcare at emergency rooms that many of them have been forced to shut down in California. As a result, the state of California now ranks dead last out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people. \\n32. Political correctness is totally out of control in California. \\n33. One California town is actually considering making it illegal to smoke in your own backyard . \\n34. The traffic around the big cities is horrific. \\n35. Los Angeles \\n40. The rampant gang activity in the state gets even worse with each passing year. \\n41. Crime continues to rise all over the state. \\n42. Just recently, the city attorney of San Bernardino, California told citizens to \u201c lock their doors and load their guns \u201d because there is not enough money to pay for adequate police protection any longer. \\n43. The murder rate in San Bernardino is up 50 percent this year. \\n44. In Oakland, burglaries are up 43 percent so far this year. \\n45. Today, Oakland is considered the 5th most violent city in the United States. \\n46. There have been more than 250 gold chain robberies in Stockton, California just since the month of April. \\n47. In Stockton, the police budget cuts got so bad that the police union put up a billboard at one point with the following message : \u201cWelcome to the 2nd most dangerous city in California. Stop laying off cops.\u201d \\n48. Jerry Brown. \\n49. The absolutely insane California state legislature. \\n50. Wildfires. \\n51. Mudslides. \\n52. The state of California lies directly along the infamous \u201c Ring of Fire \u201c. Approximately 90 percent of all the earthquakes in the entire world happen along the Ring of Fire and the \u201cBig One\u201d could hit the state at any moment. \\n53. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 100,000 more people moved out of the state of California in 2011 than moved into it. \\n54. During 2011, more than 58,000 people moved from California to the state of Texas . \\n55. Overall, the state of California has experienced a net loss of about four million residents to other states over the past 20 years. Sorry Protesters: Your Jobs Are Being Sent To China And They Aren\u2019t Coming Back \u00bb Mark \\nWe left California in 2001. That was the best move we ever made. California would be a beautiful place with about 5 million people. Give then all to texas. Mondobeyondo \\nCalifornia is a beautiful state. Nice place to visit. Wouldn\u2019t want to live there though. Jagrick \\nIt sure is. Northern California is about the most beautiful place in this country. I would never want to live in LA. I have been there several years ago and it had a creepy feeling so nowadays i assume it\u2019s even worse. San Diego back in the 80\u2019s was absolutely beautiful. Joseph Kool \\nYou don\u2019t get out much do you Jarrett Wilson \\nwas going to say the same thing! California is UGLY, it\u2019s bests and I mean absolute best is up north. rest is crap The Truth \\nYeah Yosemite is such crap isn\u2019t it? Only perhaps the most beautiful place in the lower 48 but yeah it\u2019s crap. richard \\nDEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE. I WOULD AVOID THE BIG CITIES BUT TO BE HONEST THE BIG CITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE TROUBLE. THE PROBLEM WITH CALIF IS THERE ARE 37,+ MILLION PEOPLE LIVING HERE.AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW BIG CITIES!! WERE OVER RAN WITH ILLEGALS THAT CAN\u2019T SPEAK ENGLISH AND THERE KIDS ARE BEHIND BECAUSE OF THAT, THIS IS THE REASON OUR TESTS SCORES ARE SO LOW. I HAVE LIVED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND CALIF HAS IT\u2019S BAD POINTS BUT I WOULDN\u2019T LIVE ANY PLACE ELSE. I CAN BE AT THE BEACH IN 45 MIN. I CAN GO TO THE SNOW IN 45 MIN AND LEAVE IT THERE AND GO TO THE DESERT IN 45 MINS. ELECT RATES ARE HIGHER BUT WE DON\u2019T USE AS MUCH GAS I SPENT 15 DOLLARS THIS MONTH CAN ANYONE ELSE OUT OF STATE SAY THAT..MY ELECT WAS 48 DOLLARS AND I DON\u2019T LIVE IN A SHACK,. I THINK THIS BLOG IS A LITTLE UNFAIR..I THINK GASOLINE IS HIGHER IN HAWAII THEN NEW YORK OR CALIF #41 CRIME IS GOING UP EVERYWHERE. #50-51-52 YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MUDSLIDES IF YOU DON\u2019T LIVE IN THE HILLS. FIRES, DIDN\u2019T HALF OF COLORADO BURN DOWN THIS YEAR HOW ABOUT NEW MEXICO.VERY FEW FIRES HERE THIS YEAR. EARTH QUAKES YEP WE GET THEM. WE DON\u2019T GET FLOODS VERY MUCH HERE AND NOT TO MANY TORNADO\u2019S. YOU HAVE YOUR PROS AND CONS Handog \\nYou can get your point across without using all caps. Easier to reed as well. quercus454 \\nAs a Calif native much of what you say is true. Population increases by a mostly low educated foreign population is probably one of the biggest contributors to the state\u2019s decline. While many people rightfully assume that Ca is the illegal alien capital of the country, legal immigrants contribute a larger amount towards population growth. With current immigration rules not refining who we allow in, many legal immigrants are not much better educated then the illegal variety. Lack of education means lower incomes that pay little in the way of taxes and because an immigrant is legal they are eligible for social services. \\nThe children of foreign born immigrants, both legal and illegal often require special ESL classes that cost the taxpayer extra. Some districts have ESL teachers for more then 4 or 5 languages. Population growth has rewarded California with over crowded class rooms and failing students. \\nIncreased population has swamped government resources that were designed to handle a population half today\u2019s size. Whether it be social services, infrastructure needs, health care or the judicial system, all have been adversely affected by increased numbers of people. More people needing more resources leads to two things: rising costs and shortages. \\nCalifornia is the canary in the coal mine. It is a perfect example of what happens when you continually add more and more people who contribute less then they take. Along with feel good government policies to garner votes and the high taxes to support those policies you have California, a failing state. \\nWho is to blame? The people of not only California, but the people of the entire country. While the voter\u2019s in Ca certainly carry a majority of the blame, immigration is supposedly a federal concern. The Federal government is supposed to regulate immigration and secure the border. Current and past politicians have neglected and even obstructed meaningful enforcement of immigration laws.The repeated re-election of the same inept/corrupt people has put California in the hole and the rest of the country on the edge. \\nCalifornia is a warning. Continually electing people who have no regard for the citizens of this country, who place their own careers above what is best, the rest of the country will mirror Ca. arizonadiane \\nExcellent post. You are so right, and the blame really does go back to our increasingly inept and wasteful federal governement Randy Townsend \\nCA resident here who agrees with your take on the situation. The government, however, accurately reflects the public\u2019s embrace of the leftist agenda. Higher taxes, enormous deficits, and greater spending are exactly what Obama is going to give the rest of the country. Take a good look, America: CA is YOUR future. liberranter \\nNow if only you could keep them confined to the state that they\u2019ve made such a mess of. They made their proverbial bed hard, now LET THEM SLEEP IN IT! molon_labe \\nLot of them moving to Texas, and immediately try to turn it to commiefornia. So, you move because commieforniaI a disaster, and now you wamt to do the same thing here? Roaches I tell you. Feed and move on is what they do. Durgys Ramirez \\nTotally AGREE with You on the Roaches part. Mike McCormack \\nI hope those that try to escape the blight leave behind their voting habits. Donald \\nWe do vote against this crap but we are over run by voter fraud, illegals and libtard indoctrinated schools. Now they just voted for $15 an hour to flip burgers which = Junior Web Developer right out of college. I\u2019m moving to Texas because I feel I have better support numbers and don\u2019t feel like such an outkast. By moving to Texas I will help make sure Libtard philosophies don\u2019t spread to the other states. PS I wasn\u2019t born in california either! Plus I love Guns! JustanOguy \\nAnd take a look at how many people are bailing out of California. 600,000+ population decrease last year. \\nIt\u2019s obviously not working out too well\u2026 \\nJust to be clear: I\u2019m not endorsing it. As an extreme conservative, I haven\u2019t been represented in government for years. DW \\nYour numbers are all wrong. That many may have left, but they were replaced by the 1 mill illegals welcomed in by Obama and company. Your mama \\nSounds good, lets burn one to celebrate LazyIke \\nThis is a good commentary. What we have seen is thousands of former Midwesterners who moved here after WWII leave and being replaced will illegals from south of the border many of whom are illiterate in Spanish and drop out of high school at high rates and reproduce at high rates. Sugarsail1 \\ngood post, but another major contributor is the same thing that killed Detroit; unfunded union pension liabilities is a GIANT expense as well. Unions hijacked the government long ago and we are reaping what we sow. kayaker \\nGood grief\u2026.you don\u2019t have a freaking clue what\u2019s going on if this is what you actually think. No wonder the country\u2019s in such deep trouble. Durgys Ramirez \\nTotally AGREE with your Post. cherylmeril \\nDon\u2019t write in all caps, it\u2019s hard on the eyes. You aren\u2019t being read richard Ana Hernandez \\nin all honesty, lol. I skipped over your post to. read hers and went back to find out what she was referring to. i don\u2019t care either way, but in my case it was true, I skipped over the post in all caps. sorry. it makes you seem angry so people don\u2019t listen [or read] what you said. honestly\u2026i still haven\u2019t read it.lol richard \\nit is easy for me to type with the cap locks on. broke my pinkie in a motor cycle accident about 14 years ago and it really hurts to reach that shift key with that finger. sorry i have offended so many. i will just type with out it on. of course i won\u2019t capitalize like a lot of you. hope that doesn\u2019t offend anyone. CHiP \\nWait, you only have one pinkie? Or, one of those crappy keyboards, with only one shift key. I don\u2019t like those keyboards \u2013 you can\u2019t even type a capital letter if you\u2019ve got a broken pi\u2026 oh, wait. (Pssss, Richard, we won\u2019t tell anybody, but \u201cmotor cycle\u201d is one word.) Marian \\nI read your post in caps. I didn\u2019t give a hoot how you wrote it. lol\u2026it\u2019s just letters. I was planning on moving there.. was interested to see what people had to say. I already live somewhere with the highest taxes and fuel consumption, but starting a business here is amazing. I figured I\u2019d go there once my business can settle me down. I live in Quebec. \\nI don\u2019t capitalize always.If I missed it then it stays lower case. richard \\nsounds good to me. Life is to short to worry about the small stuff. danny \\nWho the %@#! writes in all caps anymore! I refuse to even read it. JustanOguy \\nI love California\u2026. to visit. I live in Nevada and visit California all the time but it\u2019s really gone downhill over the past 20 years and I don\u2019t see it getting any better. (Quite frankly, I\u2019m visiting less and less nowadays because all of the taxes on everything is going through the roof.) \\nI guess the 600,000+ other people that bailed out of California last year don\u2019t see it getting any better either. Rod \\nI was born in SoCal. Family left when I was about to enter elementary school. My two older sisters were already in the horrible schools system with rampant gang activity even back in the mid 60\u2019s! I went back after graduating college to start a career. Left again in 1992 and have never looked back. I lived in the Bay Area (San Jose), LA area (Long Beach) and San Diego. I will NEVER live there again and do not even like to visit. Sugarsail1 \\nI\u2019m a Cali native and very disappointed with my home state as well. Other than my elderly mother and the nice weather I have no reason to be here and have been looking to move but I don\u2019t know where. I\u2019ve seriously considered Mexico\u2026any recommendations? BGenie \\nGood for You to Never Look Back. California is All Corrupted anyways. Willowville \\nThe illegals are there to fill the low-wage employment gap. Education has little to do with it. There are plenty of college-educated people earning low pay. Jordan \\nWERE OVER RAN WITH ILLEGALS THAT CAN\u2019T SPEAK ENGLISH AND THERE KIDS ARE BEHIND BECAUSE OF THAT, THIS IS THE REASON OUR TESTS SCORES ARE SO LOW. \\nReally? With this grammar, punctuation, and spelling you are targeting those who are learning a second language as being problematic? Work out your past participles, your contractions, the difference between \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201cthere,\u201d and your English syntax in general before you start blaming others for low test scores. Andrew Taylor \\nBroken caps lock key? Or do you simply believe bigger=better? Personally I find it annoying, grammatically incorrect, lazy and space consuming without a proper reason. I\u2019d have to say I disagree with your logic on California. By agreeing with it I feel like you are agreeing with the problem with this country. Uncontrolled debt, corruption, lawful theft and crime is everywhere in California. How can you agree with that? CitizenX \\nDon\u2019t want you here. thomas moloian \\nand i agree with you since my wife and i stuck here for now but will change within next 5 yrs. davidmpark \\nAny chance Disnelyland might relocate to a better place? Like Texas or South Utah? It\u2019d make life easier. Mondobeyondo \\nMaybe Phoenix? We could use a decent amusement park around here. I\u2019m tired of hunting lizards as a recreational activity. liberranter \\nWhat, no rattlesnakes up in your neighborhood to hunt (I didn\u2019t find any this year on my property either)? mleblanc138 \\nI\u2019m happy as long as California doesn\u2019t send their problems and policies up north to Utah. SLC/Provo is about a 10 hour drive away from SoCal, and yet the two are worlds apart. Unfortunately, Mexican drug cartels have set up grows on some remote land across Southern Utah. richard \\nI LOVE SOCAL I WOULDN\u2019T LIVE ANY OTHER PLACE BUT I LIVE 50 MILES EAST OF L.A. IN A SMALL AG COMMUNITY. Mondobeyondo \\nMichael\u2019s human, and being a human being, he has his hits and misses. Just like any of the rest of us. Believe me, I\u2019ve had some misses as well. Not everyone is going to hit a home run 100 percent of the time. \\nSan Francisco has this reputation for being the liberal capital of America. Perhaps that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been up there. SoCal, I know rather well. Yeah, it\u2019s different there \u2013 from what I understand, Los Angeles is to San Francisco, as Phoenix is to Flagstaff. Same states, vastly different communities. And no, I don\u2019t believe everyone in San Francisco is gay or liberal. [Common misperception of an entire community]. MeMadMax \\nUp in north california you have all the insane white people, down in the southern areas, you have, basically, mexico\u2026 \\nWhat could POSSIBLY go wrong? lololololololol! And yes, I do live there, in Van Nuys, a sub of Los Angeles chilller \\nA fence should be erected around CA to keep them all from leaving and bringing their poisonous ideas into Texas and other neighboring states. Those people moved there because they agreed with CA\u2019s insane ideas. They\u2019re only leaving because they have to but they still have those insane ideas stuck in their heads. Syrin \\nAmen. We need to wall liberals in their own states and keep people from leaving and destroying their neighbors. Up north they\u2019re called Massholes. They leave MA, then keep voting democrat in their new haven only to have the same end result. \\nLiberals are truly too stupid to understand cause and effect, history, facts, figures or basic economic analysis. Bad_Mr_Frosty \\nWe need to put a scarlet letter on liberals so no matter where they go we know who they are and what they stand for. liberranter \\nNo tattooing is needed. Just spend sixty seconds in the company of one, and you\u2019ll know by what they vomit out of their mouths what kind of creature you\u2019re dealing with. Sheryl \\nYou\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, Syrin (hope that reference isn\u2019t considered too offensive or PC-incorrect, or deemed as promoting toolshed violence, for all you uber Liberals out there) Zen \\nThey have already ruined Nevada. My advise is keep them out! They are like a parasite. They have damn near killed their host and so they are leaving it and bringing their liberal disease with them. Next thing you know you\u2019re a blue state. JustanOguy \\nSpot on\u2026 they have ruined Clark Country / Las Vegas but the backlash has started. \\nLibs are not welcomed in Nevada. The Dude \\nBe careful what you wish for. \\nAs someone who lived in California I understand the sentiment. Living their transformed my political outlook. A poor man can live better in Montana, then a rich man can in California. name \\nyou know texas doesnt border california, right? Mondobeyondo \\nTrue. It\u2019s sad to see what\u2019s happening on the Left Coast. Syrin \\nWhen these liberal douche bags come to US for a bail out for their fiscal INSANITY, all endorsed by GARY, that\u2019s when secession talks take on a SERIOUS tone. \\nI for one think we should wall in the entire state. We would allow anyone or any business that did not vote for Obama or contribute to his campaign to leave. Otherwise, they have to STAY in their cesspool, and not go pollute their neighboring states, because as we all know, liberals are too stupid to understand cause and effect. We\u2019d allow anyone to ENTER the state, but leaving would be very very difficult. 2Gary2 \\nsecession is treason. How many dies in the civil war and now you d-bad repubes want to take your toys and go home. Grow the F up. Bad_Mr_Frosty \\nUm, stealing all the wealth of the middle class and giving away all the nation\u2019s jobs to Chinese and Mexicans is treason. If it takes secession or a revolution to end this nightmare, so be it. liberranter \\nPlease, don\u2019t dignify the moron\u2019s verbal vomiting by arguing with him. It\u2019s beneath us. Jobless_1 \\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I sure have a hard time finding a job in California. I don\u2019t think that the state was a place to earn/find a living. I don\u2019t know how to do gangsta stuff either so I suck. I guess I would have to join the military as the ticket out. I would settle in a colony/territory if necessary. SOS! One warning, beware of its ripping debt, it\u2019s one of its plagues. Handog \\n58 watch the video. \u201cChief Economist says CA. Is going in the right direction. LOL \\nThanks, I needed a good laugh since I just lost my job recently. \\nThe reverse gold rush will turn TX. Into CA. It\u2019s a temporary safe haven at best. By the way, if you think the cost of living is cheap here in TX. Your in for a rude awakening. Rent, food, gas is sky high. Toll roads taxing you to death\u2026. liberranter \\nHaving lived in various localities around the country over the last 30 years, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the idea of disparate \u201ccosts of living\u201d in Amerika is a myth. Honestly, I have not seen evidence of significant cost of living differences between, say, Arlington, Virginia and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The cost of living ANYWHERE in Amerika has become almost prohibitive \u2013 thanks in large measure to that moron Ben Bernanke and his Federal Reserve counterfeiting machine, aided and abetted by state and local political machines, Kalifornia\u2019s being the absolute worst. Davethewave \\nI had to comment on your job loss. Sorry you got fried. What could the reason be that you were canned. It must be because of your winning positive personality that we have observed. Perhaps it was your world views. Maybe your ideas on those God given rights you love to spew on about.It must have be great to be with you at lunch. I am sure your former co-workers miss you. Handog \\nLiberals always use petty insults when they lose a debate. Pathetic. Davethewave \\nIf that comment is all you got then I just handed em to you. you still have not replied to my other question. Where can I find out about your God Given Rights. Handog \\nWhatever Captain Kirk. Or should I say captain numnuts. LoL Davethewave \\nYou got nothiin get a job! Handog \\nI give Michael an A + I don\u2019t need statistics on everything.

El Pollo de Oro \\n2Gary2: Thanks for that link. Thirty years ago, I would have laughed my head off if someone described the USA as a banana republic. Now, I call it The Banana Republic of America because in so many respects, that\u2019s exactly what it has become. As I\u2019ve often said, Canadians who want a visit a Third World banana republic needn\u2019t travel far. All they have to do is keeping driving south until they cross the border. Gerald Celente is right: this is an UN-developing country. By the way, I noticed that Chile is the highest ranking South American country on that list. That makes sense because Chile and Uruguay are the least banana republic countries in South America (Argentina, sadly, shot itself in the foot, like the BRA). Hoppytoo \\nSurely you know that JFK believed that lower taxes result in greater revenue. otter1111 \\nGary, if you just read the article above, you can read about the state the liberals have been in charge of for many years. Many of the above facts are due to the liberal policies. California is in no way conservative, it\u2019s pretty much completely run by liberals. Just like Detroit. This country really hasn\u2019t been run by conservatives either. Obama had complete control in his first two years in office, with the house and senate having strong democrat majorities. Really Bush was not a fiscal conservative, and Obama is out of control as far as spending. What policies exactly are you talking about, anyway? And shouldn\u2019t Obama have fixed them after 4 years? arizonadiane \\nI was born and raised in Pacific Beach part of San Diego. In the 50\u2019s-70\u2019s it was wonderful. Then more people began to move in. Who wouldn\u2019t want to live in beautiful San Diego. Unfortunately, we see the results. Especially bad on all the oceanfront properties. Can\u2019t even see the ocean. \\nI left there in the 70\u2019s but still had parents there. They moved to the \u201ccountry\u201d\u2013 which is now Rancho Bernardo. Wall to wall houses. \\nI now have no reason to go back because everyone is gone, but the last few times was there, was 2010. HORRIBLE traffic, horrible influx of illegals and you name it. It is sad. And then, what idiots put Jerry Brown in for the 3\u2019rd time? He was the one who started the mess in his first term. \\nSome people just don\u2019t get it. cherylmeril \\nSan Francisco\u2019s a booming city. Its politicians are idiots but you shouldn\u2019t have listed this city as a reason why California is the worst state.

It\u2019s an epidemic level here, the #1 city for these kind of accidents . cherylmeril \\nThe court system in California is full of a lot of corruption, particularly bad is San Diego. The courts are also entrapping victims they suspect have money through mentally ill people in a desperate attempt to bring money into the legal community. The courts play politics like never before and anything goes, the law and procedure is secondary much of the time. Court\u2019s also rely on those who obviously commit perjury not giving it a second thought.

El Pollo de Oro \\nCalifornia is a mess, but then, so is The Banana Republic of America in general. And California\u2019s woes are not only bad for California\u2014they\u2019re also bad for the rest of the country because California is the world\u2019s 9th largest economy. When an economy of that size is in deep trouble, the pain will be felt thousands of miles away. It\u2019ll be felt here in the Northeastern BRA 3000 miles away, and for that matter, it\u2019ll be felt in Europe. This is a global economic nightmare with one major economy after another sinking into the Third World abyss. California\u2019s in trouble, the rest of the BRA is in trouble, big chunks of Europe are in trouble. All this economy misery around the world will lead to violent unrest, major riots, violent crime galore, political extremism, and World War III (which might go nuclear). \\n\u201cThe presstitutes aren\u2019t reporting this, but there are massive demonstrations going on in Spain, in Portugal and in Greece. Tens of millions of people in dozens of different cities are taking to the streets. It\u2019s breaking down worldwide.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \\nYes, it is breaking down worldwide. No doubt. And the worse the misery becomes, the bloodier the future will be. The money, as Celente says, is not flowing down to the man in the streets, and the blood will flow in the streets. It will flow like tidal waves. Say a prayer for Europe and a prayer for The Banana Republic of America because we need all the help we can get. liberranter \\n\u2026California is the world\u2019s 9th largest economy. \\nAmazing that that\u2019s still true, given the lengths to which Kalifornians have gone in trying to destroy their own economy. Given the deteriorating present conditions, methinks that the \u201cworld\u2019s 9th largest economy\u201d standing won\u2019t be true for very much longer. Shahhe \\nCalifornians* I hate to be the one to say that, but you can\u2019t even spell. So your not really in the position to be saying what you think is going to happen to California\u2019s standing as the 9th largest economy in the world.

We moved our business from California to Texas in 2000 \u2013 best decision we ever made. No, we are not liberals who are foisting our ideas on Texas\u2013 just two conservatives who were smart enough to know that California would eventually kill our business. \\nWe still maintain a home in Newport Beach \u2013 where 87% are registered as republicans.

Of course, California lost us as taxpayers when we fled the state in 2000. The state also lost our employees and that tax base as well \u2013 and they continue to lose by chasing small business away. \\nGuess I will never understand why Californians continue to vote these idiots in. Prior to moving to Newport Beach, we lived in a suburb just south of here. All of our neighbors were liberals save one or two. Once our neighbors discovered we were conservative/libertarian \u2013 they had absolutely nothing to do with us, and quite frankly, some got downright nasty. Then again, we are small business owners \u2013 and they are corporate or government workers who never have had to make payroll. liberranter \\nGuess I will never understand why Californians continue to vote these idiots in. \\nBecause most Kalifornia \u201cvoters\u201d are lazy, freeloading, economically ignorant sheepletards, like most of the rest of the nation.

Traffic is heavy, but at least it moves, and most drivers I find are polite. The state is still beautiful\u2026 Our city, state and national parks are gems. Sure, we have our problems, but Californians are feisty and independent. I\u2019m sure Michael could write the same article on any of the other 49 states and list their problems.

Dominik \\nYes all of this is true, but don\u2019t forget about the successful companies here. California is the most unique state in the union. From the food to the fashion. Of course the most beautiful state (in my opinion) gets stuck with all the insane politicians and way to many regulations and\u2026well everything stated above. California still does have the largest textile factory that makes clothes in America by American workers and nothing is shipped from other countries to American Apparel Inc. which is the last great American clothing company. kurt cobain \\nI like how someone else other than me is identifying the illegals by what they are; mexicans.

My old high school turned into a prison camp, my old city into a little Tijuana, the traffic is bad 24-7, high costs for everything! Moved to the southeast: low crime, low cost of living, 10 minutes to work, low/no traffic, morals and values are taught and practiced. I went out for an interview in CA lately, even Norcal looks like Tijuana now. The freeways were littered with trash, the beach cities were unkept, people were not friendly, businesses were run down. I told them don\u2019t bother making me an offer as I was not interested in living in the state. So not only is CA losing businesses, they are now becoming uncompetitive for the best employees. because of the squalor, it will get much worse, maybe NEVER get better. we need to flush the system clean, stop attracting freeloaders and get on with life without being dragged down. There is no reason that we need to provide any free lunches and bring in more legal or illegals until we find jobs for the 25Million people that are out of work. lou \\nCalifornia is overpopulated, period\u2026.. due mostly to foreigners, especially mexicans and koreans here illegally.

They pay large amounts of taxes as they are typically high-end workers who have good qualifications. The problem is that the State puts nothing back into Education. They reap what they sew. Bad Government is the key issue. The-Truth-Hurters \\nYou sound like just another ignorant white Republican spewing hate without knowing any real facts. First of all, you\u2019re an immigrant in this country too because you stole it from the Native Americans don\u2019t forget that redneck joe. \\nSecond, your country was built by immigrants in the first place like the Chinese who came here and built the railroads and ifrastructure, and the Indians are the only reason you even have a Silicon Valley at all. \\nThird, no one is stealing your jobs\u2026 You are losing them because these people are more qualified, smarter, and work harder than fat/racist/ignorant/poorly educated white hick Americans. You can\u2019t blame an Indian or Chinese for taking your jobs when they study and work hard all day long while you\u2019re out drinking beer and eating burgers, and riding around in your pickup truck saying \u201cAmerica f**k yeah!\u201d while demanding higher salaries for doing less work and more vacation time. \\nWhat has happened is that the world today is a lot more interconnected with the advent of social media, the internet, gloablization, and many of the new technologies\u2026 This makes it easier for people from all over the world to migrate where they will have a better life just like you honky Americans did when you came from the UK to America. The only difference is that for years you have been saying America is the best everything and now you can\u2019t just simply say that anymore; now you actually have to back it up and all you uneducated Republican Americans are finding out you\u2019re actually not the best at anything and that most of the world is quite smarter and harder working than you are and you simply can\u2019t deal with it so you blame the immigrants, eventhough you yourself are immigrants in the first place. \\nThe truth is that many of the immigrants that come here have had much worse circumstances and a far harder life which has taught them a good work ethic. We as Americans have been spoiled by our luxuries and now when these people that have a better work ethic than us come here we find it hard to compete and all we do is bitch and moan. \\nIf you want your jobs back then work harder and learn to compete with those that are better qualified and you will get them back. \\nLastly, the people that are hiring the the immigrants who are better qualified and that work for less are the white people anyway, so it\u2019s actually your own kind whos selling you out. glorp \\nwow the-truth-hurters appears to be a hate mongering ignorant liberal\u2026. so sad you call someone ignorant and hateful but ignore your own hate you spew from your poisoned mind\u2026 Ben \\nLiberals like the truth hunters are destroying this country. Illegal immigrants are taken food off legal Americans plates . These corrupt politicians are destroying are legal system. No legal citizen that own an real property is safe stand up dont support this don\u2019t buy into this! If u don\u2019t feed it it can\u2019t survive The-Truth-Hurters \\nYeah, anyone who has actual knowledge and some coherent logic of whats really going on in the US; and who doesn\u2019t just find some one to point their fingers at is a \u201cliberal.\u201d What a well put together argument you made, that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re kind is become obsolete. You\u2019re just another entitled white american conservative, who cant open their eyes and adapt to change\u2026 By the way I\u2019m not a liberal either, so try again. \\nThe greedy and immoral investment banks/corporations/corrupt politicians (conservative & liberal alike) are what has ruined this country, not immigration. If you have any education you\u2019d understand the complexity behind whats going on behind the scenes. It\u2019s wealthy white CEO\u2019s and investment bankers who control Washington, the FDR, our policies and politicians; and they are the ones who are selling your own kind out. \\nThe truth is you\u2019re misinformed and uneducated on how your government really works, and you are being brainwashed by your false american patriotism; which is exactly what the powers that be are depending on to control and manipulate you. I have nothing against you personally, and you don\u2019t have to agree with me and you\u2019re entitled to your own opinion\u2026 But come on, how can an immigrant who has no establishment/resources in a new country affect or control anything\u2026 That\u2019s ludicrous and things are not so black and white as you make them out to be. \\nCorporate white America and investment banks are the cause of all this. Wake up! The Vile Maxim by Adam Smith is what has ruined our country, not a handful of immigrants. Pedro A Lopez \\nI like the way you think. I am not illegal but I am from central, born an rase and the ignorance in this great country is sad. Charles Diemont \\nThey come here for work, and then send all the money back south. The-Truth-Hurters \\nLOL! No they don\u2019t. Do you have any empirical data to prove your ignorant claim? Any statistics to show? By the way, are you even aware that your avatar is an afghan fighter holding an ak47; which ironic since you\u2019re against foreigners. No personal offense intended, but it seems that you\u2019re not very bright or observant. \\nAnd so what if immigrants send money back home to help their families? I\u2019m a US born American and I would too if I was in the same situation. Nothing comes before family, definitely not patriotism to a country that\u2019s selling out its own citizens for corporate greed. If you were struggling in your home land and could have a better life in another country, don\u2019t tell me that you wouldn\u2019t migrate to where you could have a better life and do whats best your family\u2026 After all, that\u2019s what America\u2019s founders did in the first place when they founded this country. \\nTHIS LAND WAS THE NATIVE AMERICANS LAND, AND EVERYONE ELSE IS AN IMMIGRANT HERE! Let\u2019s see you prove that wrong\u2026 You have no right to say who can be here and who can\u2019t because this is not your country to do so! \\nFurthermore, you\u2019re so concerned about immigrants sending what little money they make back home, yet your \u201cAmerican\u201d corporations and investment banks are evading taxes and siphoning billions of dollars offshore\u2026 Yet that\u2019s fine! What an immigrant makes has no affect on the economy, however dirty companies like Apple and Google have enough money to end poverty and hunger worldwide (look it up -its a fact) and yet they don\u2019t put anything back into our economy and that\u2019s the real reason behind our crumbling economy. \\nYour lack of education is scary especially when considering a lot of \u201cpatriotic\u201d Americans like you are so uneducated and full of hate; and then they go and vote being completely misinformed. Please open a book and read about how our economy works and what the Vile Maxim is. Understand what\u2019s going on behind the scenes and how the privately owned FDR manipulates currency and inflation. Learn about how corporate and special interest lobbyists have demolished the ideals that this country was founded on, and you\u2019ll start to see that immigrants are nothing but a scapegoat and that you are being brainwashed and led astray by your gov. \\nThe population of this country is so dumb that a hateful fear monger like Trump may actually win the election! Why, because this is a nation of uneducated morons who have no clue about how their country really works. Southpark totally nailed it with their \u201cDey toook r jobs!\u201d Pull your head out of the sand and LEARN THE TRUTH! I love my country, but I hate the people in charge and the rampant ignorance among the general population. molon_labe \\nDo you have any empirical data to prove your ignorant claim that I\u2019m uneducated? And speaking of ignorant, it\u2019s a red dawn avatar dumbass lol get back to your bull prepping kayaker \\nIt\u2019s the CORPORATIONS and the WEALTHY that do the tax dodging. Wake up!!!! The-Truth-Hurters \\nYes I agree 100%. The greedy and immoral obscenely wealthy individuals/corporations/investment banks are the real problem. You are one of the few enlightened ones out there and that gives me hope that others will catch up and see also see the truth. Pedro A Lopez \\nWow help ruin the country.

I have lived in Mexifornia for 42 years and the people who run this state have killed it. What\u2019s sad is that the UNIONS have taken control and these sheeple keep believing their lies so they keep voting for bull crap. Pelosi, Boxer, Feinstein, Moon-Beam Brown, Newsom, Waters, these are some of the biggest morons to ever hold office. They even shut down our farm lands to save a freaken fish. Stupid people and I can\u2019t wait to leave\u2026. B \\nMeh, the author doesn\u2019t live here. More than half of that rant is opinion, another 45% doesn\u2019t make sense/is not substantiated. Plenty of work, the state govt isn\u2019t broke (in fact we now have a surplus), people here are still alive, lots of big business STILL here (intel, apple, google, Levi\u2019s, Tesla, Hollywood, Napa Valley, thd entire central Cali agricultural business, and so on\u2026). We STILL have TWO world class cities, so much natural beauty that songs, movies, poetry, have been created about it, people travel from the other side of the earth to see it, and residents get to see it daily. You can travel thru 5 climates in less than 3 hours. Nothing\u2019s free bitch. If u like nice things ya gotta pay for \u2019em. California is one of the largest states, is THE most populous, and by far the best looking \u2013 that\u2019s gotta be maintained\u2026 If ur a cheap-ass, move to fugly-ass Texass or some other Midwestern/southern donkey-#%\u20acer state where taxes are cheap but half the state is on welfare and in poverty and \u201cedumacation\u201d is not a priority according to the state representatives\u2026 \\nSo, Californians aren\u2019t leaving in \u201cdroves\u201d (so stupid). We are still here in CA enjoying life and laughing at the fools who are jealous and therefore feel the need to knock this awesome and crazy, delicious and beautiful, one-of-a-kind place. Erin \\nRIGHT ON BABY! YOU TELL \u2018EM! Austin \\nI moved to California 3 years ago this month, my sophomore year of highschool. I love it here and am not leaving for any reason other than travel when I can afford to. I have now graduated highschool and I\u2019m attending college in a quaint costal city. The first 15 years of my life was spent in a suburb of Atlanta and it is much better here IMO. I live on the border of Encinitas and south carlsbad (la costa) and use the beach as a daily getaway. While the tourism gets annoying its wonderful meeting so many people everyday. There are very few cops away from the freeway I drive at least 30 minutes a day and usually see one cop but there is very very little crime in this area of San Diego county. I know big cities can be fun if you\u2019re visiting but they are the majority of reasons you have listed to not live here. I definitely felt more of a sense of community where I\u2019m from in Georgia but once you make friends out here and fall in love with the ocean and bays/activities you can do around them you realize it\u2019s a different kinda love. & where I live there are very few Mexicans. Just find the right area if you wanna live here (preferably on the coast not in a major city) and you may love it like me. I\u2019m 18 and hope to live past 50 stayin in this beautiful state. Most importantly if you want to get away from people there are canyons even in the coastal cities with trails all over the place and there\u2019s few to none people and they\u2019re usually gorgeous. Checkout Encinitas if you want to get away from big city lifestyle. Later everyone! Fr33th1nk3r \\nThe biggest thing I cannot stand since moving here from Pennsylvania 10 years ago\u2013 is the overwhelming conformity and materialism here. Everybody in California seems to listen to the same terrible mainstream music, the same crappy trendy movies and TV reality shows, and they all spend more time talking about their iPads and mobile devices than worrying about education or the nation as a whole.\u2013 \\nEverything here, from the pizza to the beaches, is overhyped and made out to be the best thing to happen since sugarless gum\u2013 but in reality, you will get the cheapened, watered down, overmarketed and overpriced California version.\u2013 Everything is overregulated. You can\u2019t even enjoy a beer on the beach without getting a citation. You can\u2019t even change a doorknob in your house without some local government code enforcement type trying to tack on fees and fines for your troubles.\u2013 The graduation rate for public schools in California is abyssmal. Rai \\nHey, could you do me a favor and link reliable sources and stuff that actually backs up your claims more often? Because when I see breitbart and articles that don\u2019t really prove your point upon closer inspection I tend to think you\u2019re a liar. The carbon tax article you linked had \u201ccould\u201d in the title, meaning it doesn\u2019t prove it\u2019s even happening in the first place. \\nThen again, when I look at this blog title you\u2019re probably just as reliable as breitbart. Anonymous \\nI am a fifth generation northern Californian and all I have to say is that some of these issues can happen ANYWHERE. For example, you can\u2019t prevent earthquakes, mudslides, or wildfires and its not like we WANT them to happen, we just can\u2019t control them. I\u2019m not trying to rag on anyone, so please keep the negative comments out of this. I do agree that at this point in time our government and school systems are screwed up and that illegal immigrants are also screwing up our state\u2019s balance, but everyone just focuses on CA with immigrants\u2026 What about Arizona, New MEXICO, and Texas? While I\u2019m at it, the traffic is only bad in SOUTHERN CA (I know this because I\u2019ve lived in the Bay Area my ENTIRE LIFE, never moved never wanted to) and this whole thing is blown out of proportion. By the way, I know about that city that banned smoking and it was for the good of the people, smoking causes lung cancer and cigs have such harmful things in them that they should be banned ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I also know that Oakland is one of the worst cities in CA and that its also one of the most dangerous cities, too, but that doesn\u2019t mean that ALL of CA is dangerous. Also, even though it doesn\u2019t state it here, keep your stereotypes to yourself! Californians aren\u2019t blonde moron surfers with nose jobs and Botox, we are actual people, not the fake characters on tv shows. pysco \\nI forwarded the article to Boxer, Brown and Feinstein, and told them have a nice day.

MA \\nI am a native to California, and I still live here. I do not plan to leave or move any where else any time soon mainly because I love this state. There is so much to do. I would hate living in, for example, Georgia. Not only is there nothing to do there, but there are racist people, and well I would not want to deal with that considering that I\u2019m not white. It is more excepting here. Mainly in Southern California, because there is everyone. I would hate to be surrounded just be one race. Plus, weather is unbeatable compared to other states. It does get hot, and cold, but not nearly as much compared to other states. \\nI love California (Mostly Southern) and I am not leaving. Blue Blooded Californian \\nWow so biased its funny. No state is perfect, that being said this person failed to talk about some other things. California accounts for 15% of the U.S gdp, this state alone makes more then Canada, or Russia. If California was a country it would be the eight largest economy in the world. Texas as everyone seem to be talking about, let me say some things about that. Highest un-insured rate, and one of the highest poverty rate, No state minim wage which means that they follow the fed min wage, which is $7.25 (San Francisco min wage $10.75) oh and lets not forget how much federal aid Texas has and still keep getting. Where as for California, who does have problem (I admit that) is giving more back to the govt then its taking in. Based on several economist California is on track for a surplus in 2014. California has movies, tech, agriculture, its own cuisine I can go on and on. Texas and every other conservative states takes more then its gives out. Which really makes one to rethink, the premise about takers and givers does it!! \\nSo stop your bitching because everyone who has every come to California would love to move here, they just can\u2019t afforded it. If you don\u2019t like it, leave.

I can acknowledge that the economy in California is suffering, but at least educate yourself on what\u2019s really going on before you mindlessly bash all the \u201cliberal douchebags\u201d.

Now, we have a Democrat super majority in the state\u2026 Re-read the list and see what they have done to drive businesses out of the state. Most of that was because of the liberals. The cities with the most liberal policies (in California) are the most expensive and crime-ridden places to live in. Also, some of the most successful businesses in California tend to be Democrat-leaning. www dot goodguide dot com slash contributions. sinjonsmith \\nIf its so bad, then why to real estate values continue to go through the roof? Real Estate is like any other market or commodity. People pay high prices for highly desired goods. People pay high prices for California real estate because its a desirable place to live and although it has a LOT of problems, I can name 10 other states with worse problems including all the rust belt states (iowa, wisconsin, mich, indiana, ohio, illinois) where there is an exodus of people to get away from failing infrastructure, corruption and rising taxes to pay for it all..not to mention bad weather..and extremely poor southern states that have NO economy..mississippi, alabama, south carolina and Florida where the education system is worse than california\u2026as well as some states with huge budget problems out east like Jersey\u2026I\u2019ll take california any day over any of these other states..California\u2019s economy alone is the 12th largest in the WORLD and the US would take a huge hit if it didn\u2019t exist..I don\u2019t live in CA, but imo if you want to start a page on how much a state sux, start elsewhere\u2026oh another thing about everyone crying about illegals\u2026like cali is the ONLY place where that happens\u2026its the ONLY place where people come over the border\u2026Its a National issue idiots..and we have plenty in Chicago\u2026I own real estate and without them, id have to pay some other white fat dude 5 times as much to work half as hard and do 1/10 as quality of work who\u2019s probably in a union\u2026oh which this page ironically hates because probably because unions are left leaning\u2026 James \\nEvery time the state legislature de-funds or disapproves a highway/bridge/public university repair project on the annual budget, people pass a $1B bond ballot measure during the next election to get the state into more debt and re-fund that particular effort. Voters in CA fail to realize that a new university center or highway overpass is nice, but somebody has to pay for it by raising state debt (often paid for with new taxes). I used to live there, and every election had millions of new bonds to be raised for somebody\u2019s pet project on the ballot. My rule when voting was 99% of the time \u201cNo\u201d if it required a new municipal bond to be raised, especially if it was an attempt to circumvent the regular budget process in Sacramento. James \\nCA is also one of the few states where a $100K income may not be enough to buy real estate. A down-payment on a CA home can pay the loan in full for an average home in many other states. People in high cost living areas (LA, SF, SD, etc\u2026) take out huge mortgages and cram 10 people in a small home to pay their mortgage every month. It\u2019s no coincidence that many of the homes shown being flipped on HGTV are located in CA. Unless you\u2019re rich, bought a home 25 years ago, or inherited property from a relative, or resort to shady funding methods (i.e. share mortgage payment with 6 people, take out multiple loans, etc\u2026) it\u2019s tough to buy real estate in CA.

It\u2019s disgusting really. Yes our state has major problems but we are ALL U.S citizens. Treat others as you wish to be treated. Did it ever cross your small mind that maybe people from California treated you poorly because of the way you decided to treat them? Treat people with respect, we all come from different places and different walks of life. Do you agree with the Holocaust, slave trade, Native American treatment, and all the other major in tolerances in history? Think before you write\u2026.because you are clearly defining how NOT to be a decent human being. EmeraldStar \\nI\u2019ve lived in Southern Cali all my life. After graduating college and going on to graduate school I decided it was time to leave. I moved to MI six months ago! Yes Detroit is bad, but it\u2019s like that one city is pulling the entire states reputation down. No matter how bad Detroit is, the rest of the state is SO much better than anywhere I\u2019ve been in southern Cali. Yes, I miss the diversity of people but here are some reasons a person my age would leave. The U\u2019s in Cali can take up to six months to let you know if you\u2019ve even been accepted. WMU let me know in less than two weeks. The cost of tuition and books are ridiculous when compared to the type of education you will be receiving (a BAD one). About 75% of students care about taking their education seriously and the rest are there for the financial aid. In SoCal it can take you months if not years (depending on what you do) to find a job, I found a job in less than a week in MI. The weather in amazing in CA and I miss the different cultures and their awesome food, but the pace is too fast, too many people are stressed out and are either jaded or jerks (not all, but there is a overhanging stress level you can\u2019t really escape) When your worried about being laid off or making ends meat no wonder\u2026 Also, the crime! Theft is a huge issue in SoCal. Be it car, private property, or downright armed robbery. Gangs are a major problem in the L.A. area especially. Taxes are ridiculous and because larger companies know jobs are slim pickings they use it as an excuse to treat you like garbage. What are you going to do? Quit? Too bad you have kids to feed. Welcome to Cali, the suck it up things aren\u2019t getting any better soon state. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if it wasn\u2019t for the people and the politics Cali is my home and I love it in a weird \u201cthat\u2019s MY ugly baby\u201d kind of way lol. Beautiful beaches, amazing deserts and mountains. I miss it sometimes. Then I read about a family that was murdered two miles from the high school I went to and NOPE! Glad I left. Best place to visit, but once you get past the fascination with this glamorous Hollywood lifestyle you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s all a lie. Hollywood and L.A. are full of hobo\u2019s and the whole city smells like urine and garbage. Except that small complex in little tokyo, then it smells like amazing asian food lol! Get the Golden state idea out of your head, that golds been tarnished for years : Shahhe \\nOh good god. I\u2019m fairly certain your what\u2019s causing the poor education rating in whatever part of California your living in. Please leave this wonderful state and the education rating will probably rise in literacy at least by tenfold. stassia \\nPlease stay there and everyone will be happy. Shahhe \\nIt is spelled with a C. And one wonders why Arizona scores lower than the rest on literacy. Shahhe \\nYou keep saying that yet you\u2019ve yet to leave. I don\u2019t think you realize that your wanted gone, please, feel free to go to Oklahoma or Utah, or even Texas or Florida. It matters not! All that matters is that you are to leave, as you claim you wish to, and as you are deeply wanted to by those in California before people like you came here hoping for free everything, then shocked when it turned out that the presence of so many like you tarnished it. So hopefully, with you gone, and staying gone this time, California will become fully back to the days of yore. So please, leave and don\u2019t come back once that happens. Not ever. Sorry. Davis Rivas \\nThe best thing about California is all the Freebies you can get, welfare, food-stamp, medicaid, free lunches, housing, etc..

Thanks guys. john \\nBOTTOM LINE\u2013Those that can\u2019t afford the California luxuries move to lesser states than bash California, cause THEY could not make it or be happy. I would NEVER leave California. Enjoy the snow, rain and cold. I WILL NOT! Have fun with all that. We have the best weed, the best weather and the hottest women. BOTTOM LINE\u2013There is always a story behind the story when someone bashes California. Some crazy people move from California to Oregon and convince themselves that 290 days of rain a year is better, GIVE ME A BREAK! lol @ the true Californians like me that laugh at you all. Have fun in your other state and remember when you are complaining about the cold or snow or grey sky, I\u2019m smiling with my shirt off smoking weed laughing at you fools. Melissa \\nI was born in San Diego 45 years ago and have never left. Oh, I wish you would get the word out so more people would leave California, and less people would come here. Then I could have less crowds, more parking, more room at the beach. Me and the millions of Mexicans will stay here in San Diego, we get along fine. Everyone who doesn\u2019t like it, please go awa . It\u2019s great because whenever I visit anywhere else I always notice: the weather really sucks and everything is so cheap! No sales tax? No state income tax? I am always blown away by states like this. That makes my dollar go a lot farther when I travel so fine by me. Orisha \\nThe drought is caused by The Hight Priest of the world in Solidarity against Gov. Brown and all the states unions in Solidarity against AwoGbade.

The high pressure system blocking rain in Pacific Ocean are the Ancestors spirits in Solidarity against the injustice of Gov.

As someone who has traveled and lived in other places, I can honestly testify that there\u2019s no better place to spend this precious life in. It\u2019s a beautiful place with beautiful souls. Not California \\nThe best thing I ever did was to move my family and company out of California. \\nI tried for years to sell my company, few were interested but none would buy it as long as it remained in California, and to be honest, selling it in California would has set us back two careers. \\nFound out by moving to Nevada we saved all the tax money California would have robbed from us. After a year in Nevada company was sold. we no longer live in Nevada but I will say we did leave Nevada a better place, and Nevada made us better people, Nevada gave use back the humanity California stole at every chance it could take. \\nCalifornia has the worst schools, the worst people the worst cops, the worst opportunity, brought on by the worst government, the worst everything you could image, it just plain sucks. \\nI went to court one time my attorney had everything laid out and the judge said I don\u2019t recognize that law, the attorney said here is a brief, judge said I don\u2019t recognize that law. \\nattorney said here is the law book already marked all you need to do is read it, judge said,,, you got it. he didn\u2019t recognize the law. \\nTo the judge my attorney said, you have already decided haven\u2019t you, the judge smiled, to make it short we won on appeal, the money held by the state was returned I moved it into Nevada, my company and my family, the guy that bought my company divested all the California holdings, big loss to the people of the state. \\nI have a buddy that is doing the same thing, pulling his company out of California and going to headquarters it in Nevada then divest all California holdings at a loss of another 900 jobs to the state. \\nWhen you look up the word looser, California is on the top of the list. \\nI should say I was born and raised in California, what I used to think was the best place on earth, Santa Clara, Then as we did better Dad moved us to Los Altos Hills. \\nI went for a visit to Northern California to see some friends, I bought a truck that ran on propane with a big tank, I didn\u2019t have to spend a dime on anything in that state. \\nI hate that state so much I will never spend a dime there. JULIA Dunkee III \\nThe Disney Hall Complex on that picture is usually under sold for concerts. The bar is lame, the restaurant prentious and overpriced, and it has all the chic of an airplane hanger. It has good acoustics and some great people come through but it is like mostly closed up during week. Poor Mex student work the usher roles and the mostly older elite types aren\u2019t interesting and dress like 1800\u2019s. It has these Sheriff deputies guarding I guess the 1% and they always look at me with why am I here faces. Sad place. Homeless vets live underneath bridge it sits on. That says it all. JULIA Dunkee III \\nHollywood is supported by the economic engine of Nail Salons, Tattoo Parlors, Weed Shops, and Hooker Wear type stores. At night it has some Blade Runner type nightclubs that are from the low level to Hollywood crowds, but unlike other cities the PAPS can do whatever so it\u2019s always crazy that way. Tourists keep coming though it is grimy, dirty and no stars except on premieres which are hugely policed and controlled. All Hollywood Blvd. has hidden cams that are watched from a special station. The LA is considered a \u201cgateway\u201d city and employs the TrapWire Surveillance system. Plus it is usung drones now to like Arizona. JULIA Dunkee III \\nIt is not well understood by most but the Hollywood smarter money has left LA or is trying to. It is more than taxes. Many people come in for the Media Industry but there is a sizable exodus judging by home listings in any real estate listing service. The LA TImes is total BS propaganda that even locals call out all the time. It is strange because a lot of the moneyed are exiting fast. ANd it gives me creeps cause these people already can avoid most things. I think some event is scheduled here. I think others are aware of that too.

I just had to point out observation after reading all of these racist comments. If you\u2019re not a CA resident, you are reading some random stats that do not necessarily reflect the economic status of my neighborhood.

Unfortunately, it has too many crappy people and crappy leaders. rogersan \\nYou forgot the epic drought going on right now\u2026 allfab \\nA reason why it is one of the best: the writer of this article doesn\u2019t live here. taylor \\nThis articles retarded. Its repeats the sames stuff over and over again. We have higher wages anyhow to hiving higher taxes makes sense, derrr. sdreal \\nWow, I might as well just leave the CA after reading this. Haha. \u2013 I love living in Southern CA and I have a well paying job selling software to high tech industries. I can travel anywhere in the west, but I mostly choose to stay in CA because that is where most of the money is\u2026 and who wants to go anywhere else unless absolutely necessary? Certainly, Texas is always lowest on my list of places to visit. Outside of Austin, it\u2019s a cultural vacuum and in the summer it\u2019s hotter than an oven. Plus, outside of oil, the industries aren\u2019t nearly as robust and dynamic as those in CA. \u2013 Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s interesting that some of the biggest and most innovative companies on the planet, like Apple and Google, are based in California? Guest \\nAs all those people leave, the nutty liberals remain behind and their power grows. The growing number of poor will go along with whatever they say so long as the benefits keep coming and increasing. Eventually the state is going to bust and then they\u2019ll howl for DC to bail them out, and DC probably will. Anon \\nArizona especially is awful. You want to talk about a piece of trash, it\u2019s Phoenix burning rubber smell and angry, flaring inferno environment in July. izzycafe \\nWe have a democratic super majority and they are driving our great state into the likes of Detroit city.. only it will be the whole state. The thinking is tax and put fees and regulations on everything.. they need, more and more and more, they think it will produce more revenue to help with the unsustainable retirement and pensions of government worker. The thing is, that never ever works.. and like a horrible cancer it kills all things that are good. molon_labe \\nBeen there. Beautiful state, nice people up north, but the cities, I wouldn\u2019t go near there if you paid me 7 figures. I was so disgusted I will literally cheer if an earthquake breaks it off into the ocean. I\u2019ll stick to the lone star state and the south where the people have manners. Chin Sims \\nNo, New Jersey is the worst. Way f__king worse. christopher umsted \\ndont even need to read this to say that california life sucks only reason y i did cuz of a hw assignment even though me and my fellow classmates are living it Smeagel4T \\nOdd how housing prices just keep rising, and rising, and rising\u2026 which is a very clear free market indication of demand. Lee \\nI can create a list about every state in the union and tell you why it\u2019s the worst state\u2026.it\u2019s not hard to do. To me it just looks like this website is about fear. It promotes the idea that the world economy it\u2019s going to collaps and so you need to buy Good and Silver. Sugarsail1 \\nBorn and raised in California\u2026it sucks for all the reasons mentioned above. Too many socialist politically correct fascist enviro-whack jobs from the bay area running the show and the anti-business regulation has killed the middle class and the job market. The only people that do well here is people on some kind of government subsidized business, like healthcare, welfare, or green boondoggles or Limousine Liberals in Hollywood with more money than brains. Sooner or later they will run out of other people\u2019s money and they will have to build a wall to keep Californians from escaping to Mexico. The only reason to live here is the weather and the weed and even the weather sucks in the North (the weed doesn\u2019t). molon_labe \\nCalifornians. Since your voted for it, please keep yourself confined within it\u2019s borders. It\u2019s only right to make you deal with the issues you brought upon yourselves. Moving to a different place and dragging that down too isn\u2019t fair to people whovote with common sense. inverse137 \\nThere are some good points in this article and a lot of stupid personal opinions. You are better off sticking with facts than conjecture. Conjecture makes you look stupid and weak. \\n34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 48 and 51 are just whining without facts. NUMBERS. You cannot dispute hard numbers. I would have listed it like: the average commute time in california is XX and the national average is YY. \\nWhat is listed in those instances is just filling space. New York boy \\nEveryone dissing California sounds like a bunch of bitches! And would lay out your incredible boring lives. kayaker \\nWhat a biased piece of propaganda. CA is way ahead of the rest of the nation in addressing climate change, re-localizing of food growing, promoting solar, etc., etc., etc. It has lots of problems, but at least is doing things a lot smarter than the vast majority of the U.S. which is going backwards. Tyler \\nAre these statistics even real? Some seem a little bias. However I am California Native, Los Angeles to be exact and will all of the problems that we do have going on, I love my state! When I travel people are amused and want to be surrounded by beaches and celebs. Many others states hate and I can\u2019t relate. Vacationing to other states is wonderful however, I will NEVER ever move out of California. Guest \\nHave you Californians ever thought about independence? you are an economic global power house on your own! (the state has the 8th largest economy on the planet even larger than India and nearly as large as Russia!!!) cgoofies \\nIt is very competitive, with people I don\u2019t believe should be holding these jobs I went to school for. Then they can\u2019t leave because they are like sardines usually commuting and not spending quality time working. Beautiful I agree, needs to be demolished and rebuilt, possibly. jackass \\nyou can say that about any politician, not all dems are bad, not all reps are bad. DW \\nAll Dems are bad in California, because there is no competition for them and they know they will be re-elected no matter what as long as they hold out that welfare check and keep on letting in illegals. Working class families are in the minority now, so the welfare and public assistance crowd are in charge of who gets elected. In other words, the inmates have taken charge of the mental institute. TangoWhiteTrash \\n#54 though. Why is it so hard to understand, we don\u2019t want you! I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all wonderful people, but bringing the same ideologies which caused the problems you\u2019re now running from with you will only ruin us too. Please, solve your problems, we\u2019ve got our own things to worry about. Thor \\nAccording to Californians, Cupernicus was wrong. All of the planets ,moons, stars, etc. do not revolve around the sun\u2026. The sun, moon, planetss and all of the heavens revolve around california!! I dont live there and wouldnt want to visit since california attempts to control how every other state operates, why bother TheTruthburns \\nI lived in California when it Was The Golden State \u2013 I now refer to it as the Golden Toilet Bowl. Sadly if enough states act like California then those of us who can\u2019t take it will have to move to another Country. Man \u2013 what the hell ever happened to the Good Ole USA? Gregory Chandler \\nCalifornia\u2019s government leaders tend to have the attitude, this is California so we do as you please. This attitude is the same among liberals and conservatives. Many people who live in California conduct a substantial amount of business elsewhere. Therefore, you get the beauty of California without all of the silliness. Craig Hempfling \\nCan\u2019t wait for a good 9.9 quake to get rid of Gov. Brown and the rest of you idiots a-0 \\nI have been traveling to Nor cal for years for work. I consider all of california north mexico at this point. I conceal a firearm against state laws due to the out of control crime situation. I am also starting to pull all of my buisness out of state, if only i could do it sooner. Jules \\nForgot one huge thing on this list. California has the worst worker\u2019s compensation in the country. It\u2019s pro employer and con injuried worker. 90% of all major claims are denied even though multiple doctors including state issued QMEs (Qualified Medical Evaluator) agree that care is needed. In addition after a claim is denied an anonymous IMR (independent medical review) can deny the claim without reasoning nor can ever be identified. Also worker\u2019s compensation payouts are the worst in the country even though we pay the most into it and have one of the highest cost of living. TexanForever \\nAfter working there for 40 years I retired back to west-central rural Texas and haven\u2019t regretted it one moment. I miss the beaches, ocean, \u201cCatalina Eddy,\u201d and the sound of seals barking at night as I go to sleep. But the crazyness brought on by the gang-bangers, the crazy Southbay Curve on the 405, the feel-good looney libs, the overly complex rules, the taxes, and Governor Moonbeam (not once but twice), makes it just not worth it. \\nDeer now come up into my yard at night to graze on the bermuda grass lawn. People drive down the streets at an unhurried laid-back 20 mph and wave at each other, whether sitting on porches or in pick-ups. \u2026 even though they might not know each other. Kids say \u201cyes ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cno ma\u2019am,\u201d and adults do too, regardless of age differences. It\u2019s a more civil way of life. There are loaded pistols, rifles, and shotguns in every house but there is virtually no crime, and no one ever gets shot. I can go to town and leave all my doors open and unlocked. \\nCan\u2019t say I don\u2019t miss California, but it\u2019s the old California I miss, not the insane place it has become, thanks entirely to the Marxist liberals. Fembot220 \\ni don\u2019t like California that much. Nor cal is a hard place to live and off the charts when it comes to cost of living. I\u2019m moving to the Midwest where people are conservative and you can rent a house for what you would pay for a crappy closet sized apartment out here. Wayne baumback \\nSounds like a little jealousy. Facebook, Apple, twitter, google, tesla, Intel, eBay, craigslist, oracle, and can go on forever are doing so poorly, high taxes and govt regulations. Even mitt Romney campaigned against high taxes and govt regulation, then lost the election and moved to calif.'"}, "time": 1742562101.2406294}
