If the British government want to improve matters, they should come and talk to the city of Calais,\u201d he added. \\nMignonet invited Prime Minister Theresa May to visit the town, and even offered to give her a covert ride from the airport. \\n\u201cI have a car with dark windows, so she doesn\u2019t have to be seen,\u201d Mignonet said. \\n\u201cCalais was once part of England, and we have often worked together in the past. We can work together again. The people of Britain made their choice about Brexit, and some of those choices mean they will face difficulty, but putting walls and fences up here is not right.\u201d \\nThe wall, which is seen as a blight on the coastal town, could also affect the price of the land once occupied by the Jungle camp, which will soon be ready for private development. \\n\u201cThis is at the door of England, and near to the shuttle terminal for trucks,\u201d Mignonet said. \u201cWhat better place for British businesses to come?\u201d Tighter border \\nThe British public appears unmoved by French concerns. A new poll suggests most Brits would rather see their borders tightly secured than stay in the single market. \\nAccording to a poll commissioned by ITV, 58 percent of Brits approve of May\u2019s Brexit strategy of prioritizing immigration controls over the negotiation of the UK\u2019s access to the single market. Only a quarter were against. \\nJust over 40 percent of those asked insisted EU trade benefits should be prioritized throughout the divorce. However, a similar Sky News poll found the opposite to be the case. \\nA breakdown of the data, however, showed twice as many older Brits support May\u2019s \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 and immigration control policies as the younger demographic. \\nVia RT .
