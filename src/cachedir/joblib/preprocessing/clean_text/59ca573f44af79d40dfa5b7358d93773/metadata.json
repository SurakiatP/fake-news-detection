S. and likeminded countries on Syria, or embrace Iran, militant group Hezbollah and embattled Syrian leader Bashar Assad. [As he embarked on a trip to Moscow following urgent meetings in Italy with top diplomats, Tillerson said it was unclear whether Russia had failed to take seriously its obligation to rid Syria of chemical weapons, or had merely been incompetent. But he said the distinction \u201cdoesn\u2019t much matter to the dead. \u201d  \u201cWe cannot let this happen again,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cWe want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,\u201d Tillerson added in remarks to reporters. \u201cOr Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia\u2019s interests longer term. \u201d Since the U. S. launched airstrikes against Assad\u2019s forces in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians last week, Trump administration officials have offered mixed messages about whether Washington believes Assad definitely must surrender power  \u2014   and when. Tillerson said it was clear the U. S. saw no role for Assad in Syria\u2019s future, given that he had lost legitimacy. \u201cIt is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we are not presupposing how that occurs,\u201d Tillerson added. He said the   talks that Russia and Iran have helped broker in the Kazakh capital, Astana, could generate momentum toward broader talks about a political transition  \u2014   if the Astana talks succeed in creating a durable  . The resulting political talks would take place under the auspices of the United Nations process in Geneva. \u201cTo date, Astana has not achieved much progress,\u201d Tillerson said. Tillerson spoke after a meeting of the \u201clikeminded\u201d countries was hastily arranged on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized economies in Italy, days after the U. S. for the first time launched airstrikes against Assad\u2019s forces. A key focus since the chemical attack has been on increasing pressure on Russia, Assad\u2019s strongest ally, which has used its own military to keep Assad in power. The U. S. and others have said that Russia bears responsibility for the deaths of civilians at the hands of Assad given Moscow\u2019s role in guaranteeing the 2013 deal in which Assad was supposed to have given up his chemical weapons arsenal. The U. S. raised the stakes significantly on Monday when a senior U. S. official said Washington has made a preliminary conclusion that Russia knew in advance of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons attack. Yet the U. S. has no proof of Moscow\u2019s involvement, said the official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity. That accusation will hang over Tillerson\u2019s visit to Moscow, where he plans with meet with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and possibly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin declined to say whether Putin would meet with Tillerson, in line with its usual practice of not announcing such meetings ahead of time. The United States has sought to minimize expectations for the trip or the likelihood that the U. S. will leave with any concessions from Russia regarding its support for Assad. Instead, the U. S. is hoping to use the visit  \u2014   the first by a Trump Cabinet official to Russia  \u2014   to convey its expectations to Moscow and then allow the Russians a period of time to respond. Though intended to punish Assad for a chemical weapons attack, the U. S. strikes last week served to refocus the world\u2019s attention on the bloody war in Syria, now in its seventh year. Diplomats gathered in Italy as U. S. officials in Washington floated the possibility of new sanctions on the Syrian and Russian military, plus the threat of additional U. S. military action if Assad\u2019s government continues attacking civilians. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting in the walled Tuscan city of Lucca, the   countries were joined by diplomats from   nations including Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The inclusion of those countries is important because the U. S. strategy for Syria involves enlisting help from Mideast nations to ensure security and stability in Syria after the Islamic State group is vanquished.'"}, "time": 1742563103.90355}
