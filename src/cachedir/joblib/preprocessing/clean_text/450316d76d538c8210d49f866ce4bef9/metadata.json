It also suspends refugee arrivals for 120 days, ends the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and sets a limit for refugees in the 2017 fiscal year at 50, 000 people. It represents a fulfillment of a key Trump campaign promise. Those initially detained at the nation\u2019s airports included several with the legal right to reside in the U. S. apparently including some children who were U. S. citizens traveling with   parents  \u2014   prompting criticism of the order\u2019s implementation. At least some of those were apparently later allowed to continue into the U. S. In 2011, the Obama administration suspended the resettlement of Iraqi refugees in the U. S. after two Al Qaeda terrorists were discovered living in Kentucky as refugees. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
