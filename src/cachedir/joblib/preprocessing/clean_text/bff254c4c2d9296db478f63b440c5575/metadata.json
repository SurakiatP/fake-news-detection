What she doesn\u2019t know is that he crunches numbers for international criminal organizations out of a strip mall. And has    firearm skills. Ms. Kendrick found a kindred spirit in Mr. Affleck, whose filmmaker\u2019s sensibility and straightforward approach helped turn the set of Gavin O\u2019Connor\u2019s thriller  \u2014   a sort of \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d for the C. P. A. crowd  \u2014   into a model of efficiency. \u201cWhen it came down to it, he was very practical about how we were going to basically get our scenes in the can,\u201d she said. In a recent interview from Los Angeles, where she was scrambling to catch a flight to London, Ms. Kendrick, 31, pondered her very busy year, including DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cTrolls\u201d and a memoir, \u201cScrappy Little Nobody,\u201d both out next month. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You\u2019ve been all over the place recently. I made a lot of movies in the last couple of years, and they\u2019re all coming out right now. I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m oversaturating my own market. But by next year, there will be at least a year of not, like, constantly my face in everybody\u2019s business. Was this your first introduction to Ben? We had met years ago, and he was seated next to me and had not brought his glasses or worn his contacts and was asking me who everybody was. And then I pointed out the Jonas Brothers and had to explain to him who the Jonas Brothers were. You spent the last year writing a book. How did you land that gig? An editor approached me because they thought I was funny on Twitter, and then I wrote this piece in Vogue about the Oscars, and somebody went, \u201cWell, I guess if she wrote one article, she can write a book. \u201d Apparently people are allowed to make decisions like that. And these are essays? \u201cEssays\u201d is giving me too much credit. That makes it sound like I\u2019m Alexander Hamilton or something. Basically the idea was all the funny stories I wanted to put on Twitter but couldn\u2019t reduce to 140 characters. I\u2019m definitely amazed that writers can create things on a continual basis because I feel like my brain will never been the same. I feel like it drained my life power. Where did the title come from? From a conversation I had with my brother, wondering if I\u2019m still the same person that I was when I moved to Los Angeles and the worry that I was becoming complacent in my life. He assured me that I was still scrappy and still had a little   person inside of me.  ? I\u2019m very small, so I\u2019ve spent my life trying to talk louder and be stronger to overcome that. That\u2019s a quality that some people might think is objectionable, but I\u2019m kind of proud of it, so that\u2019s a quality that I\u2019d like to retain. In \u201cMike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,\u201d you played a crazy party gal opposite your BFF Aubrey Plaza. Was that a stretch? There are aspects of my personality that are a little persnickety, I guess one could say. But I do think that I play   characters more than it makes sense in my brain. Like, it\u2019s a surprise that people keep asking me to play professional women, because I\u2019m like, are you looking at the same person? This person is the person you want to play really professional and driven? I\u2019m falling apart. You\u2019re falling apart? Oh, yeah.'"}, "time": 1742564519.839844}
