Wallace, an author and faculty member at Northwestern\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, told an audience last week near the University of Chicago that a Christian fundamentalist \u201cin control of nuclear codes was a much, much greater threat\u201d than Islamic terrorists who \u201cneed to put bombs on their own children and send young men in to kill themselves\u201d in order to \u201cblow up a concert,\u201d the paper said. \\nWallace \u2014 a historian and \u201cChristian humanist,\u201d the Maroon said \u2014 noted that Christian fundamentalism has roots in the American South: \u201cThe religious right in its most contemporary form has an origin in Southern opposition to desegregation and to the Civil Rights Movement \u2026 a transparently racist appeal.\u201d \\nShe added that radicalism comes from a literal interpretation of the Bible. \u201cNobody in the ancient world would have read the Bible literally,\u201d she said, the Maroon reported, adding that a literal reading of scripture is a modern construct. \\n\u201cChristian fundamentalism is a malignant form of Christianity,\u201d Wallace said, \\nChristian Fundamentalism \u2013 Collins English Dictionary states, \u201cIs the belief that every word of the Bible is divinely inspired and therefore true and advocates strict adherence to the fundamental principles of that set of beliefs. \\nJesus and the Apostles would be considered fundamentalists. \\nJohn 8:24 Jesus said, \u201cI said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\u201d \\nJohn 10:1, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\u201d \\nActs 4:12, \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d \\nIn 2016, I am a fundamentalist. I believe that the Bible is the word of God, that it is the absolute truth and that it requires strict adherence to the doctrines taught in the Bible to be saved. \\nMatthew 24:3-4, \u201cAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?\u201d \\nIn response to this question, the first words out of Jesus\u2019 mouth were, \u201c\u2026Take heed that no man deceive you.\u201d \\nNever forget: \u201cA strict adherence to the doctrines taught in the Bible is absolutely essential for salvation.\u201d Join the Conversation'"}, "time": 1742561806.736555}
