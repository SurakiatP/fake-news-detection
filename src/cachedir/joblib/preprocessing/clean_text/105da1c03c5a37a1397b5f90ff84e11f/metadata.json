She was 89. The cause was cancer, her agent, Anne Alvares Correa, said. \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour,\u201d directed by Alain Resnais and written by Marguerite Duras, was one of the first internationally acclaimed films to emerge from the French New Wave, a movement that rejected classic cinematic storytelling with youthful irreverence. In the United States it was an   hit. \u201cWith his first feature film,\u201d Andrew Sarris wrote in The Village Voice, \u201cResnais has made the most important contribution to realizable film aesthetics since \u2018Citizen Kane. \u2019\u201d The movie opens with Ms. Riva, playing an actress who has come to Hiroshima to make a film promoting peace, and her   Eiji Okada, as an architect, in a lovers\u2019 embrace. Their faces are unseen and their limbs are covered in what appears to be ash, as if from a nuclear blast, that is then washed away. They speak in  . Ms. Riva says she has seen evidence of the bomb\u2019s effects in a hospital and a museum. But Mr. Okada rebukes her, over and over: \u201cYou saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing. \u201d She reveals tortured memories of an affair she had during World War II in her native Nevers, France, with a German soldier. Her living and dead lovers become linked  \u2014   as do the horrors of Nevers and Hiroshima. Looking back at it nearly a   later, the critic Michael Koresky said that Ms. Riva\u2019s performance was \u201cresponsible for much of the emotional heft\u201d of the film and that \u201cthe range of feelings that run across Riva\u2019s face is perhaps the most unforgettable element. \u201d Ms. Riva sensed at the time that \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour\u201d might turn out to be the creative peak of a film career that had just begun. \u201cI think I was particularly blessed because I put my trust in Alain Resnais,\u201d she told an interviewer at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959, when the film was shown there. But, she added: \u201cI feel like I might be a disappointment after this, because Resnais pushed me to excel. He made me reach certain heights. \u201d Paulette Germaine Riva was born on Feb. 24, 1927, in Chenimenil, in northeastern France, and grew up in nearby Remiremont. Her father, Ren\u00e9 Alfred Riva, was a sign writer her mother, the former Jeanne Fernande Nourdin, was a seamstress. An only child, she never married and had no children. Ms. Riva had wanted to act since she was a child, she later said, but felt that her ambition was circumscribed by her family\u2019s modest life in a rural village. She began performing in regional theater, but also trained as a seamstress before she entered acting school in Paris in her  . \u201cIf I had failed, I\u2019d be dead,\u201d she told the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cI did not have a second to lose. \u201d Her first role on the Paris stage was in Shaw\u2019s \u201cArms and the Man\u201d in 1954. Five years later, Mr. Resnais cast her as the nameless actress in \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour. \u201d In the decades that followed, Ms. Riva toggled from movies to stage work to television series. She distinguished herself in movies like \u201cL\u00e9on Morin, Priest\u201d (1961) but she never had another role as sensational as the one she played in \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour. \u201d \u201cI refused as many offers as I accepted,\u201d she told The New York Times in 2013. \u201cI refused commercial roles. But it was wrong, I have been too extreme, and I don\u2019t say it was good. \u201d Then the Austrian director Michael Haneke  \u2014   who told The Times in 2012 that as a young man he had been \u201ccaptivated\u201d by Ms. Riva\u2019s performance in \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour\u201d  \u2014   asked her to audition for \u201cAmour. \u201d \u201cClearly he wanted to see me again after all these years,\u201d she told The Guardian in 2013. \u201cI was in his head, perhaps. \u201d In \u201cAmour,\u201d Ms. Riva played Anne, a retired music teacher who is failing mentally and physically. Her husband, Georges, played by   Trintignant, devotedly cares for her. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis called them \u201ctwo titans of French cinema. \u201d  In an interview with the entertainment news website TheWrap. com, she said that Mr. Haneke had only one direction for her as she worked with Mr. Trintignant. \u201cWe were doing a scene,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand he said, \u2018It\u2019s very nice  \u2014   very sweet, very tender  \u2014   but it\u2019s too tender. No sentimentality. From here on in, no sentimentality.\u2019 This was the key that opened the horizon of the film. Once I heard that, it became much more clear. \u201d \u201cAmour\u201d won the Academy Award for best   film. Ms. Riva did not win the Oscar for best actress  \u2014   she lost to Jennifer Lawrence for \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d  \u2014   but she won the C\u00e9sar, the French version of the Oscar, and a Bafta film award, from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for the role. After the release of \u201cAmour,\u201d she said in an interview with The Times, she received a letter from a friend who wondered how she had aged \u201cso tragically in front of our eyes. \u201d She explained:  \u201cAnne is another person, it isn\u2019t me. It is a journey into someone else, someone I\u2019m not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628524.5062454}
