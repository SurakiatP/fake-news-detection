It was a less than tantalizing brew, perhaps. The story, which was never reviewed or reprinted, appears to have sunk like a stone. But now comes another rich revelation: The anonymously published tale was nothing less than a complete novel by Walt Whitman. The   \u201cLife and Adventures of Jack Engle,\u201d which was discovered last summer by a graduate student, is being republished online on Monday by The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review and in book form by the University of Iowa Press. A   tale of an orphan\u2019s adventures, it features a villainous lawyer, virtuous Quakers,   politicians, a sultry Spanish dancer and more than a few unlikely plot twists and jarring narrative shifts. \u201cThis is Whitman\u2019s take on the city mystery novel, a popular genre of the day that pitted the \u2018upper 10 thousand\u2019  \u2014   what we would call the 1 percent  \u2014   against the lower million,\u201d said David S. Reynolds, a Whitman expert at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. But it also, Mr. Reynolds and other scholars who have seen it say, offers clues to another mystery: how a workaday journalist and mostly conventional poet transformed himself into the author of the sensuous, philosophical, wildly experimental and altogether unclassifiable free verse of \u201cLeaves of Grass. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing the workshop of a great writer,\u201d said Ed Folsom, the editor of The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review. \u201cWe\u2019re discovering the process of Whitman\u2019s own discovery. \u201d That transformation was one that Whitman himself wished to obscure. He said little about the early 1850s, when he hung a shingle as a carpenter in Brooklyn and published almost nothing, working instead on what became the 1855 first edition of \u201cLeaves of Grass. \u201d Later, he all but disowned his successful 1842 temperance novel \u201cFranklin Evans or The Inebriate,\u201d and had little interest in seeing his short fiction revived. \u201cMy serious wish,\u201d he wrote in 1882, \u201cwere to have all those crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp\u2019d in oblivion. \u201d In 1891, when a critic was planning on republishing some of his early tales, he was blunt: \u201cI should almost be tempted to shoot him if I had an opportunity. \u201d That doesn\u2019t faze Zachary Turpin, the graduate student at the University of Houston who found the \u201cJack Engle. \u201d In fact, this is the second time archival lightning has struck Mr. Turpin. Last year, he announced the discovery of \u201cManly Health and Training,\u201d a previously unknown     treatise that Whitman published in The New York Atlas in 1858. \u201cA friend joked that that\u2019s what would be on my gravestone,\u201d Mr. Turpin said. The library of lost American literature includes many \u201cknown unknowns,\u201d as Mr. Turpin put it (channeling Donald H. Rumsfeld) like Herman Melville\u2019s \u201cThe Isle of the Cross\u201d (the eighth and final novel he may, or may not, have finished) and Whitman\u2019s \u201cThe Sleeptalker,\u201d a seemingly completed 1850 novel he discusses in his letters, but which does not survive. Mr. Turpin has made a specialty of looking for the \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201d using vast online databases that compile millions of pages of   newspapers. One day last May, he entered some names and phrases from fragmentary notes for a possible story concerning an embezzling lawyer named Covert and an orphan named Jack Engle  \u2014   one of many entries in Whitman\u2019s voluminous notebooks that the online Walt Whitman Archive had deemed to have no clear connection to any known published material. Up popped the advertisement that included the name Jack Engle. The serial was to run in The Sunday Dispatch, a New York paper Whitman was known to have contributed to. \u201cMy   was really tingling,\u201d Mr. Turpin said. Mr. Turpin ordered a scan of the first page from the Library of Congress, which held the only known (and as yet undigitized or microfilmed) copy of that day\u2019s Dispatch. A month later, he was stunned to open a file showing a yellowing page containing \u201cJack Engle\u201d and other names from Whitman\u2019s notes. \u201cI was at my  \u2019 setting up a Pack \u2019n Play, when the email arrived,\u201d he recalled. \u201cFrom that day until now, I\u2019ve had this simmering inside me. \u201d The   tale, published in six   installments, may not belong in the American literary canon. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great novel, though it\u2019s not a bad read either,\u201d said Mr. Reynolds, the author of \u201cWalt Whitman\u2019s America. \u201d Mr. Turpin called it \u201crollicking, interesting, beautiful, beautiful and bizarre,\u201d with antic twists, goofy names and suddenly revealed conspiracies that recall \u201ca   Thomas Pynchon\u201d or even, he ventured, \u201cIt\u2019s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. \u201d This may sound a long way from \u201cLeaves of Grass. \u201d But Jack Engle and the other raffish young male characters, Mr. Reynolds said, are reminiscent of the     persona  \u2014   \u201cWalt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs\u201d  \u2014   he created with \u201cLeaves of Grass. \u201d And then there\u2019s Chapter 19, which Mr. Folsom called \u201ca magical moment. \u201d Here, Jack enters the cemetery at Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, and the madcap plot grinds to a halt in favor of reveries about nature, immortality and the oneness of being that strikingly echo the imagery of Whitman\u2019s great work. \u201cLong, rank grass covered my face,\u201d says Jack, the   narrator. \u201cOver me was the verdure, touched with brown, of trees nourished from the decay of the bodies of men. \u201d Jack wanders among those bodies of men, copying out the inscriptions of the tombstones of Alexander Hamilton, the War of 1812 hero Capt. James Lawrence (of \u201cDon\u2019t give up the ship!\u201d fame) and other lost lives. Then, he exits onto the streets, where \u201conward rolled the broad, bright current\u201d  \u2014   and quickly and rather indifferently wraps up his own story. \u201cThroughout the novel, you constantly see Whitman wandering off the plot, looking for life in all the nooks and crannies of the city,\u201d Mr. Folsom said. \u201cWith the visit to the cemetery, where all plots end, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s suddenly lost interest in all plots  \u2014   or at least this plot. \u201d Today, we think of the radically expansive free verse of \u201cLeaves of Grass,\u201d with its wandering \u201cI\u201d who \u201ccontains multitudes,\u201d as one of the fixed signposts in American literary history. But in his notebooks from the early 1850s, Mr. Turpin noted, Whitman was toying with other forms for his great work. \u201cYou see him asking, Should it be a novel? Or a play, with thousands of people onstage, chanting in unison?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think that \u2018Leaves of Grass\u2019 could have taken a different form entirely. \u201d Mr. Turpin said the graveyard chapter put him in mind of \u201cCrossing Brooklyn Ferry,\u201d one of the most famous poems in \u201cLeaves of Grass,\u201d where Whitman declares, \u201cI am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence. \u201d But when asked how it felt to be the first in many generations to read Whitman\u2019s   novel, Mr. Turpin reached for another   line. \u201cWhitman said something really great: \u2018Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou really do start to believe it after a while. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562566.4120238}
