My Turkish brother citizens in Germany and brother ministers. \u201d The   \u201cModerate Islamist\u201d was referring to the Merkel administration refusing to allow the AKP to organise political rallies in Germany ahead of a Turkish referendum on 16 April. Germany is home to around three million Turks, and Erdo\u011fan has been keen to court them, as well as other European diaspora communities, in support of his bid to increase executive powers. Chancellor Merkel said the slurs broke \u201cevery taboo\u201d and disrespected genuine victims of the Nazis. She said she would consider revoking permissions for AKP campaign events which have already been granted if the insults continued. Erdo\u011fan has shown no signs of deescalating his rhetoric, accusing the Germans of \u201charbouring terrorists\u201d from Turkey\u2019s embattled Kurdish minority.
