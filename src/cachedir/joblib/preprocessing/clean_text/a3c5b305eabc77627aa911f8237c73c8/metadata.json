Yet more important to   Wang, the   Chinese entomologist who discovered and named it, the Rhyzodiastes (Temoana) xii eats rotten wood. That makes it a fitting symbol for Mr. Xi, whose campaign against official corruption is as important for China as the beetle\u2019s diet is for the health of its environment, Mr. Wang said in a telephone interview. \u201cPresident Xi is the same. He is fighting corruption. That is so important,\u201d said Mr. Wang, 32, who added that his discovery last year excited him so much he could not sleep at night. He not only named it for Mr. Xi but added the word \u201cwolf\u201d in Chinese, for good measure: \u4e60\u6c0f\u72fc\u6761\u810a\u7532  \u2014   literally, \u201cXi Surnamed Wolf Spine Carapace. \u201d (The last words indicate a beetle, which has a hard carapace, unlike the cockroach.) Mr. Wang\u2019s taxonomic gesture seems to have irritated China\u2019s vigilant propaganda bosses, who have moved fast to block references to the \u201cXi beetle\u201d from China\u2019s heavily censored internet. Searches for the beetle\u2019s name on Tuesday failed to return results. A Weibo search for the name in Chinese showed the message that \u201cdue to relevant laws and policies, results for \u2018Xi Surnamed Wolf Spine Carapace\u2019 cannot be shown. \u201d Still, many reports were available in Chinese outside the country\u2019s Great Firewall, meaning a growing number of people who use VPNs, or virtual private networks, could read these, too. In an email before the interview, Mr. Wang expressed concern that foreign news reports had portrayed him as \u201cbelittling\u201d Mr. Xi by comparing him to a small insect. (The beetle is 0. 3 inches long. Mr. Xi is   .) \u201cThey know nothing about entomology or taxonomy,\u201d he wrote, and \u201chave no idea about the meaning of a biological name!\u201d Indeed, some Chinese have been puzzling over the notion that a beetle could be named after their president, in a country where traditionally the leaders are shielded from criticism and anything that might be interpreted as ridicule. One website, Weiming Space, which is based in the United States but caters to Chinese around the world, even filed it under the \u201cjoke\u201d section on Monday. With the practice of naming new species for   figures common elsewhere, Mr. Wang said he saw nothing wrong with it. Mr. Xi\u2019s name is presented respectfully, he said: \u201cxii,\u201d or \u201cxi\u201d for Mr. Xi, adding the Latin \u201ci,\u201d to show a male possessive. Why isn\u2019t it called \u201cXi Jinpingi\u201d? \u201cIn Chinese, for such a famous person, it\u2019s a bit disrespectful to use the whole name,\u201d he said. \u201cThe surname is enough. \u201d Above all, Mr. Wang said he wanted to steer clear of politics. \u201cI am crazy on insects!\u201d he wrote in the email earlier on Tuesday. \u201cI love them. I do not want to make any trouble!\u201d \u201cI like Chairman Xi. Because of him, China is getting big and strong,\u201d he said. Like the president, \u201cThis beetle is rare, in 10 collecting trips I\u2019ve never seen one. \u201d Mr. Wang is hardly the first person to name a creature after a political leader. As a post on Weiming Space noted, President Obama has had a Californian trapdoor spider named after him, the Aptostichus barackobamai. Then there\u2019s Obamadon, an extinct, toothy lizard. Nelson Mandela had not only a sea slug named after him, but its whole genus and family, a bigger honor, the Mandelia mirocornata. Among the beetles, there is the Aegomorphus wojtylai named for Karol Wojtyla, who is perhaps better known as Pope John Paul II, and Agathidium bushi for President George W. Bush. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler got a blind beetle that lives in caves in Slovenia, the Anophthalmus hitleri. The gesture that was meant to be an honor started last year, when a colleague of Mr. Wang\u2019s found several specimens in the forested highlands of the island of Hainan, China\u2019s southernmost province. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t research beetles, he researches cockroaches, so he gave them to me,\u201d Mr. Wang said. Careful study of the new species followed in Mr. Wang\u2019s lab at the Czech University of Life Sciences, where Mr. Wang is a postdoctoral researcher. Then came a paper in the journal Zootaxa, dedicating the finding \u201cto Dr. Xi Jinping, the president of the People\u2019s Republic of China, for his leadership making our motherland stronger and stronger. \u201d One online commenter in China drew parallels between a nation\u2019s status and naming privileges for discoveries. \u201cWhat does beetle research have to do with the country\u2019s strength and size?\u201d asked echowuhao on Weiming Space, noting that for decades it was mostly foreigners who were in a position to identify and name insects. \u201cAs an undergraduate, I studied cockroach species. Before liberation\u201d  \u2014   the 1949 Communist revolution  \u2014   \u201cpeople naming cockroaches were mostly Japanese, and the specimens mostly were in Taiwan University. \u201d Taiwan was a Japanese colony before 1945. \u201cAfter liberation, it was mostly foreigners\u2019 names,\u201d echowuhao wrote. But all this has changed. \u201cAfter economic reform, our own people began to name cockroaches for themselves and their country,\u201d echowuhao wrote. \u201cClassifying insects, this kind of work is definitely something that only countries with spare money can afford to do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628472.632969}
