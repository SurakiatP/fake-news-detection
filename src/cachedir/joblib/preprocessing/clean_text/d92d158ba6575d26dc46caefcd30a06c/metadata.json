Instead, the administration will start from scratch, issuing a new executive order, the department said. Last Thursday, a unanimous   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked the key parts of the original executive order, which suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program as well as travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The panel said the original ban was unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny. The Justice Department said that the panel\u2019s decision was riddled with errors but that the flaws it noted would be addressed in the new executive order. \u201cRather than continuing this litigation,\u201d the Justice Department\u2019s brief said, \u201cthe president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns. \u201d \u201cIn so doing,\u201d the brief said, \u201cthe president will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially   litigation. \u201d In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the new executive order would be issued next week. In its brief, the Justice Department urged the appeals court to await the new order and then vacate last Thursday\u2019s decision. It is not clear that the issuance of a new and narrower executive order will make the case before the Ninth Circuit moot or that the court will agree to vacate the decision even if it did. The Supreme Court has said the \u201cvoluntary cessation\u201d of a government action does not usually make a case moot if the government remains free to resume the conduct after the case is dismissed. In calling for a legal   the Justice Department avoided a Supreme Court test of the original executive order. A    tie on the   Supreme Court would have left the panel\u2019s decision in place. Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, issued Jan. 27, caused confusion and protests at airports nationwide and was immediately challenged in court. Many federal judges blocked aspects of the order. The broadest injunction was issued on Feb. 3 by Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle, acting in a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. Judge Robart required the administration to roll back the key aspects of the order, and travel from the affected countries resumed almost immediately. The next day, the Justice Department filed an emergency appeal, saying that national security concerns required immediate action from the appeals court. The   panel heard arguments a few days later, and in a unanimous decision last Thursday, it refused to reinstate the ban. Many legal scholars, including ones who disapproved of the ban, have criticized the reasoning in the panel\u2019s ruling. The Justice Department\u2019s brief tracked many of those critiques, saying the panel\u2019s decision was plagued by misunderstandings about the scope of the original executive order and the president\u2019s authority to address immigration. \u201cIn other circumstances,\u201d the brief said, \u201cthe panel\u2019s multiple errors in sustaining a substantially overbroad injunction, and thereby prohibiting enforcement of a lawful executive order designed to protect the nation\u2019s security, would warrant\u201d review by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. \u201cSuch review is not called for at this time,\u201d the brief said, given the forthcoming executive order. In their own brief filed Thursday, Washington and Minnesota agreed with the administration on one thing: that no rehearing of the panel\u2019s decision was warranted. But the states argued that the panel\u2019s ruling had been careful and correct. \u201cThe panel\u2019s order thoroughly considered the legal precedent and the parties\u2019 arguments and neither overlooked nor misunderstood a point of law or fact,\u201d the brief said. The briefs came in response to a request from the appeals court. Last Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the   panel\u2019s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. If a majority of the court\u2019s active judges vote to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an   panel made up of the circuit\u2019s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. Rehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by   panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said. The Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges 18 were appointed by Democratic presidents. Even if the Ninth Circuit agrees to vacate the panel\u2019s decision, challenges to the original executive order will continue in other courts. And the new executive order may draw fresh legal challenges.'"}, "time": 1742628298.16181}
