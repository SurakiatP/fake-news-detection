The frigate will be provided with Indian equipment. This version (of the frigate) has stealth technologies, and we will participate in the design work,\u201d the minister was quoted as saying by the NDTV news channel. \\nIndia already has six frigates of the Talwar type \u2013 the predecessors of Project 11356, designed for export. The Indian ships entered into service in 2003-2004 and in 2012-2013. \\nThe standard patrol ship of the Burevestnik type is armed with Kalibr cruise missiles. However, as Minister Rogozin stated in Goa, the new frigates will be equipped with BrahMos cruise missiles, of joint Russian-Indian production. \\nFirst published in Russian by RIA Novosti .
