S. missile strike on a Syrian airbase said to have launched a chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians and threatened retaliation if further such attacks occur. [\u201cThe United States crossed red lines by attacking Syria, from now on we will respond to anyone, including America if it attacks Syria and crosses the red lines. America knows very well our ability and capabilities to respond well to them, [and] we will respond without taking into consideration any reaction and consequences,\u201d read the statement, as transcribed by ABC News.  \u201cRest assured that we will liberate Syria from all kinds of occupying forces, it does not matter from where they came to the occupied part of Syria,\u201d the statement added. \u201cRussia and Iran will not allow the United States to be the only superpower in world. \u201d According to the statement, Syria and its patrons are \u201cclosely and deeply following American forces\u2019 moves and presence\u201d in both Syria and Iraq and \u201cconsider them an occupying force. \u201d Russia and Iran stated, \u201cwe, as Syria\u2019s allies, will increase our military support toward Syria and support its people in many other ways. \u201d On Friday, Russia suspended military cooperation with the United States in Syria, including an end to the \u201cdeconfliction\u201d agreement that was meant to prevent accidental hostile encounters between Russian and American pilots. \u201cAmid the missile strikes, it is hardly reasonable to talk about any more increase in the risk, as the risk has increased considerably,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Over the weekend, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani urged \u201cthe Syrian people and army\u201d to \u201cgive a response that makes Americans regret their attack. \u201d \u201cAmericans have never acted within international frameworks, and one instance is the sanctions they impose against Iran, unreasonably considering themselves as the world\u2019s leader,\u201d complained Rouhani, who was hailed as a \u201cmoderate\u201d leader by the Obama administration.   notes that Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, designated a terrorist organization by the U. S. State Department, was a signatory to the   statement.'"}, "time": 1742564438.8893895}
