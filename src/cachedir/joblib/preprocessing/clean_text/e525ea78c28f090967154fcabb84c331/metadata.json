[Rep. Brad Sherman ( ) and other members of the Democratic caucus have been pushing for a vote on impeachment  \u2014   the natural consequence of months of   claims about Trump\u2019s actions in relation to alleged Russian interference in the election. Politico reported earlier this week that Sherman is prepared to buck his leadership in bringing a vote to the House floor.  Sherman claims that Trump\u2019s alleged request for former FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn amounts to an obstruction of justice and is, therefore, an impeachable offense. His motion would almost certainly be    in the House. But Sherman isn\u2019t the only Democratic lawmaker to float impeachment. Fellow California Rep. Maxine Waters was seen chanting \u201cImpeach 45\u201d on Sunday. Earlier this month, Rep. Al Green ( ) also called for impeachment and wants there to be a vote in the House. \u201cObstruction of justice by the president is the problem,\u201d Green said. \u201cImpeachment by Congress is the solution. \u201d Yet, while impeachment is always a popular word among Democrats\u2019   base whenever a Republican is in the White House, Democratic leaders are concerned about something Republicans are frequently accused of when the tables are turned  \u2014   overreaching. According to the Hill, leaders are worried that an aggressive push for impeachment will further politicize the investigation and undercut both the probe and Democrats\u2019 midterm election chances. Famously, Republicans were stung in the late nineties by accusations of overreach when they sought the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Rep. Steny Hoyer ( ) the minority whip, said that talk of impeachment was \u201cnot timely,\u201d according to the Hill. Meanwhile, Former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile was forced to deny Sunday that Democrats were overreaching. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t think the Democrats are overreaching. I mean this is about the integrity of our democracy  \u2014   democratic process. It\u2019s about what happened in 2016,\u201d she said on ABC\u2019s This Week. Axios reported that Democratic leadership wants to be careful using the   as the \u201cinvestigations haven\u2019t revealed enough yet\u201d  \u2014   a possible sign that Democrats were disappointed with Comey\u2019s testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee last week and that it revealed no apparent obstruction of justice. Other Democrats believe that the way to political victory is by focusing on the issues likely to decide the midterm race and the issues they were beaten on in 2016  \u2014   such as jobs and health care reform. \u201cWe need to be looking at the issues that matter to families at home, and that starts with jobs, health care, addressing the opioid crisis,\u201d Rep. Katherine Clark ( ) said earlier this month. \u201cWe can file articles of impeachment, we very well may have a basis, but Republicans have shown they\u2019re unwilling to criticize, to hold this president accountable,\u201d Clark said, according to the Boston Globe. \u201cLet\u2019s mobilize, get to the streets, register voters, and change the majority in the House. \u201d Other lawmakers though, while cautious for now, are still licking their lips at the chance of impeachment  \u2014   even egging Trump on to do something to trigger such a push. \u201cYou want a   car to impeachment? Fire Mueller,\u201d Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez ( ) according to the Hill. \u201cI dare you to do it. \u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
