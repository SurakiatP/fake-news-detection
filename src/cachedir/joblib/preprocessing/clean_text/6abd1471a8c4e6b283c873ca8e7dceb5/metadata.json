Trump, adding a decidedly unprintable modifier. The crowd on Sunday in Provincetown, Mass. one of the country\u2019s gay capitals, roared its approval at Cher\u2019s succinct and salty assessment. But the famed singer and actress was not just riffing between songs at a concert: She was introducing Hillary Clinton at a   for her presidential campaign. Cher did more than just blister Mr. Trump. She also offered a blunt appraisal of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. \u201cThis chick is just tougher than Chinese algebra,\u201d Cher said of the Democratic nominee. Prompting a mix of nervous laughter and applause, she added, \u201cShe is shy, and she\u2019s not the greatest speaker in the world. \u201d Cher said Mrs. Clinton had told her of being deeply affected by her failed effort to spearhead an overhaul of the nation\u2019s health care system in 1993. \u201cShe got so crushed by the G. O. P. just for trying to set up health care, and she never thought it would be so personal, and she said it made her kind of pull in. \u201d \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t mind my telling this story,\u201d Cher said, adding: \u201cToo late now!\u201d Her   remarks, recorded by an attendee and posted on Facebook, offered a colorful glimpse at a part of the presidential campaign that has been mainly   to the general public and journalists this election cycle. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have generally barred reporters from attending their  . As Cher demonstrated, the language used in private settings like the event on Cape Cod  \u2014   which brought in more than $1 million for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign  \u2014   can be more inflammatory and raw than what is said with a bank of television cameras present. And it was not just the entertainer, whose Twitter posts often employ a toilet emoji instead of Mr. Trump\u2019s name, who spoke bluntly. Mrs. Clinton, who often discusses how well she was able to work with Republicans during her tenure in the Senate, took the stage and acknowledged former Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, noting that he has been promoting a new bumper sticker. \u201cI think it is something like, \u2018Democrats Aren\u2019t Perfect  \u2014   but They\u2019re Nuts! \u2019\u201d said Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou understand that. \u201d But Mrs. Clinton, a portion of whose remarks was also posted online, was not onstage when Cher, 70, arrived to loud applause,   a few lines of her song \u201cWoman\u2019s World. \u201d Cher warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d was only a guise for a more divisive message. \u201cHe means, \u2018We want to make America straight and white,\u2019\u201d she said. And she belittled Mr. Trump for his stumbling reference at the Republican convention to the \u201cL. G. B. T. Q. \u201d community. \u201cIt\u2019s like he just learned it, you know?\u201d she said to laughter. Speaking without notes, Cher\u2019s performance was more of an   routine than a traditional political speech. \u201cDo you remember \u2018Fun with Dick and Jane? \u2019\u201d she asked, referring to the 1970s comedy. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Racist Fun with Dick and Jane.\u2019 We\u2019re going to build walls!\u201d Mr. Trump, she added, reminded her of the pigtailed blond actress Patty McCormack from \u201cThe Bad Seed. \u201d \u201cConsummate liar, doesn\u2019t care who she hurts, insane and, you know, sociopathic narcissist,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d fall off the face of the earth. \u201d Veering into more incendiary territory, Cher invoked \u201cold despots\u201d and received a subdued response when she mentioned Hitler and Stalin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make Germany great again,\u201d she said, before digressing to a bit on Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Even as she sought to use her closing comments to praise Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   \u201cI believe in her so much,\u201d she said  \u2014   Cher could not help but return to the object of her ire, Mr. Trump. \u201cI know that if he got into office, our world would be the worst place,\u201d Cher said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could imagine how bad it could get. \u201d She added that, \u201cif breaking news ever happened and he had to go to the podium, we would just all go . .. \u201d She finished her thought with a   expression of disgust. Then she walked off to a roar of applause.'"}, "time": 1742563783.794108}
