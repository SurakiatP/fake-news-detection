The former black lives matter spokesman, deposed after the discovery that he is white and not the African American he claimed to be, accused the NFL of being \u201cbigoted\u201d against black people because it hasn\u2019t hired   protester Colin Kaepernick. [King made his proclamation after it became clear that American anthem protester and former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick would not find a team to take him on after he became a free agent at the tail of last season.  Kaepernick spent the entirety of the   season refusing to stand for the national anthem and spoke out against the U. S. A. our police, soldiers, and other first responders. He also repeatedly said the country was \u201cnever great. \u201d But after the season ended, in February the player announced both his free agency and an end to his     protests. But despite his new status and his pledge to end his embarrassing protests, Kaepernick has not been able to find a team to hire him for the coming football season. His inability to find a berth has sparked numerous protests by   fans and   sports reporters alike. Kaepernick was even the subject of a politician\u2019s decree when a   socialist Seattle City Council member wrote an open letter demanding that the Seattle Seahawks bring him on. The demands ultimately fell on deaf ears. With Kaepernick left out in the cold,   football fan Shaun King now says he can\u2019t watch football anymore. \u201cI can\u2019t, in good conscience, support this league, with many of its   owners, as it blacklists my friend and brother Colin Kaepernick for taking a silent, peaceful stance against injustice and police brutality in America,\u201d King blathered in his June 6 column. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting and has absolutely nothing to do with football and everything to do with penalizing a brilliant young man for the principled stance he took last season. \u201d The white man who posed as a black man for a decade fulminated at Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll for turning his back on Kaepernick and signing white quarterback Austin Davis instead. King labeled Davis a \u201cscrub\u201d over the incident. King, who admitted that he lied about being black, went on to rail at the Seahawks for hiring Davis who has far fewer accomplishments in the NFL than Kaepernick. The activist insisted that there could be only one reason that the Seahawks took a pass on Kaepernick: It\u2019s racism. It\u2019s bigotry. It\u2019s discrimination. Period. It\u2019s not football. Don\u2019t call it football. If you call the decisions by 32 teams to not sign this man a football decision, you don\u2019t know football and probably voted for Donald Trump. Nearly 100 quarterbacks \u2014  96, in fact \u2014  are usually signed to teams in the NFL. That Colin Kaepernick is not one of them is disgusting. Of course, he\u2019s one of the top 96 quarterbacks in the league. Kaepernick\u2019s longtime rival, Richard Sherman, said he believed Kaepernick was a   quarterback. King went on to add that the \u201cridiculous fragility of the conservative white male fan base\u201d has kept Kaepernick on the sidelines. Finally, this very white \u201cblack activist\u201d added that his decision was sealed when ESPN announced that it had rehired country singer Hank Williams, Jr. to once again sing his iconic Monday Night Football theme song at the start of each Monday game. Williams had been fired six years ago for being a conservative. \u201cHank Williams, Jr. is basically Donald Trump with a guitar. He\u2019s a bigot,\u201d King growled. \u201cEverybody knows it. His songs and statements have echoed bigotry for years, but now that Obama is out of office, he\u2019s back. \u201d King continued, bellowing: Hank Williams, Jr. and Austin Davis are employed right now, and Colin Kaepernick isn\u2019t. Shame on this league for following Trump\u2019s lead in spirit, tone and now in actions. I\u2019m appalled. As a lifelong fan, I\u2019m deeply disappointed. What I do know is this \u2014  I can\u2019t support this product. Warming to his closing statements, King then blamed his little son for launching the boycott with a claim that his    boy told him they could no longer watch football, \u201cAfter what they\u2019ve done to Colin and with all of those owners loving Donald Trump so much. \u201d So, in the face of all this purported \u201cinjustice,\u201d King has set out on his road to boycotting the NFL: Maybe if Colin Kaepernick gets a deal, it would change my mind, but deep damage is already done. As a leader in the Black Lives Matter Movement, as a voice in the resistance to Donald Trump, and as a friend of Colin Kaepernick, I cannot, in good conscience, support the NFL any longer. If I did, I\u2019d struggle to look my own son in the eyes or look at myself in the mirror. As a reminder, King is boycotting a sports league that is almost 70 percent African American. It is a business where the average rookie salary is $365, 000 a year, a number that goes up by tens of thousands every year the player stays signed to an NFL team. It is also a league where the average player\u2019s salary is about $1. 9 million annually. This is the same sports league that Shaun King says isn\u2019t black enough and is unfair and discriminatory to blacks. But, this is also a man who directly equates   to being \u201ctolerant\u201d and right thinking.
