For days, a frustrated and simmering president fumed inside the West Wing residence about what aides said he saw as his staff\u2019s inadequate defense and the ineffectiveness of his own tweets. Over the objections of some top advisers who wanted to steer him away from confrontation, Mr. Trump demanded to face the media, determined to reject the narrative that his administration is sinking into chaos, scandal and incompetence. In a rowdy,    news conference hastily staged in the East Room, Mr. Trump attempted to deflect attention from news coverage about Russian intelligence, the resignation of his national security adviser, the defeat of his labor secretary nominee, and deepening questions about his ability to govern. \u201cI turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he attempted  \u2014   with little discipline  \u2014   to read from prepared remarks listing his accomplishments since being inaugurated one month ago. \u201cChaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine. \u201d From there he offered a disjointed and emotional performance in which he appeared to release   anger and suspicion about the \u201cdishonest media,\u201d Democrats, intelligence officials, \u201ccriminal\u201d leakers, Hillary Clinton, environmentalists and judges. Taking a room of reporters and the television audience on a journey through the Trump psyche, the president was at times angry (at the news media) playful (\u201cI love this,\u201d) bewildered (by \u201cbias and hatred\u201d) occasionally respectful (\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to be with you\u201d) and needy (\u201cI\u2019m really not a bad person, by the way\u201d). Ever the salesman, Mr. Trump painted his presidency as he wishes it to be: an Electoral College victory so massive it was historic  \u2014   a falsehood pointed out by a reporter in the room  \u2014   plus accomplishments in the first four weeks that have outpaced, he said, every other president. For his supporters, the performance was certain to be energizing. Mr. Trump turned sober questions from journalists into, at times, mesmerizing television. He attempted to reassert his command of \u201cdishonest\u201d journalists at a time when the news media is questioning his capacity to lead. It all made the brooding boss feel better, people close to Mr. Trump said. The news conference, they said, was Mr. Trump\u2019s best effort at spitting the bit out of his mouth and escaping the bridle of the West Wing, where he views his only way to communicate his side of any argument is his   limited Twitter feed. Still, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump\u2019s   performance will divert much   attention from questions about his campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia, or reassure wavering Republicans on Capitol Hill that their agenda is on track. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s close allies said he had met his more immediate goal of soothing himself with a sense of control over his own administration. Mr. Trump, who has long required employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, has been unnerved, aides said, by leaks big and small, ranging from disclosures about his evenings spent alone in the White House residence to the details of his calls with global leaders. Now, Mr. Trump finds himself at the mercy of a vast, leaky bureaucracy. \u201cThe first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that\u2019s classified? How do they do it?\u201d Mr. Trump said of the leaks. \u201cThe press should be ashamed of themselves. \u2019\u2019 The news conference was not without its high points for the embattled president. His initial statement about a surge of optimism in the business world and more jobs was, however fleetingly, a focused message on the issue that helped elect him. And he lured a few reporters into a trap of debating the quality of their reporting as opposed to the merits of their original questions. And after complaining to aides about the dour delivery of his press secretary, Sean Spicer, at the daily televised briefing, Mr. Trump laced his own banter with humor. But he also revealed how crushing he is finding the onslaught of criticism that a president receives, saying that he has long preferred the business media to the political press corps he must now deal with. With the same lack of discipline that his supporters on the campaign trail found refreshing, Mr. Trump lashed out at the news media, which he called \u201cout of control. \u201d He accused The New York Times of publishing what he termed a \u201cdiscredited\u201d story  \u2014   evidently a reference to an article this week about current and former American officials who say that phone records and intercepted calls show that members of his campaign had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. He said The Wall Street Journal had published an article that was \u201calmost as disgraceful. \u201d He mocked Jim Acosta, a CNN correspondent, saying at one point, \u201cYeah, go ahead, Jimmy. \u201d His exchange with Mr. Acosta  \u2014   a frequent foil for Mr. Trump in his news conferences on the campaign trail  \u2014   made it clear that the president believes that the American people are with him, and against the news media. \u201cThat\u2019s why the public sees it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey see it. They see it\u2019s not fair. The public is smart, they understand it. \u201d Mr. Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama  \u2014   whom he had often described in glowing terms since his inauguration  \u2014   for handing him a failing government. \u201cI inherited a mess,\u201d Mr. Trump asserted. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. \u201d At one point, Mr. Trump searched for a new face among the veteran White House reporters who were challenging him and settled on a journalist wearing a skullcap whom he clearly did not recognize, hoping for the best. \u201cAre you a friendly reporter? \u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said. The response of the reporter, Jake Turx of Ami magazine, a Jewish publication, could not be heard in the room. The president\u2019s anger then flared when Mr. Turx asked about a rise in   incidents around the country. Telling Mr. Turx to sit down and accusing him of lying about asking a \u201cvery straight, simple question,\u201d Mr. Trump rejected the charge that he is personally    \u2014   something the reporter had explicitly said he was not asserting. At one point, Mr. Trump predicted how the news media would cover the event  \u2014   and preemptively rejected that, too. \u201cTomorrow, they will say, \u2018Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not ranting and raving. I\u2019m just telling you. You know, you\u2019re dishonest people. But  \u2014   but I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I love this. I\u2019m having a good time doing it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561662.3073173}
