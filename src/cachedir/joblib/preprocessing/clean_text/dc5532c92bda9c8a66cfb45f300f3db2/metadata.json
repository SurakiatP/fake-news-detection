By Neal Gabler Posted on November 7, 2016 by Neal Gabler \\nIt is impossible to count the myriad ways in which the media botched FBI Director James Comey\u2019s Friday announcement that the agency had found a cache of emails that seemingly (a key word) pertain to Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server. I heard the news via CNN at an airport while waiting to board a plane. No one needs to be told that CNN is a journalistic disgrace\u2014a textbook case of the decline of American media, all the more depressing because, unlike Fox News and MSNBC, it purports to be a real news organization. Instead, it is a ratings machine, and it is beyond contemptible. \\nSo what I heard was Wolf Blitzer in his customary tizzy, as if Pearl Harbor had just been attacked, breathlessly ballyhooing Comey\u2019s missive to Congress and asking what seemed to be an endless queue of talking heads to weigh in on what is now routinely called a \u201cbombshell.\u201d This too is a textbook example of media practice. In the movies, bombast has replaced narrative. The last half-hour of every blockbuster is obligatory and generic: noise, lots and lots and lots of noise, and a gazillion special effects until any vestige of story evaporates and your head throbs. Cable has done something similar with news. It is all pitch, no content. The hysteria can transform anything into a drama, which is precisely cable\u2019s intention. \\nThis has been true of the Clinton emails since the beginning. It was always something of a hoax\u2014a new chapter for a hungry media juicing its audience. Not one in a hundred voters can tell you the awful crime Clinton was supposed to have committed or why it matters. Not one in a hundred\u2014and I would include journalists\u2014have any idea of what really went down with these emails, as I discussed in an earlier post that highlighted the one reporter, Garrett M. Graff of Politico , who actually did something it appears no other reporter thought of doing: read the FBI\u2019s summary account of the investigation. \\nIn effect, then, the Clinton emails have always been what the great film director Alfred Hitchcock called a \u201cMacGuffin,\u201d which Hitchcock described as the \u201cdevice, the gimmick, if you will, that sets the plot in motion.\u201d And he continued: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is. And the logicians are wrong in trying to figure out the truth of a MacGuffin, since it\u2019s beside the point. The only thing that really matters is that in the picture, the plans, documents or secrets must seem to be of vital importance to the characters. To me, the narrator, they\u2019re of no importance whatever.\u201d \\nIt takes Alfred Hitchcock to reveal the secret of the emails as well as the basic operating principle of our political media. To the media, the emails are the primary plot device. In reality, they mean nothing. And I should add this: Should Donald Trump win this election, and he very well might now, historians 50 years from now will be scratching their heads over how something so inconsequential as a private email server could possibly have swayed the election. Emails! Really! How do we explain a MacGuffin overtaking our politics? \\nThe thing is that while the media have been obsessing over the MacGuffin, they have missed entirely the real story\u2014the story that historians will examine and ponder. Oddly enough, it was arguably one of the world\u2019s worst newspapers, England\u2019s right-wing Daily Mail tabloid, which is about 10 notches below our own New York Post , which is 10 notches below any real newspaper, that broke the deeper story . \\nThe Daily Mail reported that FBI agents were incensed over Comey\u2019s decision not to prosecute Clinton (so, says the paper, was Comey\u2019s wife) and many submitted resignations in protest. Even when real newspapers finally caught up with this angle, they soft-peddled the significance of the nation\u2019s primary investigative agency being an in-house right-wing force that was determined to veer the election toward Trump. The later dump of Bill Clinton documents only underscores the determination of the FBI to turn the election. \\nThat is real and really disturbing news\u2014colossally big news, giant headline news. With his sudden announcement, Comey may or may not have been trying to pacify the GOP, which would have been bad enough. It does appear he was trying to raise morale among the Gestapo at his own agency by aiding Trump. And let\u2019s be clear: He knew he was aiding Trump. \\nThat the media have largely ignored this aspect is both astonishing and depressing. The New York Times very delicately compared Comey to the late J. Edgar Hoover, who used the agency for his own devices, largely to settle personal grievances and advance his right-wing agenda. (And I mean very delicately. The media have always treated Comey as Diogenes.) \\nBut then the media are so caught up in their own hysteria over emails, they don\u2019t have distance to view the big story. And when they aren\u2019t preoccupied with the emails, they are preoccupied with how Comey\u2019s revelation, seemingly in violation of Justice Department protocols and the Hatch Act, will affect the election. So you go from the MacGuffin to the horse race without ever having to engage anything substantive. \\nYou could say that Comey brilliantly played the media for his own benefit, knowing that they couldn\u2019t resist and certainly wouldn\u2019t investigate a new plot twist. Hitch knew the difference between an insubstantial MacGuffin and something that was important. Comey realized that the media don\u2019t. Their confusion, along with their unwillingness to out the FBI and its seemingly alt-right agenda, could wind up being the decisive element in this election. It is the campaign equivalent of that deafening superhero movie climax\u2014all noise, no sense.
