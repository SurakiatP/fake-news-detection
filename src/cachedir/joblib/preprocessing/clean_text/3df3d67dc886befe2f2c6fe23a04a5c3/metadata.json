[According to Politico, two White House senior officials confirmed that Trump will sign the order but would not release the details of the latest draft. A prior draft of the order, however  \u2014   leaked to the   Nation in February  \u2014   reportedly would \u201ccreate wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious objections to   marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity. \u201d  The leak of the original draft to the Nation, says Politico, was \u201cthe handiwork, many conservatives believed, of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have sought to project themselves as friendly to the LGBT community. \u201d Leftwing groups condemned the draft executive order as overtly discriminatory. The Nation continued: The   draft order, a copy of which is currently circulating among federal staff and advocacy organizations, construes religious organizations so broadly that it covers \u201cany organization, including closely held   corporations,\u201d and protects \u201creligious freedom\u201d in every walk of life: \u201cwhen providing social services, education, or healthcare earning a living, seeking a job, or employing others receiving government grants or contracts or otherwise participating in the marketplace, the public square, or interfacing with Federal, State or local governments. In a statement released Wednesday, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said the report of the order is \u201cvery welcome news. \u201d \u201cSpeaking as one who has spent the last five years in federal courts  \u2014   and who is still in court  \u2014   defending the right of religious groups and individuals to practice our beliefs, President Trump\u2019s anticipated executive order is cause for celebration,\u201d Pavone said. \u201cFor far too long, government has been trying to confine faith to the four walls of houses of worship. I\u2019m confident that President Trump\u2019s order will reinforce the Constitution\u2019s guarantee that our religious beliefs are to be protected, not attacked. \u201d Reports of the new executive order come amid complaints that the Trump Department of Justice is still continuing its contraceptive mandate cases against religious   such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. Catholic News Agency reports the plaintiffs in these cases expected the federal government would drop its appeals once Trump took office. However, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty  \u2014   which represents many of the plaintiffs in the HHS contraceptive mandate cases  \u2014   observed that the Obama administration\u2019s lawyers who litigated these cases are still on board in the Trump Department of Justice. During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised faith leaders and employers relief from the Obamacare mandate that requires most employers to provide contraception,   drugs, and sterilization procedures to their workers in health insurance plans. In a letter to the Catholic Leadership Conference last October, Trump told Catholic leaders prior to the November election that Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for the HHS mandate \u201cis a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump Administration. \u201d Trump wrote: On life, I am, and will remain,  . I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs. \u201cWe are grateful to have a president who is committed to defending a value so basic to Americans as religious freedom,\u201d Pavone said. \u201cWe look forward not only to his executive actions, but also to legislation that will further protect religious liberty from unjust government mandates and from the oppressive restrictions of such measures as the Johnson Amendment. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563868.4752276}
