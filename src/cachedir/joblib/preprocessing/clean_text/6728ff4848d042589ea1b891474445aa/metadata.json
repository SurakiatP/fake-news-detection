It would be years before she learned that this was far from the American norm. And that many women in her hometown defied convention, too, by having vibrant, and by most standards, unusual careers. Black and female, dozens had worked at the space agency as mathematicians, often under Jim Crow laws, calculating crucial trajectories for rockets while being segregated from their white counterparts. For decades, as the space race made heroes out of   astronauts, the stories of those women went largely untold. Four of them are the subjects of Ms. Shetterly\u2019s first book, \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d a history being released on Tuesday by William Morrow. The book garnered an early burst of attention because its movie version, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, is scheduled for a   release and set for an Oscars run. The movie rights were snapped up weeks after Ms. Shetterly sold her book proposal in 2014, and well before she started writing the book in earnest, a disorientingly fast, if exhilarating, turn. \u201cThe thrilling thing to me about the book, and the movie, is this is an American story that we\u2019re getting to see through the faces of these women,\u201d Ms. Shetterly said during a recent visit to Hampton, which sits on the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, surrounded by aquamarine waters and Navy ships. \u201cIt\u2019s just as American a story as if it were John Glenn or Alan Shepard telling it. \u201d Ms. Shetterly happened upon the idea for the book six years ago, when she and her husband, Aran Shetterly, then living in Mexico, were visiting her parents here. The couple and Ms. Shetterly\u2019s father were driving around in his minivan when he mentioned, very casually, that one of Ms. Shetterly\u2019s former Sunday school teachers had worked as a mathematician at NASA, and that another woman she knew calculated rocket trajectories for famous astronauts. Ms. Shetterly remembers her husband perking up and asking why he had never heard this tale before. \u201cI knew women who worked at NASA as mathematicians and engineers,\u201d Ms. Shetterly said, \u201cbut it took someone from the outside saying, \u2018Wait a minute\u2019 for me to see the story there. \u201d (A book on a similar topic, Nathalia Holt\u2019s \u201cRise of the Rocket Girls,\u201d about women working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the \u201940s and \u201950s, was published in April.) Two of the women she would focus on are still living in the area. Christine Darden, now 73 and retired, had worked her way out of NASA\u2019s computing pool to lead engineering research into sonic booms. Katherine Johnson, who recently turned 98, lives in a retirement home with her husband of 57 years, James A. Johnson, and is enjoying a recent surge of fame. She calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions, and last year President Obama personally awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her life\u2019s work. Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson still socialize, and on a recent summer day, made meltingly hot by a heat wave, met to play bridge at Mrs. Johnson\u2019s apartment. (Mrs. Johnson and her partner won.) Ms. Shetterly was visiting too, and presented both women with an early copy of her book. \u201cFantastic,\u201d Mrs. Darden said, as Mrs. Johnson, whose eyesight is failing, peered at the cover with a slight smile. Yet asked how she felt about the coming film, in which she is played by Ms. Henson, in the starring role, Mrs. Johnson became solemn. (Mrs. Darden is not portrayed onscreen, as the film focuses on the years preceding her arrival at NASA.) \u201cI shudder,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. She had heard, she said, that the movie might stretch the facts, and that her character possibly came across as aggressive. \u201cI was never aggressive,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. Ms. Shetterly reminded Mrs. Johnson of her persistence in the late 1950s, when she successfully pressed her supervisor into admitting her into traditionally   meetings. \u201cYou took matters in your own hands,\u201d Ms. Shetterly said. \u201cFor other women, it was a revelation. \u201d Ms. Johnson said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t ever wait for something. I remember asking the question, \u2018Is there a law?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Let her go.\u2019 It was easier than arguing. \u201d Listening in, one of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s health aides chuckled. \u201cYep,\u201d he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the Katherine Johnson I know. \u201d Though outwardly their stories are remarkable, both Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson remained    when describing their careers, an attitude that seems to have prevailed among their peers. Ann Hammond, whose mother, Dorothy Vaughan, was one of the first black women to be hired by what was then called the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, in 1943, said her mother never wanted a pat on the back. Mrs. Vaughan died in 2005 at the age of 98, and is played in the film by Octavia Spencer. \u201cMy mother would\u2019ve probably said, \u2018I was just doing my job,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hammond, 80, said, speaking in the Hampton bungalow where she grew up with her five siblings. But what jobs they were. While military budget cuts and sequestration have hurt the economy here in recent decades, some 75 years ago the hungry wartime machine needed manpower, and womanpower, to fill its depleted ranks. This helped open the door for black female mathematicians, who were recruited through job bulletin boards and newspaper ads. Their job title? \u201cColored computers. \u201d Mrs. Johnson, a math savant, graduated summa cum laude from what is now West Virginia State University at 18, and heard about the job through a family connection. Mrs. Darden, who went to college at Hampton Institute and earned a master\u2019s degree in math at Virginia State College, was hired to be a NASA data analyst out of graduate school in 1967, and went on to become an aerospace engineer. The military boom lasted for decades, allowing the women and their families to have what Ms. Hammond described as a good life, despite enduring the indignities of segregation in the early years  \u2014   working, eating and using restrooms apart from white colleagues. Ms. Shetterly discovered in her research that the space agency\u2019s leaders were well aware of the negative effects of segregation. As Virginia began vigorously fighting public school desegregation in 1956, one higher up worried about the face that the United States, with its roiling racial problems, was presenting to the world, using words that still have resonance today. \u201cIn trying to provide leadership in world events, it is necessary for this country to indicate to the world that we practice equality for all within this country,\u201d NACA\u2019s chief counsel, Paul Dembling, wrote in a file memo that year. Two years later, the segregated computing pool was disbanded. Through it all, by most accounts, the black women at NASA held their heads high. \u201cHer whole life, my mother never felt superior and never felt less than anybody else,\u201d said Joylette Hylick, the eldest of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s three daughters. \u201cShe didn\u2019t let it get in her way. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561804.0190244}
