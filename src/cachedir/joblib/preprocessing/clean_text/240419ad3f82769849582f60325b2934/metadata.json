Today\u2019s story brings you a never-heard-before audio tape of then Sen. Clinton talking about rigging the elections in Palestine to ensure the outcome preferred by the United States government. \\nVia NowEndBegins \\n\\nLooks like Crooked Hillary thinks nothing of rigging an election \u2013 any election \u2013 to suit her personal purposes. \u201cI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,\u201d said Sen. Clinton. \u201cAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.\u201d\\nScroll Down For Video Below On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.\\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audio cassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.\\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton\u2019s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is \u201crigged.\u201d\\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).\\n\u201cI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,\u201d said Sen. Clinton. \u201cAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.\u201d\\nCHOMSKY RECALLS BEING TAKEN ABACK THAT \u201cANYONE COULD SUPPORT THE IDEA\u2014OFFERED BY A NATIONAL POLITICAL LEADER, NO LESS\u2014THAT THE U.S. SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF FIXING FOREIGN ELECTIONS.\u201d Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.\\nRegarding capturing combatants in war\u2014the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind\u2014Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, \u201cAnd then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there\u2019s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we\u2019ve got to capture a soldier.\u201d\\nEquating Hamas , which to this day remains on the State Department\u2019s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper\u2019s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase \u201cthese cultures\u201d is also a bit of a head-scratcher.\\nAccording to Chomsky, Clinton was \u201cgracious, personable and pleasant throughout\u201d the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.\\nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign\u2014speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he\u2019d \u201cget along\u201d with Putin.\\nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.\\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s worth talking to Syria\u2014both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel\u2019s point [of view]?\u201d\\nClinton replied, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m pretty much of the mind that I don\u2019t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you\u2019re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,\u201d an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.\\nShortly after, she said, \u201cBut if you say, \u2018they\u2019re evil, we\u2019re good, [and] we\u2019re never dealing with them,\u2019 I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them\u2026So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I\u2019ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d\\nA final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, \u201cI think you can make the case that whether you call it \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 or \u2018Islamo-fascism,\u2019 whatever the label is we\u2019re going to give to this phenomenon, it\u2019s a threat. It\u2019s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States\u2026Therefore we need a global response. It\u2019s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle\u2026So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there\u2019s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what\u2019s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d and the even more strident \u201cIslamo-fascism,\u201d at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.\\nIn an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some \u201codd and controversial comments\u201d on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined \u201cHillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,\u201d is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.\\n\u201cI went to my bosses at the time,\u201d Chomsky told the Observer. \u201cThe Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody\u2014even a direct quote from anyone\u2014in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn\u2019t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.\u201d\\n'"}, "time": 1742563582.484821}
