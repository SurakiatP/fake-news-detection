Unfettered corruption has metastasized to the highest levels of government. FBI Director James Comey, a man once widely respected throughout all levels of law enforcement, has sadly sealed his legacy as a crooked shill for the Clinton crime family. It\u2019s the theatre of the absurd. Based upon his Sunday announcement that he intends to put the kibosh, for now at least, on Hillary Clinton\u2019s criminal investigations, Mr. Comey has asked the American people to believe that the FBI thoroughly reviewed 650,000 emails from Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop in a whopping 691,200 seconds. I suspect Comey may have come across details of his own impending \u201csuicide\u201d on Weiner\u2019s hard drive. It\u2019s little wonder that trust for government is at an all-time low, and that the FBI has become a national laughing stock. \\nIndeed, a preponderance of legal and political analysists agree that the level of corruption and cover-up forcing Richard Nixon to resign his presidency in disgrace in 1974, pales by comparison to the evidence behind the multiple criminal investigations surrounding Hillary Clinton \u2013 the Democratic Party\u2019s embattled presidential nominee. Both the Clinton Foundation and Clinton email scandals represent, jointly and separately, Watergate on steroids. \\nWhile a week ago Mr. Comey sent a letter to both Republicans and Democrats in Congress advising them that, \u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the [ongoing Clinton] investigation,\u201d an even greater bombshell shook the Clinton camp mid-week. \u201cFox News reports Wednesday night that the FBI\u2019s Clinton Foundation probe has produced an \u2018avalanche of evidence\u2019 likely to result in indictments,\u201d reports the Washington Times. \\n\u201cBret Baier, based on two sources, said in a tweet that \u2018barring obstruction they\u2019d likely continue 2 push to try for an indictment.\u2019\u201d The \u201cobstruction\u201d referenced, as Baier later explained, is that presently being conducted by the Obama Department of Justice (DOJ) in general, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch in particular. As leaks indicate, the DOJ has placed a roadblock at every corner in an effort to obstruct the ongoing FBI investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s illicit activities. Multiple reports further indicate that said DOJ obstruction has triggered an uprising within the Bureau. \\n\u201cMr. Baier,\u201d continues the Times, \u201csaid the probe into pay-for-play charges at the Foundation by the Bureau\u2019s White Collar Crime division has been going on for more than a year and has involved multiple interviews with numerous individuals.\u201d \\nIt doesn\u2019t take a beltway insider to recognize that if Hillary Clinton takes the White House on Tuesday, an unprecedented constitutional crisis looms large. An already divided nation will be thrown into chaos, and a hyper-partisan Washington D.C. will effectively settle, like concrete, into total gridlock. \\nThe aforementioned criminal investigations into Secretary Clinton\u2019s activities, though intertwined in a tangled web of deleted emails, pay-to-play shakedowns and obstruction of justice, are otherwise quite easy to understand. While serving as Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton had a private email server installed in the basement of her Chappaqua, NY home with the express, and very much illegal, purpose of leveraging her federal power and authority to both solicit Clinton Foundation donations, and to conduct official State business. The private server enabled her to avoid government oversight and accountability, and to racketeer under cover of darkness. \\nMrs. Clinton then obtained and used a private email address, , to conceal her illicit activity. While soliciting bribes from foreign dignitaries, Islamic terrorist nations, and foreign corporate wheeler-dealers, she likewise transmitted highly classified government information over her unsecured network. No less than five enemy nations then hacked the account with little difficulty, gaining access to classified State secrets. \\nMrs. Clinton shamelessly \u2013 treasonously \u2013 placed her own personal enrichment above national security and the lives and safety of American citizens both at home and abroad. \\nThus, in the interest of both justice and the best interests of the American people, FBI agents and other government officials with direct evidence of Hillary Clinton's crimes (and the Obama DOJ\u2019s ongoing cover-up) should immediately release that evidence to both Congress and the public at large. It\u2019s not a \u201cleak\u201d when the level of systemic crime and corruption has reached critical mass, as it has within both the Obama administration and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. These public servants will be whistleblowers, not rouge agents \u2013 patriots, not partisans. Their oath is to the U.S. Constitution, not to a second rate community organizer, his Marxist political party, or that party\u2019s career criminal presidential nominee. \\nThey\u2019d better hurry, though. Mr. Obama likely has his Clinton pardon already drafted and saved on \u201cwe the people\u2019s\u201d very-much-secure government server. \\nMatt Barber is founder and editor-in chief of BarbWire.com .
