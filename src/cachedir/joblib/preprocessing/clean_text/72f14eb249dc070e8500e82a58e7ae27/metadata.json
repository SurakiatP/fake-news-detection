[65 rooms will be built for the shelter, which is being planned in partnership with nonprofit organization Mary\u2019s Place, providing space for more than 200 homeless people every night.  \u201cMary\u2019s Place does incredible,   work every day for women, children, and families experiencing homelessness in the Seattle community,\u201d said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. \u201cWe are lucky to count them as neighbors and thrilled to offer them a permanent home within our downtown Seattle headquarters. \u201d According to CNN, \u201cThe new Mary\u2019s Place shelter will open in early 2020. It will also have a resource center like those the nonprofit offers in North Seattle and White Center, where   local nonprofits and volunteers work with staff to help families obtain employment and permanent housing. \u201d In 2016, Amazon partnered with Mary\u2019s Place to temporarily house 200 homeless people in an empty building on its Seattle campus. Since last year, Amazon customers have also been able to order items from the Mary\u2019s Place wishlist, \u201csuch as diapers and socks. \u201d \u201cTo have a permanent downtown Seattle location within Amazon is a   for Mary\u2019s Place and the families we serve,\u201d declared Marty Hartman, Executive Director of Mary\u2019s Place. \u201cWe\u2019ve loved being Amazon\u2019s neighbor, and now the opportunity to move into their headquarters permanently is truly a dream come true. This unique,     shelter will remind families that they matter and that their community wants to help them succeed. \u201d \u201cAmazon employees are frequent visitors and volunteers at the existing shelter  \u2014   bringing meals, organizing arts and crafts projects, throwing parties for the families, and more,\u201d claimed the nonprofit group in a blog post. \u201cBy sharing permanent space with Mary\u2019s Place, Amazon employees will now have even more opportunities to volunteer and support the organization and the families they serve. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
