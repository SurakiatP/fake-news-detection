S. global ballistic missile defense poses a deep risk to the security of the region,\u201d declared Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday after meeting with Japanese officials in Tokyo. [The Associated Press describes Lavrov\u2019s visit as the first \u201c  \u201d meetings of foreign and defense ministers between Japan and Tokyo since Russia annexed Crimea. Japan has participated in sanctions against Russia for that action.  Lavrov specifically denounced the THAAD missile system America is installing in South Korea as a \u201cresponse completely out of proportion\u201d to the North Korean threat. He said the United States was \u201cpumping arms into the region. \u201d Tokyo has been thinking about asking the United States to pump a THAAD missile system into Japan, especially since the recent launch of four ballistic missiles towards the Japanese coast stoked fears that Pyongyang may be capable of \u201cswarm attacks\u201d or \u201csaturation launches\u201d that would overwhelm Japan\u2019s missile defenses. One of the arguments against THAAD missile shield deployment is that North Korea might be able to fire a dozen or more missiles at once and overwhelm even the Terminal   Area Defense System. That would make THAAD acquisition disruptive to Japanese relations with Russia and China, both of which believe the system is ultimately intended to limit their military options, without gaining any real security against North Korean aggression. Lavrov is well aware that political turmoil in South Korea gives Russia an opening to pressure Seoul into canceling THAAD deployment. Odds are that the replacement for impeached South Korean President Park   will be less enthusiastic about the system than she was. \u201cAt the end of the day, if the reality unfolds in a way that South Korea\u2019s national security and the economy were damaged because of the THAAD, not because of the North Korea issue, then it\u2019s not really a rational situation, is it?\u201d Choi   an adviser to   presidential candidate Moon   said over the weekend. The economic damage Choi referred to is coming mostly from an enraged China. Sergey Lavrov\u2019s comments in Tokyo are a warning of national security damage that will be heard clearly in Seoul. The Associated Press notes that Russia and Japan had one other lingering bit of business to discuss at the \u201c  \u201d meeting: World War II isn\u2019t over yet. It still isn\u2019t over because no major breakthrough on the fate of the disputed Kuril island chain was announced after Lavrov\u2019s trip to Tokyo. The disposition of these islands has prevented Japan and Russia from signing a peace treaty and formally concluding the Second World War. On the bright side, Russian media reported on Monday that Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida expressed a willingness to make travel to the islands easier for Russian citizens, and Russia has floated similar proposals with respect to the Japanese. However, Kishida also voiced concerns about Russian military activity in the south Kuril Islands, and official conveyed those concerns to Lavrov at the meeting. Specifically, Japan is worried about Russia\u2019s deployment of coastal missile systems.'"}, "time": 1742561683.3939083}
