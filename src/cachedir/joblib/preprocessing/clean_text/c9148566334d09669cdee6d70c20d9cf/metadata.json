He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan. But on Thursday night,    Micah Johnson, an   drove his car to a rally against police violence and began killing  officers in downtown Dallas, hoping to single out the white ones. In the process, he also managed to bring his war back home, killing at least one fellow military veteran and heightening fears that the nation he had been deployed to protect overseas was now failing to address its growing racial divide at home. The Dallas police remained on edge Saturday. In the late afternoon, officers drew their weapons and cleared an area near the back of their headquarters after a report of a suspicious person in a department parking garage. The agency later said that no one had been found. In the past several days, as demonstrators jammed the streets in a number of American cities, protesting police violence, new details emerged about Mr. Johnson\u2019s life. They revealed a young man who had returned in disgrace from his stint abroad in the Army Reserve, but then continued a training regimen of his own devising, conducting   exercises in his backyard and reportedly joining a gym that offered martial arts and weapons classes. A Dallas County official also revealed Saturday that Mr. Johnson  \u2014   who killed five officers and wounded seven others, as well as two civilians, before the police killed him with a   explosive device  \u2014   had kept an extensive journal and described a method of attack in which a gunman fired on a target and then quickly moved to another location to confuse an enemy. Although it did not seem to be a precise plan for Mr. Johnson\u2019s ambush, it was strikingly similar to the tactics he used. \u201cIt\u2019s talking not only about how to kill but how to keep from being killed,\u201d said Clay Jenkins, Dallas County\u2019s chief executive and director of homeland security and emergency management, who said he had not read the original journal but had reviewed summaries of it. \u201cIt shows that he\u2019s well prepared. \u201d Mr. Johnson showed an affinity for radical   organizations on his Facebook page. Organizers of the Black Lives Matter network and others have denounced Mr. Johnson\u2019s shooting spree. In a news conference on Saturday in Warsaw, President Obama said it was \u201cvery hard to untangle the motives\u201d behind the shooting. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBy definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you  \u2014   strangers  \u2014   you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I\u2019ll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents. \u201d On Saturday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said in a statement that Mr. Obama had called him to offer condolences. Mr. Abbott said he had thanked the president and reiterated the need for Americans to unite after the shooting. Tensions remained high, however. In San Antonio, the police were investigating reports late Saturday that gunshots had been fired at their department\u2019s headquarters, Chief William McManus said at a briefing. Officers said that they heard gunshots hitting the building just before 10 p. m. and that \u201ca number of shell casings\u201d were recovered, Chief McManus said. There were no injuries. Mr. Johnson spent some of his childhood at the home of his father and stepmother in Garland, about a   drive north of downtown Dallas. Their neighborhood, Camelot, is a collection of   and     houses of    vintage, and their house is set in the middle of a   block, where a number of neighboring homes this weekend still displayed American flags from the Fourth of July weekend. The neighbors walking by or working on their lawns were black, white, Hispanic and Asian. Courtney Williams, 37, an electrician who lives in Forney, just east of Dallas, said he had known Mr. Johnson during his teenage days, when Mr. Johnson would stay with his mother in the Pleasant Grove area of Dallas. The two young men attended the same church, and Mr. Williams recalled Mr. Johnson as a \u201c \u201d youth who was active in church events and the typical pursuits of a teenager. \u201cVideo games, the whole nine yards,\u201d he said. Mr. Johnson showed no interest in weapons, Mr. Williams said. \u201cHe was just a quiet kid,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cNo attitude, no trouble with school. Just a normal kid. \u201d Mr. Williams lost touch with Mr. Johnson after the younger man graduated from John Horn High School in Mesquite, Tex. where he had shown some interest in the military, going so far as to participate in the school\u2019s Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps program. He was not, it seemed on Saturday, a standout: Horn\u2019s former J. R. O. T. C. instructor said he had little recollection of Mr. Johnson. He enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2009 and was assigned to a unit  \u2014   a component of the 420th Engineer Brigade  \u2014   near Dallas. More than four years later, the unit deployed to Afghanistan. But before the soldiers left for the Afghan theater, they stood in formation not far from the streets where Mr. Johnson would someday stage a siege. An officer urged them to take care of their families and cultivate their faith. He also emphasized the importance of adapting on the fly. \u201cContinue to build the flexibility to adjust to changing and unforeseen situations faster than the enemy can adapt,\u201d the officer said, according to a video of the ceremony. \u201cThis is how we will succeed. \u201d But Mr. Johnson did not succeed. While overseas, a female soldier in Mr. Johnson\u2019s unit accused him of sexual harassment. When the Army considered kicking him out, he waived his right to a hearing in exchange for a lesser charge. Soon he was back in Texas, living with his mother. Ron Price, 49, a former president of the Dallas school board, lives in Mesquite, about four blocks away. He used to see Mr. Johnson in the neighborhood and exchange hellos. He said he had noticed nothing really remarkable about him. \u201cHe was just another guy at the gas station,\u201d he said. But Mr. Jenkins said a neighbor had seen Mr. Johnson doing militarylike exercises in his backyard in Mesquite in the last couple of weeks. Mr. Johnson\u2019s preparations seemingly extended to visits to a \u201c  and personal protection\u201d gym in the Dallas area. The gym\u2019s owner, Justin Everman, told The Daily Beast that it counted many police officers among its members, and he sought to distance himself and his business from Mr. Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, what he did,\u201d Mr. Everman told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted. \u201d In addition to reading summaries of the journal, Mr. Jenkins said he had heard descriptions of its contents from other officials. Some of it was given over to very specific combat and sniper tactics, including details, Mr. Jenkins said, of \u201cwhat we call \u2018shoot and move\u2019 tactics  \u2014   ways to fire on a target and then move quickly and get into position at another location to inflict more damage on targets without them being able to ascertain where the shots are coming from. \u201d This tactic is used by the military\u2019s special forces. \u201cWhen you couple \u2018shoot and move\u2019 and other tactics in his writings, his practice in the yard, his interest in weaponry, it seems to me that this was a   individual,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. He added, \u201cIt appeared that he was an excellent marksman and was calmly shooting, as opposed to someone who\u2019s just holding a gun up and aiming it and pulling the trigger in the direction of where they think people are. \u201d Mr. Jenkins said Mr. Johnson had used a semiautomatic SKS rifle and a   handgun. He drove his vehicle to the demonstration and parked it, Mr. Jenkins said, but was on foot at many points throughout the attack. Mr. Johnson\u2019s knowledge of \u201cshoot and move\u201d  \u2014   and the fact that a few of the protesters in the crowd who were not involved in the shooting were armed and carrying rifles  \u2014   has helped shed light on how a theory of multiple assailants emerged. In Texas, gun owners can legally and openly carry what are known as long guns, including shotguns and rifles. The carrying of handguns is regulated in Texas and requires a   permit, whether concealed or openly carried, but the carrying of rifles is largely unregulated and requires no permit. The   open carrying of rifles has become common at many demonstrations in Texas in recent years. \u201cWhen the shooting first happened, you had people in the crowd who were carrying long rifles and dressed in camouflage,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cAnd then the shooting happens, and those people begin to disperse and move quickly, and they have guns and they\u2019re not police officers and there\u2019s a shooting, and so one of the things that people would investigate quickly is did they have anything to do with whatever is happening. \u201d Mr. Jenkins said that Mr. Johnson did not appear to have advance knowledge of the march route. Parts of the route were determined on the spot without planning, Mr. Jenkins said. Throughout a sweltering Saturday, a section of downtown Dallas remained a   crime scene as investigators faced a second day of piecing together the details of the attack, an inquiry that had included more than 200 interviews. More than 20 square blocks remained cordoned off. Two squad cars outside Police Headquarters have become memorials, covered in flowers, balloons, posters and handwritten notes. On Friday evening, before the officers went on heightened alert, person after person slowly and quietly approached the cars to add tributes. A Dallas police sergeant wiped her eyes, and a handful of people gathered in a circle to pray. Similar moments played out on Saturday. \u201cI miss you already Brother, but you are home with the angels now,\u201d said a note about Officer Brent Thompson. The authors wrote, \u201cYou were, are, and always will be our hero. \u201d As Mayor Mike Rawlings visited Police Headquarters on Saturday, he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re all human here, and I think that people feel each other\u2019s pain. And that\u2019s what makes it great, that\u2019s what makes you hopeful that we can do this, that we can move from senselessness, absurdity that\u2019s like a Camus novel, to something that has redemption and hope in it. And that\u2019s ultimately what we need to do. \u201d He stopped to speak with a woman kneeling by one police car and told her, \u201cPray hard, sister. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628542.1661727}
