S. Eliot, William Faulkner, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. \\nIt\u2019s a tremendous honor for the legendary singer-songwriter, that\u2019s for sure. But it\u2019s also stirred up its share of controversy. I won\u2019t debate Dylan\u2019s award\u2014I\u2019ll leave that to my esteemed colleagues Andrew Klavan and Ron Radosh \u2014except to say two quick things. First, when the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to people like Yasser Arafat and Barack Obama, did it dim the luster of the prizes in other categories? And second, I like the idea of songs like \u201cGotta Serve Somebody\u201d and \u201cSaved\u201d (and, apologies to Andrew, even \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me, Babe\u201d) joining the pantheon of Nobel Prize-winning literature. \\nBut now that the reliably left-leaning Nobel Prize Committee has given Dylan an award, a funny thing has happened. The left has begun to turn on Dylan for being less than the predictable leftist they have expected him to be. In Defense of Bob Dylan\u2019s Nobel Prize for Literature\u2014He Deserves it! \\nThe first example comes to us from that cherished source of unbiased news, Al Jazeera. In a recent editorial , French sociologist and \u201cmedia critic\u201d Ali Saad takes the media to task for reporting the news of Bob Dylan\u2019s award without mentioning that he\u2014 gasp\u2014 supports Israel. Saad gripes that: \\n\u2026media outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with Dylan\u2019s pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed. \\nSaad goes on to cite \u201cNeighborhood Bully,\u201d an early \u201980s tune from Dylan that expresses support for the nation of Israel. \\nThe song, that Stephen Holden described in The New York Times in 1983 as \u201c an outspoken defence of Israel \u201c, begins by stating two key precepts emphasising the Israeli perspective: first by comparing Israel to a man in exile whose enemies unjustly \u201cclaim he\u2019s on their land\u201d, a sentence that serves as a scolding to those who refute the legitimacy of Israel\u2019s historic claim to Palestine\u2019s land. Then, by metaphorically presenting Israel as a man \u201coutnumbered by a million to one\u201d, which postulates the frequent representation of Israel as the underdog of the Middle East.Such a stance by an anti-war activist raises serious doubts over Dylan\u2019s commitment to humanity \\nFOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK'"}, "time": 1742628479.9891818}
