Politicians, mainstream media and technology giants are taking aim at what they call \u201cfake news,\u201d reports Robert Parry. \\nBy Robert Parry \\nIn the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s victory, a hot new issue \u2013 raised by President Obama in an international setting on Thursday and touted on The New York Times\u2019 front page on Friday \u2013 is the problem of \u201cfake news\u201d being disseminated on the Internet. \\nMajor Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, are being urged to censor such articles and to punish alleged violators. Also, teams of supposedly \u201cresponsible\u201d news providers and technology giants are being assembled to police this alleged problem and decide what is true and what is not. President Obama in the Oval Office. \\nBut therein lies the more serious problem: who gets to decide what is real and what is not real? And \u2013 in an age when all sides propagate propaganda \u2013 when does conformity in support of a mainstream \u201ctruth\u201d become censorship of reasonable skepticism? \\nAs a journalist for more than four decades, I take seriously the profession\u2019s responsibility to verify information as much as possible before publishing it \u2013 and as editor of Consortiumnews.com, I insist that our writers (and to the extent possible, outside commenters) back up what they say. \\nI personally hate \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d in which people speculate about a topic without real evidence and often in defiance of actual evidence. I believe in traditional journalistic standards of cross-checking data and applying common sense. \\nSo, I am surely no fan of Internet hoaxes and baseless accusations. Yet, I also recognize that mainstream U.S. news outlets have made horrendous and wholesale factual errors, too, such as reporting in 2002-03 that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program (The New York Times) and was hiding stockpiles of WMD (many TV and print outlets, including The Washington Post). \\nAnd, mainstream outlets getting such life-and-death stories wrong was not just a one-off affair around the Iraq invasion. At least since the 1980s, The New York Times has misreported or glossed over many international issues that put the United States and its allies in a negative light. \\nFor instance, the Times not only missed the Nicaraguan Contra cocaine scandal , but actively covered up the Reagan administration\u2019s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s. \\nThe Times lagged badly, too, on investigating the secret operations that became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Times\u2019 gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the Reagan administration. [For more on this topic, see Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201c New York Times: Apologist for Power .\u201d] \\nIn that same era, The Washington Post performed no better. Leonard Downie, its executive editor at the time of the Contra-cocaine scandal, has continued to reject the reality of Ronald Reagan\u2019s beloved Contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz that, in fact, many Contras were neck-deep in the cocaine trade and the Reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons. \\nMore recently, during the mad dash to invade Iraq in 2002-03, the Post\u2019s editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt wrote repeatedly as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and mocked the few dissenting voices that challenged the \u201cgroup think.\u201d \\nYet, Hiatt suffered no accountability for his falsehoods and is still the Post\u2019s editorial-page editor, still peddling dubious examples of Washington\u2019s conventional wisdom . \\nMinistry of Truth \\nSo, who are the \u201cresponsible\u201d journalists who should be anointed to regulate what the world\u2019s public gets to see and hear? For that Orwellian task, a kind of Ministry of Truth has been set up by Google, called the First Draft Coalition , which touts itself as a collection of 30 major news and technology companies , including the Times and Post, tackling \u201cfake news\u201d and creating a platform to decide which stories are questionable and which ones aren\u2019t. Correspondent Michael Usher of Australia\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d claims to have found the billboard visible in a video of a BUK missile launcher after the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014, but the scenes actually don\u2019t match up at all. (Screen shot from Australia\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d) \\nFormed in June 2015 and funded by Google News Lab, the First Draft Coalition\u2019s founding members included Bellingcat, an online \u201ccitizen journalism\u201d site that has gotten many of its highest profile stories wrong and is now associated with NATO\u2019s favorite think tank, the Atlantic Council. \\nDespite Bellingcat\u2019s checkered record and its conflicts of interest through the Atlantic Council, major Western news outlets, including the Times and Post, have embraced Bellingcat, apparently because its articles always seem to mesh neatly with U.S. and European propaganda on Syria and Ukraine. \\nTwo of Bellingcat\u2019s (or its founder Eliot Higgins\u2019s) biggest errors were misplacing the firing location of the suspected Syrian rocket carrying sarin gas on Aug. 21, 2013, and directing an Australian news crew to the wrong site for the so-called getaway Buk video after the July 17, 2014 shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.

(Image from Australian \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program) \\nBut like many news outlets that support establishment \u201cgroup thinks,\u201d Bellingcat wins widespread praise and official endorsements, such as from the international MH-17 investigation that was largely controlled by Ukraine\u2019s unsavory intelligence agency, the SBU and that accepted Bellingcat\u2019s dubious MH-17 evidence blaming the Russians . \\nIf such a Ministry of Truth had existed in the mid-1980s, it might well have denounced the investigative reporting on the Contra-cocaine scandal since that was initially deemed untrue. And if \u201cMinitrue\u201d were around in 2002-03, it almost surely would have decried the handful of people who were warning against the \u201cgroup think\u201d on Iraq\u2019s WMD. \\nPower and Reality \\nWhile it\u2019s undeniable that some false or dubious stories get pushed during the heat of a political campaign and in wartime \u2013 and journalists have a role in fact-checking as best they can \u2013 there is potentially a greater danger when media insiders arrogate to themselves the power to dismiss contrary evidence as unacceptable, especially given their own history of publishing stories that turned out to be dubious if not entirely false. \\nIt\u2019s even more dangerous when these self-appointed arbiters of truth combine forces with powerful Internet search engines and social media companies to essentially silence dissenting opinions and contrary facts by making them very difficult for the public to locate. \\nArguably even worse is when politicians \u2013 whether President-elect Donald Trump or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or President Obama \u2013 get into the business of judging what is true and what is false. \\nOn Thursday, an impassioned President Obama voiced his annoyance with \u201cfake news\u201d twice in his joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 \u201cbecause in an age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation and it\u2019s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television. \u2026 If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect.\u201d \\nLet that phrase sink in for a moment: \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to protect\u201d? Is President Obama suggesting that it is the U.S. government\u2019s role to \u201cprotect\u201d certain information and, by implication, leave contrary information \u201cunprotected,\u201d i.e. open to censorship? \\nOn Friday, a New York Times front-page article took Facebook to task, in particular, writing: \u201cfor years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news.\u201d \\nThe Times added, in a complimentary way, \u201cNow Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late.\u201d \\nInfo-War \\nThis new alarm about \u201cfake news\u201d comes amid the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cinformation war\u201d against Russia regarding the Syrian and Ukraine conflicts. Obama\u2019s State Department insists that it is presenting the truth about these conflicts while Russia\u2019s RT channel is a fount of disinformation. Yet, the State Department\u2019s propaganda officials have frequently made false or unsupported claims themselves. Ukraine\u2019s (now-former) Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk \\nOn Wednesday, there was the unseemly scene of State Department spokesman John Kirby refusing to answer reasonable questions from a Russian journalist affiliated with RT. \\nThe RT journalist asked Kirby to identify the hospitals and clinics in Syria that he was claiming had been hit by Russian and Syrian airstrikes. You might assume that a truth-teller would have welcomed the opportunity to provide more details that could then be checked and verified. \\nBut instead Kirby berated the RT journalist and tried to turn the rest of the State Department press corps against her. \\nQUESTION: Don\u2019t you think it is important to give a specific list of hospitals that you\u2019re accusing Russia of hitting? Those are grave accusations. \\nKIRBY: I\u2019m not making those accusations. I\u2019m telling you we\u2019ve seen reports from credible aid organizations that five hospitals and a clinic \u2014 \\nQUESTION: Which hospital \u2014 \\nKIRBY: At least one clinic \u2014 \\nQUESTION: In what cities at least? \\nKIRBY: You can go look at the information that many of the Syrian relief agencies are putting out there publicly. We\u2019re getting our information from them too. These reports \u2014 \\nQUESTION: But you are citing those reports without giving any specifics. \\nKIRBY: Because we believe these agencies are credible and because we have other sources of information that back up what we\u2019re seeing from some of these reports. And you know what? Why don\u2019t [you] ask \u2026 Here\u2019s a good question. Why don\u2019t you ask your defense ministry \u2026 what they\u2019re doing and see if you can get\u2026\u201d \\nQUESTION: If you give a specific list \u2014 \\nKIRBY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. \\nQUESTION: If you give a specific list of hospitals \u2014 \\nKIRBY: No, no, no. \\nQUESTION: My colleagues who are listening hopefully would be able to go and ask Russian officials about a specific list of hospitals that you\u2019re accusing Russia of \u2026\u201d \\nKIRBY: You work for Russia Today, right? Isn\u2019t that your agency? \\nQUESTION: That is correct. Yes. \\nKIRBY: And so why shouldn\u2019t you ask your government the same kinds of questions that you\u2019re standing here asking me? Ask them about their military activities. Get them to tell you what they\u2019re \u2013 or to deny what they\u2019re doing. \\nQUESTION: When I ask for specifics, it seems your response is why are you here? Well, you are leveling that accusation. \\nKIRBY: No, ma\u2019am. \\nQUESTION: And if you give specifics, my colleagues would be able to ask \\nRussian officials. \\nAs Kirby continued to berate the RT journalist and stonewall her request for specifics, an American reporter intervened and objected to Kirby\u2019s use of the phrase \u201c\u2018your defense minister\u2019 and things like that. I mean, she\u2019s a journalist just like the rest of are, so it\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s asking pointed questions, but they\u2019re not \u2026\u201d \\nKirby then insisted that since RT was \u201ca state-owned\u201d outlet that its journalists should not be put \u201con the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets.\u201d (But the reality is that Voice of America, BBC and many other Western outlets are financed by governments or have ideological benefactors.) \\nPublic Diplomacy \\nKirby\u2019s hostility toward legitimate questions being raised about U.S. or U.S.-allied assertions has become typical of Obama\u2019s State Department, which doesn\u2019t seem to want any challenges to its presentation of reality. A screen shot of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland speaking to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013, at an event sponsored by Chevron, with its logo to Nuland\u2019s left. \\nFor instance, during the early phase of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry called RT a \u201cpropaganda bullhorn\u201d and Richard Stengel, Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, issued a \u201cDipNote\u201d saying RT should be ostracized as a source of disinformation. \\nBut Stengel\u2019s complaint revealed a stunning ignorance about the circumstances surrounding the February 2014 putsch that overthrew Ukraine\u2019s elected President Viktor Yanukovych. \\nFor instance, Stengel cited RT\u2019s \u201cludicrous assertion\u201d about the U.S. investing $5 billion to promote \u201cregime change\u201d in Ukraine. Stengel apparently wasn\u2019t aware that Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland had cited the $5 billion figure in support of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cEuropean aspirations\u201d during a public speech to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013. \\nAt the time, Nuland was a leading proponent of \u201cregime change\u201d in Ukraine, personally cheering on the Maidan demonstrators and even passing out cookies. In an intercepted, obscenity-laced phone call with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Nuland said her choice to lead Ukraine was Arseniy \u201cYats is the guy\u201d Yatsenyuk, who ended up as Prime Minister after the coup. \\nSo, was Stengel a purveyor of \u201cfake news\u201d when he was accusing RT of disseminating fake news or was he just assembling some propaganda points for his underlings to repeat to a gullible Western news media. Or was he just ill-informed? \\nBoth democracy and journalism can be messy businesses \u2013 and credibility is something that must be earned over time by building a reputation for reliability. There is no \u201cgold seal\u201d from the Establishment that makes you trustworthy. \\nIt\u2019s simply important to do one\u2019s best to inform the American people and the world\u2019s public as accurately as possible. Awarding trust is best left to individual readers who must be the ultimate judges of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake. \\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.
