Trump suggested it was time to add an extra \u201cF\u201d to NAFTA for \u201cfair trade. \u201d \u201cI have very serious concerns about NAFTA,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNAFTA has been a catastrophe for our country. It\u2019s been a catastrophe for our workers and our jobs and our companies. They\u2019re leaving our country. I want to change it. And maybe we do it  \u2014   maybe we do a new NAFTA and we put an extra \u2018F\u2019 in the term NAFTA. You know what the \u2018F\u2019 is for, right? Free and fair trade  \u2014   not just free trade  \u2014   free and fair trade because it\u2019s very unfair. So all of the statutory guidelines we\u2019re adhering to.
