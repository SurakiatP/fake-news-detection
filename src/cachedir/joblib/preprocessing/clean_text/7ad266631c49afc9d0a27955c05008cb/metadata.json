In return, Aoun is expected to appoint Hariri prime minister. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a power-sharing system,\u201d Salem said. \u201cIn a way, the status quo will continue.\u201d \\nU.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby congratulated Lebanon on the election results. \\n\u201cThis is a moment of opportunity, as Lebanon emerges from years of political impasse, to restore government functions and build a more stable and prosperous future for all Lebanese citizens,\u201d he said in a statement. \\nAsked later about Aoun\u2019s support from Hezbollah, which the State Department has designated a terrorist organization, Kirby said: \u201cLet\u2019 see what decisions he makes, what kind of leadership he exudes as president.\u201d \\nThe U.S. routinely assesses its foreign assistance programs \u201cand we will do that with Lebanon going forward,\u201d Kirby said at a press briefing. \\nAoun\u2019s election drew immediate praise from a top adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ali Khamenei. \\nThe adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, described the choice as a victory for Iran and its allies in Lebanon, because the Lebanese president is \u201ca very significant ring in the chain of the Islamic resistance,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s government-owned Tasnim News Agency. \\nAoun, in his first speech after becoming president, pledged to fight corruption and protect Lebanon from the fires raging around it, referring to the Syrian civil war, according to the Associated Press. He also promised to liberate contested territory under \u201cIsraeli occupation,\u201d according to Hezbollah\u2019s Al Manar-TV, apparently referring to territory Israel considers part of the Golan Heights, which it conquered from Syria during the 1967 war. Saad Hariri and Michel Aoun \\nLebanon has been without a head of state since May 2014, when then-president Michel Suleiman\u2019s six-year term expired. Since then, 45 sessions to elect a new leader have failed because of political infighting, the AP reported. Hezbollah leader Nasrallah and Michel Aoun'"}, "time": 1742564324.5274212}
