Barely above half. Romney had 77 percent in 2012. As noted here yesterday , Romney had a lot of support Trump lacks. And Romney lost. \\nThere have been rumblings among prominent Evangelical women, like Beth Moore of Living Proof Ministries: Try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don\\'t think it\\'s that big a deal. \\n\u2014 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 \\nPolitico asked earlier this month how long Evangelical women can remain behind Trump. \\nThat answer is in, according to the Wall Street Journal , which says they are turning away, that the \u201cRepublican nominee faces vocal backlash from evangelical women over lewd comments and sexual-misconduct allegations.\u201d \\nWhile some are willing to overlook any number of deplorable remarks from Trump just to see Clinton defeated, others have had enough : \"Conservative Christian Women Turn Away From Donald Trump\" https://t.co/YH0ZFOzJRN pic.twitter.com/572wTqMTEm \\n\u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 27, 2016 \\nKimberly Ross wrote at Red State earlier this month that, \\nI don\u2019t believe that I, as an American woman, am oppressed. However, it is beyond disappointing that men who not only claim faith, but are in leadership roles, are so willing to dismiss a predator among them. Maybe Trump has promised them some future role? I don\u2019t know. Regardless, they are lured away from doing their duty and instead join in with someone whose hobby is casting females aside. I\u2019m disgusted by Trump and his male cheerleaders. You should be, too. Thankfully, women like Beth Moore and Rev. Lisa Sharon Harper won\u2019t stay quiet on the sidelines as some Evangelical men have always wished they would. \\nShe is hardly alone, and more and more Evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from Trump. The reaction of Evangelical women, as Laurie Goodstein noted at The New York Times earlier this month, be a rift \u201cthat shapes politics for years.\u201d \\nIt isn\u2019t as if Trump hasn\u2019t been saying these things all along. As David French protested at the National Review back in June, Trump \u201csubverts all of our most cherished values.\u201d The question is, what took them so long? \\nTrump has already had an effect on the Religious Right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. He has 70 percent support from Evangelical men, but while Evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women. \\nIf Trump wants to further shrink his already deflated tent by shutting out another demographic, he\u2019s going about it the right way.'"}, "time": 1742628535.2176783}
