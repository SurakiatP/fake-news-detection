And for the bank\u2019s stockholders, that could mean more frustration lies ahead. John Stumpf abruptly exited late Wednesday from his chief executive and chairman posts at the bank, taking responsibility for the bank\u2019s phony accounts disaster. But the elevation of Timothy J. Sloan, the Wells Fargo president and former chief operating officer, to succeed Mr. Stumpf, and the simultaneous appointment of an independent board chairman seem like incremental moves from a bank that really needs a   to repair the damage. Is Mr. Sloan, an almost   veteran of Wells Fargo and a seasoned insider, the best executive to lead the bank out of crisis? Some of the experts I talked to don\u2019t think so. Sarah Bloom Raskin, deputy secretary of the United States Treasury and a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said that Wells Fargo needed to shift from a reactive   stance to proactive risk management. And this may require more significant change than the company is offering. \u201cThe whole country is watching to see if this bank is seizing the opportunity to make a clean break from doing business in a way that strains its reputation with its customers to one that enhances it,\u201d Ms. Raskin said. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring in a new perspective at the top. \u201d Mr. Sloan may indeed be a great manager. But one of the big questions looming over him is whether his long tenure at Wells Fargo is an asset or a liability. Richard Bove, a veteran bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, said Wells Fargo needed an overhaul that went far beyond the scandal itself. Yes, repairing the culture that allowed the fraudulent practices to occur is a crucial task for Mr. Sloan, but that alone will not get the bank back on track. In recent years, Wells Fargo\u2019s competitors, Mr. Bove said, have vastly improved their operations by exiting significant businesses and selling off assets. Citigroup has gotten out of 30 businesses and sold off a large number of assets, he said. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have also downsized. But Wells Fargo has added lines of business during the period, Mr. Bove said, resulting in a bloated bank. \u201cThis is a company that must make massive revisions to its business model,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cSomeone has to get in there and rip the company apart. Sloan is not the guy to do that. \u201d There is also a question about Mr. Sloan\u2019s previous position as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer from February 2011 to May 2014. In that post, Mr. Sloan was required to sign periodic certifications that he had disclosed to the company\u2019s auditors and the audit committee of the board any fraud involving management or other employees that had a significant role in the company\u2019s internal controls. The pervasive opening of sham accounts, a practice in a division overseen by Carrie Tolstedt, also a top Wells Fargo executive, would certainly seem to qualify as fraud relating to the bank\u2019s internal controls. Did Mr. Sloan make disclosures about these practices to the board during his stint as chief financial officer? If not, why not? And if he did, why were the disclosures not acted on years ago? I asked these questions of Wells Fargo. A spokeswoman, Arati Randolph, emphasized that the bank had determined that the financial impact of the problematic practices was not meaningful. \u201cThe vast majority of the accounts reviewed did not generate fees or result in net income for the company,\u201d Ms. Randolph said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, it cost Wells Fargo more than $10 million to open and service those accounts, which generated the $2. 6 million in fees that was returned to customers. \u201d Certainly, the bank\u2019s shareholders are hoping that Mr. Sloan\u2019s rise will stop the fall in the company\u2019s share price. Wells Fargo\u2019s stock has lost almost $28 billion in market value since early September, when the bank announced its settlement with regulators over the dubious practices. On Friday, after Mr. Sloan held a conference call with analysts, the stock fell 0. 6 percent from the previous day\u2019s close. Annalisa Barrett, a clinical professor of finance at the University of San Diego school of business, thinks the bank may be making the best of a bad situation. She argued that the investor reaction could have been worse had the board announced it was looking for an outsider to replace Mr. Stumpf. \u201cThey likely would have named an interim C. E. O. while they conducted their search,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my opinion, that would have been very disruptive and led to more uncertainty in the market and concern among employees and customers. \u201d Given the sad sequence of events at Wells Fargo, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Why does it take a crisis of this magnitude to get a company or its board to act on governance matters that its shareholders have been agitating about? One such matter involves who runs the Wells Fargo board. For years, the position of chairman was held by the company\u2019s chief executive, most recently Mr. Stumpf. This meant that the same person presided over the board even as he oversaw the bank\u2019s operations. Recently, companies whose chief executives also lead their boards have come under pressure from investors who think these responsibilities should be divided to ensure an appropriate balance of power. At Wells Fargo\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in April, for example, investors were once again asked to vote on a proposal that would have required an independent chairman to replace Mr. Stumpf in that role. Such a proposal has come up at the bank every year for more than a decade. Each time, Wells Fargo has recommended that shareholders nix it and each time the bank has gotten its way. This year was no different. But in arguing against the proposal, Wells Fargo made the following points. Its existing board structure, the company said, \u201cprovides effective independent oversight of management and board accountability\u201d and its governance is \u201cworking effectively as evidenced by the company\u2019s strong financial performance. \u201d Well, so much for that. On Wednesday, the company did an   indicating that its governance prowess might not have been as effective as the company had contended. In his new position as C. E. O. Mr. Sloan will not become board chairman. That assignment now goes to Stephen W. Sanger, retired chief executive and chairman of General Mills, who will be assisted by Elizabeth A. Duke, a former Federal Reserve Board governor, as vice chairwoman. These two directors have a lot on their plates. They are essentially charged with waking up what has been a somnambulant board. Ms. Duke joined the Wells Fargo board only in early 2015, so she cannot be held responsible for overlooking years of problematic activities. Mr. Sanger, on the other hand, has been a Wells Fargo director since 2003. And since 2012, he has held the position of lead independent director of the bank\u2019s board. In that job, he was supposed to ensure that Mr. Stumpf was putting his shareholders\u2019 interests first. That didn\u2019t happen then, but it better happen now.'"}, "time": 1742628346.7690384}
