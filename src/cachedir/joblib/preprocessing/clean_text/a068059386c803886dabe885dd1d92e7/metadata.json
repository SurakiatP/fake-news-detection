DRIVING THE COLUMN If information is the lifeblood of Washington, the Politico writer Mike Allen\u2019s Playbook forms the veins. Pumped out by email every morning, it is where the most influential political operatives in the United States send tidbits or bigger news scoops that they hope will give them the edge in the D. C. skirmish of the week, month or year (and sure, maybe settle a score or two). They do so because it\u2019s what 100, 000 insiders, outsiders, lobbyists and journalists, governors, senators, presidents and   presidents read every morning of the week to be in the know, or, in some cases, to see their own names in print. If they say they do not look for it in their inboxes in their first waking minute, they are lying. Even if you\u2019re not one of these addicts, it reaches you, too, because the distillation of what Mr. Allen considers the most vital news items of the day can influence the thinking of television news producers and Mr. Allen\u2019s rival national political reporters, sometimes in a   way (especially when Mr. Allen has included their work in his list of TOP TALKERS) and occasionally in an   way (especially if he has dismissed their work as    USED NEWS). THE CONVERSATION Mr. Allen\u2019s Playbook provides a daily sense of cohesion for a town at war with itself. Along with important news items, Playbook lists birthdays, births and swanky parties where Republicans and Democrats manage to hold hostilities in check for a couple of hours. It can also carry the whiff of   coziness, pack journalism and clubbiness that pervades our capital city, contributing to Washington\u2019s case of acute  . But that also goes with its role as official D. C.\u2019s village square. The central element of its success has been the frenetic mind of Mr. Allen, who is preparing to start an undisclosed media venture with his Politico colleagues Jim VandeHei and Roy Schwartz. DATA DU JOUR Monday will be the 3, 285th consecutive edition of Playbook. Mr. Allen has written all but eight (Hat Tip: Peter Cherukuri). FLASHBACK \u201cThe Man the White House Wakes Up To,\u201d by Mark Leibovich New York Times Magazine, cover, April 2010. \u201cHe bursts in and out of parties, at once manic and serene, chronically toting gifts, cards and flower arrangements. . .. It is as if Mikey is the host of one big party, and by showing up anywhere in Washington, you have served the Playbook community and are deserving of the impresario\u2019s thanks (or \u201cHat Tip\u201d in Playbookese). . .. Allen was the first reporter hired by Politico\u2019s founding editors, John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, when they left The Washington Post to start the website and newspaper in 2006. He is considered a Politico \u2018founding father.\u2019   \u2026     He speaks in quick and certain cadences, on message, in sound bites. \u201d Playbook reads in the clipped rhythm that Mr. Leibovich describes, with big, bold headlines, ellipses and em dashes. It separates its items with headings like DRIVING THE DAY, FLASHBACK,   and SIREN (a homage to the internet news titan Matt Drudge) and others that I\u2019m imitating here. What can\u2019t be imitated is the intimacy Mr. Allen has with his audience. THE MONEY, HONEY  Politico found dollars in that intimacy. Big corporations with big business pending in Washington  \u2014   Comcast, BP, the United States Chamber of Commerce  \u2014   take Playbook sponsorships that come in the form of paid items that are marked with asterisks and laid into the flow of the newsletter. Such arrangements, which have at times drawn media criticism for blurring journalistic lines, bring in about $55, 000 a week, an executive vice president, Mr. Cherukuri, told me. Playbook also provides the mother ship with a platform to promote itself, through the newsletter (which I mimicked at the top  \u2014   50 percent off   journalism! ). It all makes Mr. Allen\u2019s departure from Playbook kind of a sensitive deal for the company. ODD TIMING (?) The timing of Mr. Allen\u2019s Playbook retirement  \u2014   in the middle of a presidential election for the ages  \u2014   is unexpected. But Mr. Allen told me on Friday that he agreed with Mr. Harris, the editor in chief, that \u201c2017 effectively begins now, so this is the perfect time for the new team to get airborne. \u201d Mr. Allen will continue writing for Politico through the election. It does make some sense it always seemed odd that Mr. Allen, 51, would carry on in his   role while a new venture beckoned and the team forming to succeed him was eager to make a splash. Inside Politico\u2019s sleek new offices in Arlington, Va. on Thursday, Mr. Harris asked me, \u201cHow do you replace Mike? The answer is you don\u2019t replace Mike. \u201d These days, brands can be more important than the news organizations they are attached to. Can Politico replicate Mr. Allen\u2019s success at Playbook? Mr. Harris said that it could and that if Politico\u2019s business was to be \u201cscalable,\u201d a franchise like Playbook  \u2014   now with geographically targeted versions in places like Miami and Brussels  \u2014   cannot be built around \u201ca singular personality. \u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have invented the franchise, but he\u2019s shown other people how to do this job and how to own this space. \u201d WHO THEY ARE Anna Palmer, 34, and Jake Sherman, 30, frequently write together as a team  \u2014   they helped break open the scandal that forced the resignation of Representative Aaron Schock of Illinois in 2015  \u2014   and pitched themselves to Mr. Harris as natural   of Playbook 2. 0. (CNN Money reported they were in the running in April.) Mr. Sherman has covered Capitol Hill for Politico since 2009. Ms. Palmer has covered Congress and was a   of Politico\u2019s newsletter specializing in lobbying, called Politico Influence. Daniel Lippman, 26, who has been helping Mr. Allen with Playbook since 2014  \u2014   and is a peripatetic emailer and   himself  \u2014   will assist them. SNEAK PEEK Playbook was built to meet Politico\u2019s vow to \u201cown the morning,\u201d and to be \u201cdelivered by automatic email\u201d to the BlackBerry, as it proclaimed at its start in 2007. The new version will be made for today\u2019s smartphones, with color and items that can be shared more easily on Twitter and Facebook. A standing Playbook home page, to be introduced later, will update throughout the day. Mr. Lippman will bring continuity from Mr. Allen\u2019s tenure. Ms. Palmer is interested in \u201cthe changing roles for women in Washington and women in politics  \u2014   they\u2019re chiefs of staff and leaders on the Hill, and Playbook needs to reflect that. \u201d Mr. Sherman says the goal is \u201cexpanding the ecosystem of Playbook.   \u2026     We\u2019re of a generation that is coming up and is grabbing control of power in Washington   \u2026     the   to    who are running the town now. \u201d GAME CHANGE Just when Donald J. Trump and the populist forces he represents are upending Washington\u2019s established order, the town is losing its daily bard. (\u201cThe End of Our Times!\u201d the Bloomberg \u201cMasters in Politics\u201d podcast   Tammy Haddad said, only half joking.) But Mr. Allen, who will continue to practice journalism at his new company, said of his successors, \u201cThis is the perfect time for them to step in. \u201d MIKE ALLEN MIND MELD I can\u2019t wait to \u201csleep in\u201d until 5 a. m. BIRTHWEEK Mr. Allen turns 52 on Tuesday, June 21.'"}, "time": 1742561760.294516}
