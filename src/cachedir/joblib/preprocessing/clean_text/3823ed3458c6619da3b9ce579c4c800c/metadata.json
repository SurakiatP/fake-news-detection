The More You Spend the More You Save?! US Lawmakers Fight to Increase F-35 Budget Lockheed\u2019s chief financial officer, Bruce Tanner, explained during a Tuesday earnings conference call that the sides are yet to agree on the cost of fulfilling the contract obligations, terms, and conditions regarding jet construction, and the amount of money to be paid to the manufacturer.\\n\u201cI'd say we haven't really reached closure on any of those three [points],\u201d Tanner was quoted by Defense News as saying. \\nLockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson stated that the delay is normal, as the contract is \u201cvery large\u201d and that there is \u201ca lot of work that has to happen.\u201d \\nDuring the negotiation process, Lockheed spent some $900 million of its own capital to keep the beleaguered project afloat. However, the Defense Department reimbursed the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s expenses in a $1 billion transaction in August. Earlier this month, an additional $743 million was allocated for LRIP 9. \\nStill, Lockheed says it lacks funding to maintain the pace of production process for both LRIPs. \u201cDespite not yet receiving funding sufficient to cover its costs, the corporation continued work in an effort to meet the customer\u2019s desired aircraft delivery dates,\u201d the Lockheed's news release stated. \u201cCurrently, the corporation has approximately $950 million of potential cash exposure and $2.3 billion in termination liability exposure related to the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts.\u201d \u00a9 Flickr/ Times Asi Can\u2019t Fix the F-35?

The troubled contract is now expected to be finalized December 2016, according to F-35 Joint Program Executive Officer Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan. ...\""}, "time": 1742563577.1044936}
