[In the article,   responded to OUT magazine\u2019s Chadwick Moore, who came out as a conservative on Saturday and explained how the   LGBT community started to ignore, reject, and cut ties with him after he wrote a neutral profile on Breitbart Senior Editor MILO and expressed conservative political beliefs.  \u201cGay conservatives aren\u2019t welcome in gay spaces because the people they support are an existential threat to our rights and our community,\u201d claimed   condemning homosexual conservatives including Moore and MILO. \u201cAfter all, queer spaces (such as bars, bathhouses, community centres, and even bookstores) were founded and instrumental in radical sexual politics and political engagement. You can\u2019t divorce that from the social aspect, because doing so would deny the history of our community and the present reality of so many vulnerable LGBT people. \u201d \u201cAsking that the gay community embrace you and your politics is like one turkey asking another to be okay that he voted for the farmer and Thanksgiving,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t care if this hurts someone\u2019s feelings I\u2019m more concerned with the harm their vote causes. So until American conservatism welcomes queer people, queer people shouldn\u2019t welcome American conservatives. Even if they\u2019re queer themselves. Sorry, Chad. Maybe Milo will buy you a drink. \u201d   further attacked homosexual conservatives on his Twitter account, where he added: \u201cI have no time for gay American conservatives. Go cry your tears elsewhere. \u201d I have no time for gay American conservatives. Go cry your tears elsewhere. My latest for the Independent: https:  .   \u2014   Skylar   (@SkylarJordan) February 13, 2017,  During his article coming out as a conservative on Saturday, Chadwick Moore explained how he had been ousted from LGBT circles and cut off from his best friend, who no longer wanted to have anything to do with him. \u201cI decided to go out to my local gay bar in Williamsburg, where I\u2019ve been a regular for 11 years. I ordered a drink but nothing felt the same half the place  \u2014   people with whom I\u2019d shared many laughs  \u2014   seemed to be giving me the cold shoulder,\u201d Moore recalled. \u201cUpon seeing me, a friend who normally greets me with a hug and kiss pivoted and turned away  \u2026     My best friend, with whom I typically hung out multiple times per week, was suddenly perpetually unavailable. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he sent me a long text, calling me a monster, asking where my heart and soul went, and saying that all our other friends are laughing at me. \u201d \u201cI began to realize that maybe my opinions just didn\u2019t fit in with the liberal status quo, which seems to mean that you must absolutely hate Trump, his supporters and everything they believe,\u201d he concluded, adding, \u201cIt can seem like liberals are actually against free speech if it fails to conform with the way they think. And I don\u2019t want to be a part of that club anymore. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
