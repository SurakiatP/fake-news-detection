That changed with the election of President Trump.   liberals were jolted. Some joined women\u2019s marches in January, and many here have become active in   groups, galvanized by a special election this month to fill a vacant House seat that has long been in Republican hands. Ms. Cox   the group PaveItBlue to mobilize volunteers to elect the leading Democrat in the race, Jon Ossoff. Within three weeks, 1, 000 people joined. With the national media descending on Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, and outside money pouring in, the contest is viewed as a major test of whether a wave of   activism since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration will produce change at the ballot box. Ms. Cox\u2019s group is one of more than a dozen popping out like dogwood blooms in these comfortable suburbs of brick homes, shopping malls and technology companies. They have names like the Johns   Progressives Network, Roswell Resistance Huddle and Liberal Moms of Roswell and Cobb. If a Democrat were to win the seat  \u2014   once held by Newt Gingrich, and recently vacated by Tom Price, who joined Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet as secretary of health and human services  \u2014   it would not be because of the $4 million that has come into the Ossoff campaign, much of it from national donors. Rather, it would be thanks to volunteer brigades roused by Mr. Trump\u2019s election, who are knocking on doors, making phone calls and writing personalized post cards to turn out voters. Even though the district favors Republicans, special elections are   affairs a strong ground game by Democrats could upend the usual outcome. Mr. Ossoff, 30, a documentary filmmaker and   candidate, is hoping for a knockout punch in the open primary on April 18. All candidates in the race appear on the same ballot. If Mr. Ossoff, the polling leader, can win more than 50 percent, it will eliminate a runoff. If the race goes to a second round, scheduled June 20, a Republican would be favored because of the party\u2019s historic advantage. Ms. Cox recalls insisting to Mr. Ossoff that he use lawn signs, even after campaign consultants had ruled them out, arguing that they have no effect. She got in Mr. Ossoff\u2019s face  \u2014   literally, she says  \u2014   and told him lawn signs would show shy Democrats like her and her friends that they are not alone. \u201cIf you want volunteer action and people working for you up in these red districts, you need to help us help you,\u201d she recalls telling Mr. Ossoff. Today, there are lots of Ossoff signs. Republicans acknowledged the surge of interest and energy powering Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign. \u201cNancy Pelosi and liberal politicians are flooding into Georgia to try and stop our Republican majority that\u2019s getting things done,\u201d says the narrator of a TV ad running in the district from the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThe stakes are too high to stay home. \u201d Republicans expect their followers to coalesce around one candidate after April 18. \u201cWe\u2019ve held this seat for 37 years, and we\u2019re planning on keeping it for another 37,\u201d said Maddie Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Republican committee. \u201cThe vast majority of the district has no interest in being represented by a   candidate with virtually no experience. \u201d When Mr. Ossoff addressed the Johns   Progressives last week, in a subdivision called Medlock Bridge, he spoke of the young people involved in his campaign. \u201cAnd there are a lot of moms,\u201d a woman piped up from the back, \u201cwho are almost 50 who have never gone to anything like this in their whole life. \u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. Afterward, supporters stayed behind, describing their surprise that so many liberals had come out of the woodwork. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like being a gay person and realizing there are other gay people in the world,\u201d Tobie Kranitz Walters, a business consultant, said. Many newly hatched activists described a similar pathway, from feeling abashed about sharing their political views before November to feeling emboldened to act out of anger at the Trump administration. Jessica Zeigler, 32, who works in the medical device industry, said she had cried for days when Hillary Clinton lost. Her son, Noah, came home from first grade distraught that someone had told a Muslim classmate \u201cnow you have to leave. \u201d \u201cI\u2019d always been surrounded by conservatives, and I was very uncomfortable sharing my views, so I didn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Zeigler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t do any activism. I just voted. But I felt on Nov. 9 that wasn\u2019t enough. I was mad at myself. \u201d On Saturday, Ms. Zeigler and some 25 members of two   groups gathered in the clubhouse of a community pool to write postcards to Democratic voters. Chloe Carlson, 15, wrote to one district resident, \u201cAs a high schooler my future means a lot to me, and it\u2019s in your hands. \u201d She sat at a low table beside her mother, Kit Carlson, who trains bank employees. \u201cWhen I found this group, it was crazy to find out I was not the only one,\u2019\u2019 Mrs. Carlson said. The groups are adept at using social media. They have private Facebook groups, Slack channels to coordinate volunteers and email blasts headlined \u201cIf you only do one thing today. \u201d Lesley Bauer, who founded PaveItBlue with Ms. Cox, was asked the other day by the Ossoff campaign if she could find two dozen volunteers to drive voters to polls. \u201cI said, \u2018Give me 10 minutes,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bauer recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018What?\u2019 They sent me a spreadsheet. I posted it to our closed Facebook group with 1, 000 members. People filled it out immediately, and we sent it back. \u201d Professional campaign organizers, who are used to struggling to enlist volunteers, said they were witnessing something remarkable. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said Amy Friedman, Mr. Ossoff\u2019s field director, a veteran of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in Iowa and Maryland. \u201cNothing we\u2019re doing would be possible without their existence,\u201d Ms. Friedman said of the   groups. \u201cIt\u2019s something Jon says every day. \u201d On Saturday, 50 people signed in at an Ossoff field office in Marietta to knock on doors of likely Democratic voters. \u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d a campaign staff member told the crowd, whose attire included \u201cResist\u201d and \u201cDump Trump\u201d ball caps. \u201cThis is the most effective way to turn out voters. If we can turn out enough, we can end this on April 18. \u201d Ms. Cox, walking a suburban street, knocked on the door of Kevin and Erin Jones. Their young daughter squealed when she heard the election date. \u201cApril 18 is my best friend\u2019s birthday and we\u2019re going to Sparkles!\u201d she said. Both parents said they planned to vote for Mr. Ossoff. Ms. Jones, who works in strategy for a communications company, said she had voted for Mrs. Clinton, but had declined to put a sign in her yard. \u201cThere was just this stigma of being a Democratic voter in Georgia,\u201d she said. There was also a reluctance to broadcast her support because of the strong hostility toward Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump\u2019s election ended that. \u201cI\u2019m all for balance, I\u2019m just not for crazy,\u201d Ms. Jones said. Ms. Cox asked if she would like an Ossoff yard sign. Yes, said Ms. Jones. She pointed to a spot near the mailbox.'"}, "time": 1742563416.621647}
