[During an interview with ChannelFi to promote his new film, Gold, McConaughey was asked if he thinks Hollywood had given Trump a chance to govern.  \u201cWell, they don\u2019t have a choice now. He\u2019s our president,\u201d the Oscar winner said. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s very dynamic and as divisive of an Inauguration and time as we\u2019ve had. At the same time, it\u2019s time for us to embrace and shake hands with this fact. And be constructive with him over the next four years. \u201d Even if you have strong disagreements with Trump, McConaughey says, it\u2019s worth waiting to see what he actually does in his first term in office. \u201cSo anyone, even those who may strongly disagree with his principles or things he\u2019s said and done  \u2014   and that\u2019s another thing, we\u2019ll see what he does compares to what he has said  \u2014   no matter how much you even disagreed along the way, it\u2019s time to think about how constructive can you be,\u201d he said.  Some of the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest stars have spent months protesting Trump\u2019s stunning Election Night victory over Hillary Clinton, and have caused outrage over his Cabinet appointments, his executive orders, and even his pick for the Supreme Court. Celebrities have even gone so far as to launch personal attacks against Trump\u2019s    son. But McConaughey says it\u2019s past time Trump\u2019s detractors stop protesting Trump for the sake of protesting. \u201c\u2018Cause he\u2019s our president for the next four years, at least,\u201d McConaughey said, \u201cthe President of the United States. \u201d McConaughey\u2019s new thriller Gold, in which he plays a prospector in Indonesia, opened in theaters on Jan. 27 and is directed by Stephen Gaghan.
