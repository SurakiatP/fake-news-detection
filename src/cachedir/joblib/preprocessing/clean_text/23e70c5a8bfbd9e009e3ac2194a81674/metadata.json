Brazile has since been let go from CNN after it was discovered she provided the Clinton campaign another question before a debate. Told us it is \u201cillegal\u201d to possess the stolen documents from Wikileaks. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo said, \u201cIt\u2019s different for the media. So everything you learn about this, you\u2019re learning from us.\u201d Wrongly claimed Hillary did not laugh over defending a rapist Brushed off Clinton sex assaults as \u2018Conspiracy Theory Land\u2019 Misquoted Trump , then said he sounds like \u2018Stalin or Hitler\u2019 Intentionally removed critical audio from the footage of Keith Scott\u2019s death, according to a law enforcement media company Ignored Clinton rape charges while bolstering Hillary \\nFrom CNN\u2019s post : It\u2019s time for a new rule on the web: Double, no, triple check before you share. Especially if it seems too good to be true. \\nWhy? Look no further than Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that \u201cTwitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.\u201d \\nNot only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comey\u2019s name was at the top of Facebook\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d box; and Twitter\u2019s \u201cmoments\u201d section had a prominent story about the controversy . (I guess I\u2019ll have to take their word for it. I don\u2019t use Google nor Facebook. As for Twitter, well, just ask Jack .) You can trust Facebook\u2026 \\nNevertheless, Trump\u2019s wrong-headed \u201cburying\u201d claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 \u201cliked\u201d it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide. \\nThe rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sunday\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count. \\nSo that\u2019s what I recommended a \u201ctriple check before you share\u201d rule. \\nNew web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars. \\nBut the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition. \\nA recent BuzzFeed study of \u201chyperpartisan Facebook pages\u201d found that these pages \u201care consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.\u201d (There you have it. From the expert journalism of \u201cBuzzFeed.\u201d) \\nThe less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared \u2014 which does not bode well for the nation\u2019s news literacy during a long, bitter election season. \u201cRight-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,\u201d the BuzzFeed reporting team said. \\nOn a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d box \u2014 a problem that the company says it is trying to address. \\nIn a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined \u201cDonald Trump Protester Speaks Out: \u2018I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump\u2019s Rally.'\u201d \\nA close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump in early October. \u201cFinally, the truth comes out,\u201d he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story. \\nAs soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of \u201cfake news.\u201d But that\u2019s a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth. \\nFake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites: \\n#1, Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you; \\n#2, Hyperpartisan sites that aren\u2019t lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party; \\n#3, \u201cHybrids\u201d that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction. \\nThese sites aren\u2019t going away, so it\u2019s up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it. Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help \u2014 they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks. Josh Stearns from Democracy Fund \\nJosh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play. \\n\u201cFact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,\u201d he told me. \u201cAt a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter \u201cburying\u201d bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the \u201cvery dishonest media.\u201d Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter. \\nTrump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a \u201csocial media blackout.\u201d The blog post contained false information. I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded. \\nDCG\""}, "time": 1742628319.891212}
