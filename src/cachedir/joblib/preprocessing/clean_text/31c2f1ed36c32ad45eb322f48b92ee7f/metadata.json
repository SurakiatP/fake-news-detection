Since June 24th, it has become apparent that some things which claim to be British are anything but, and only loyal Brexiters can tell the difference. \\nHere\u2019s the ultimate Brexiter\u2019s guide to what is British and what will leave our shores forever when the Sacred Emerald is placed in the Queen\u2019s crown to trigger Article 50: \\nThe British legal system \u2013 not British. Based on the Magna Carta, clearly not native to these shores as it has a foreign name, the British legal system has spent centuries convicting British people who must logically be innocent by virtue of their nationality. \\nThe BBC \u2013 not British. The \u2018British\u2019 in the BBC\u2019s name is a Trojan horse which sneaks multicultural propaganda into the homes and hearts of decent patriots. All BBC News programmes have been entirely fictional since 1964. \\nNews International \u2013 British. This US-owned media corporation is as British as steak-and-ale pie, dog-fighting in rural barns and Oxo. \\n16,141,241 Remain voters \u2013 not British. Probably Brazilian. Go back to Brazil. \\nWinning World War II \u2013 British. America was involved at the very, very end, for between five and ten minutes. Russia had no idea it was even going on. \\nParliament \u2013 not British. None of them were elected. They were all appointed by a cabal of elite judges who are all homosexuals. \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564415.5926294}
