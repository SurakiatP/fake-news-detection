Proving just that is an illegal alien who managed to sneak his way back into this country after being deported twice. However, it\u2019s the sick surprise he had for his girlfriend that landed him behind bars \u2013 and hopefully, it\u2019s for good. \\nIt all started when the daughter of illegal alien Raul Perez, 43, got an odd phone call from her father that just couldn\u2019t be ignored. After hanging up with her father, Perez\u2019s daughter immediately called 911, prompting dispatch to send a few officers to the home of the girl\u2019s mother, 31-year-old Karla Guadalupe-Magana, a mother of 5 and Perez\u2019s girlfriend.

Come to find out, the illegal alien decided to strangle her to death for reasons unknown \u2013 but it only gets worse from there . \\nAccording to reports, Perez is actually a Mexico national in the United States illegally and had already been deported twice, but making matters worse, he was actually in police custody just 4 days prior to the murder. Unfortunately, he was released on bond due to a technicality. \\nPerez had been arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, but he reportedly used a fake name to fly under the radar. Although his fingerprints were taken and sent to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), seeing how the agency \u201c doesn\u2019t monitor this type of thing 24/7 ,\u201d Perez was released on bond before the local jail heard anything back. \\nRight now, Perez is facing life in prison and deportation once he has answered for his crimes \u2013 not that it really does any good. As it stands, this illegal alien could live the rest of his life, leeching off the American taxpayer while in our prison system, because our border is so porous that he just walked across three separate times. If he\u2019s deported, that would solve the drain on our taxpayers, but as he\u2019s already proven, it also means he could do it all again if our border issue isn\u2019t solved. \\nThis is the type of problem that America is dealing with, and it all stems from Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and the man\u2019s dangerous policies. Beyond tying Border Patrol\u2019s hands behind their backs, our so-called leader has left our nation\u2019s border literally open for anyone to simply walk across. \\nUnfortunately, because of that lunacy, a mother of 5 is now dead. However, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel if Donald Trump gets elected. Not only will he allow Border Patrol to do its job, he\u2019ll build a wall, making it just about impossible for scum like Perez to come into this country \u2013 and that, my friends, is exactly what we need.'"}, "time": 1742628448.1500688}
