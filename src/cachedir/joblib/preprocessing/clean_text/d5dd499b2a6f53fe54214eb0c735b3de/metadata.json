The jury could not reach a verdict on a single count of theft for Ryan Bundy. \\nThe charges were conspiring to impede federal workers from doing their jobs and that\u2019s exactly what they did. \\nBut in the end, the jury acquitted them . \\nThe jury wasn\u2019t dumb, or blackmailed or somehow brainwashed. They were sick and tired. \\nSick and tired of a bureaucracy in Washington that didn\u2019t listen to them. That dictated use of their lands from thousands of miles away with an iron fist. \\nIt was a classic case of jury nullification : where despite the evidence, the jury is so convinced that the laws are immoral or so wrongly applied that the accused must be set free. \\nAnd so Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan and their five co-defendants were found not guilty. Most of them were set free from the courtroom. Ammon faces charges in Nevada, so he is still being held. \\nAs the Associated Press reported it, even lawyers for the Bundys were shocked at the verdict: \\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s a stunning victory for the defense,\u201d said Robert Salisbury, attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. \u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201d \\nThe U.S Attorney in Oregon, Billy J. Williams, issued a statement defending the decision to bring charges against the seven defendants: \u201cWe strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury.\u201d \\nThis is what happens when the American people see an out-of-control Washington bureaucracy: They ignore them. They ignore the law and decide for themselves that no, these people shall be set free. \\nWhile courts are reluctant to inform juries of their right to \u201cnullify,\u201d that\u2019s exactly what they can do. \\nEffectively, the jury nullifies a law they believe is either immoral or wrongly applied to the defendant, and that\u2019s what happened here. \\nAnd it bodes well for America. Jury nullification sends a messages to prosecutors and lawmakers about their priorities and about what they see as harassing or abusive prosecutions. \\nA professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City wrote about how important the power of jury nullification really is: \\nJuries clearly have the power to nullify; whether they also have the right to nullify is another question. Once a jury returns a verdict of \u201cNot Guilty,\u201d that verdict cannot be questioned by any court and the \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d clause of the Constitution prohibits a retrial on the same charge. \\nSo whether the Bundy\u2019s antics were stupid or dangerous or just plain wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter. The Portland jury found that in this case \u2013 the seven defendants were to be set free because in our court system, a jury of their peers felt the government went too far . \\nYes, this is good news for America, for the people, for the rule of law and for the right of the people to object. To say: \u201c No. We will stand for this no longer.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628566.6913254}
