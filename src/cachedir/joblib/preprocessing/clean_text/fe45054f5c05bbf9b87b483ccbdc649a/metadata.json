They talked about Donald Trump\u2019s appointments to his new cabinet. They gave low marks to Representative Mike Pompeo as the new CIA director for his past policy positions, although they noted his loyalty to Trump as a potential silver lining. They also panned Nikki Hailey as the UN ambassador, which however does allow Trump supporter Henry McMaster succeed her as South Carolina governor. \\nThe most hopeful prospect is Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, who is a potential secretary of state. She has supported Trump\u2019s desire to reconcile with Russia, and has been the most vocal opponent in Congress of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to overthrow Syrian President Assad. Her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of American foreign policy from Jewish neocons and putting America\u2019s interests first again. \\nThis is another great show that you won\u2019t want to miss. Please share it widely. \\n\\nOur show is aired live at 11 am replayed at ET 4pm Eastern and 4am Eastern.'"}, "time": 1742563677.792481}
