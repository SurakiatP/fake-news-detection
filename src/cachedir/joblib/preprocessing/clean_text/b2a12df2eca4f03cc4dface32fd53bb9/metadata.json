An even greater number of respondents, 40%, would wish to work abroad, citing the difficulty of \"a decent life\" in Ukraine.  \\n\\nWhile in the immediate aftermath of the Maidan, 58% of Ukrainians were against the idea of leaving the country, but three years later, only 28% completely reject the idea. \\n\\nExplaining their choice, the respondents put forward their hopes of having better living conditions and ensuring a happy future for their children. Notable also is the fact that the majority of potential migrants live in the western and central regions of Ukraine, ie those closest to the border with the EU. In 2015, about 9.5 million Ukrainian migrants crossed the Polish border.  \\n\\nIs the EU about to withstand a new wave of migration? \\n\\nNo need to wait long for the answer. The new statistics are a reminder of the promise made just yesterday by Piotr Poroshenko. The visa-free regime between Ukraine and the EU will be in place by November 24, he said yesterday, adding that Kiev had fulfilled all its commitments to Brussels.  \\n\\nThe obligations to stop the war in the southwest and improve living standards in the country apparently were not part of the list. \\n\\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742563424.996575}
