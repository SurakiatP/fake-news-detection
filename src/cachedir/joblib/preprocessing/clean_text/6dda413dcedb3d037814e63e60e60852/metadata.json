Its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information. Now we have a new twist: information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it. In other words, the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a user/consumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cInformation can be dressed up a thousand different ways. But it tends to have an \u2018elastic\u2019 quality. By that I mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up. That\u2019s a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press. They expose themselves, even though they don\u2019t want to. It takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation. This is happening now, right in front of our eyes.\u201d \\n\u201cThe basis of big media is theater. News is theater. Its directors and producers think they\u2019re doing a first-rate job. But they\u2019re sadly mistaken. Gaps and obfuscations are growing larger. The outright non-sequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent. The audience is wising up to the farce. Who are these fools who direct the news? They\u2019re simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer. But that transaction doesn\u2019t contain any guarantees about shelf life. Mainstream news is decaying, and the expiration date is approaching. Like civilizations, the petty princes of information rise and fall\u2026\u201d \\nGlobalized media. It\u2019s nice plan. Let\u2019s examine it. \\nThe new technocratic media is based on profiling users. There is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants. \\nShocking? It\u2019s to be expected. How else would technocrats parlay the untold hours they\u2019ve spent sizing up their consumers/users? \\nSeveral years ago, I wrote: \u201cTech blather has already begun, since Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, bought the Washington Post at a fire sale. Jeff Genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to \u2018people on the go\u2019 and make the Post a smashing success. Mobile devices. Multiple platforms. Digital taking over from print. Ads customized to fit readers\u2019 interests (profiling). News stories customized to fit readers\u2019 interests (more profiling).\u201d \\nIn other words, non-news. If you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before, you haven\u2019t seen anything. The \u201cnew news\u201d will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly, under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms. \\nThe tech giant Apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users. Yahoo: \u201cApple News, part of the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, aims to be the primary news source for users of the iPhone and iPad\u2026 Apple says its news app \u2018follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests\u2019\u2026 Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab said the app will be important because \u2018through the awesome power of default, Apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league. This [news] app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within 24 hours of its debut\u2019.\u201d \\nTranslation: Profiling their users down to their toenails, Apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read. \\nNot just one overall presentation for all; no, different \u201cnews outlets\u201d for Apple\u2019s audiences. \\nThis introduces a whole new layer of mind control. \\n\u201cYou\u2019re an Obama fan? Here are stories confirming your belief in the Prophet.\u201d \\n\u201cYou want neo-con on the rocks with a conservative Republican twist? Here\u2019s some war footage that\u2019ll warm your heart.\u201d \\n\u201cDo you believe \u2018government gridlock\u2019 is our biggest concern? Congress can\u2019t get anything done? We\u2019ve got headlines for that from here to the moon.\u201d \\n\u201cTuned into celeb gossip? Here\u2019s your world in three minutes.\u201d \\nThe idea: convince users, one day at a time, that what they already believe is important IS the news of the day. \\nIt\u2019s Decentralized Centralization. One media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and no-context psyops. \\nAnd for \u201cfringe users?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doubtful about GMOs? Well, look at what Whole Foods is planning for their healthier produce section. Cheer up.\u201d Nothing about Maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic Monsanto/Dow experiments or the dangers of Roundup. \u201cYou\u2019re anti-vaccine? Sorry, you don\u2019t count. You\u2019re not a recognized demographic. But here\u2019s a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the I5.\u201d \\nDoes this sound like science fiction? It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the mainstream look of the near-future. Search engines are already \u201cpersonalizing\u201d your inquiries. US ABC national news is climbing in the ratings because it\u2019s giving viewers \u201clighter stories,\u201d and spending less time on thorny issues like the Middle East. \\nThe mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience; and treating every \u201cuser\u201d as a profiled social-construct-bundle of superficial preferences is their answer. \\n\u201cMr. X, we\u2019ve studied the little virtual bubble you live in, and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth.\u201d \\n\u201cHello, audience. We\u2019re going to pitch you on becoming full-fledged obsessed consumers, as if there is no other worthy goal in life\u2014and then we\u2019re going to profile you from top to bottom, to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are, so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands\u2026\u201d \\nThe one-two punch. \\nAny actual event occurring in the world will be pre-digested by robot media editors and profilers, and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences. \\nWho cares what really happened? In the new world, there is no \u2018what really happened\u2019. That\u2019s a gross misnomer. A faulty idea. A metaphysical error. No, there is only a multi-forked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same event\u2026because different viewers want and expect different realities. \\nIn 1984 , Orwell\u2019s Big Brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population. That was old-school. That was primitive technology. That was achieving unity by hammering unity into people\u2019s skulls. This, now, is the frontier of unity through diversity. \\n\u201cWe want to make all of you into androids, through basic PR and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education. However, we recognize you\u2019ll become different varieties of androids, and we\u2019ll serve that outcome with technological sophistication. Trust us. We care about what you prefer.\u201d \\nUser A: \u201cWow, did you see the coverage of the border war in Chula Vista?\u201d \\nUser B: \u201cWar? They had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there. At least a hundred different types. And then I watched an old WW2 movie about aerial combat.\u201d \\nUser C: \u201cChula Vista? They had a great food show. This woman made a lemon pie. I could practically taste it.\u201d \\nUser D: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a border war. It was a drill. And then afterwards, these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear. Vests, shields, communication devices, flash-bangs, auto rifles with silencers, batons. I watch drills all over the country. Love them.\u201d \\nUser E: \u201cChula Vista? The only thing I saw on the news was \u2018sunny and mild\u2019 this week. I watch all the weather channels. I love them.\u201d \\nBUT when a Big One comes along, like the 2016 national election in the US, the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalism\u2019s goals (in the person of Hillary Clinton) blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then it\u2019s the same bubble for everyone. \\nOne problem, though. Major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites, and by WikiLeaks and Project Veritas. This attack has exposed the truth and the Clinton crimes. \\nAnd alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in what\u2019s actually happening on many fronts. \\nThe technocratic plan for the news is failing. \\nIt was a nice plan, but\u2026 \\nIt\u2019s turning out to be a dud. \\nAlt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another: Hillary/Obama support for ISIS; pro-vaccine liars; the collapse of Obamacare; the GMO hustle; pesticide damage\u2026on and on and on. \\nThe result? Major media are being backed into a corner, where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for EVERYONE all the time. The idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing. \\nMajor media are playing defense against the rest of the world. \\nIt\u2019s quite a party. \\nAnd it has no expiration date. \\nA final note: Trump, WikiLeaks, Project Veritas, Drudge, and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in 2016, raining down on major media. It was and is unprecedented. The mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots, as never before. The lying, the collusion, the arrogant sense of entitlement, the desperation, the corruption\u2014it\u2019s all there to see, for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells. Expect more to come, regardless of the outcome of the election. The train has really left the station\u2026 \\n(To read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, Power Outside The Matrix , click here .) \\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED , EXIT FROM THE MATRIX , and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX , Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29 th District of California.
