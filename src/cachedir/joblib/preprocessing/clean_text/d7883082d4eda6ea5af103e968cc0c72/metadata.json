[In a new interview with Michael McCarthy of Sporting News, Whitlock pokes his finger in the eyes of presumptuous sports reporters who think they speak for African Americans, slaps around a few major sports stars, and dishes about his treatment at ESPN.  Long a lightning rod for his    views, Whitlock has a long history in sports media. He\u2019s been a columnist for the Kansas City Star, a star commentator for ESPN, a radio talk show host, a writer for Huffington Post, the central figure of a popular sports website, and a Fox Sports contributor. He was also on the other side of the   divide, having been an offensive lineman for Ball State University\u2019s Cardinals football program. The interview started off with Whitlock criticizing NBA star LeBron James for essentially sitting out games after partying too hard the night before, but the interview then jumped straight to Whitlock\u2019s criticism of the leftward lurch of sports media. The topic kicked off as Whitlock slammed former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his season of clueless   protests. Even as he doubted that politics had kept Kaepernick from landing a new team as a free agent  \u2014   Whitlock said Kaepernick is \u201cdelusional about his standing in the league\u201d  \u2014   the sports writer called the quarterback\u2019s protests ill informed and muddled. \u201cKap is running around with Twitter idiots who love to play the race card,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cNo general manager or coach wants [black lives activist] Shaun King   them in the New York Daily News about a   quarterback who is trying to prove his blackness through public gestures. \u201d Whitlock went on to urge Kaepernick to \u201cget new friends,\u201d and stop hanging around with people coddling him over his   protests. The sports firebrand also noted that he is one of the few who has the spine to point out that Kaepernick is likely dealing with a personal identity crisis due to his upbringing, too. Whitlock said, \u201cI\u2019ve angered the far left by pointing out that Kap has some understandable identity issues based on his unique upbringing and a society that is brutally harsh on   people. Kap is not a thought leader on race or even informed about the issues. He was a guy who liked to kick it, lift weights and be a celebrity quarterback. The Niners benched him and he became a militant activist, which made him attractive to the   movement. \u201d That brought the conversation to the   tilt of the media, something Whitlock has criticized. Sporting News asked Whitlock if liberals are trying to \u201ckill the golden goose\u201d by corrupting sports coverage with   politics. Whitlock was adamant that liberals really are ruining sports media with political content. \u201c  political ideologues want to reshape sports culture to their liking,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cSports culture has long had a major impact on American culture. The values taught and celebrated in sports are conservative. The far left wants to change that. They want sports to have a liberal impact. \u201d The interviewer then asked about the charges made by Breitbart Sports that ESPN is too liberal. Sporting News labeled Breitbart Sports as an \u201c \u201d site trying to stir attacks against ESPN, but Whitlock shot that down, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair to pin this on the \u2018  media.\u2019 ESPN and most of the mainstream media have lurched farther left. That\u2019s a complaint from middle America and, in my opinion, objective America. ESPN\u2019s own ombudsman acknowledged ESPN\u2019s hardcore progressive slant. \u201d Of course, Whitlock is referring to the piece written by ESPN Ombudsman Jim Brady last year exploring whether or not the network has drifted too far to the left. But, even as he spent several thousand words reviewing the claim, Brady ended up insisting that the network had not gone too far left. Despite Brady\u2019s pronouncement, this year ESPN issued new guidelines in an effort to put a dampener on its   talent\u2019s penchant for spouting off on liberal political topics. Speaking of ESPN\u2019s new   guidelines, Whitlock sees the new rules as \u201cconfusing. \u201d Before wrapping up, among the other topics in the interview, Whitlock criticized college player Lonzo Ball\u2019s outspoken and activist father, saying the man has \u201cemasculated\u201d his son with all his public shenanigans. Whitlock said LaVar Ball is \u201churting\u201d his sons\u2019 basketball careers. \u201cHe\u2019s making their careers about him rather than about them,\u201d Whitlock continued. \u201cLaVar is doing way too much. I hope he   his role. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com'"}, "time": 1742564485.8103251}
