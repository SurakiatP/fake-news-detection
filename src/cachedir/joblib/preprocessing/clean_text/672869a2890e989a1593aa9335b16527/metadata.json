Eric Zuesse At 2:47 in this video about a key moment in the 7 September 2016 \u201cTown Hall\u201d \u2018debate\u2019 between Trump and Clinton where Matt Lauer has asked her about her privatization of her State Department emails, Ms. Clinton says, \u201cbut the real question is the handling of classified materials, which is I think what the implication of your question was.\u201d Lauer did not deny that; he was following the line of Comey, that only the classified emails could pose a criminal problem for her. However, that assumption is flat-out false, and both Hillary Clinton knows it (which is why she tried there to narrow the meaning of his question to the classified-information issue ), and also Comey knows it (which is why he has his FBI exclude from its consideration the illegality of her privatization of official email itself \u2014 her theft of U.S. government information, her abuse of even non-confidential information, her destruction of evidence by destroying her government emails, etcetera \u2014 there are several laws she broke which have nothing to do with \u201cconfidential information,\u201d but both the FBI and the \u2018news\u2019 media (at least until Comey\u2019s about-face on October 28th) were ignoring them, and they still do ignore each one of them. Here are six of those laws . They describe what nobody denies that she did, and the maximum sentence under all of them, if the FBI were to \u201cthrow the book at her,\u201d would be 72 years. Conviction of her under them would be a slam-dunk, but all of these laws are being simply ignored. So, the questions here are: Why is the FBI ignoring those criminal laws, which she clearly did violate? Why are America\u2019s \u2018news\u2019 media ignoring the FBI\u2019s ignoring these laws?'"}, "time": 1742563585.1699433}
