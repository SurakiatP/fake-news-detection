[\u201cThe bottom line here is that we\u2019ve got a set of politically driven rules of engagement that are getting our guys and girls overseas killed and hurt unnecessarily,\u201d Hill said of his book\u2019s urgent message.  LISTEN: \u201cThis book Dog Company highlights a number of examples of that, in a real setting, during a real deployment to a province in eastern Afghanistan\u201d in 2008 and 2009, according to Hill.  \u201cMy First Sergeant, Tommy Scott, and myself, we led a heavy weapons company in a violent province in eastern Afghanistan,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt seemed like the enemy was always one step ahead of us, and we discovered why. Through the aid of a   team, we uncovered twelve spies operating on our base. These were Afghan laborers that were hired by the U. S. government to serve as translators and other workers to support us so that we could focus on combat operations. \u201d  \u201cAlso at that time, I was receiving credible intelligence that the enemy was planning a   attack against my base. My command made multiple calls to our higher command to get these twelve spies taken off our hands, as was according to protocol. They would not,\u201d he continued. \u201cWorking against that clock, this credible intelligence of a   attack, we decided to interrogate these spies ourselves to disrupt the attack. The interrogation consisted of me firing a weapon into the ground and scaring some detainees into talking. That led to an investigation, the investigation to a hearing, and a handful of us being drummed out of the military,\u201d Hill said. Marlow asked why the book is presented as \u201csomething the Army doesn\u2019t want you to read. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a thing that a lot of troops overseas refer to in a negative way, and it\u2019s this ideal of \u2018catch and release\u2019 or \u2018revolving door\u2019 regarding our detainee policies overseas,\u201d Hill explained. \u201cA lot of Marines, a lot of guys from the Army on the ground have dealt with this, where you catch detainees, enemy combatants on the battlefield  \u2014   in this case also spies  \u2014   and our higher commands are forcing us to simply release them. \u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve got a really vivid, colorful example of this among several throughout the book, but one that I\u2019ll highlight right here is, we were in a firefight once in a very dangerous valley called Tangi Valley in Wardak Province,\u201d he recalled. We pushed through the ambush line, came across some enemy fighters. We killed some, captured one guy. It just so happened that we blew his arm off. We\u2019re a heavy weapons company, so Mark Nineteens,   machine guns. \u201d  \u201cWe patch him up, put a tourniquet on him, take him to Higher,\u201d Hill continued. \u201cThey save his life, essentially, and they send him back to us two weeks later, and they say, \u2018Hey, we know you caught this enemy fighter, but he\u2019s outside that window of time you had to bring charges against him, so we need you to take him back to the point of capture  \u2014   which is a very dangerous area  \u2014   and release him. \u2019\u201d  He later noted that under NATO rules of engagement, troops in the field have only 96 hours to file charges against suspected enemy combatants or saboteurs, a time frame he called \u201cinsane\u201d  \u2014   especially since the enemy is well aware of the rules and knows how to run out the clock. \u201cI\u2019ve been forced to give guys cab fare so they could go back to their villages after we captured them in combat operations,\u201d he revealed. Hill found it \u201cdisheartening\u201d to be at odds with his government. \u201cI feel like myself, my men have been discarded,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, when you take on a story like this  \u2014   and this book has taken about seven years to write, the government has done a number of things to throw obstacles in our way, to prevent us from getting to publication, so it\u2019s been a long journey. What happens when you write a story like this is, a lot of people start to come out of the woodwork and disclose their own experiences. So I know this is a pretty rampant problem, and I know the right thing to do is make light of it, so the American people know about what\u2019s going on, and they can put pressure on our political system to make change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur young Marines and soldiers do not get to pick and choose where they go to fight, what enemy they get to fight. That\u2019s something we do, and by extension of our votes through the political process, our government does,\u201d he noted.  \u201cWe have an obligation as a people, as a government, that when we send them into these complex environments  \u2014   especially like the ones we\u2019re dealing with in the Middle East, where the enemy fights and then basically falls back into their own populace knowing that they\u2019re going to take civilian casualties, goading us into this sort of collateral damage  \u2014   we have an obligation to stand behind our men and women in uniform when things go sideways, maybe when civilians are killed, and back them. We\u2019re not doing that right now,\u201d he urged. Hill said his book is filled with instances of U. S. troops under fire \u201chaggling with their high command\u201d to justify requests for fire support or   support, illustrating that issues at the political, strategic, and tactical levels need to be addressed. \u201cThe bottom line is, our rules of engagement need to be reviewed. Those parts of it that are overly restrictive and overly cumbersome need to be rolled back  \u2014   especially now, before we consider stepping foot into another theater of conflict,\u201d said Hill. He described tactical command failures, such as failing to send a couple of Blackhawk helicopters to pick up the spies his unit discovered in Afghanistan, as \u201cabandonment\u201d of our troops. \u201cHowever, when they found out we interrogated these spies ourselves, they initiated an investigation, and they sent slews of Blackhawk helicopters into our base to bring in investigators to investigate us for our actions,\u201d he added. Hill looked back to 2003, when General Eric Shinseki told the Bush administration that at least 250, 000 \u201cboots on the ground\u201d would be needed to win on the ground in Iraq, because \u201cit\u2019s not going in to invade a country that you have to worry about it\u2019s the phase three and phase four of rebuilding that you have to worry about. \u201d \u201cWe have only dealt with Iraq and Afghanistan in terms of tens of thousands,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe have not even come close to the resources that are necessary to fight and win in that conflict, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we have constantly and consistently, from the very beginning, set our people up for failure. \u201d He further quoted World War II General Douglas MacArthur\u2019s advice that the troops who defeat a wartime enemy should not also be tasked with rebuilding efforts, but \u201cwe\u2019ve asked our people for the last 10 or 15 years to do both jobs, in an extremely   state. \u201d \u201cAll these things matter. All these things need to be looked at. They all affect how well we can do our jobs. The bottom line here is if we\u2019re going to ask our people to go in and do a job, then we need to back them when things go sideways. And if we\u2019re going to ask them to do a job, we need to resource them and equip them so that we can see it through to the end,\u201d he urged. This is all the more important because access to local resources can be problematic in theaters like Afghanistan. In the case of the interrogation that led to the Army investigating his unit, Hill mentioned that he was unable to share some of the intelligence he had on the suspected enemy spies with Afghan police officers and had to contend with the possibility that some of them were compromised enemy agents. He noted that the danger of insider threats has proven to be far worse than originally estimated. Hill warned that working with kid gloves in such treacherous environments, in a type of warfare which relies very heavily on timely and reliable intelligence, is incredibly dangerous. In his own case, he was accused of war crimes and \u201cpsychological torture\u201d for merely perpetrating a ruse designed to frighten his   prisoners into divulging vital information. In essence, he tricked these prisoners into thinking their less valuable comrades had been taken outside by American troops to be beaten and shot, when, in truth, none of them suffered more than a hard slap. \u201cThe lawyers are running the war,\u201d he complained. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem here. \u201d Hill described himself as a \u201c  veteran\u201d whose   died from wounds suffered during World War I. \u201cMy grandfather served in the Navy during WW2. My dad was an infantryman, and I\u2019m an infantry  \u2014   was an infantry officer,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to West Point, branched infantry, became a Ranger, airborne qualified, served in Korea, Iraq, and then Afghanistan, which is where the book is set. My time in Iraq was spent as a combat adviser. I fought alongside the Kurds and the Peshmerga, fought from just south of Mosul all the way down to Ramadi during the surge in Iraq. \u201d Hill enthusiastically agreed with critics who say media bias and   journalism have distorted the true stories of Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cThis book Dog Company is full of examples of that and full of examples of a lot of the politically driven rules of   stuff that we just talked about,\u201d he told Marlow.  \u201cThere is a story in the book, one of the chapters about   of the way in, where we receive an SOS call from a New York National Guard unit that gets caught up in a valley called Tangi Valley,\u201d he offered as an example.  \u201cWe had this sort of IM chat capability from vehicle to vehicle, so these guys are about 45 minutes away in the valley, and we get this SOS chat: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re in trouble. Come give us a hand if you\u2019re nearby or available.\u2019 So we load up, move out to those guys, not expecting to do so on that day because we had other operations going on,\u201d he recalled.  \u201cWe show up, their vehicles are burned through the asphalt into the bedrock. There are uniform items strewn about the battlefield. There are shell casings all over the place. Soon after, a special operations unit shows up on the ground with pictures of two guys and says, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got two New York National Guardsmen missing in action right now. We\u2019ve got to go find their bodies. We\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re dead or alive,\u2019\u201d he continued.  \u201cThat mission turns into a hunt, a search for these two guys. Long story short, our unit  \u2014   my guys, Dog Company  \u2014   finds one of the guys in a field some distance away. His arms had been hacked off. He\u2019s naked. His uniform has been ripped off. His heart has been cut out, or at least that\u2019s what we suspect because there is a hole in his chest right where his heart should be. At this point in time, we had a lot of assets in the air, and we were getting reports that his fingers were being sold in the local bazaars as war trophies. \u201d \u201cMy guys are the guys on the ground that are sifting through all this crap, and I find out some number of weeks later that what\u2019s reported in the AP is that three National Guard soldiers were killed in action in Afghanistan in this area. Here are their ages. Here are their ranks. Here are their names. Killed in an I. D. ambush. End of story. No further comment,\u201d said Hill. \u201cPart of the problem here is that the American people don\u2019t know what we\u2019re up against,\u201d he contended. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how barbaric and savage the enemy that we\u2019re dealing with is, and the government has been hiding this from us. It really changes your perspective when you understand what you\u2019re really dealing with. It changes the sense of urgency that you have. It changes what you\u2019re willing to do to overcome such a barbaric enemy. Unfortunately, the American people have had a lot of this stuff repressed and hidden from them. \u201d Hill said the Obama administration was \u201ca good example of the type of mindset and people that have pushed us more in the direction of being too P. C. and   the military and the government at large. \u201d \u201cThe folks that have been advocates and have really come to the aid of Dog Company and other stories like ours, are folks like United American Patriots,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re an organization that is working to push the current administration, and has for past administrations, to conduct full reviews of the Uniform Military Code of Justice, to review the laws of warfare versus the rule of law, which is what we\u2019re trying to push overseas. \u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t fight a counterinsurgency, you can\u2019t fight combat, with the same rules and restrictions that you police your own First World country with,\u201d he argued. \u201cThere\u2019s an inevitable conflict there between what we should be subscribing to in terms of law of warfare, which gives commanders a lot more latitude on the battlefield to discern and make decisions that they need to, given the realities on the ground  \u2014   versus trying to push this agenda of, \u2018Hey, we rule with police in a highly progressive Western civilization let\u2019s try to apply that rule of law to a   or   country.\u2019 It just doesn\u2019t work. \u201d Marlow asked Hill to clarify just what the government has done to prevent publication of his book. \u201cThere\u2019s a case that\u2019s central to this book. This book is tragic, but it\u2019s also unfortunately very entertaining,\u201d Hill observed. \u201cThe feedback that we\u2019ve gotten is that when people pick it up, from the first chapter, they can\u2019t put it down. The reason for that is it has a number of really neat elements to it. It\u2019s sort of a cross between Band of Brothers and that sort of combat action and brotherhood, and then also it ends and sort of culminates with a court hearing, if you will, action. It\u2019s sort of a cross between Band of Brothers and A Few Good Men. \u201d \u201cThe case central to the story was kicked off by an investigation which led to a hearing. The findings took that investigation and hearing  \u2014   an Article 32 hearing, for those of your audience that are familiar with military law  \u2014   the findings were written by an investigating officer who sort of serves as a judge, over what is equivalent to a civilian grand jury proceeding,\u201d he explained.  \u201cMy higher command at that time fought to  \u2014   and I didn\u2019t know this  \u2014   they conspired to make that set of findings an \u2018incomplete record\u2019 through a technicality, to make it unavailable through the Freedom of Information Act to the American public. From the very beginning, the findings were stifled and masked by the government to try to prevent the American public from knowing what really happened to Dog Company in Afghanistan in 2008 and 2009,\u201d he charged.  \u201cIf you flip through the book, you\u2019ll notice that there are a number of redactions in the book,\u201d Hill added. \u201cWe submitted the book to the Office of Security Review at the Pentagon. They advertise that they can turn a book around in a month. They\u2019ve got a whole office and staff dedicated to doing this. They got back to us once they received the book and said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re book\u2019s a little long\u2019  \u2014   our book\u2019s about 420 pages it\u2019s got a bit of a presence to it  \u2014   and they said, \u2018It\u2019s gonna take us two months.\u2019 It took them a year to get their review done, and when we got the book back, by that point in time, we had hired subject matter experts in   and intelligence to review it, and they argued that 90 percent of the redactions that the government had made were already in federally funded websites. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
