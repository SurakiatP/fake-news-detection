Kennedy wrote for the majority in the    decision. The case arose from statements made during jury deliberations in a 2010 sexual assault trial. \u201cI think he did it because he\u2019s Mexican, and Mexican men take whatever they want,\u201d a juror said of the defendant, according to sworn statements from other jurors submitted by defense lawyers after the trial was over. The juror, identified in court papers as H. C. was a former law enforcement officer. After the trial was over, two other jurors submitted sworn statements describing what he had said during deliberations. \u201cHe said that where he used to patrol, nine times out of 10 Mexican men were guilty of being aggressive toward women and young girls,\u201d one juror recalled. Those statements, Justice Kennedy wrote, warranted an investigation by the trial judge into deliberations that are ordinarily secret. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion. In dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that the majority opinion was a well intentioned but   intrusion into jurors\u2019 privacy. \u201cThis is a startling development,\u201d Justice Alito wrote, \u201cand although the court tries to limit the degree of intrusion, it is doubtful that there are principled grounds for preventing the expansion of today\u2019s holding. \u201d Justice Kennedy wrote that the usual tools to root out biased jurors  \u2014   questioning during jury selection and reports from jurors before they render a verdict  \u2014   are less effective when race is at issue. Pointed questions about racism may exacerbate tensions, he wrote. And jurors may be reluctant, he added, to accuse one another of insensitivity. \u201cNot every offhand comment indicating racial bias or hostility will justify\u201d an investigation into jurors\u2019 deliberations, Justice Kennedy wrote. \u201cFor the inquiry to proceed, there must be a showing that one or more jurors made statements exhibiting overt racial bias that cast serious doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the jury\u2019s deliberations and resulting verdict. \u201d In dissent, Justice Alito countered that it would be difficult to limit the sweep of the ruling. He added that the court\u2019s constitutional analysis was flawed. \u201cThe real thrust of the majority opinion is that the Constitution is less tolerant of racial bias than other forms of juror misconduct, but it is hard to square this argument with the nature of the Sixth Amendment right on which petitioner\u2019s argument and the court\u2019s holding are based,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat the Sixth Amendment protects is the right to an \u2018impartial jury.\u2019 Nothing in the text or history of the amendment or in the inherent nature of the jury trial right suggests that the extent of the protection provided by the amendment depends on the nature of a jury\u2019s partiality or bias. \u201d In earlier cases, the Supreme Court has said that even egregious misconduct in the jury room cannot be used to challenge a conviction if it would require jurors to testify about what was said there. Until Monday, though, the court had never confronted whether racial or ethnic prejudice requires an exception to the general rule. In 1987, in Tanner v. United States, the Supreme Court let stand convictions in a mail fraud case in Florida even though the jury had treated the trial as \u201cone big party\u201d fueled by \u201crampant drug and alcohol abuse,\u201d as one juror described it. During recesses, jurors drank pitchers of beer and liters of wine, and they used marijuana and cocaine. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, writing for the majority, said there were good reasons to ignore \u201cirresponsible or improper juror behavior\u201d if it was based on jurors\u2019 accounts of what had gone on in the jury room.    challenges based on jurors\u2019 testimony, she wrote, would make it less likely that jurors would speak candidly during deliberations. Allowing such challenges would encourage lawyers to harass former jurors, she said, and undermine the finality of verdicts. In 2014, in Warger v. Shauers, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that jurors may not testify about what went on during deliberations, even to expose dishonesty during jury selection. But Justice Sotomayor, writing for the court, suggested that cases involving racial bias might require a different result. \u201cThere may be cases of juror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf and when such a case arises, the court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not sufficient to protect the integrity of the process. \u201d Monday\u2019s decision addressed the question the court had deferred in 2014. Miguel Angel Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez, who maintains that he is innocent, was convicted of harassing and trying to grope two teenage sisters in a racetrack bathroom. A defense witness testified that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez was elsewhere at the time of the assault. H. C. the juror said to have made the biased statements, was not persuaded by that testimony, according to a fellow juror. \u201cHe said he did not think the alibi witness was credible because, among other things, he was \u2018an illegal,\u2019\u201d the fellow juror said. The jury deadlocked on the most serious charge, a felony, but convicted Mr. Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez of three misdemeanors. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation. In Monday\u2019s decision in Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez v. Colorado, No.   Justice Kennedy said the justice system must root out racial bias. \u201cThe progress that has already been made,\u201d he wrote, \u201cunderlies the court\u2019s insistence that blatant racial prejudice is antithetical to the functioning of the jury system and must be confronted in egregious cases. \u201d Justice Alito responded that the majority\u2019s motives were admirable but misguided, citing the 1987 decision. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision is \u201d he wrote. \u201cIt seeks to remedy a flaw in the jury trial system, but as this court said some years ago, it is questionable whether our system of trial by jury can endure this attempt to perfect it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562257.6820621}
