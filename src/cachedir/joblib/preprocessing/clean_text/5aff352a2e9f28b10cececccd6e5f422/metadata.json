Host Chris Wallace said, \u201cHouse Republicans are right now facing angry voters at town halls this weekend. On Friday, \u2018The Cook Political Report,\u2019 which you know well, the kind of unofficial bible assessing House races, shifted its assessment of 20 seats now held by Republicans in the direction of Democrats. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re going to win them, but that they are more likely for Democrats to win. You could lose your House majority over this. \u201d Priebus said, \u201cYeah, these are the same people that said Donald Trump wasn\u2019t going to run and he ran, he couldn\u2019t win the general, he won the general, he couldn\u2019t get health care repeal and replace through the House, he got it through the House. Look, the fact of the matter is there are sometimes in life you have to do what\u2019s right, not what\u2019s politically expedient. We believe this is going to be a better product, and by the time people see the premiums are lower, it\u2019s a better service, more options, more choices, they\u2019re going to reward the Republicans that stood up and said we are not going to see the Obamacare system, which is failing and collapsing continue any longer. We\u2019re going to do something better, and We\u2019re going to do our job as legislators to get this thing done. I think that the Republican Party will be rewarded. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN,  '"}, "time": 1742562322.242887}
