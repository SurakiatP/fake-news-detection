As their reviews spread across the internet on Tuesday, it became clear there was little consensus about the film. The reviews were mostly positive, but there were several notable exceptions. Let\u2019s start with, oh, to pick one at random, The New York Times. A. O. Scott called it a \u201cthoroughly mediocre movie\u201d with \u201ca surprisingly hackish script. \u201d On MTV, Amy Nicholson said the film\u2019s director, Gareth Edwards, had an opportunity to \u201cexplore a   frontier,\u201d but instead, \u201cwe\u2019re trapped on a   cruise to the moon. \u201d The Miami Herald was also underwhelmed. Rene Rodriguez said the end was rousing, but the journey there was \u201cabout as exciting as a long drive down the Florida Turnpike. \u201d In USA Today, Brian Truitt said the movie was undermined by its ties to the original trilogy, and it \u201cmisses a real chance to turn the familiar into something remarkable. \u201d Stephanie Zacharek wrote in Time that it was \u201calmost pedantic in its inoffensiveness. \u201d The New Yorker was perhaps the most harsh. Calling the film \u201clobotomized and depersonalized,\u201d Richard Brody wondered: Is it time to abandon the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise? Several other critics were far more complimentary, and some even considered it among the best of the eight films in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d canon. Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Chris Nashawaty said the film \u201cgets the obsessive    curiosity that the most rabid \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fans have always had. \u201d Richard Lawson wrote in Vanity Fair that it is \u201ca bracing and dizzying marvel, propulsively pitched and even, I dare say, moving. \u201d Jen Yamato in The Daily Beast declared it the best \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie since \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back. \u201d In Variety, Peter Debruge said it is \u201cnot the crass   skeptics may have feared. \u201d In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers said the spinoff \u201chas the same primitive,   emotional, loopy, let\u2019     spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy. In Wired, Angela Watercutter said it was unfairly burdened by the inevitable discussion of how it fit into the postelection climate in the United States. Bryan Bishop wrote in The Verge that several of the characters \u201cfeel thin and undefined\u201d and struggled with the workload of building itself from the ground up. Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian that it was an \u201cexhilarating,   and enjoyable adventure. \u201d In The Chicago Tribune, Michael Phillips said it is \u201crough around the edges, hectic in its crosscutting but increasingly effective as kinetic cinema. \u201d In Deadline, Pete Hammond called it \u201ca rousing and wholly entertaining take that proves you don\u2019t have to go along with the recipe in order to serve up a satisfying meal for fans and   alike. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562193.4006712}
