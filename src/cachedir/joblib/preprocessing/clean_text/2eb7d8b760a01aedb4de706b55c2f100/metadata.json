Gorsuch for the Supreme Court to the full Senate for consideration. \u25a0 Democrats now seem to have the votes to filibuster Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. \u25a0 But Republicans will most likely vote to change Senate practices later in the week so that Judge Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority vote. \u25a0 The tenor of the Judiciary Committee strongly suggests that the full Senate debate on Judge Gorsuch will be even more contentious. With an announcement from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, during the Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing to vote on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, Democrats found their 41st vote in support of a filibuster, sending the body hurtling toward a bitter partisan confrontation this week. Read more \u00bb As senators began revealing their votes on Monday, partisan acrimony predominated. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee\u2019s chairman, accused Democrats of searching in vain for credible reasons to vote against Judge Gorsuch. \u201cThis nominee that we\u2019re voting on today is a judge\u2019s judge,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a picture of the kind of justice we should have on the Supreme Court. \u201d Mr. Grassley suggested that some attacks in recent weeks from Democrats, which have included criticisms of the spending push from outside groups supporting Judge Gorsuch, defied the country\u2019s values. \u201cThis is America,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere people can spend their money where they want to spend it. \u201d Taking her turn next, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, criticized Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and his reluctance to answer questions. She did thank Mr. Grassley for overseeing the hearings fairly. Ms. Feinstein also reminded the public about the treatment last year of Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Republicans refused to even consider Judge Garland during a presidential election year. \u201cIn my view, this is not a routine nomination,\u201d she said at the top of her remarks. In his own comments, Mr. Grassley expressed no regrets. \u201cI believe then and I believe now that we took the right course for the Senate and for the court,\u201d he said. From the hearing\u2019s opening moments, lawmakers took turns lamenting the state of the Senate, holding forth on the present divisions but appearing resigned to the institutional upheaval that awaits this week. Few sounded as aggrieved as Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the body\u2019s   member. He first suggested that Republicans\u2019 treatment of Judge Garland last year had convinced Judge Gorsuch that \u201cthis committee is nothing more than a partisan rubber stamp,\u201d allowing the nominee to evade straightforward questions during his hearings. He said that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, had \u201cpromised to use whatever tactic is necessary to get his way, to make sure that Donald Trump\u2019s nominee is confirmed, even if that means forever damaging the United States Senate. \u201d \u201cNow, I respect this institution as much as anyone. I never expected to be here long enough to become the dean of the Senate,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cI\u2019ve devoted myself to the good the Senate can accomplish. But I cannot vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of   Americans are at risk. Because I fear that the Senate I would be defending no longer exists. \u201d As the committee continued debating Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, Republicans received a modest lift outside the hearing room: Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said he would not join fellow Democrats in filibustering the nomination. He urged Republicans against the   nuclear option, changing the rules to allow Judge Gorsuch to be approved on a simple majority vote instead of the 60 votes now required. \u201cNeither Republicans nor Democrats are blameless for where things stand in our politics and on this nomination,\u201d Mr. Bennet said in a statement, which did not reveal his voting intentions on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination itself. \u201cBut at some point, we need to take the long view and stand up for our institutions. \u201d What happens next will most likely be up to Republicans. And their intentions seem clear. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week,\u201d Mr. McConnell told Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d Practically, this will almost certainly require Republicans to change Senate practice and elevate Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote. The strain has already compelled leaders from both parties to adopt the    tone of hostage negotiators  \u2014   and the   senatorial tic of leavening criticism by calling opponents \u201cfriends. \u201d \u201cOur Republican friends are acting like, you know, they\u2019re a cat on the top of a tree and they have to jump off, with all the damage that entails,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d urging Mr. Trump to submit a new judge. \u201cCome back off the tree, sit down and work with us. \u201d Mr. McConnell chose to forgo analogies. Judge Gorsuch will get his new robes, he suggested, and \u201chow that happens really depends on our Democratic friends. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561987.8922148}
