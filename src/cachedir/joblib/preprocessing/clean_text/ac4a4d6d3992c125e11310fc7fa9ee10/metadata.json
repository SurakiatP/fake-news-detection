Image by plaisanter~, via Flikr. Used under creative commons. Safety pin. I\u2019m wearing one. My daughter wants to wear one to school. She understands the responsibility it entails. She knows that the safety pin means \u201cI am a safe person.\u201d She knows that if anyone at her school is being harassed, she will go stand next to that kid. She knows who in her grade might be a target. I hear the critique. I saw the article because two WOCs posted it. I know they resonated with it because of long experience with lip service and/or betrayal by white feminists. I hear that. Nevertheless, I cannot support slamming the safety pin idea, and here\u2019s why: 1) If a big white Trump dude is bearing down on me screaming \u201cGO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY\u201d, I am not going to check the progressive bona fides of a person near me wearing a safety pin. I will only be grateful to know there\u2019s another person nearby who won\u2019t assault me and is demonstrating a willingness to help defend me. 2) I\u2019ve heard from plenty of POCs and Muslims as well as some LGBTQIAs that they feel surrounded by enemies. The safety pin helps them feel that they are not isolated and alone. 3) We can\u2019t all go around all the time wearing a sandwich board that reads \u201cBlack and Latinx and Asian and First Nations and People with Disabilities and Muslim and Sikh Lives Matter.\u201d A safety pin is cheap, ubiquitous, and easy to wear with any outfit. 4) For some white people, putting on a safety pin may be the first step toward allyship that they have ever taken. By putting it on, they make themselves a target for Trump supporters IRL and online to call them whiny liberal losers. Then liberals/progressives/leftists turn around and tell them they are embarrassing themselves by wearing a safety pin? Yeah, that\u2019s how we lose. 5) When I put on a safety pin, I am recommitting every day to stand up to oppression, whether in the form of harassment or in the form of legislation enacted by a Trump administration. I hope the pin helps others to think, every single day, about how they can resist our nation\u2019s slide into a morass of hatred and prejudice and assist others with less privilege to attain equal rights. In fact, I will say this as a woman of color, as a member of the LGBTQIA community: if you are wearing a safety pin, this is what I expect of you. 6) Some people have said that white supremacists have co-opted the safety pin, but I haven\u2019t seen documentation of this so far. Given the level of Trumpist ridicule heaped on the safety pin movement, I\u2019m guessing that many if not most Trump supporters will proudly NOT wear a safety pin. If you are also wearing a safety pin, for you I am posting a comic that explains how to support and protect someone targeted for Islamophobic harassment. This guide is broadly applicable to other -isms and -phobias. Wearing a safety pin is only one step. We are facing an unprecedented threat, and this will be a long struggle. It will require listening and following the leads of the communities who are most threatened. I hope everyone wearing a pin will continue to stand with those communities over the next four years and beyond. LINKS to resources for wearing a safety pin:'"}, "time": 1742562095.8234396}
