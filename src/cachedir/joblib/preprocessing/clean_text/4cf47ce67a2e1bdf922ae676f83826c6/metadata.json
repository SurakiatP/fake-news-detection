Mr. McCartney\u2019s suit is over what is known as copyright termination: the right of authors  \u2014   or any creators  \u2014   to reclaim ownership of their works from publishers after a specific length of time has passed. It was part of the 1976 copyright act and in recent years has become a potent force in the music industry as performers and songwriters have used the law to regain control of their work. In Mr. McCartney\u2019s suit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for the singer detailed the steps they have taken over the last nine years to reclaim Mr. McCartney\u2019s piece of the copyrights in dozens of Beatles songs he wrote with John Lennon, including \u201cLove Me Do,\u201d \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d and \u201cAll You Need Is Love. \u201d That process involved filing numerous legal notices, which, the suit says, should be enough to guarantee that   would return the rights to Mr. McCartney, starting in October 2018. But the suit contends that late last year, after the band Duran Duran lost a copyright suit in Britain, executives at   began to suggest to Mr. McCartney\u2019s lawyers that the rule might not apply to his songs. In the Duran Duran case, a judge ruled that the band\u2019s original contract was governed by British law, which barred it from reclaiming rights in the United States. Under United States law, this power cannot be waived by contract. As Mr. McCartney\u2019s suit notes, he and Mr. Lennon signed a series of publishing contracts in Britain beginning in 1962. The suit contends that in a series of remarks and emails to Mr. McCartney\u2019s lawyers,   executives alluded to the Duran Duran case and refused to confirm that he could reclaim his rights. The suit asks for a declarative judgment that Mr. McCartney would not be violating any contract by exercising his termination rights. In a statement,   said that it had \u201cthe highest respect for Sir Paul McCartney\u201d and that it worked closely with Mr. McCartney and the Lennon estate. But the company added, \u201cWe are disappointed that they have filed this lawsuit, which we believe is both unnecessary and premature. \u201d For many musicians, especially those who had hits decades ago, copyright termination has become a powerful means to reclaim their work and to gain financial leverage with the record companies and music publishers that represent them. When Prince\u2019s classic albums were nearing the point at which he could reclaim them, he struck a lucrative new deal with his label, Warner Bros. to let the company continue to release his music. And in the music industry, there is no more valuable catalog than the songs of the Beatles. Michael Jackson purchased the rights to those songs in 1985, and 10 years later he formed   as a joint venture with Sony. Last year, Sony bought out the share of Mr. Jackson\u2019s estate for $750 million. In a note referring to a standard legal threshold, Mr. McCartney\u2019s lawsuit includes a major understatement. \u201cThe copyright interests at issue in this case,\u201d the suit says, \u201care worth well in excess of $75, 000. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628529.0446541}
