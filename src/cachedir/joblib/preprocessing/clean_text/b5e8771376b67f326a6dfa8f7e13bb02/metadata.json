Besides this recent work on the Standing Rock Sioux protests in North Dakota, this company has offices in Iraq and Afghanistan and is run by a special forces Army veteran.\\nAccording to a summary of the investigation , TigerSwan \u201cis in charge of Dakota Access intelligence and supervises the overall security.\u201d\\nThe Morton County, North Dakota, Sheriff\u2019s Department also recently concluded that another security company, Frost Kennels, operated in the state while unlicensed to do so and could face criminal charges . The firm\u2019s attack dogs bit protesters at a heated Labor Day weekend protest .\\nLaw enforcement and private security at the North Dakota pipeline protests have faced criticism for maintaining a militarized presence in the area. The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and National Lawyer\u2019s Guild have filed multiple open records requests to learn more about the extent of this militarization, and over 133,000 citizens have signed a petition calling for the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene and quell the backlash.\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has also implemented a no-fly zone , which bars anyone but law enforcement from flying within a 4-mile radius and 3500 feet above the ground in the protest area. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer on the scenes in North Dakota with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said on Facebook that \u201c DAPL private security planes and choppers were flying all day\u201d within the designated no-fly zone.\\nDonnell Hushka, the designated public information officer for the North Dakota Tactical Operation Center, which is tasked with overseeing the no-fly zone, did not respond to repeated queries about designated private entities allowed to fly in no-fly zone airspace.\\nWhat is TigerSwan? TigerSwan has offices in Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, India, and Latin America and has headquarters in North Carolina. In the past year, TigerSwan won two U.S. Department of State contracts worth over $7 million to operate in Afghanistan, according to USAS pending.gov.\\nTigerSwan, however, claims on its website that the contract is worth $25 million, and said in a press release that the State Department contract called for the company to \u201cmonitor, assess, and advise current and future nation building and stability initiatives in Afghanistan.\u201d Since 2008, TigerSwan has won about $57.7 million worth of U.S. government contracts and sub-contracts for security services.\\nCompany founder and CEO James Reese , a veteran of the elite Army Delta Force , served as the \u201clead advisor for Special Operations to the Director of the CIA for planning, operations and integration for the invasion of Afghanistan and Operation Enduring Freedom\u201d in Iraq, according to his company biography. Army Delta partakes in mostly covert and high-stakes missions and is part of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , the latter well known for killing Osama Bin Laden.\\nOne of TigerSwan\u2019s advisory board members, Charles Pittman, has direct ties to the oil and gas industry. Pittman \u201cserved as President of Amoco Egypt Oil Company, Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, and Regional President BP Amoco plc. (covering the Middle East, the Caspian Sea region, Egypt, and India),\u201d according to his company biography .\\n\u201cSad, But Not Surprising\u201d Investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill told Democracy Now! in a 2009 interview that TigerSwan did some covert operations work with Blackwater USA , dubbed the \u201c world\u2019s most powerful mercenary army \u201d in his book by the same name. Blackwater has also guarded oil pipelines in central Asia, according to Scahill\u2019s book .\\nReese advised Blackwater and took a leave of absence from TigerSwan in 2008 in the aftermath of the Nisour Square Massacre , a shooting in Iraq conducted by Blackwater officers which saw 17 Iraqi civilians killed. TigerSwan has a business relationship with Babylon Eagles Security Company , a private security firm headquartered in Iraq which also has had business ties with Blackwater .\\n\u201cIt is sad, but not surprising, that this firm has ties to the US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq,\u201d Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the women-led peace group CODEPINK and the co-founder of the human rights group Global Exchange, told DeSmog. \u201cIt is another terrifying example of how our violent interventions abroad come home to haunt us in the form of repression and violation of our civil rights.\u201d\\nThe North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Private Investigation and Security Board are also conducting parallel investigations to the one recently completed by Morton County. TigerSwan did not comment on questions posed about their contract.\\n\\nThe post Security Co.
