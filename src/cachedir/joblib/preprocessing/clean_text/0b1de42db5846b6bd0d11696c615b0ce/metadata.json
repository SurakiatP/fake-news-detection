The Iran nuclear deal is  \u2014   of all the many, many catastrophic legacies, it\u2019s the Iran deal. \u201d  He judged that the empowerment of Iran was a worse Obama legacy than the rise of the Islamic State because \u201cwe can wipe ISIS off the face of the earth, if we\u2019re serious, and if we really go to war. \u201d \u201cI mean, think about it: they\u2019ve got maybe, at best, at this point, 40, 000 fighters. We have twice that number of special operators alone in the United States,\u201d he noted. \u201cIf we\u2019re serious, we can destroy them, and then follow that up with a   campaign. But dealing with an eschatologically informed theocratic republic that now has a crescent of influence from Yemen to Persia, which is on the cusp of nuclear capability, that\u2019s even more dangerous. \u201d Gorka suggested a dissertation could be written on how the realignment of power in the Middle East became a \u201csecret war,\u201d largely unreported by U. S. media, because President Obama wanted to change American posture towards Iran and other regional powers. \u201cObama has a legacy for using more drones to kill people in the first six months of his administration than Bush ever did,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the fact that on one day, he has bombed six different nations  \u2014   but nobody\u2019s reporting about it. During the Bush administration, we had embedded journalists. You remember embed phenomena? That doesn\u2019t exist any more. This is the complicity of the mainstream media, that they preach peace, they preach Nobel Prizes, but this is a truly   administration when it comes to doing what they think is right around the world for ideological reasons. But nobody writes about it, except Breitbart. \u201d Gorka agreed with author Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s contention that Obama was \u201cthe first   President. \u201d \u201cHis guiding philosophy was very simple: America is bad. If there are problems in the world, from global warming to    we are the cause. America is the new imperial force. As a result, we have to be taken down a peg or two  \u2014   and my, did he take us down a peg or two,\u201d he said. Gorka had no patience for Obama\u2019s claim of a \u201c \u201d presidency. \u201cWhere to begin? Benghazi, the IRS, the Iran deal, the involvement of drone strikes against U. S. citizens without due process  \u2014   on and on and on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is perhaps the most   lie of any of the press reporting in the last eight years, that this was a   administration. \u201d Kassam asked for Gorka\u2019s take on how the Trump transition team is handling the Russian hacking story, in particular the assertion in the intelligence community\u2019s public report that Russian President Vladimir Putin directly ordered an effort to influence the 2016 election via media manipulation. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to the transition, but if you listen to the statements that are being made, I think you\u2019ll understand that the transition team understands better than most: this isn\u2019t about \u2018hacking.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to hack somebody whose password is \u2018password,\u2019\u201d Gorka replied, making a jab at the notoriously lax security procedures of Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta. \u201cThis is about influence operations and information warfare,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe issue is that Russia, for very little investment, managed to question the probity of our elections, without there really being anything that\u2019s occurred to the elections themselves. That\u2019s the big story. This is old, Cold   information operations at their worst. \u201d He said links to Russia could be seen in the penetration of the Democratic National Committee and Podesta\u2019s email.  \u201cIf you look at the code that was used, if you look at the various modus operandi, the report from DHS, FBI, the unclassified one is clear. But the important point is, it\u2019s not a \u2018hack.\u2019 The election wasn\u2019t undermined. It is the perception of the probity of the election, and that\u2019s called active measures. That\u2019s called dezinformatsiya,\u201d Gorka said. Kassam noted the IC report has been criticized for offering   conclusions about Russian involvement without providing any supporting information, much of which would still be classified  \u2014   the very same criticism that was leveled retroactively, for years, with   passion, against the intelligence reports on   Iraq. \u201cWhy are we just sort of accepting this now?\u201d he asked. \u201cLook, the thing that has to be remembered  \u2014   and this is the point I always try to make on any interviews  \u2014   is that we have patriots and good people working inside the national security establishment,\u201d Gorka responded. \u201cFor the majority of cases, that is absolutely true. But who runs them? Who is John Brennan? Who is General Clapper? These individuals are politically chosen. John Brennan has carried the water for Obama for eight years. That is important, and as a result, we have to reassess when one agency says something that the other agencies do not agree with. That\u2019s the bottom line, Raheem. \u201d Kassam recalled that the last time unanimity was supposedly reached between the intelligence agencies, \u201cit was Colin Powell sitting there claiming that everybody believed we had to go to war in Iraq. How\u2019d that work out for us?\u201d \u201cYes indeed  \u2014   another political actor who I\u2019m sure regrets waving a test tube at the United Nations Security Council. Indeed, the \u2018 \u2019 dossier, Colin Powell\u2019s behavior  \u2014   these are all things we must remember,\u201d Gorka urged.
