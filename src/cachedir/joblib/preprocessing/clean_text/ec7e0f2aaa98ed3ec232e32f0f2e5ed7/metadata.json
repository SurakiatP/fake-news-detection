She was 60. A family spokesman, Simon Halls, said Ms. Fisher died at 8:55 a. m. She had a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday and had been hospitalized in Los Angeles. After her \u201cStar Wars\u201d success, Ms. Fisher, the daughter of the pop singer Eddie Fisher and the actress Debbie Reynolds, went on to use her perch among Hollywood royalty to offer wry commentary in her books on the paradoxes and absurdities of the entertainment industry. \u201cStar Wars,\u201d released in 1977, turned her overnight into an international movie star. The film, written and directed by George Lucas, traveled around the world, breaking   records. It proved to be the first installment of a blockbuster series whose vivid, even preposterous characters  \u2014   living \u201ca long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,\u201d as the opening sequence announced  \u2014   became pop culture legends and the progenitors of a merchandising bonanza. [ What Carrie Fisher\u2019s career meant ] Ms. Fisher established Princess Leia as a damsel who could very much deal with her own distress, whether facing down the villainy of the dreaded Darth Vader or the romantic interests of the roguish smuggler Han Solo. Wielding blaster pistols, piloting futuristic vehicles and, to her occasional chagrin, wearing strange hairdos and a revealing metal bikini, she reprised the role in three more films  \u2014   \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d in 1980, \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d in 1983 and, 32 years later, \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d by which time Leia had become a   general. Lucasfilm said on Tuesday that Ms. Fisher had completed her work in an    eighth episode of the main \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga, which is scheduled to be released in December 2017. Winning the admiration of countless fans, Ms. Fisher never played Leia as helpless. She had the toughness to escape the clutches of the monstrous gangster Jabba the Hutt and the tenderness to tell Han Solo, as he is about to be frozen in carbonite, \u201cI love you. \u201d (Solo, played by Harrison Ford, caddishly replies, \u201cI know. \u201d) Offscreen, Ms. Fisher was open about her diagnosis of bipolar disorder. She gave her dueling dispositions the nicknames Roy (\u201cthe wild ride of a mood,\u201d she said) and Pam (\u201cwho stands on the shore and sobs\u201d). She channeled her struggles with depression and substance abuse into fiercely comic works, including the semiautobiographical novel \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d and the   show \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d which she turned into a memoir. For all the attention she received for playing Princess Leia, Ms. Fisher enjoyed poking wicked fun at the character, as well as at the fantastical \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe. \u201cWho wears that much lip gloss into battle?\u201d she asked in a recent memoir, \u201cThe Princess Diarist. \u201d Having seen fame\u2019s light and dark sides, Ms. Fisher did not take it too seriously, or consider it an enduring commodity. As she wrote in \u201cThe Princess Diarist\u201d: \u201cPerpetual celebrity  \u2014   the kind where any mention of you will interest a significant percentage of the public until the day you die, even if that day comes decades after your last real contribution to the culture  \u2014   is exceedingly rare, reserved for the likes of Muhammad Ali. \u201d Carrie Frances Fisher was born on Oct. 21, 1956, in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was the first child of her highly visible parents (they later had a son, Todd) and said in \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d that, while her mother was under anesthetic delivering her, her father fainted. \u201cSo when I arrived,\u201d Ms. Fisher wrote, \u201cI was virtually unattended! And I have been trying to make up for that fact ever since. \u201d In 1959, Ms. Reynolds divorced Eddie Fisher in the wake of his affair with Elizabeth Taylor, whom he married that same year. (Ms. Taylor later left him to marry Richard Burton.) Any semblance of a normal childhood was impossible for Ms. Fisher. At 15, she played a debutante in the Broadway musical \u201cIrene,\u201d which starred her mother, and appeared in Ms. Reynolds\u2019s Las Vegas nightclub act. At 17, Ms. Fisher made her first movie,  \u201cShampoo\u201d (1975) Hal Ashby\u2019s satire of   politics and the libidinous Los Angeles culture of the time, in which she played the precocious daughter of a wealthy woman (Lee Grant) having an affair with a promiscuous hairdresser (Warren Beatty). She was one of roughly two dozen young actresses considered for the role of Princess Leia in Mr. Lucas\u2019s marathon casting sessions for \u201cStar Wars. \u201d (Cindy Williams, Amy Irving, Sissy Spacek and Jodie Foster were among those who also read for the part.) Many of Ms. Fisher\u2019s line readings from that film have since become part of the cinematic canon: her repeated, almost hypnotic exhortation, \u201cHelp me,   Kenobi, you\u2019re my only hope\u201d her wryly unimpressed reaction when Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) arrives in disguise to rescue her from a detention cell: \u201cAren\u2019t you a little short for a stormtrooper?\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d became a financial and cultural phenomenon, launching more movies and a merchandising machine that splashed Ms. Fisher\u2019s likeness on all manner of action figures and products while casting her into an uneasy limelight. She partied with the Rolling Stones during the making of \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u201d hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and had romantic relationships with Dan Aykroyd (with whom she appeared in \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d) and Paul Simon. She and Mr. Simon had a marriage that lasted less than a year, and he was inspired to write his song \u201cHearts and Bones\u201d about their time together. As its lyrics go: In \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d she admitted what many fans had long suspected: During the filming of the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, she and Harrison Ford (who was married at the time) had an affair. Ms. Fisher acknowledged taking drugs like LSD and Percodan throughout the 1970s and \u201980s and later said that she was using cocaine while making \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back. \u201d In 1985, after filming a role in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d she had a nearly fatal drug overdose. She had her stomach pumped and checked herself into a   rehab program in Los Angeles. Those experiences later became grist for her caustic, comic novel \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d whose chapters are variously presented as letters, diary entries, monologues and   narratives. As the main character, Suzanne, writes of her rehab stay: \u201cMom brought me some peanut butter cookies and a biography of Judy Garland. She told me she thought my problem was that I was too impatient, my fuse was too short, that I was only interested in instant gratification. I said, \u2018Instant gratification takes too long. \u2019\u201d The book was later made into a movie, directed by Mike Nichols from a script by Ms. Fisher. Released in 1990, it starred Meryl Streep as Suzanne and Shirley MacLaine as her   mother. On film, Ms. Fisher also played the   best friend of Meg Ryan\u2019s title character in the 1989 romantic comedy \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally  \u2026    \u201d On television, she played satirical versions of herself on shows like \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory. \u201d She had a recurring role on the British comedy \u201cCatastrophe\u201d (seen here on Amazon) as the mother of the character played by Rob Delaney, one of the show\u2019s creators. Her survivors include her mother her brother, Todd her daughter, Billie Lourd, from a relationship with the talent agent Bryan Lourd and her half sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher, the daughters of Eddie Fisher and Connie Stevens. Ms. Fisher had a Dorothy   presence on Twitter, where she ruminated on the inexplicable mania surrounding \u201cStar Wars\u201d and on her French bulldog, Gary, in playful messages filled with emoji. Last year, after the release of \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d she wrote, in part: \u201cPlease stop debating about whether OR not [eye emoji] aged well. unfortunately it hurts all 3 of my feelings. My BODY hasn\u2019t aged as well as I have. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563783.431803}
