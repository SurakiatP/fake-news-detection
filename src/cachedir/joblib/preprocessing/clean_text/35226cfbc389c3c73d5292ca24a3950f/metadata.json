We\u00e2\\x80\\x99re having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting,\u201d Miller said. \\n\u201cAnd it\u00e2\\x80\\x99s not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support (Democrat nominee) Hillary (Clinton). It\u00e2\\x80\\x99s not (President) Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary. It\u00e2\\x80\\x99s a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote,\u201d he continued. \u201cMany who have not voted in eight or 10\u00c2 elections so they\u00e2\\x80\\x99re not reported in the polls.\u201d \\nMiller then said he had proof that the polls are being rigged. His proof comes amid Trump\u2019s claims that the election was being rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton.   \\n\u201cI know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample Democrats by 8,\u00c2 sometimes up to 16\u00c2 percent, oversampling Democrats. They\u00e2\\x80\\x99re oversampling women by 5 to 8 percent,\u201d Miller explained. \\n\u201cSo the Republican vote is underreported. Plus there is no way to sample this extra 20\u00c2 to 25percent of new voters that are Trump voters. They\u00e2\\x80\\x99re not Republican, they\u00e2\\x80\\x99re not Democrats, they\u00e2\\x80\\x99re pragmatists. They\u00e2\\x80\\x99re tired of the status quo and they want change.\u201d \\nWatch the entire interview below: YUGE RECORD BREAKING VOTES in TEXAS!!! & Its Not Bernie Fans or Obama Voters for Hillary Clinton!!
