Notably, he demonstrated against the Vietnam War and was even arrested for his anti-war efforts. Hayden died on Sunday at the age of 76, but even in the last few years he continued to remind America of the importance of activism. \\nIn a speech given last year at \u201cVietnam: The Power of Protest,\u201d a conference in Washington, D.C., Hayden cited his activist history and urged Americans not to forget the powerful political movements of earlier decades. \u201c[T]he struggle for memory and for history is a living thing,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cEach generation has to wrestle with the history of what came before, and ask: Whose interest does this history serve? How does it advance a legacy of social movements? How does it deny that legacy?\u201d \\nHayden then began to explain the importance of remembering the widespread political activism of the \u201960s and \u201970s. \u201cWe gather here to remember the power that we had at one point, the power of the peace movement, and to challenge the Pentagon now on the battlefield of memory,\u201d he said. He continued: \\nThere came a generation of career politicians who were afraid of association with the peace movement, who were afraid of being seen as soft, who saw that the inside track was the track of war. Our national forgetting is basically pathological. Our systems\u2014politics, media, culture\u2014are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right. In the absence\u2014in the absence of an established voice for peace in all the institutions, the neoconservatives will fill the foreign policy vacuum. Am I right? Will it not? Will it not advise both parties? I think, though, that American public opinion has shifted to a much more skeptical state of mind than earlier generations, but the spectrum of American politics and media has not. \\nIn order to fully unify, Hayden concluded, America must remember its past. Although he noted the many successes of the anti-war and pro-civil rights movements, he argues that activists must accept that they \u201call walked away\u201d when the Vietnam War ended. \u201cWe might have been united,\u201d Hayden said, \u201cbut instead, we were relegated to wondering what might have been.\u201d \\nAdvertisement \\nWatch Hayden\u2019s full speech in the video below: \\n</p><p>'"}, "time": 1742561995.4263573}
