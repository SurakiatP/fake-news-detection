Reminder: This is Trump\u2019s America.  \u2014   Eyounguns (@AunteeYo) March 27, 2017,  In the photo, Paulson appears to be laughing while Gooding Jr. looks like he\u2019s lifting up her dress. The event took place on Sunday at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. Also in attendance at the panel were Kathy Bates, Denis O\u2019Hare, Cheyenne Jackson, Adina Porter and more, who spoke about the upcoming season of the show. During the panel, Paulson was asked which of her AHS characters she\u2019d like to see come back. \u201cProbably [Coven\u2018s] Cordelia. We only got to see her just getting her powers. I just would like to know  \u2026     if the power might have been something that kind of changed her,\u201d she said. American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy was not present for the panel. The FX show\u2019s stars, which included Denis O\u2019Hare, Cheyenne Jackson, and Adina Porter, discussed past seasons but didn\u2019t offer clues or tidbits for the forthcoming season 7 premiere. The upcoming season is expected to revolve around the 2016 presidential election. Paulson told the Hollywood Reporter on Saturday that she would like to play Donald Trump on the upcoming season of the show, though Murphy has previously said neither Trump nor Clinton would appear as characters. \u201cWhy not? That\u2019s an acting challenge to be sure,\u201d she said.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742628527.2342274}
