Here\u2019s how to navigate the   process. Delay freshman year, not your application. Students interested in a year off should still apply to college their senior year of high school, advises Michele Hern\u00e1ndez,   of Top Tier Admissions and a former admissions officer at Dartmouth. It ensures that you\u2019ll have access to your school\u2019s resources and won\u2019t be bogged down with applications and standardized testing during a year that may include travel abroad. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how quickly your high school forgets you,\u201d Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to go back and ask for teacher recommendations and the other materials you might need after a year has passed. \u201d It\u2019s also a good idea to keep options open should plans suddenly change. You might not get that internship or job you were counting on, or you might get into a college with even better options for a bridge year, like the   international program at Princeton or Tufts\u2019 \u201c1+4\u201d program, offering both national and international service opportunities. Harvard has long encouraged applicants to consider a year off, but that won\u2019t increase your chances of getting in. While more and more institutions are seeing value in a gap year, it\u2019s better to inform them of your intentions after you\u2019ve been accepted. \u201cIt might work against you because admissions\u2019 priority is filling that year,\u201d Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what the next year is going to look like. \u201d If your plans have merit  \u2014   education, work or service components  \u2014   they are likely to agree. But, she said, \u201cdepending on what you\u2019re going to do, a gap year can be viewed as slightly frivolous. So that\u2019s why I say, get in first and then propose an idea. \u201d If a college has no gap year program, write to the admissions director before deposits are due. Describe plans for the year ahead, and ask whether time off will affect any scholarships the school has offered for freshman year. USA Gap Year Fairs organizes events where students can hear about an array of programs and speak with professionals in the field: 39 were held this winter a list of locations for 2018 will be published in the fall (usagapyearfairs. org). The American Gap Association accredits independent programs that offer   or   learning experiences. It maintains lists of the programs, which run a few weeks to a year, and their scholarships, as well as university policies on deferring enrollment (www. americangap. org). The association tracked $2. 8 million in   support for gap year programs in 2015. Some universities even provide funding for   experiences. Florida State University offers $5, 000 gap year fellowships, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers fellowships of $7, 500, with a focus on students from rural school districts in the state. Chapel Hill is impressed with the results. \u201cStudents in the gap year fellowship don\u2019t struggle like other freshmen do with the transition into college,\u201d said Richard Harrill, who helped design the program. Instead, he said, participants \u201cbecome even more intellectually hungry. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562142.415496}
