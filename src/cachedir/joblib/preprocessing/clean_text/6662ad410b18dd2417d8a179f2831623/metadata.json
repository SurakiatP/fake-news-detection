[Kelly toured the U. S.  southern border with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey ( ). afterwards meeting withAfter the tour, he conducted a roundtable of Arizona\u2019s border county sheriffs where they collectively agreed that more security at the nation\u2019s border was necessary.  Kelly\u2019s meeting included Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier. Napier praised Kelly, telling AZ Central, \u201cI think the bottom line is we finally have a receptive ear of someone who is taking notes, very engaged, very willing to listen to us. \u201d \u201cWe talked about the value of technology in some areas and physical structures in others, but there\u2019s a lot to be vetted out in that,\u201d Napier said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of distance between an executive action and some political rhetoric and actual policy implementation at the local level. \u201d Dannels echoed Napier\u2019s call for not only a border wall, but more local security and cooperation. \u201cThe fencing along is not the   to this border problem,\u201d Dannels said. \u201cWe need to help get [local law enforcement] at the table, and number two is fund the programs that we\u2019re taking on as a result of the federal government not doing it. \u201d Dannels said one of the issues Kelly and the Arizona sheriffs all agreed on was the reinstatement of what\u2019s known as the \u201cStonegarden\u201d program, where federal grant money is given to local authorities to help them be equipped with handling border security issues. Stonegarden, according to Dannels, is a \u201cforce multiplier when it comes to community and highway interdiction to those that smuggle drugs and smuggle humans. \u201d Wilmot, on the other hand, asked Kelly to have President Donald Trump\u2019s administration bring back Operation Streamline, which allowed for immigration judges to criminally charge illegal immigrants in large groups, rather than by an individual basis. Estrada, the lone Democrat in the meeting, was the only law enforcement official during the meeting to question the validity of a border wall, versus other solutions. \u201cI think that\u2019s still an open question, being that we\u2019re unique all along the border from San Diego to Brownsville,\u201d Estrada told AZ Central. \u201cIt requires different approaches. In some places, you may not even need a wall. \u201d Trump has long made immigration one of his top priorities, and has often called for programs which were previously cancelled by the Obama administration to be reinstated to modernize the nation\u2019s border crisis.
