Dyer writes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are generous people \u2014 that is, generous toward themselves. \\nThe Clintons are probably the world\u2019s most famous grifters and the Clinton Farce Foundation has proven to be a great cover for them. \\nBill and Hillary gave $1,042,000 to charity according to their tax return and $1 million of that went to, you guessed it, the Clinton Foundation. Of the $1,042,000 the Clintons gave to charity as listed on their return, $1 million went to the Clinton Foundation https://t.co/IuNXUGZBdC \\n\u2014 Michael Tracey (@mtracey) August 12, 2016 @CounterMoonbat Which in turn is used to pay Chelsea her $900K salary. & leftists everywhere say \"aren\\'t they wonderful\". We\\'re so screwed. \\n\u2014 Da Hack (@NoMoreSheepdog) August 12, 2016 \\nIt\u2019s a pretty slick move: donate to your own charity and write it off on your taxes. One twitter user aptly called the Clinton Foundation \u201ctheir own slush fund.\u201d \\nAs far as the money laundering comment goes, well, dirty money does need to get clean, you know, and Clinton Foundation money is dirty in more ways than one. \\nFirst, it\u2019s a great way to make enough money to pay for Hillary\u2019s ugly designer clothes and Bill\u2019s girlfriends \u2014 not to mention that Chelsea needs a job; $600,000 at NBC only goes so far, you know. \\nSecond, the Clinton Foundation takes enormous amounts of money from countries with disgusting human rights abuses and all the Clintons have to do is a photo-op here and there to make it look like it\u2019s all about charity and whatnot. \\nThis fits perfectly with the Democrat Party, though \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what is, just what it looks like, and fortunately for them Democrat voters aren\u2019t the most discerning bunch. \\nApparently Clinton made $10.6 million in 2015\u2026but hey, she\u2019s just like us! \\nShe\u2019s your neighbor down the street who can\u2019t climb the stairs, screams at everyone and gets away with massive fraud and has yet to be held accountable for the death of four Americans on her watch \u2014 not to mention the others that drop like flies around her. \\nThen there\u2019s creepy, pervy, pathological liar uncle Bill, and their ne\u2019er-do-well daughter Chelsea with questionable paternity \u2014 although that\u2019s probably a lot more common \u2026 \\nEveryone\u2019s got neighbors like that right?
