Penguin Books. $17. Some people shuffle paper for their jobs. Sommeliers lick rocks. Well, not all sommeliers. But a number of them do, if they\u2019re desperate enough to want to know the difference between the taste of blue slate and that of red. Some forgo brushing their teeth in the morning, or drinking hot beverages, or using perfume, scented laundry detergent, extra salt. Their palates  \u2014   and their noses  \u2014   are their instruments. Who would risk blistering or blunting them? Would a violinist leave her Stradivarius in a locked trunk on a sweltering day? She would not. Bianca Bosker\u2019s \u201cCork Dork: A   Adventure Among the Obsessive Sommeliers, Big Bottle Hunters, and Rogue Scientists Who Taught Me to Live for Taste\u201d is a compendium of bewitching and sometimes disgusting facts. (There\u2019s an art to spitting, apparently.) Do ignore the subtitle, which is filled with about as many additives as your average plonk, and every bit as cloying. It\u2019s deceptive. Bosker\u2019s journey into this sodden universe is thrilling, and she tells her story with gonzo \u00e9lan. I\u2019m not one to let blurbers, often   into service by authors or publishers, do my work. But when the sommelier and blogger Madeline Puckette writes that this book is the \u201cKitchen Confidential\u201d of the wine world, she\u2019s not wrong, though Bill Buford\u2019s \u201cHeat\u201d is probably a shade closer to this book\u2019s sensibility and heart. \u201cCork Dork\u201d is likely to find a large audience. The real miracle is that Bosker was sober enough to write it. \u201cMost days,\u201d she explains, \u201cI was drunk by noon, hung over by 2 p. m. and, around 4 in the afternoon, deeply regretting the burger I\u2019d devoured for lunch. \u201d Bosker was the technology editor of The Huffington Post when she heard about the World\u2019s Best Sommelier Competition. She   videos. She marveled. She decided to change her life. For 18 months, she shadowed renowned wine fanatics, hoping to understand their obsession and to become a certified sommelier herself. The goal was more foolhardy than she knew. Sommeliers, at least in her hometown (New York) are a diehard lot. They\u2019re best described as punctilious sybarites  \u2014   \u201cthe most masochistic hedonists I\u2019d ever met,\u201d as Bosker writes. They spend evenings on their feet. During the day, they practice the arcane rituals of wine service, ingest a magnum of wine esoterica and, if they\u2019re aspiring to become master sommeliers, sample more than 20, 000 kinds of wine so that they can make such blind declarations as: \u201cThis is a   blend from the right bank of Bordeaux from the village of   in the 2010 vintage of Grand Cru Class\u00e9 quality. \u201d That\u2019s a direct quote, by the way. It comes from Bosker\u2019s friend  \u2014   and Sherpa  \u2014   Morgan Harris, a precocious, brassily opinionated sommelier at New York\u2019s Aureole. He and other expert tasters are expected to become the Alan Turings of wine, deciphering flavors as if the Battle of the Atlantic depended on it. Bosker had exactly no experience in this field. But because she\u2019s possessed of a jolly hubris, she manages to wheedle and bluff her way into a series of jobs for which she isn\u2019t remotely qualified, and then to muscle her way into the most elite   group in Manhattan  \u2014   which would be like me deciding I wanted to brush up on my baseball skills by joining the Yankees for spring training. She gets a quick, boozy education, and so do we. About how to decant properly, which is as difficult as sinking a hole in one. About how to serve, which involves more rules than cricket. (Whatever you do, do not show customers the back of your hand.) She gives great gossip. While trailing a \u201csomm\u201d at Marea, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, Bosker learns that management keeps SparkNotes on its 1 percenter clientele. They\u2019re a confetti of acronyms, the most devastating of which is HWC, or \u201cHandle With Care. \u201d (At other restaurants, it\u2019s SOE, or \u201cSense of Entitlement. \u201d Ow.) Readers also get a feel for restaurant economics from \u201cCork Dork,\u201d and this much is clear: Sommeliers are secret weapons, capable of adding extra zeros to the bottom line. They\u2019ve mastered the fine art of the upsell, sometimes based on the semiotics of customer clothing and accessories alone. Is Dad wearing a $50, 000 Patek Philippe watch? Do not give him a bottle of Pinot Grigio if the most expensive one on your list is only $80. \u201cYOU ARE NOT ALLOWED,\u201d Harris booms. (Steer him toward a $270 bottle of Chablis grand cru instead.) I\u2019d say that Harris deserves his own reality show, but in a sense, he already has one, as do some of the other somms that Bosker follows. They\u2019re on the Esquire Network\u2019s \u201cUncorked. \u201d It felt a bit dishonest of the author not to reveal it. And while I appreciated her bravado, I grew similarly queasy, as time wore on, with how she would congratulate herself for   her way into an event she had no business attending. Did she promise the organizers publicity in her book? A magazine article? Too often, she doesn\u2019t say. On occasion, Bosker radiates youthful   maybe a touch of na\u00efvet\u00e9. But she is, in the main, great company as a narrator  \u2014   witty, generous, democratic. She devotes many pages to singing the praises of taste and smell, which philosophers throughout the ages have considered the baser senses, and shows how just about any of us can sharpen them. She\u2019s suspicious, as any good journalist should be, of cant  \u2014   she\u2019s a decanter!  \u2014   and interrogates at length whether the florid language of the sommelier (\u201cnotes of vanilla, cassis and saddle leather\u201d) is useful or even authentic. She shows up at one of her fancy tasting groups with a plastic cup of chervil and asks everyone to give it a sniff. They can\u2019t identify it  \u2014   even though they regularly claim to detect hints of the herb in what they drink. Eventually, she interrogates the entire notion of wine expertise, which in turn raises the biggest question of all: What does make a wine great? Especially if, as one damning study found, most judges in a California wine competition gave contradictory ratings to the same bottle of wine every time they tasted it? And if a wine economist explains that there\u2019s little correlation between quality and cost once a bottle exceeds $50 or $60? (\u201cAfter that,\u201d Bosker writes, \u201cbrand, reputation and scarcity start to nudge up a bottle\u2019s cost. \u201d) Bosker ultimately arrives at her own kind of homespun answer to what makes a wine special. It accommodates tastes high and low, and she\u2019s still certainly capable of enjoying three different vintages of the fabled Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem. \u201cIt tasted like the sun,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt tasted like an experience that would never repeat itself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562779.478946}
