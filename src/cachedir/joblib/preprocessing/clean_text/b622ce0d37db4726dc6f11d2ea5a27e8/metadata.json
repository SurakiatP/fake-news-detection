Polls ahead of this month\u2019s election suggest that Ms. Le Pen, who is running on a candidacy of opposing mass immigration and the European Union and, will win the first round of voting, yet faces an uphill battle to win against globalist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the second round. Some of her policies include a referendum on France\u2019s membership of the European Union, taking tough stances on radical Islamism, as well as implementing a   \u201cFrance First\u201d form of economic nationalism. However, polls in recent days suggest the race is tightening, with   candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and the   left wing candidate   Melechon seeing increased support.
