[Abu Sayyaf, which has been active for years in the southern Philippines but more recently pledged allegiance to Islamic State caliph Abu Bakr   has become active in southern Bohol Island, a new territory for them. Duterte\u2019s administration has responded with a reinforced military presence in the region, while Duterte himself has threatened to cannibalize the jihadists.  \u201cI can eat you,\u201d Duterte said this week. \u201cJust give me salt and vinegar. True. Make me mad. Get me a terrorist. Give me salt and vinegar. I will eat his liver. \u201d In September, Duterte made a similar promise to \u201ceat\u201d Abu Sayyaf terrorists, following a series of attacks on soldiers. Duterte also assured civilians living in affected regions that he would endeavor to protect their right to  . Speaking last week following an attack on soldiers in Bohol, Duterte said, \u201cto the police  \u2026     and even civilians interested to fight and kill, the order is dead or alive. \u201d \u201cI intend to also arm the civilians and I will include the civilians  \u2026     you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cJust go to the police and make a report and state your truth  \u2026     no problem. I\u2019ll take care of you, I\u2019ll pardon you, whatever. \u201d Duterte has taken a similar stand with drug criminals, assuring civilians of impunity if they kill drug offenders. In addition to the increasingly common clashes between Abu Sayyaf terrorists and police, law enforcement arrested a Philippine policewoman this week for ties to the group. Philippine National Police (PNP) Superintendent Maria Cristina Nobleza is under arrest after police found evidence that she had been engaged in an affair with an Abu Sayyaf bombmaker, potentially handing over sensitive information. The investigation into whether she was a source for the terrorist group is ongoing. Authorities also found the head of Sergeant Anni Siraji, a Philippine soldier abducted on April 20 by the terrorist group. Abu Sayyaf terrorists reportedly beheaded him this weekend after the soldier was assigned to work as an intermediary between the terrorists and police. \u201cHe is involved in peace efforts,\u201d Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana told reporters. \u201cHe is not actually a combatant. We are using him to engage stakeholders because he is a Tausug [like most Abu Sayyaf],\u201d he added, referring to the man\u2019s ethnicity. Dutertespokesman Ernesto Abella called the beheading a \u201cbarbaric act\u201d over the weekend and vowed more military action. \u201cThe President is firm and decisive in the fight against terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has ordered government troops to carry out sustained, focused and intense operations to put an end to lawless and gruesome acts of violence. \u201d The Philippine Star quotes another PNP official as stating, \u201c[Our] teams will do nothing except to \u2018eat Abu Sayyaf in breakfast, lunch and dinner. \u2019\u201d Duterte, who had repeatedly demanded the United States stay out of Philippine matters during the Obama administration, recently changed his disposition, requesting that American soldiers help his country fight the jihadist insurgency in the south. \u201cAs we fought together to stay above the enemy then, so we should help each other to address the threats that confront our societies, our region, and our world,\u201d Duterte said in April, reaching out to President Donald Trump, according to regional outlet   News.'"}, "time": 1742628573.6887214}
