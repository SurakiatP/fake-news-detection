They\u2019re trying to do everything that they can to tear him down even more than Hillary is already. Obama even went as far as to say that the KKK will return! \\nPresident Barack Obama wants people in North Carolina to vote for Hillary Clinton, so he\u2019s warning them that Donald Trump would tolerate the support of the Klu Klux Klan if he\u2019s elected president. \u201cIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers \u2014 the Klan \u2014 and hesitate when asked about that support, then you\u2019ll tolerate that support when you\u2019re in office,\u201d he said. \\nObama added that Trump would \u201cdisrespect\u201d the Constitution as president, citing the Republican nominee\u2019s vow to put Hillary Clinton in jail. \\n\u201c[Y]ou threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process \u2026 then imagine what you\u2019ll do when you actually have the power to violate the Constitution along those lines,\u201d Obama warned. \\nObama made his remarks at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Wednesday, saying that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders. \\n\u201cI hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders,\u201d he said as the audience laughed. \u201cThe fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.\u201d \\nObama dismissed all of the negative ads and bad news that hurt Hillary Clinton as \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cdistractions,\u201d that they should put aside. \\n\u201cEvery day is just hysteria and over-the-top coverage,\u201d he said, admitting that even he was getting tired of politics. \u201cI understand the feeling, I promise you.\u201d \\nHe argued that the choice for president was simple, because Trump was a con artist who was unfit and not ready to be president. \\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s strange how, over time, what is crazy gets normalized,\u201d Obama said, referring to the multiple controversial statements made by Trump during the campaign. \\n\u201cThat is not the voice of America. That\u2019s not the better angels of our nature,\u201d he said. \\nIf you thought things couldn\u2019t get any more ridiculous, you\u2019re wrong. This accusation is taking things to a whole new level just days before voting. It\u2019s nothing but a desperate, pathetic plea for help. Related Items'"}, "time": 1742562130.5107374}
