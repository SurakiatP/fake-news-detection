He also reminisced on the days when just three establishment media outlets dominated the narrative, and were \u201cgenerally\u201d trusted by Americans. \\nToday, polls show Americans have overwhelmingly rejected the establishment media's deception, lies, and propaganda. That is why Obama and the establishment he serves are calling for a \u201ccurating function\u201d to help control information and the narrative. \\nBut the truth will remain the truth. And because the alternative media has done a better job of seeking and promoting the truth, in recent years it has seen an enormous increase in ratings and influence. This will continue as long as the truth is being reported \u2013 something the mischaracterized \u201cmainstream\u201d media has not done in quite some time.
