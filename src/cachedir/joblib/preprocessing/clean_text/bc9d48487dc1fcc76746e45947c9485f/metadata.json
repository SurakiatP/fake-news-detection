He\u2019s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he\u2019s not going to support the two-state solution,\u201d he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. \\nTrump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. \\nOthers at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that he becomes president,\u201d said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton becomes president, we\u2019re dead.\u201d \\nThe rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state. \\nEven if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate. \\nIn an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trump\u2019s adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israel\u2019s greatest hope. \\n\u201cUnder Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people,\u201d he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d. \\nWhile the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. \\nThe critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trump\u2019s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. \\nOn Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughter\u2019s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. \\n\u201cMy administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel\u2019s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cTogether we will make America and Israel safe again.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564059.4260545}
