the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their \u201cbank of banks\u201d; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest \u201cmegabank\u201d; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. \\nWith Hillary Clinton\u2019s US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates\u2014including both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. \\nOn Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton\u2019s Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City\u2014and who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon\u2019s, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company\u2019s stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line\u2014and that caused JP Morgan\u2019s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. \\nWithin 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. \\nTo why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the \u201cmassive bribery scheme\u201d that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup\u2014and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present\u2014bringing Hillary Clinton\u2019s total \u201ccash grab\u201d from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million\u2014all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton\u2019s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS. \\nTo what Jamie Dimon said to Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this \u201cmegabanks\u201d master plan to save itself had \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d that could \u201cpose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States\u201d. \\nTwo months after the FDIC\u2019s warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically \u201csounded a warning\u201d that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that \u201csomeone is going to get hurt\u201d. \\nUnbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse\u2014and that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that \u201cthis market is scary\u201d, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a \u201cRed Alert\u201d warning all of its clients warning them to \u201cprepare for a severe market crash\u201d. \\nWith one of the first casualties of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is \u201cnearing its doom\u201d and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe\u2014who unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers. \\nAs Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the \u201cClinton Crime Story of the Century\u201d, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.\""}, "time": 1742561705.3360045}
