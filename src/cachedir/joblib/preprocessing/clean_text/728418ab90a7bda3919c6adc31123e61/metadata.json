Trump\u2019s ardent supporters, four Republican members of Congress who had made headlines for demanding that Mr. Trump leave the presidential race retreated quietly this week, conceding that they would still probably vote for the man they had excoriated just days before. From Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the only member of the Republican leadership in either chamber who had disavowed Mr. Trump, to Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, who is in a difficult   fight, the lawmakers contorted themselves over Mr. Trump. Some of them would not mention him by name, preferring instead to affirm their support for the generic \u201cRepublican ticket,\u201d still grasping for a middle ground. They said that if Mr. Trump would not make way for his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, to lead the party after the release of a recording on Friday showing Mr. Trump bragging about groping women, they had little choice but to vote for their embattled nominee. But the collective   owed less to his refusal to exit a race in which ballots are already being cast than to the fury his supporters unleashed at the defectors at rallies and on social media. And Mr. Trump himself escalated his bitter feud with the country\u2019s   elected Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, saying at a rally in Florida on Wednesday that Mr. Ryan\u2019s refusal to actively support his candidacy was part of a \u201csinister deal going on. \u201d The quick reversals back to Mr. Trump\u2019s camp vividly illustrated  Republicans\u2019 predicament  as they grapple with a nominee whom some of their core supporters adore, a Democratic candidate their base loathes  \u2014   and a host of voters who believe that Mr. Trump is   unsuited for high office. In Alabama, Representative Bradley Byrne, who said flatly over the weekend, \u201cIt is now clear Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States,\u201d insisted to reporters on Wednesday that he had always said he would \u201cbe a supporter of the Republican ticket from top to bottom. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cI don\u2019t vote Democrat. \u201d Mr. Thune, who also said on Saturday that Mr. Pence should be the party\u2019s nominee, \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d acknowledged that the recording of Mr. Trump boasting of grabbing women\u2019s genitals was \u201cmore offensive than anything that I had seen\u201d from the   Republican  . But he said in an interview Tuesday with KELO television in Sioux Falls, S. D. that he would still cast his ballot for Mr. Trump. \u201cI intend to support the nominee of our party, and if anything should change, then I\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Thune said. \u201cBut he\u2019s got a lot of work to do, I think, if he\u2019s going to have any hope of winning this election. \u201d Of the Republicans who reversed themselves, only Mr. Garrett is in a competitive race. Mr. Byrne and Mr. Thune are expected to easily defeat their Democratic opponents, and Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska is not up for   until 2018. On Saturday, Ms. Fischer called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cdisgusting and totally unacceptable under any circumstance\u201d and said, \u201cIt would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party\u2019s nominee. \u201d But she was almost philosophical in telling a Nebraska radio station on Tuesday why she was still backing Mr. Trump. \u201cHe decided he would not step aside. I respect his decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI support the Republican ticket, and it\u2019s a   ticket. \u201d In New Jersey, Mr. Garrett also initially called for Mr. Pence to lead the party. But by Tuesday, Mr. Garrett, a   lawmaker who was already facing perhaps the stiffest challenge of his career, said he would \u201cvote Trump for president if he is the party\u2019s official nominee come Election Day. \u201d The legislators\u2019 tortuous efforts to climb down from their earlier clarion calls did not seem to placate Mr. Trump\u2019s admirers much. \u201cIf you are not FOR Mr. Trump, then you must be AGAINST Mr. Trump,\u201d Lonnie Lee Mixon II, an Alabamian, wrote on Mr. Byrne\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cPlease stop dancing around this. \u201d A handful of the Republican Party\u2019s recruits also find themselves in a vise. In Nebraska, Don Bacon, who is challenging Representative Brad Ashford, a Democrat, initially issued a statement calling Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cutterly disgraceful and disqualifying. \u201d But the news release is nowhere to be found on Mr. Bacon\u2019s website, and at a debate Tuesday night in Omaha, he would not rule out voting for Mr. Trump. The specter of a civil war enveloping the party less than four weeks before Election Day left veteran Republicans deeply worried about what the elected officials who moved so quickly to abandon Mr. Trump last weekend had wrought. One former Virginia congressman, Thomas M. Davis III, said \u201cpanicked\u201d Republicans might have made the party\u2019s   problems even worse. \u201cIt discourages turnout,\u201d Mr. Davis said, noting that even as Mr. Trump sinks in the polls, he still has at least   of the party behind him. \u201cPublicly disowning and running from him just creates havoc. It hurts everybody. I understand individual decisions, but when this happens institutionally, it hurts. \u201d Sensing an opportunity to rally his supporters against the wavering Republican leaders, Mr. Trump went after Mr. Ryan at a campaign rally for the first time since the speaker told House Republicans on Monday that he would no longer defend the party\u2019s nominee. Before 7, 000 people in Ocala, Fla. Mr. Trump veered between dark, conspiratorial warnings and strikingly personal expressions of resentment. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole deal going on,\u201d he said of Mr. Ryan\u2019s decision to walk away from his candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure it out. \u201d Yet even as he used the rally to accuse the speaker of being part of a nefarious, if vague, plot, Mr. Trump also made clear he was wounded that Mr. Ryan had not called to praise him for his debate performance on Sunday. \u201cSo wouldn\u2019t you think that Paul Ryan would call and say good going, in front of just about the largest audience for a   debate in the history of the country?\u201d he complained. In a conference call Wednesday night with major donors, Mr. Ryan vented about leaks from the conference call with House Republicans on Monday in which he announced his decision to focus entirely on congressional races. He said the news media had misinterpreted his message to his colleagues  \u2014   that they should not \u201cdefend the indefensible\u201d  \u2014   and that Mr. Trump lacked \u201cthe discipline\u201d to resist swiping back at him, according to a donor on the call. But Mr. Ryan said that Republican candidates could \u201chelp Trump with turnout,\u201d and that he planned to use a speech on Friday to argue against Hillary Clinton. While Mr. Trump had already lashed out at Mr. Ryan on Twitter and in a Fox News interview, his decision to use his own campaign event to hurl attacks at the speaker caused a new wave of fear among Republicans that their now \u201cunshackled\u201d candidate, as he described himself earlier in the week, might use his rallies to similarly attack local Republican lawmakers who have refused to support his candidacy. (They also had to deal with new revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, like a report that he had walked into a Miss Teen USA dressing room as contestants were changing, and another report that two women had accused him of groping them.) Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, would not say whether Mr. Trump planned to start tailoring his intraparty attacks by region. But she pointedly emailed an automated survey of Nevada voters showing that Republicans were punishing Representative Joe Heck in his Senate campaign for withdrawing his support of Mr. Trump. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent remaining allies, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, said the nominee\u2019s blasts at other Republicans were an unnecessary diversion from targeting Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Gingrich added that Mr. Ryan had invited the opprobrium from both Mr. Trump and his admirers. \u201cRyan wants to find a middle path, but he doesn\u2019t understand that the middle path signals to his own partisans that he\u2019s not hanging tough,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you have to say if you\u2019re Ryan is, \u2018We need to beat Hillary Clinton, and I\u2019m going to help beat Hillary Clinton. \u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton herself was reveling in the Republican conflagration and, in a new sign of confidence, used a rally in Pueblo, Colo. to appeal across state lines to voters in two red states that now appear within reach. \u201dIf you\u2019ve got friends in Utah or Arizona, make sure they vote, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are competing everywhere. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561956.414605}
