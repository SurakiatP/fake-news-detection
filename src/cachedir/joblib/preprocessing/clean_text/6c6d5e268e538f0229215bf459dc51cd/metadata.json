Featured as part of a collaboration with the International Cat Association, the cats drew consternation from some dog handlers, who felt the parvenus did not belong. The cats, being cats, did not care. They dressed up or dressed down, leapt through the occasional hoop and gazed witheringly on the efforts of their human and canine compatriots. Oh, to be a cat and be above it all. For the photographer Vincent Tullo, the cats offered another attraction as well: They brought him and his camera to the show\u2019s fringes, where the   discipline of the main events gave way to curious hoodies and whimsy. \u201cThe cat people were much more playful than the dog people,\u201d said Mr. Tullo, who is a dog owner. \u201cI\u2019d go to the cat section, and all the owners were laughing. The judges were laughing. Then I\u2019d go to the dog section, and people would get mad at you for taking pictures of their dog. It\u2019s a little strange that people take a puppy this seriously. The dogs want to relax and play. They try to walk over to you and sniff you, and the owners pull them back. \u201d The truly exotic creatures at the event, of course, are the handlers, who spend four hours or more wetting and drying their dogs\u2019 hair for the grooming competition. Before the dogs\u2019 agility competition, handlers were given the opportunity to practice the obstacle course  \u2014   but without their dogs. \u201cIt was the weirdest thing,\u201d Mr. Tullo said. \u201cThere were 20 or 30 people running in circles, saying, \u2018Good boy,\u2019 and not a single dog in sight. \u201d The cats, no doubt, had a good chuckle at that one.
