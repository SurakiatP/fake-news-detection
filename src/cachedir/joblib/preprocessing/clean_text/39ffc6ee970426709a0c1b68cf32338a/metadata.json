But for the rebels and many others in Yemen, the predawn strikes on Thursday were just the first public evidence of what they have long believed: that the United States has been waging an extended campaign in the country, the hidden hand behind Saudi Arabia\u2019s punishing air war. For the Obama administration, the missile strikes also highlighted the risks of a balancing strategy it has tried to pursue in Yemen since a bitter sectarian war engulfed the country two years ago. The United States has not formally joined the   coalition that intervened in support of Yemen\u2019s deposed government  \u2014   and has tried to push the warring factions toward a peace deal  \u2014   but it has refueled coalition bombers, trained Saudi pilots and provided intelligence to the bombing campaign. A year and a half of bombing  \u2014   along with the deaths of thousands of Yemeni civilians  \u2014   has stoked anger in Yemen not only toward the Saudis, but also toward their perceived patrons in Washington. This week\u2019s attacks on the Mason, an American destroyer, and the Pentagon\u2019s response show how rapidly the United States can go from being an uneasy supporting player to an active participant in a chaotic civil war. \u201cThe Americans have been patronizing and directing the war from the very beginning,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Sharaf Luqman, a spokesman for the rebel alliance. Yemen\u2019s conflict started in 2014, when Shiite rebels from the north, the Houthis, seized the capital, Sana, and sent the government into exile. They now control much of the country\u2019s north and west, along with army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. An international military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began a bombing campaign in March 2015 in an effort to restore the government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the exiled president. The Obama administration gave its immediate support to the campaign  \u2014   despite skepticism about whether the coalition would be able to dislodge the Houthis from Sana  \u2014   in part because it needed Saudi support for the nuclear deal it was negotiating with the kingdom\u2019s archenemy, Iran. That support has come under greater scrutiny amid reports that coalition forces have been striking residential areas, markets, medical facilities and weddings. On Saturday, an attack on a funeral reception in Sana killed more than 100 people. The United States has also kept warships in the region to guard a sea lane through which four million barrels of oil pass each day. There, in the narrow strait at the mouth of the Red Sea, the dizzying mix of warships, cargo vessels and insurgent forces this week yielded precisely what the Obama administration had spent 18 months trying to avoid. The American strikes, launched at   territory, came after two unsuccessful missile attacks on the Mason in four days, the Pentagon said Thursday, and were intended solely to protect American forces and other shipping in Bab el Mandeb, the strait separating Yemen from Eritrea and Djibouti. More attacks would invite further retaliation, Peter Cook, the Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday. American and allied warships will continue to patrol the strait, he said, but \u201cwe don\u2019t seek a wider role in the conflict. \u201d That may be the case, but the United States now finds itself facing a dangerous situation in a narrow stretch of water where even small incidents run the risk of inciting a broader conflict. After the American strikes, Iran said it was sending two warships to the strait, presumably to support the Houthis, an indigenous Shiite group with loose connections to Iran. Saudi Arabia has portrayed the Houthis as an Iranian proxy force and has said that it needed to intervene in Yemen to protect Saudi national security by preventing the rise of a belligerent militia on its southern border. Foreign diplomats and analysts say Iran\u2019s ties to the Houthis are murkier, although Iran has provided the group with some military support. Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who studies Yemen, said most of the arms used by the   alliance were \u201clegacy mat\u00e9riel,\u201d meaning that they were in the country before the conflict started. Yemen has for a long time been awash in arms, and much of the rebels\u2019 armory came from the Yemeni Army. But as the conflict has gone on, there has been more evidence of Iranian military support, he said. Along the   border, rebels have begun using   missiles,   rockets and sniper rifles of the same type used by   militias in Iraq and Lebanon. Pentagon officials could not say whether it was Houthi rebels themselves who had launched the missiles at the Mason or whether they had been fired by allied military units loyal to Yemen\u2019s former president, Mr. Saleh, who are fighting alongside the insurgents. But Mr. Cook said Thursday that the main issue was the threat to American forces and that the retaliatory strikes had disabled the radar installations that had targeted the Mason. \u201cThese targets were chosen based on our assessment that they were involved in missile launches in recent days, and they were struck in order to defend our ships and their crews and to protect freedom of navigation through a waterway that is vitally important to international commerce,\u201d Mr. Cook told reporters. Gerald M. Feierstein, a former ambassador to Yemen who was the State Department\u2019s   diplomat for the Middle East until May, said the rebels most likely acquired the   missiles in the past few months, probably from Iran. \u201cThis is a relatively new phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Feierstein said, acknowledging that it was unclear whether the decision to launch them at an American warship had been made by senior Houthi leaders or a rogue commander. On Oct. 1, the Houthis claimed a successful attack on a vessel being used by the United Arab Emirates. While that strike  \u2014   and the two attacks on the Mason this week  \u2014   killed no one, they raised the specter that the chaos in Yemen would increasingly threaten international navigation. \u201cThat is why these missile strikes are so significant,\u201d said Mr. Knights, the analyst. \u201cIt might be the indication that the Houthis have said, \u2018You know what, if we get nothing from the West, then we have nothing to lose. \u2019\u201d According to the United Nations, more than 4, 000 civilians have been killed in Yemen since the bombing campaign began. Even though the Obama administration provides extensive support for the military coalition, the administration\u2019s public position is that it is not a party to the conflict, a stance that rings hollow for many Yemenis. \u201cIn Yemen, this is seen as a U. S. bombing campaign,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat and critic of the war who led an effort in the Senate last month to block a $1. 15 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Mr. Murphy said that the White House should use its leverage over the Saudis, and use the threat of dialing back some of this support to try to rein in a campaign that has been widely condemned as reckless. \u201cThe Saudis have to know that they can\u2019t conduct this campaign without U. S. support,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562682.3124251}
