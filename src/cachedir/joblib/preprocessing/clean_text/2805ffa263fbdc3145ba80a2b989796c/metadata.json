But it could also be seen as retaliation for our coverage. I have emailed @PressSec https:  .   \u2014   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 9, 2017,  Trump has referred to outlets like CNN and the Times as part of the \u201copposition party\u201d and slammed them for publishing \u201cfake news\u201d based on anonymous sources. The New York Times was sent to the very last row a day after former FBI director James Comey revealed on Thursday while testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Times published a fake news story in February suggesting that Trump\u2019s campaign had colluded with Russians a year before the 2016 election.

Maybe the American people don\u2019t. The challenge, and I\u2019m not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information, is the people talking about it often don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, and going on are not talking about it. We don\u2019t call the press to say, hey, you don\u2019t that thing wrong about the sensitive topic. We have to leave it there. \u201d In addition to the Times\u2019 \u201cfake news\u201d story, Comey also revealed that have been \u201cmany, many\u201d stories in the mainstream press about the Trump campaign and Russia that have been \u201cdead wrong. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562654.6183243}
