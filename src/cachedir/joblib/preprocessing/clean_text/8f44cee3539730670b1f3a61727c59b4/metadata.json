(She\u2019ll even remove her teeth!) \\nHillary\u2019s campaign has deployed Miley Cyrus to canvas for her \u2014 when Cyrus is not busy inviting men in the audience to reach up and grab her p*ssy. (Here\u2019s a video of delicate flower Miley Cyrus in action.) \\nWhen Vernon Jordan was asked by CBS\u2019 Mike Wallace what he talked about while golfing with Bill Clinton \u2014 aka Hillary\u2019s husband \u2014 he answered: \u201cP*ssy.\u201d \\nOh, and 11 years before Teddy Kennedy ran for president as the Conscience of the Democratic Party \u2014 he killed a girl. After grabbing her p*ssy. \\n(2) Trump\u2019s a sexual predator! \\nHillary\u2019s husband is a well-established rapist, groper and pants-dropper. She\u2019s his fixer. \\nUnlike the serial predations of her husband, leveled repeatedly throughout the decades, the timing of these 11th-hour allegations against Trump make them highly suspect. \\nRecall that The New York Times spent months investigating Trump\u2019s treatment of women earlier this year. The Newspaper of Record put its best reporters on the job, interviewed a dozen women, and the paper splashed the story on its front page. But the best the Timescould come up with was a story about Trump, as a bachelor, publicly praising a model for looking great in a bikini at his pool party. Then they dated. The horror. \\nFive months later, just days before the election, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a female Democrat who isn\u2019t claiming to have been groped by Trump \u2014 and getting loads of fawning publicity. \\n(3) Trump doesn\u2019t give enough to charity. \\nThe media only counts \u201ccharitable giving\u201d if it can be taken as a tax deduction with the IRS. When Trump spent time and money saving a Georgia family farm from foreclosure in the 1980s, for example, he didn\u2019t get any tax write-off. \\nHillary, by contrast, was a big philanthropist because, at about the same time, she was taking a deduction for donations of Bill\u2019s used underwear \u2014 the modern equivalent of smallpox-laden blankets. Today, the munificent Clinton Foundation spends less than 10 percent of its revenues on actual charity, using about 90 percent for salaries, offices and travel. \\n(4) Several of Trump\u2019s businesses went bankrupt. \\nTrump has created or helped create hundreds of businesses. Fewer than 10 went bankrupt. Hillary had one business, Whitewater Development Corp., and it went bankrupt \u2014 after ripping off scores of ordinary Americans. Also, a dozen prominent Arkansans went to prison in connection with sleazy financial transactions involving Whitewater. \\n(5) Trump University was a scam! \\nApproximately 10,000 graduates of Trump University were thrilled with the program and said so in writing. But a law firm that paid Hillary and Bill Clinton $675,000 for three speeches managed to find a handful of disgruntled students to be the named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against it. \\nTrump University was a minuscule portion of Trump\u2019s portfolio. Whitewater was a huge part of Bill and Hillary\u2019s get-rich-quick schemes, scamming the elderly, retirees and working-class Americans for the money-hungry Clintons. \\nAs described by The Washington Post, people who bought property from the Whitewater Development Corp. were required to submit a down payment, followed by monthly payments, until the entire purchase price of the property was paid off. But if buyers missed a single payment for any reason, the entire transaction would be deemed null and void, and the property, as well as all prior payments, would be forfeited to the Whitewater corporation. No foreclosure proceeding, no court hearing, no due process. \\nMore than half of Whitewater\u2019s customers lost their entire investment. (See \u201cWhitewater Repossessions; Sales Practice Benefited Clintons, Partners,\u201d The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) \\nThough Hillary had long claimed to have nothing to do with the operation of the business, when the books were finally opened, it turned out that the monthly checks were mailed to the Whitewater Development Corp. \u2014 \u201ccare of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d (See \u201cRecords Show Wider Role for Hillary Clinton; Whitewater Papers Detail Involvement,\u201d The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) \\n(6) We can\u2019t allow Trump access to nuclear codes! \\nHillary is the one who is champing at the bit to go to war with Russia, which, I am reliably informed, is a nuclear power. \\nAt least Hillary\u2019s adept at dealing with sensitive digital information. Huma! Quick! Are the nuclear launch codes on my Blackberry, my desktop thingy or my Facebook page? \\nCompared to Hillary, we\u2019d be safer if the nuclear codes were held by Miley Cyrus (unless she kept them in her p*ssy). \\n(7) Trump\u2019s temperament will get us into World War III. \\nHillary\u2019s temperament drove her to push for intervention in the Libyan civil war against Moammar Gadhafi for the sole purpose of giving her a foreign policy success that could be all her own. \\nObama was skeptical. Libya was Hillary\u2019s baby. (Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s email to Hillary: \u201cFirst, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it.\u201d) \\nAfter Gadhafi was killed, Hillary\u2019s temperament led her to go on TV and laughingly say, \u201cWe came. We saw. He died.\u201d \\nUnfortunately, Hillary hadn\u2019t given the slightest thought to what would come next. What came next was: the Muslim Brotherhood, the murder of Americans in Benghazi and millions of refugees pouring into Western Europe. \\n(8) Trump failed to denounce David Duke with the ferocity deemed sufficient by our media. \\nNo one even knows if Duke actually exists or is just a phantom produced by the media every four years to smear Republicans. \\nI know that no one has ever been incited to commit murder after listening to a David Duke speech. Lots of people have been murdered by someone who\u2019d just heard an Al Sharpton speech: seven at Freddy\u2019s Fashion Mart in Harlem, and one Orthodox Jew, plus one Italian mistaken for a Jew, in Crown Heights. \\nHillary has not disavowed Sharpton \u2014 nor would our media be so rude as to ask. \\nThe mother of Ferguson thug Mike Brown, Lesley McSpadden, campaigns with Hillary \u2014 she even took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. The father of Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter, appeared on stage behind Hillary at a rally. \\nIf the media won\u2019t ask her to \u201cdisavow\u201d the relatives of criminals and terrorists featured at her events, could they at least ask her if she approves of their parenting techniques? \\n(9) Trump is a \u201cracist\u201d because of his plan to remove Muslim jihadists, Mexican drug dealers and rapists from our country. \\nApart from the fact that \u201cdrug dealer,\u201d \u201crapist\u201d and \u201cjihadist\u201d are not races, we didn\u2019t do anything to Muslims or Mexicans, except send them billions of dollars in foreign aid. The only \u201cracism\u201d Americans care about is that toward black Americans. We did something to them. \\nHillary asks blacks to vote for her, then vows to bring in millions of Muslims and Mexicans to take their jobs \u2014 the ones that \u201cAmericans just won\u2019t do.\u201d That\u2019s racism. \\n(10) Trump \u201cfat-shamed\u201d Miss Universe! \\nNo, he didn\u2019t \u2014 he saved her crown and she was grateful. It\u2019s on tape. \\nBut more importantly, the Miss Universe in question is Alicia Machado, well-known in Venezuela as a publicity-seeking clown. \\nMachado is credibly accused of: driving the getaway car in an attempted murder; threatening to kill a federal judge; and being the baby mama to drug cartel kingpin Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, who was on the State Department\u2019s \u201cMost Wanted\u201d list under \u2014 let\u2019s see, checking my notes \u2014 Hillary Clinton. \\nUntil 1975, everyone would have realized that it\u2019s stupid to bring in single mothers with no marketable job skills, to add to the dependent class. If we did bring them in, politicians wouldn\u2019t proudly introduce them at rallies. \\nBut Machado is Hillary\u2019s model immigrant. Her only job skill is voting. Upside: Hillary gets another vote. Downside: You\u2019ll be supporting Machado and her anchor baby for the rest of their lives, America. \\n(11) Trump is challenging the very foundation of our democracy by saying elections are rigged! \\nThey are rigged \u2014 ask former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, whose 2008 election was provably stolen from him when more than a thousand ineligible felons voted for Al Franken in a race Coleman lost by 312 votes. (At least it wasn\u2019t an important election: Franken provided the 60th, and deciding, vote to pass Obamacare.) \\nIn any event, Hillary says the election is rigged, too \u2014 by the Russkies! \\nThe Democrats and the media have gone full John Birch Society on us. There\u2019s a fifth column in America \u2014 and their leader is Donald Trump!!! \\nThis is a marked departure from their previous cosmopolitan sangfroid about communism. We could have really used this fighting spirit during the Cold War. Instead, we got Jimmy Carter warning Americans about their \u201cinordinate fear of communism.\u201d \\nToday, bad-ass, eye-rolling journalists are somberly announcing: \u201cI have in my hand a list \u2014 a list of Donald Trump supporters, who are a conscious, articulate instrument of the Russian conspiracy \u2026\u201d \\n(12) Trump is shallow, has a microscopic attention span and has not studied political issues deeply. \\nOn the other hand, he has a good heart, good judgment and wants the right outcome for America: limits on immigration, fair trade deals, the elimination of Wall Street tax breaks and no more pointless Middle East wars. \\nHillary doesn\u2019t want any of these things. She is good at memorizing all her little facts, but is deeply evil. She wakes up early in the morning to make sure she does the wrong thing for America. \\n(13) Trump has personal baggage. \\nThis election is not about Trump. It\u2019s never been about Trump. Anyone running on his platform of putting Americans first would be torn to shreds. \\nThere are probably lots of bad things Trump\u2019s done in his personal life in the past. The ruling class wants Hillary to do bad things to our country in the future.'"}, "time": 1742564049.0586438}
