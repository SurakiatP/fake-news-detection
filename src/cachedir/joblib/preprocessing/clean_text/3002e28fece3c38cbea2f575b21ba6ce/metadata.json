Driven by   definitions of what is healthy to eat, people are turning to foods they shunned just a couple of years ago. Studies now suggest that not all fat, for example, necessarily contributes to weight gain or heart problems. That has left companies scrambling to push some foods that they thought had long passed their popularity peak  \u2014   and health advocates wondering what went wrong. Under the new thinking, not all fat is bad, and neither are all salty foods. A stigma among the public remains for sugar substitutes, but less so for cane sugar, at least in moderation. And all of those attributes are weighed against qualities like simplicity and taste. \u201cI think the   equation has changed,\u201d said Steve French, a managing partner at the Natural Marketing Institute, a research firm, said. Edy\u2019s ice cream, known as Dreyer\u2019s west of the Rockies, is a case in point. Edy\u2019s sold 10. 8 percent more of its Edy\u2019s Grand Ice Cream, a   ice cream, in the 52 weeks that ended Feb. 21 compared with the year before, according to IRI, a data and research firm. Other   ice creams also had sales gains. Over the same period, Edy\u2019s sold 4. 8 percent less of its   Ice Cream, made with a process that lowers the fat content. When the product was introduced in 2004, it was promoted as having less fat and fewer calories  \u2014   and sales soared. Now, that sort of marketing is gone. Instead, the company has retooled some of its   products to make them with fewer ingredients and to include cane sugar rather than   corn syrup, which many consumers don\u2019t like. Labels on those ice creams will also tell consumers that they contain no genetically engineered ingredients. The devil, of course, is in the details of those new scientific findings. None of the new studies, for instance, recommend eating as much bacon as you want. \u201cThe new definition of modern health is very different from the traditional view, which was to reduce fat, sugar and sodium,\u201d said Robert Kilmer, president of Nestl\u00e9 Dreyer\u2019s Ice Cream, a division of Nestl\u00e9 USA. \u201cHealthy now is about what\u2019s in my food and where did it come from. \u201d Food companies have been working feverishly over the last several years to offer what consumers perceive as improved nutritional content and healthier food. Sales of products made from organic ingredients have risen sharply in recent years, for example. Mars Food, a division of the privately held Mars candy company whose brands include Uncle Ben\u2019s and Dolmio, reduced sodium by over 20 percent in many of its products and recently announced a plan to go even further. And General Mills is eliminating artificial colors and flavors from its cereals  \u2014   no more neon hues in Trix. But consumers are constantly recalculating the pros and cons of the foods they eat  \u2014   leading to some unexpected foods rising in popularity. For example, in 2015, Americans checked the fat content on food labels less often than they did in 2006, according to research from the Natural Marketing Institute. They\u2019re focusing more on the list of ingredients, a product\u2019s environmental impact and animal welfare  \u2014   the famous \u201cFarm\u201d episode in \u201cPortlandia\u201d in which a waitress can tell diners the name of the chicken they\u2019ll be eating remains relevant five years after it was first shown. And don\u2019t forget about taste. A majority of Americans say they value taste more than how healthy a food is. This can be frustrating for food executives, who spent years getting salt, sugar and fat out of a wide variety of products, paying high costs in development and marketing along the way. Michael Sharp, the research scientist at Nestl\u00e9 who has presided over the reformulation of its   ice creams, noted that all of the ingredients he is working to eliminate today were originally added to the product for good reasons. \u201cThe ingredients we\u2019ve subtracted either had some functionality on their own or improved the functionality of other ingredients,\u201d Mr. Sharp said. \u201cCorn syrup adds a lot of body and bulk to a product  \u2014   but the consumer doesn\u2019t want it today. \u201d Nutrition experts are watching the shift warily. Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a research and advocacy group, noted that companies have gone a long way toward reducing or eliminating saturated fats, which raise cholesterol in the blood and increase the risk of heart disease. The American Heart Association and other health advocacy groups have long recommended limiting consumption of saturated fat. But in recent years, studies have suggested that maybe saturated fat is not as bad as once thought. One analysis of research on saturated fats, which generated some criticism, blurred the link between it and heart disease. Another study concluded that skim milk did not appear to restrict weight gain among young children. That rethinking seems to have encouraged some consumers to return to   foods. Edy\u2019s French Vanilla Grand ice cream, for example, has four grams of saturated fat in every  . A   of the same flavor in its   variety, the recently less popular option, has 1. 5 grams of saturated fat. Similarly, the public appears to have been persuaded by some evidence that eating dark chocolate is good for the heart. Technavio, a market research firm, predicted that sales would increase an average of more than 8 percent a year through 2019. But the federal government also recommends a limit on total fat consumption  \u2014   the combination of bad and good fats. An   bar of Ghirardelli 72% Intense Dark chocolate supplies more than the government\u2019s daily recommendation for saturated fat and more than   of the recommendation for total fat. \u201cThere are recommended limits on total fat that I think have sort of gotten lost in the marketing,\u201d Ms. Wootan said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in science that tells you it\u2019s healthy to eat as much fat as you want, just as long as it\u2019s not saturated fat. \u201d Another sore point among nutritionists is the rising sales of jerky, once regarded as little more than a sodium delivery mechanism. Now, as consumers clamor for foods high in protein, jerky has become a popular option. One ounce delivers about a quarter of the daily recommended amount of protein and costs roughly $2. 50. Sales of meat snacks like jerky shot up 46. 9 percent from 2011 to 2015, to more than $2. 6 billion, according to Nielsen, a market research firm. \u201cJerky is manly, jerky is kind of rednecky and jerky can even be kind of offensive if people don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d said Troy Link, chief executive of Link Snacks, a   snack food business. \u201cSo we changed things up and began calling it a protein snack, and now jerky is being eaten by   health eaters who haven\u2019t been involved in the category before. \u201d Link Snacks\u2019 most popular product, Jack Link\u2019s Teriyaki Beef Jerky, delivers 12 grams of protein and just 80 calories in a   serving  \u2014   and   the daily recommended amount of sodium. Mr. Link said the company had worked to reduce the sodium in its products, along with getting rid of monosodium glutamate and nitrites. \u201cFor the most part, sodium has become good again, and I think certain fats have become good again, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople want something that tastes good. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562121.1786668}
