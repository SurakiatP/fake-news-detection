The loving uncle/CEN Photo \\nIn Germany, as in many European countries, the legal age of sexual consent is 14 . Since there is no law in Germany prohibiting the relationship, it may continue to blossom, the court ruled. \\n\u201cThe court does not offer any opinion on the non-judicial question of whether a 47-year-old married man should return the love of a 14-year-old fired by adolescent affection and enthusiasm,\u201d it wrote, the Telegraph reported . \\n\u201cThe relationship may be socially undesirable and unacceptable, but it is not covered by criminal law, and not categorically forbidden.\u201d \\nThe girl from Schildow, a town in the German state of Brandenburg, ditched school and ran off with her uncle a year ago \u2014 to the dismay of her worried parents, who alerted police. \\nThe pair were later found in southern France, and the teen was brought back to Germany, where her parents forbade her from seeing her uncle. The parents got the court involved in a bid to keep the two apart. The red-haired teen revolted, stopped attending school, and tried to stay in a government shelter. \\nThe teen, whom the court described as of \u201cabove average intelligence,\u201d has said her relationship with her uncle is \u201cgoal-oriented and stable,\u201d according to CEN. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742561956.1413805}
