[Nintendo hopes to sell another 10 million Nintendo Switch consoles in the next fiscal year, but they are trying to produce nearly double that number in order to meet demand. Yet despite their ambition, production efforts are being hamstrung. The culprit? None other than Apple, who needs many of the same parts to produces their internationally popular products.  NAND   chips, LCD screens, and vibration motors top the list of   commodities to the industry at large. The sudden addition of a   new console employing many of the same technologies has caused a significant shortage in parts, and manufacturers simply have not been able to keep up with demand. A spokeswoman for Toshiba stated that \u201cDemand for our NAND flash memory has been overwhelmingly greater than supply, and the situation is likely to stay for the rest of this year. \u201d That is bad news for Nintendo, because the video game giant simply cannot compete with hardware as widespread and established as the iPhone. One is a very hot new piece of entertainment, but the other has become so deeply ingrained in our daily lives that it can cause its own version of separation anxiety. If Nintendo can\u2019t   Apple, their only alternative is to  . But paying more would stress Nintendo\u2019s bottom line, and could potentially push the Switch beyond the sleek $299 price point that is proving so popular. Furthermore, the production of additional units isn\u2019t always translating into additional households. The Switch\u2019s portable nature  \u2014   but complete lack of transferable save data  \u2014   has prompted many families to purchase multiple consoles. So while the Nintendo Switch moved almost 3 million units in March alone, there are still many people who have yet to even see it on store shelves. It\u2019s not looking like the shortage will end anytime soon, regardless of Nintendo\u2019s willingness to bolster production. Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima is determined not to sell the Switch at a loss, and the company is already doing costly   deliveries to get the console from the production line to retailers as fast as possible. If you are interested in getting a Switch, be prepared to hunt  \u2014   even through this year\u2019s distant but inexorable holiday season.
