So it may be several years before he feels he can boss a game like Sexton and Murray,\u201d explained joint directors of the movie Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese. \\nSuch is the unconfined joy created by the 40-29 victory many of the fans in attendance in Chicago are cashing in on the famous win. \\n\u201cMy mate Dave is doing a one man show called \u2018I Was There\u2019, he\u2019s sold out 40 dates in Vicar Street,\u201d explained Dublin woman Andrea Hooley, \u201cI\u2019ve had 8 proposals of marriage from old boyfriends after I posted a picture of myself at the game on Facebook, I won\u2019t take any of them up on the offer but I could probably get a holiday out of one of them\u201d. \\nWe Beat Them, We Actually Fucking Beat Them is slated for release sometime in the next few years.'"}, "time": 1742561997.5225847}
