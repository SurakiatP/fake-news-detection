Trump hurled himself into a new effort to reshape the presidential race on Monday, scrambling to allay voters\u2019 concerns about his temperament and put Hillary Clinton on the defensive over her critical comments about many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. Though Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has largely withheld comment about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health, showing uncharacteristic restraint after her campaign announced she had pneumonia, he took Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unexpected absence from public view as an opportunity to press his case with ferocity. Among Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, there is a sense of urgency. With eight weeks left in the race  \u2014   and just two before his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee  \u2014   Mr. Trump may never again have such a window to make his argument to voters more or less uninterrupted. Without a forceful message and iron discipline heading into the debates, Mr. Trump could struggle mightily to overcome the deeply rooted opposition to his candidacy. An ABC   Post poll published over the weekend showed Mrs. Clinton with a    edge over Mr. Trump nationally, with six in 10 voters describing Mr. Trump as unqualified and biased against women and minorities. Mr. Trump seized the chance on Monday to turn the charge of intolerance against Mrs. Clinton: Denouncing the allegation that his supporters were bigoted, Mr. Trump argued in a speech in Baltimore that Mrs. Clinton had shown \u201ccontempt\u201d for voters by deriding many of his supporters as racist and sexist, calling them a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d at a   on Friday. At a rally on Monday night in North Carolina, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was running a \u201c  and negative campaign. \u201d The Trump campaign also announced the support of R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to reassure voters of Mr. Trump\u2019s readiness for the presidency. Mr. Trump made no mention of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health in his campaign speeches. During two television interviews on Monday morning, he said he wished Mrs. Clinton well. He also did not revive his frequent accusation that Mrs. Clinton lacks the physical strength to be president, though he suggested vaguely that \u201csomething is going on. \u201d Instead, he used a speech to the National Guard Association of the United States to defend his supporters at length, arguing that they were right to be concerned about border security and crime, and that those concerns did not indicate a hateful view of racial and religious minorities. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don\u2019t see how she can credibly campaign any further,\u201d Mr. Trump said, demanding an apology. He claimed that his campaign was doing \u201camazingly well with   and Hispanic workers. \u201d But Mr. Trump, who records little support in the polls among racial minorities and educated whites, did not address any of the past remarks that have contributed to his low standing with those groups. He has continued to call for a crackdown on immigrants who are in the country illegally, and has declined to retract his false assertions in the past that President Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Trump has also not expressed regret for clashing with the family of a slain Muslim Army captain or renounced his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country. Mrs. Clinton has rebuked Mr. Trump over the last month for what she has called his promotion of racially insensitive messages and policies and his alignment with leaders of the movement known as the \u201c\u201d which is widely seen as holding fringe and racist views. Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Trump appeared to be recovering his footing in the race, but that it might be too late for him to change many voters\u2019 longstanding assessment of his character and capabilities. \u201cHillary Clinton clearly won the summer, and there\u2019s little doubt Donald Trump dug himself a very deep hole in the aftermath of the nominating conventions,\u201d Mr. Blizzard said. \u201cWhile Trump is starting to climb out of that hole now, his ability to take advantage of a few bad weeks for Clinton is going to be limited due to enduring views about his judgment, his temperament and his rhetoric toward other ethnicities and women. \u201d And Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Trump will be able to reinvent himself by using Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biting comments as a shield. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises a   \u201csuper PAC,\u201d described an exercise he uses in focus groups, asking voters to write down three words to describe Mr. Trump before the discussion begins. \u201cPeople use the word \u2018racist\u2019 consistently to describe him,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cBut they also talk about him as a dangerous egomaniac. \u201d Still, on a conference call with top supporters Monday, advisers to Mr. Trump spoke of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s turbulent stretch as a source of relief: For the first time in a while, they said, they were starting the week on offense, according to people who participated in the call who spoke on condition of anonymity about a private discussion. Campaign surrogates were told to hammer Mrs. Clinton for her description of Trump voters, and to say as little as possible about her pneumonia diagnosis. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army officer who advises Mr. Trump, said there was optimism in the campaign that the momentum of the race had \u201ctotally shifted in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. \u201d He predicted that voters would see a distinction between \u201ca guy who made all kinds of comments as he was fighting to win the primaries\u201d and the Donald Trump of the general election. Mr. Trump has taken other steps in recent days to steady his candidacy, moving to shore up his campaign in crucial swing states. With Mrs. Clinton holding a daunting advantage on the Electoral College map, Mr. Trump aimed a new television campaign at the four most critical states for his candidacy: Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. He has given his aides greater leeway in directing his television advertising, allowing the campaign to focus on that smaller cluster of states, a change from as recently as two weeks ago, when Mr. Trump was personally choosing where to run television ads, according to two people briefed on the Trump operation. Mr. Trump also removed the head of his Florida operation last week, replacing her with Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican operative close to Gov. Rick Scott. And Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who is still a trusted adviser, has visited New Hampshire in recent weeks, meeting with senior Republicans there and making suggestions on spending and strategy decisions in the state, two people familiar with his activities said. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump and his allies can maintain this level of determined focus. Numerous times, Mr. Trump has briefly adopted a more disciplined pose on the campaign trail, only to give in quickly to the temptation to taunt and brawl. Even on Monday morning, as he refrained from taunting Mrs. Clinton in a television interview, Mr. Trump made an offhand reference to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \u201cPocahontas. \u201d Ms. Warren, a Democrat, has described herself as having Native American heritage. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have suggested in the past that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health should be fair game. Blaise Ingoglia, the chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said he considered Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of her health a legitimate campaign issue because she did not immediately disclose that she had pneumonia. \u201cThe disturbing part of that whole thing is that the campaign is willing to conceal that instead of being up front and honest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really start to question: What else is being concealed?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564161.0445888}
