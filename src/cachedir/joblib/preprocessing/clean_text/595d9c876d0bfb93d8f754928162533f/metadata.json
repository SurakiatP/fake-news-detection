Bannon\u2019s reputation has taken on almost mythic proportion as a   populist, emerging power center, man of mystery. When Mr. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s chief strategist, appeared in public on Thursday for the first time since the president was sworn in, it was to deliver, in his own combative way, a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists gathered here for their annual assessment known as the Conservative Political Action Conference. Do not believe the \u201ccorporatist globalist media\u201d that was \u201ccrying and weeping\u201d on election night and is still \u201cdead wrong\u201d about what the Trump administration is doing. Inside the White House, Mr. Bannon said, everything is going according to plan. The \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d has just begun. Appearing with Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s chief of staff, he joked about how well the two get along despite the friction that had always existed between them. \u201cI can run a little hot on occasion,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, complimenting Mr. Priebus\u2019s equanimity. And he urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a populist, whether you\u2019re a   conservative, whether you\u2019re a libertarian, whether you\u2019re an economic nationalist,\u201d he said, \u201cwe want you to have our back. \u201d Despite Mr. Bannon\u2019s assurances, a simmering unease remains among conservatives over whether Mr. Trump will honor his promises to them, given that he was not part of their movement  \u2014   or any political movement, for that matter  \u2014   until very recently. Not too many years ago CPAC almost denied Mr. Trump a speaking slot because it feared he only wanted to promote himself. As for Mr. Bannon, he was essentially banished from the premises when he was running Breitbart News. So Mr. Bannon started a  rival conference at a hotel down the street and called it The Uninvited. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, acknowledged the discomfort that comes with any hostile party takeover when she addressed the meeting. Mr. Trump, she said, had to uproot the political system. \u201cEvery great movement ends up being a little bit sclerotic and dusty after a time,\u201d she said. She predicted that CPAC would wholly embrace the new president. \u201cWell, I think by tomorrow this will be TPAC,\u201d she said. Part of what has been so problematic in Mr. Trump\u2019s first month is that the disruption he promised to unleash on the federal bureaucracy so far seems to be occurring in the wrong place: his administration, which has been rife with infighting and rattled by early missteps. The destructive forces that Mr. Bannon and other conservatives complain about can sometimes come from within. Mr. Trump\u2019s first nominee for labor secretary withdrew after allegations of domestic abuse and revelations that he had employed an undocumented immigrant he did not pay taxes on. His hastily carried out executive order barring refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has been tangled up in the courts and blocked from going into effect. He fired his national security adviser. And questions of how closely members of his inner circle may have worked with the Russians to sabotage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign continue to attract interest from investigators. \u201cDisruption is a good thing,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC. Still, he acknowledged, \u201con some days they do it better than others. \u201d There is another lens through which to see the disorder that has characterized this White House, Mr. Trump and his supporters say. And that is to understand that the president\u2019s enemies  \u2014   especially in the news media  \u2014   want to distort his actions, exaggerate his mistakes and not discuss issues like safety and unemployment that are on the minds of his supporters. Gov. Matt Bevin, Republican of Kentucky, said he was appalled by the \u201cunbelievable incessant focus on the most mindless things,\u201d with regard to how the president is portrayed in the news media. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about crime rates. Let\u2019s talk about economic viability. Let\u2019s talk about joblessness,\u201d Mr. Bevin added. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on things that matter and stop being so   and titillated by idiocy. \u201d Ms. Conway said the stories of disarray in the White House, including recent accounts that she has been sidelined lately, were nothing more than tiresome palace intrigue. And without naming names, she said the attacks directed at her were really desperate attacks against the president by political enemies still sore about the election. \u201cTo try to remove me from the equation would remove one of his voices and one of his trusted aides. And that would be hurtful to him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see this coming. They weren\u2019t prepared for this result  \u2014   even though they all ran around and said: \u2018We\u2019re a divided country! We\u2019re a divided country! \u2019\u201d It was not as if the support for Mr. Trump, who will speak to the conference Friday morning, is not enthusiastic. \u201cI always said he\u2019s not a stupid man. And if he has the right people around him he\u2019s going to do the right thing,\u201d said Daniel Cirucci of Cherry Hill, N. J. who was standing in line on Thursday evening to listen to Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative he said he deeply admired. \u201cI think he realizes the enormity of the job,\u201d Mr. Cirucci added. \u201cNow does that mean Trump is going to stop being Trump? No. \u201d These should be good times for conservatives  \u2014   and much of the time they are. They control not just the White House but both houses of Congress and appear on the verge of regaining a majority on the Supreme Court. They have not dominated so many state governments in close to a century. But part of the subtext of CPAC this year has been how conservative leaders are trying to smooth out the rougher edges of their movement, not all of which involve Mr. Trump. Because of the association that a fringe element of Trump supporters has with white nationalists, the CPAC organizers held a panel discussion on Thursday to signal their strong disapproval. Its title: The   Ain\u2019t Right at All. Yet after the panel was over, the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer stood in the hall just off the main stage and declared himself a conservative. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative in a deep sense, in a sense that I care about people and defending a culture. \u201d And the organizers had to cancel a planned speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart editor and Trump supporter who has a history of insulting Jews, Muslims,   and other minorities, after a tape surfaced in which he condoned sex with boys as young as 13. The projections of placidity inside CPAC tried to mask how fractious the movement remains. Yet optimists were not hard to find. Mr. Pence said the Trump victory has given conservatives \u201cthe most important time in the history of our movement. \u201d \u201cMy friends, this is our time,\u201d he told the conference Thursday night. \u201cThis is the time to prove again that our answers are the right answers for America. \u201d In his brief remarks, Mr. Bannon ended on a conciliatory note. He insisted that conservatives all had more in common than most people realized. \u201cWe have wide and sometimes divergent opinions,\u201d he said. But the core of what conservatives believe is \u201cthat we\u2019re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders  \u2014   that we\u2019re a nation with a culture and a reason for being. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what unites us,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to unite this movement going forward. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563189.7770207}
