The tech community, which was largely averse to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, may be asked to spread its wealth beyond places like Silicon Valley and Seattle. And the Federal Reserve is expected to give the American economy a vote of confidence, raising interest rates slightly for the first time in a year. Our analyst cautions that Mr. Trump\u2019s promised stimulus could set off a round of rapid rate increases to stave off inflation. _____ \u2022 Russia, Turkey and Syrian rebel groups reached an agreement for rebels to leave their last pockets of territory in the ravaged city of Aleppo.

N. said had been shot in the streets by the score. _____ \u2022 In Indonesia, the Christian governor of Jakarta, at the start of his trial on blasphemy charges, tearfully denied that he had meant to insult Islam.

A     trip through six African countries with five children. What could go wrong? \u2022  \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d opens this week in Asia and the U. S. with projections of one of the biggest December debuts. Here\u2019s our   review. We told you last week about a fight in Canada over a proposed official bird, the gray jay. Canadians have also sparred over whether poutine (fries topped with cheese curds and gravy) should beat out maple syrup as their most representative food (no). In some places, trademark foods are not so  . Many Britons consider chicken tikka masala, a colonial adaptation featuring a bright orange sauce, as their national dish  \u2014   more so than fish and chips. The concoction, one official said, \u201cis a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. \u201d In other places, there\u2019s no question about the winner.

Order \u201cChristmas,\u201d and you\u2019ll get both. Can\u2019t handle the heat? Reach for a glass of milk, which neutralizes the capsaicin that makes your taste buds sting. It\u2019s also the official beverage of 21 states. Anna Holland contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?
