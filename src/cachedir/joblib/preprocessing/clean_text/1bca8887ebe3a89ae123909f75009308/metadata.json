[In a luxurious and    Dolce  Gabbana floral coat, covered in an array of flowers, along with a matching floral clutch, Melania stole the show from the other spouses of foreign leaders during the NATO event.  As the First Lady was photographed in the center for the spouses, her peers opted for more subtle looks. Newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s wife, Brigitte, dressed down for the occasion, arriving in an orange knit top paired with white skinny jeans and red wedges. The wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Akie, wore a floral look as well, but couldn\u2019t match up to Melania\u2019s vibrant coat and matching clutch purse. Meanwhile, the wife of Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni, Emanuela Mauro, remained casual in a white linen top and black trousers, while the wife of Catania, Italy\u2019s Mayor Enzo Bianco, Amanda Succi, kept it subtle in a pale blue dress.  TIZIANA    Images, Melania\u2019s arrival at the meeting of international leaders marks her and her husband\u2019s last visit abroad before heading back to the United States from their first global trip as President and First Lady. The First Lady took the fashion world by storm on the trip with her choice of high fashion outfits of mostly coats, dresses and   belts, stunning the foreign press in   Dolce and Gabbana, Reem Acra, Ralph Lauren and Michael Kors. Melania is a friend of Dolce  Gabbana designer Stefano Gabbana, who takes to Instagram to celebrate each time she wears one of his creations.'"}, "time": 1742564318.6263025}
