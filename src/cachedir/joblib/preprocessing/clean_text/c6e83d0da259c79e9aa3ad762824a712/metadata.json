(Rob Morrow is good, but his Boston brogue is wicked bad.) John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are characteristically fantastic as the rival game show participants. \u2018Dheepan\u2019 When this film by the French director Jacques Audiard made its debut in May after showing at Cannes the year before, A. O. Scott wrote that \u201cthis story of a makeshift family, tossed from a distant war zone into a French housing project, looked to many festival observers less like a work of cinematic art than like a news bulletin. \u201d (Oct. 3) \u201813th\u2019 Ava DuVernay (\u201cSelma\u201d) directs this documentary about mass incarceration and racial inequality in the United States. The movie, which takes its title from the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, opens in select movie theaters on the same day. (Read Manohla Dargis\u2019s review.) (Oct. 7) \u2018Black Mirror,\u2019 Season 3  After finding success in America on Netflix, this dystopian   anthology TV series returns with six dark episodes, including installments directed by Joe Wright (\u201cAtonement\u201d) and Dan Trachtenberg (\u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d). (Oct. 21) \u2018Kung Fu Panda 3\u2019  This is neither the first nor the second entry in the \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d series. (Oct. 26) \u2018The Fall,\u2019 Season 3  At Watching, we\u2019ve received a handful of emails every month for the past   asking, \u201cWhen is the new season of \u2018The Fall\u2019 going to hit Netflix?\u201d For those of you who are that invested in this British serial killer drama starring Gillian Anderson, now you know. (Oct. 29) Also of interest: \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d \u201cGrizzly Man,\u201d \u201cGentleman\u2019s Agreement,\u201d \u201cOnce Upon a Time in the West,\u201d \u201cThree Kings,\u201d \u201cTitanic,\u201d \u201cUnforgiven. \u201d \u2018Before Sunrise\u2019   \u2018Before Sunset\u2019 Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, walking and talking, beautiful European locales, romance and longing. \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d (1995) the first film in the director Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cBefore\u201d trilogy, is cute and cringing in equal measure, as young love often is. \u201cBefore Sunset\u201d (2004) which looks at the same characters about a decade later, is a knockout, simultaneously melancholy and hopeful. \u2018Pride and Prejudice\u2019 Look, any version of Jane Austen\u2019s novel is going to suffer in comparison next to the beloved 1995 TV version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. But this 2005 adaptation directed by Joe Wright (\u201cAtonement\u201d) looks beautiful, and Keira Knightley is radiant. \u2018Goliath,\u2019 Season 1 David E. Kelley is one of the kings of the TV legal series  \u2014   \u201dL. A. Law,\u201d \u201cThe Practice,\u201d \u201cAlly McBeal\u201d  \u2014   and he returns to the genre with this   series starring Billy Bob Thornton as a dissolute former   lawyer who happens onto a big case. Don\u2019t expect much humor here, though there\u2019s something charming about Mr. Thornton\u2019s casual line delivery. (Oct. 14) \u2018Good Girls Revolt,\u2019 Season 1  In the early 1970s, a group of female researchers at \u201cNewsweek\u201d sued the magazine for gender discrimination, claiming that only men were considered for or appointed to the positions of reporter and writer. If you\u2019re interested in the era, the news industry, \u201cMad Men\u201d vibes or often think of this GIF, then this might interest you. You can watch the pilot now. (Oct. 28) Also of interest: \u201cChinatown,\u201d \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2,\u201d \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d \u201cMisery,\u201d \u201cSecretary,\u201d \u201cSlap Shot,\u201d \u201cSpectre\u201d (Oct. 21) \u201cTimecrimes,\u201d \u201cTraining Day,\u201d \u201c \u201d \u201cThe Warriors,\u201d \u201cThe Witches. \u201d \u2018Deadpool\u2019  Ryan Reynolds, in one of the year\u2019s biggest   hits, proves that it\u2019s O. K. to curse in a superhero movie. (Starting at 8 p. m. Oct. 1.) \u2018By the Sea\u2019  Angelina Jolie Pitt wrote and directed this beautiful, if languid, film in which she and Brad Pitt play a couple whose marriage is falling apart. And now we can all watch it. It\u2019s like HBO knew or something. (Starting at 8 p. m. Oct. 13.) Also of interest: \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d \u201cDrumline,\u201d \u201cEastern Promises,\u201d \u201cPoltergeist,\u201d \u201c\u201d \u201c  2. \u201d \u2018Carol\u2019  Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in a Todd Haynes movie. Ravishing. (Starting at 9 p. m. Oct. 8.) \u201845 Years\u2019  This British domestic drama has a   premise for such a quiet film. On the eve of their 45th anniversary, Kate and Geoff\u2019s domestic boredom is shaken by a letter announcing that the body of Geoff\u2019s former lover, who died after falling into a Swiss ravine decades ago, has been found in a melted glacier. This film consists primarily of the actors Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay talking and getting lost in their own private reveries and it\u2019s utterly gripping. (Starting at 7:15 p. m. Oct. 8.) Also of interest: \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d \u201cThe Descent,\u201d \u201cThe Original Kings of Comedy. \u201d \u2018Chance,\u2019 Season 1 Hugh Laurie, who played Dr. House in the series \u201cHouse\u201d plays Dr. Chance in a new series called \u201cChance. \u201d That\u2019s an amusing fact, but Mr. Laurie\u2019s new venture is nothing like Fox\u2019s hit \u201c   \u201d series. Here, he plays a San Francisco neuropsychiatrist in this dark and tense series that, like the novel it\u2019s based on, feels like a take on the Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo. \u201d (Starting at 7:15 p. m. Oct. 8.) \u2018Spectre\u2019 Daniel Craig starred in \u201cCasino Royale\u201d and \u201cSkyfall,\u201d two of the James Bond franchise\u2019s best entries. So maybe let\u2019s forgive him this   effort. Does it matter that it\u2019s silly for two people to take a train out into the middle of the desert when they look as good as they do above?

A 2009 article in The New York Times headlined \u201cThis Band Was Punk Before Punk Was Punk,\u201d reintroduced its music to the world. This 2013 documentary tells Death\u2019s fascinating story. Acorn\u201cCasanova\u201d (Oct. 3)  \u2014   This 2005   British TV movie stars David Tennant (the Doctor in \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d Kilgrave in \u201cJessica Jones\u201d) as the title character. As a reviewer for The New York Times wrote then, the film has \u201ca lively pace, a warm spirit, a contagious sense of fun, some very pretty   European settings and Peter O\u2019Toole as the title character in his later years. \u201d SundanceNow Doc Club\u201cThe Bureau\u201d (Oct. 3)  \u2014   This French series stars Mathieu Kassovitz (\u201cAm\u00e9lie\u201d) as an intelligence agent who returns to Paris after years undercover in Damascus. If you\u2019re looking for a smart, talky, foreign spy series (though one without much action) this one\u2019s for you.
