We want to dismantle all walls, from prison walls to border walls, from Mexico to Palestine. \u201d One of the march\u2019s   is Rasmea Odeh, a former member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) designated by the U. S. as a terrorist group. Odeh was arrested for her alleged involvement in two bombings in the late 1960s. Two Israeli university students were killed and nine more were injured. In 1980, Odeh was freed from an Israeli jail as part of a prisoner exchange deal, and a decade later emigrated to the U. S. She recently made headlines again after being charged with immigration fraud for lying about her terrorist background when applying for U. S. citizenship. In an oped published by the Guardian last month entitled, \u201cWomen of America: we\u2019re going on strike. Join us so Trump will see our power,\u201d Odeh and her cohorts urged the mobilization of women  \u2014   including trans women  \u2014   to strike against \u201cattacks on Muslim and migrant women, on women of color and working and unemployed women, on lesbian, gender nonconforming and trans women. \u201d Odeh has also been invited to deliver an address at the upcoming National Member Meeting for Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP). The leftwing organization said it was \u201chonored to feature the deeply respected Palestinian   \u2026     feminist leader,\u201d and added that the accusations against her \u201cstem from a context of     and   persecution by both the Israeli state and the United States, policies which are escalating under the Trump administration. \u201d JVP added that that her label as a terrorist is a concoction of \u201cIsraeli apartheid. \u201d At the JVP summit, Odeh will speak alongside Linda Sarsour, the     activist who made headlines for becoming the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration.'"}, "time": 1742563521.7055733}
