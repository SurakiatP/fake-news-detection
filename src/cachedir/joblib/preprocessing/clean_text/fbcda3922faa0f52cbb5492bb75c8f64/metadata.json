That\u2019s real cash, not some     valuation. (That figure is $68 billion.) It has done all this while still managing to remain a private company, and its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has insisted that a public offering is not coming soon. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure it happens as late as possible,\u201d he has repeatedly said. Consider this: When Amazon went public in 1997, it raised $54 million and was valued at $438 million. So what exactly is Uber doing with all that money? And what does it say about Uber  \u2014   and the financial markets  \u2014   that the company has turned most recently to selling the equivalent of junk bonds? Yes, Uber has to finance an   war to gain market share in China and India. But there is more to it than that: Uber\u2019s   is seemingly part of an unspoken strategy to mark its territory. Every time Uber raises another $1 billion, venture capital investors and others may find it less attractive to back one of Uber\u2019s many rivals: Didi Chuxing, Lyft, Gett, Halo, Juno. In other words, Uber\u2019s   efforts have seemingly become part of the contest: It\u2019s not just a rivalry over customers and drivers it\u2019s a war of attrition, a mad scramble to starve the competition of cash. At the moment, Uber\u2019s success has had the opposite effect: It has spawned a long list of rivals, big and little guys who say, \u201cWe can do it too. \u201d But over time, as the smaller competitors run out of cash  \u2014   after heavily subsidizing riders in an effort to steal business from Uber  \u2014   venture capitalists should be less inclined to put up even more cash to go up against Fortress Uber. Uber\u2019s   arms race comes against the backdrop of falling valuations for many Silicon Valley unicorns  \u2014   private companies worth $1 billion or more. So there\u2019s clearly a rush to take the money while it\u2019s still available. \u201cIt\u2019s not the second inning or even the sixth, it\u2019s the 14th inning in a   baseball game,\u201d Bill Gurley, the famed venture capitalist who has as a stake in Uber and sits on its board, warned on his blog about the state of Silicon Valley. He alerted investors about unicorns that come to them seeking funds: \u201cYou are not being invited to a special dance, you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort. \u201d The   industry has long been seen as a   game because of the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d: The more customers sign up for Uber, the more drivers sign up, making it tougher for rivals to mount competition. There will most likely be only one or two significant players in any given market. (More on that in a moment, because there might be some cracks emerging in that point of view.) The question is whether the financing game is   too. And the even larger question is whether Uber\u2019s   capital investments could ultimately act as a deterrent to investors who might consider supporting Uber\u2019s competitors: Will they look at Uber\u2019s balance sheet  \u2014   it has some $6 billion in cash just sitting there  \u2014   and throw up a white flag? So far, Uber is clearly winning the valuation game: It is worth more than virtually all of its rivals combined. But Uber still has formidable competition in the   arena: Didi, the market leader in China that is engaged in a   battle with Uber, just raised $7 billion,  some of which came from Apple. (Mr. Kalanick, too, was hoping to raise money from Apple and had planned to meet with executives at the iPhone maker the same week Apple announced its investment in Didi.) Perhaps strangely, several of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi in China, including BlackRock and Tiger Global, so it is hard to say that one service is deterring investment in the other  \u2014   at least not yet. (It is worth noting that among the investor class, some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.) Uber\u2019s most recent   effort  \u2014   focused on the leveraged loan market  \u2014   aims to avoid diluting the current base of shareholders. It has hired Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to sell about $2 billion in loans. By avoiding a traditional round of financing, the company also avoids the company having to risk trying to sell itself at an even higher valuation. Given the remarkably low interest rates, investors looking for yield may buy into Uber. Uber says it is profitable in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia  \u2014   if you factor out taxes and interest payments. The challenge for Uber is breaking into China and India, perhaps the two largest markets in the world. Uber is currently on track to lose about $2 billion annually in those markets as it heavily subsidizes customers and drivers to gain market share. That means that Uber will have to pay up for the financing. But if Uber\u2019s valuation continued to grow, it would be a bargain compared with the value of the equity. Uber is hoping to sell debt with a yield of about 4 or 4. 5 percent. Uber\u2019s I. P. O. will probably come to pass in the next three to four years. That\u2019s because some of the convertible debt it previously issued provides investors with a special discount if the company has not gone public by then. But by 2018 or 2019, at the rate Uber is going, who knows how much money Uber will have raised. It may need none. The question is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.'"}, "time": 1742561924.7018929}
