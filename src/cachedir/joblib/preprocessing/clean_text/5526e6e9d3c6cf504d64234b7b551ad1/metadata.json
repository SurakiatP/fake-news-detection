{"duration": 0.0802757740020752, "input_args": {"text": "'Netflix is following in the footsteps of Twitter, the NFL and the Democrat party with a brilliant strategy of insulting more than half the country in one fell swoop. Will they be as shocked as their   compatriots when they experience a harsh blowback to injecting identity politics into well  \u2026     everything? [I\u2019m referring of course to the announcement this week of a new original show, Dear White People, an adaptation of a 2014 movie by the same name. Basically it\u2019s an opportunity for spoilt brats of color to lecture ordinary Americans on how unconsciously racist they still are  \u2014   you know, just the sort of     that lost Hillary the election and makes decent people everywhere gag and heave and run for the hills.   I believe I\u2019ve pinpointed exactly why this show exists, and it isn\u2019t globalist liberals striking out in anger at Daddy\u2019s America. Instead there is a simpler answer to why such an astoundingly bad concept would be  : Netflix is desperately seeking a followup science fiction hit to Stranger Things, and an alternate timeline story of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidency, one in which every conceivable identity group is in open warfare with each other, is a natural candidate. That must be it, otherwise we must confront some depressing alternatives. Can it possibly be that a pitch meeting for a Netflix series can sound like this: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take the worst idea MTV ever had, add in a healthy amount of Buzzfeed and spice up the blend with the same disdain for regular Americans that drove the white working class away from the Democrat party and which makes even people on our own side of the political divide absolutely hate us! Yeah!\u201d Because, if you reject my vision of Dear White People as a kooky,     story, then you must presume that this pitch was met with a standing ovation in Netflix headquarters, not to mention a hefty production budget. That\u2019s even scarier than the Stranger Things monster. I\u2019m referring to Eleven by the way, the nameless     who was a good boy who didn\u2019t do nothing and was in the middle of turning his life around. Because the sort of people who commission shows like this are deeply stupid, they will no doubt interpret the reaction to this show as \u201cprecisely why the show is so needed. \u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. America hates it because America is tired of entitled brats on TV lecturing other people about Halloween costumes while turning a blind eye to the real causes of racial tension. Newsflash, Netflix: black people can be racist too. Many of them are. And by buying into the \u201clet\u2019s bash whitey\u201d narrative cooked up on college campuses, you\u2019re not helping to fix racism, you\u2019re just further underlining the differences between people, and buying into a wacky   ideology that says the color of your skin determines what you can and cannot say. It\u2019s ugly and hateful, and it\u2019s why Donald Trump is in the White House. (I have a dream that Americans will one day live in a nation where journalists, the entertainment industry and academics will not judge them by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.) The reaction on YouTube to Dear White People is clear, regardless of race. As of this writing, with just over 2. 1 million views, the video has 267, 000 dislikes to just 25, 000 likes. Some people are concentrating on the raw number of dislikes, which is impressive for a video in its first week, but not necessarily historic. The video may never match the   YouTube losers, like this video game trailer with 3. 4 million dislikes. But the raw number of dislikes isn\u2019t the story: the visceral rejection of Netflix\u2019s identity politics pablum is laid bare by the percentage of overall votes that its dislikes represent. An astonishing 91 per cent of the votes on the Dear White People announcement are negative. To put this in perspective, a mere 77 per cent of the votes on the diabolical Ghostbusters trailer were negative. Congratulations, Netflix, you\u2019ve made the worst movie I have ever seen look like it got a warm reception in comparison. I bet a bunch of Sony execs are partying right now. \u201cWe lost a ton of money and ruined our careers, but America hates someone even more than us!\u201d The 91 per cent ratio of dislikes truly puts the Dear White People announcement in rarefied air. Very few other videos have reached a similar level of disdain. (PewDiePie reached 94 per cent negative with a video called \u201cCan this video get 1 million dislikes?\u201d but I feel that was cheating.) In fact, one of the few major videos to top Dear White People is YouTube\u2019s own \u201cGetting Started with YouTube Heroes,\u201d a guide to the platform\u2019s odious \u201c \u201d system, despised by most users. An intensely disliked YouTube announcement video is not the end of this story for Netflix. A vocal group has sprung up on multiple social media platforms proclaiming the cancellation of their Netflix service over the series. Can you blame them? Americans who happen to be white or conservative are getting tired of being blamed for all of the world\u2019s problems by crybaby liberals. They don\u2019t want to hear it, let alone pay for the privilege of hearing it! I know some people are going to say: hey, isn\u2019t this just special snowflake behavior in reverse? And perhaps they have a point. But, you know, I can\u2019t get too upset about the Left being forced to swallow a dose of its own medicine for once, as I explained on a recent college tour stop.  And we should view this PR disaster in a wider context: social justice is tanking, and the public appetite for and tolerance of   identity politics coming to a juddering halt. Journalists and commentators like to describe America as \u201cdivided,\u201d as though these are just two sides moving further apart from each other. But actually, even liberals are losing patience with the crazies on their own side, such as online talk show host Dave Rubin, who recently announced that he has left the Left. The NFL took a serious ratings hit this season, in part thanks to politics. Based on the initial reaction from subscribers, Netflix may be about to experience the same. As we\u2019ve seen from the reaction to the Breitbart Kellogg\u2019s boycott, not to mention Trump\u2019s election, liberal America is getting a taste of what happens when conservatives are sufficiently irritated to come out in large numbers. As ever, the Left invents these tactics the Right perfects them. A subscriber boycott would be a big issue for Netflix stockholders, which includes everyone from your retirement fund to George Soros. Netflix has an astronomical   ratio of 340, which in simple terms means its stock price is predicated on massive continued growth and profitability. The last thing Netflix needs right now is to be shedding customers. Until now, Netflix was on an amazing run. It is the clear leader in streaming and even if their movie selection can be dodgy, they continue to achieve new heights with their original programming. This leaves us with one tremendous question: why piss off so many subscribers and potential subscribers? Is the temporary glow they gain from   that they are good liberals worth all this pain? Or is it that liberals simply never learn? My money is on the latter. And there\u2019s evidence I\u2019m right. The Daily Dot is labeling anyone who cancels Netflix over this as \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and \u201c \u201d. The avowed Marxists of the Left have invented a new form of economics. Let\u2019s call it   capitalism. It goes like this: \u201cSubscribe to Netflix or you are a white supremacist drink Starbucks or you hate Muslims. \u201d Good luck with that, lefties: conservatives already know how to vote with their dollars, and unlike you, Republicans actually have jobs. Also, unlike liberals who quit social media crying about harassment, conservatives don\u2019t come back to your brand two weeks later. Netflix will have to win back the customers it is currently alienating with radical ideas, such as entertaining shows that don\u2019t vilify people by race. Shocking, I know.
