Many are unwilling to share helmets with strangers, because of germs and stuff. And carrying a helmet at all times can be a burden. Luckily, a selection of foldable helmets has emerged to help solve the problem. This month, one such product, the EcoHelmet, won the 2016 James Dyson award. A cheap, recyclable helmet made from cardstock paper, the EcoHelmet was designed by Isis Shiffer, who will receive $45, 000 to \u201cfurther develop\u201d her invention. The helmet uses a honeycomb pattern to diffuse the impact of a blow, and Ms. Shiffer has said that it is as safe as a standard polystyrene helmet. But if you\u2019re unconvinced, there are other options. The Plixi helmet, from Overade, is more like a traditional helmet, and folds down to a more portable size. A collapsible option from a company called Closca has the added benefit of making you look like a character in a   epic. Helmets. org, a helmet advocacy program and nonprofit, has a handy list of foldable helmets, including whether they meet European and American safety standards. You can find that here.
