His Hooking Up article gives a birds-eye view of how feminism corrupted women, in a way that only a senior citizen who has seen it all can elucidate. \\nWhat I don\u2019t get is, why are gals bitching? This is the world they wanted. They clawed and scratched and burned their bras and had court cases and threw fits to get exactly what they have. They hated men because, they said, men weren\u2019t letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to. Men, or more likely their mothers, didn\u2019t let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hod-carriers and swearing like sailors. Finally men gave in and now women hate them for that . Whatever happened to gratitude? [\u2026] \\nSally Sue might have teeth like pearls and brains and perky tits and a wacky sense of humor and actually be quite a prize, but sex trumps art. If Sally didn\u2019t say Yes, she knew that Greta would. Women had commoditized themselves. It was a marvelous thing for the testosterone wads we think of as college boys. [\u2026] \\n\u201cAll you want is sex!\u201d \\n\u201cUh\u2026what else have you got?\u201d or \u201cSo what?\u201d \\nOr, \u201cMarriage? Why? Would sex be better? Would food taste better? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d \\nOr, \u201cMarriage doesn\u2019t make sense. Do you want to eat in the same restaurant all your life?\u201d \\nWomen weren\u2019t happen then and aren\u2019t happy now. Trying to please them will just sacrifice what you want while giving no guarantee that they\u2019ll be content, yet we still have beta males and white knights fighting among each other to appease the unappeasable. Will they collectively realize their folly? \\nMaybe a more relevant question is if we want them to wake up. When I\u2019m looting the Best Buy after a hurricane, I don\u2019t want to compete with other looters. It\u2019s possible the quality of goods I\u2019d be able to steal would be much less due to the competition.'"}, "time": 1742563395.536255}
