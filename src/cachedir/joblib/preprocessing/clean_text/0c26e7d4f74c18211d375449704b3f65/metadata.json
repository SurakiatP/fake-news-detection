The box, containing notes from his early life in Missouri was uncovered during a spring clean of the Twain family home in Connecticut, now a working museum dedicated to the literary legend. On one note, Twain wrote that \u2018golf is a good wank spoiled\u2019, casting considerable doubt on the commonly held view that he was comparing the sport unfavourably to a walk in the park. \\n\u2018Twain was a prodigious masturbator as a teenager, that much we know from published memoirs, and the extensive porn collection found under his mattress,\u2019 indicated Cecile De Mornay, Professor of American Literature at Oxford University. \u2018These new notes reveal much about the state of his mind \u2013 and his trousers \u2013 during his formative years. As he entered adolescence, it seems he struggled to find much privacy in the family home, so he would often sneak off to the local golf club to snap one out.\u2019 \\n\u2018The local toilets at the club provided him with a nice quiet space for him to bash his bishop,\u2019 continued De Mornay. \u2018Frustratingly for him, sometimes, other members of the golf club would spot him before he reached the toilets, and, understandably, they would invite him to join them for 18 holes, thus spoiling his regular bouts of self-discovery. A round of fourballs, rather than his preference for a solitary game with two balls and a wood, if you like.\u2019 \\nExperts suggest that this discovery will not be a long term stain on Twain\u2019s reputation, although the impact on his bedsheets is a different matter. \u2018Twain\u2019s place in the spotlight will come again\u2019, concluded De Mornay confidently. \u2018Although, with this new discovery, it is actually his come that is being placed under the spotlight.\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 12th, 2016 by chrisf Click for more article by chrisf ..
