I. secretary on FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans. \u201d And another four  \u2014   after Martha made the shattering discovery that her marriage to Clark Westerfeld, an alias of the K. G. B. agent Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) was mostly a sham  \u2014   to break viewers\u2019 hearts and be jettisoned off the series (maybe to Moscow). But Ms. Wright\u2019s career was just starting to soar. After roles in \u201cThe Accountant,\u201d the Ben Affleck feature, and \u201cSneaky Pete,\u201d the Bryan Cranston series for Amazon, she will make her Broadway debut in Lynn Nottage\u2019s \u201cSweat,\u201d beginning performances at Studio 54 on Saturday, March 4, which is transferring from the Public Theater. Ms. Wright plays Jessie, a factory worker in Reading, Pa. who finds herself pitted against her friends as jobs become scarce and society crumbles. \u201cThese are the people who maybe voted for Trump, or chose not to vote at all today,\u201d Ms. Wright said of the play, set in 2000 and 2008. \u201cLynn has put real people behind the numbers of whole cities evaporating, in a way. \u201d Ms. Wright, a subversively witty native of England\u2019s Lake District who lives in Harlem with her maltipoo, Luigi, talked about blooming late. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Will Martha be back this season? No comment. They\u2019ve told me that I can say something they\u2019ve said many times themselves: She\u2019s alive  \u2014   and if you\u2019re alive on \u201cThe Americans,\u201d there\u2019s always hope for you. Which is fair enough, but it\u2019s certainly something that everybody is dying to know. I\u2019m asked on a daily basis. Are you sick of the questions? No, it\u2019s  . I\u2019ve noticed just this real tenderness when they talk to me about her, their genuine concern and sympathy and empathy. It\u2019s quite lovely, because it didn\u2019t start out like that. Does a part like Jessie in \u201cSweat\u201d give you empathy for people whose politics may not reflect your own? With these people\u2019s stories, you can\u2019t help but see how they just did what they needed to do to survive, because nobody was listening to them. Nobody was going to help them. O. K. I now can understand and have empathy for this part of society. That\u2019s tremendous, right? That\u2019s what theater is supposed to do. And now you\u2019re making your Broadway debut at 40. [Sings] Yesss! I set the benchmark for myself about a year ago, actually, at the end of Season 4 of \u201cThe Americans. \u201d \u201cOK, when I\u2019m in a real part  \u2014   not a bit part  \u2014   on Broadway, that\u2019s when I can feel that I\u2019ve made it as an actor. \u201d It has been a long time coming. And some  \u2014   in fact, most  \u2014   never get to Broadway. This is true. That\u2019s a good attitude. Or on a Ryan Murphy show. You have another timely role, as Pauline Jameson, playing opposite Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon in his FX series, \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan,\u201d which begins Sunday. I am perhaps the single composite regular  \u2014   a little bit of all the women in the studio systems who were girl Fridays and very competent and able. She can hold her own with Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and she wants to have a future in the business. But it\u2019s 1962, so she\u2019s not in control of that for herself. I\u2019m not sure how far we\u2019ve come in 2017. It\u2019s funny  \u2014   I have a very big fourth episode, and the first part of it we filmed before the election, and there was a lot of this stuff that was very tongue in cheek at the time: \u201cYou know, some guys don\u2019t like the idea of a woman in charge. \u201d Then we went back [the day after the election] to shoot the rest, and it had a whole different gravitas to it. You\u2019ve described the show as a very   examination of aging in Hollywood. Susan Sarandon said that when she started, 40 was the cutoff, the hard line. That\u2019s it  \u2014   roll over and die. And that\u2019s certainly been pushed, specifically by people like Ryan Murphy. He\u2019s a real champion of women. I think there were 15 roles in this show for women over the age of 40. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys of \u201cThe Americans\u201d got awards love this year, though they didn\u2019t win. Whatever the competition is, it\u2019s not always the best person or the best work that wins. Meryl\u2019s only got three Oscars. It\u2019s clearly a flawed system. But I don\u2019t want to say anything here that\u2019s going to make sure I never get an award  \u2014   because I really want one! How do you get those amazing eyebrows? They\u2019ve had this much attitude since I was 5 years old.'"}, "time": 1742564269.9056454}
