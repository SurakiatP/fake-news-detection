[Listhaug said the left wing media \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about facts\u201d as long as right wingers are the target after writer and former newspaper editor Sven Egil Omdal claimed the Progress Party politician had never worn the crucifix before being appointed immigration and integration minister.  In a message posted to Facebook, alongside a picture of Ms Listhaug wearing the crucifix while speaking at the Oslo Symposium, the left wing journalist wrote: \u201cShe looks like a bishop even when she says that it \u2018has never been something for us\u2019 to live side by side with people from another culture. \u201cSylvi Listhaug is almost always seen wearing the cross now, and she is always talking about how important it is for her. But I\u2019ve been through all images in the Scanpix database in the period from 2001 to December 15, 2015, when she became immigration and integration minister. She does not wear the cross necklace on one of them. \u201d \u201cWould I say she\u2019s using the cross as a political prop to appeal to strange people who think xenophobia is a Christian virtue? Yes, I would,\u201d concluded Mr Omdal, who has weekly columns in four newspapers. Ms Listhaug hit back at what she called the \u201cvile attack\u201d accusing the \u201cmedia mogul\u201d of \u201cspreading fake news\u201d which the minister said Mr Omdal \u201cinvented to make me look evil and cynical\u201d. \u201cHe has received well over 1, 000 likes, many of them from journalists and media professionals on an outright lie\u201d she wrote to Facebook. She then pointed to three Scanpix photos from 2006 and 2007 attached to the post in which she can be seen wearing the crucifix, to disprove the journalist\u2019s claim. The minister described how the jewellery piece  \u2014   a gift from her grandmother who is nearly 100 years old  \u2014   means a lot to her. Ms Listhaug took aim at the leftist media, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder a growing number of people have seen through many of the leftist media and are relying less on journalists. \u201cThey have an agenda, which is attacking the right. They have no standards and they don\u2019t care about the facts  \u2014   everything is okay as long as I or the Progress Party is the target. \u201d Ms. Listhaug, who is Norway\u2019s first ever immigration and integration minister, received global press attention soon after taking up the post after she said that Jesus would support her party\u2019s tough stance on immigration. \u201cWhat Jesus cared about is you should help as many people as possible  \u2014   and that\u2019s not as many as possible in Norway,\u201d she said. She asserted it\u2019s possible to relieve the suffering of a lot more people in refugee camps in the Middle East rather than encouraging them to make a perilous journey across Europe.'"}, "time": 1742628504.7801683}
