The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life, or that\u2019s what she wants you to believe. \\nNow, I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture, specifically the \u201chiker\u201d she met. Memorize her face\u2026 \\nGot it? Okay, good. \\nNow what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice. Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture, taken in the 2000\u2019s, reminds you of anyone: \\nYeah, it is the EXACT SAME GIRL! \\nHer name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary. That\u2019s actually where the older picture was taken. \\nWow! That doesn\u2019t seem random at all, does it? \\nIt looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesn\u2019t know them. \\nAll I gotta say is, give it the Hell up, Hillary! You lost, nobody needs to see your \u201cchance encounters\u201d or other promotional propaganda anymore. This is exactly why Americans ended up hating you! \\nOh well, I guess you really cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Well, in that case all that\u2019s left to do is share this all across Facebook and the internet and expose yet another one of her Serial Lies! '"}, "time": 1742563828.6768215}
