Trump\u2019s real estate empire, and perhaps the most visible symbol of the ethical quandary he now confronts. The Trump International operates out of the Old Post Office Building, which the federal government owns. That means Mr. Trump will be appointing  the head of the General Services Administration, which manages the property, while his children will be running a hotel that has tens of millions of dollars in ties with the agency. He also will oversee the National Labor Relations Board while it decides union disputes involving any of his hotels. A week before the election, the board ruled against Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel in a case in Las Vegas. The layers of potential conflicts he faces are in many ways as complex as his   business empire, adding a heightened degree of difficulty for Mr. Trump  \u2014   one of the wealthiest men to ever occupy the White House  \u2014   in separating his official duties from his private business affairs. Further complicating matters are Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to name his children to his transition team, and what is likely to be their informal advisory role in his administration. His daughter Ivanka Trump joined an official transition meeting on Thursday, the day before Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was removed from his post leading the effort. Mr. Trump has said he will eliminate ethical concerns by turning the management of his company over to his children, an arrangement he has referred to as a blind trust. But ethics lawyers  \u2014   both Republicans and Democrats  \u2014   say it is far from blind because he would have knowledge of the assets in the trust and be in contact with the people running it, making it unlike a conventional blind trust controlled entirely by an independent party. \u201cTo say that his children running his businesses is the equivalent of a blind trust  \u2014   there is simply no credibility in that claim,\u201d said Matthew T. Sanderson, a Washington lawyer and Republican who has worked on the presidential campaigns of John McCain, Rand Paul and Rick Perry. \u201cYes, the American public elected him knowing he has these assets, but unless he deals with this properly there will just be a steady trickle of these    stories, and it could be a drag on his presidency. \u201d Mr. Trump, as part of his bid for the White House, released information about his financial holdings, which include more than a dozen hotels and golf courses commercial real estate space, including Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street in New York and marketing deals in the United States and abroad. But it is unclear how much information was not disclosed, in part because he declined to release even a summary of his tax returns  \u2014   becoming the first presidential candidate not to do so in 40 years. Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close adviser to Mr. Trump, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that excluding Mr. Trump\u2019s family from a role in his businesses \u201cwould basically put his children out of work. \u201d The public, Mr. Giuliani said, needs to trust Mr. Trump. \u201cYou have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThe man is an enormously wealthy man. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real fear or suspicion that he\u2019s seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn\u2019t have run for president. \u201d Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the transition, declined to respond to questions about possible conflicts of interest Mr. Trump might face as president. \u201cThe Trump Organization will respond accordingly,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump\u2019s company said in a statement that the Trump Organization was already working to address possible conflicts. \u201cWe are in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of the Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric Trump along with a team of highly skilled executives,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is a top priority at the organization, and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations. \u201d Previous presidents have encountered questions about their financial holdings. Lyndon B. Johnson, through his wife, continued to have ownership of television stations while he was president. George Washington enlisted the Treasury Department to help find a runaway slave. But presidents have often taken steps to prevent ethical questions. George Bush put his stock holdings into a blind trust after he was elected vice president, and Jimmy Carter turned his peanut farm over to a blind trust after he was elected. As president, Mr. Trump will be exempt from a federal ethics rule that prohibits government employees and members of Congress from taking actions that could benefit their financial interests. But the president still must comply with a law that requires annual financial disclosures of his assets. The first will not be due until May 2018, although President Obama filed one voluntarily during his first year in office. Experts said that even if Mr. Trump was exempt from some federal ethics rules, the public will expect him to not use his office to benefit his personal finances. \u201cHe has campaigned on a platform of getting rid of corruption and that Washington is broken and we need new, refreshing change,\u201d said Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, a nonprofit that pushes for accountability in government. \u201cAs president, the American public expects that Mr. Trump will be held to a higher standard. \u201d In a statement on Monday, the General Services Administration said that the agency realized it must examine its Old Post Office lease with Mr. Trump\u2019s   business \u201cto allow a path to be put in place to identify and address any potential conflict of interest. \u201d Also on Monday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called for an inquiry into how Mr. Trump will handle these potential conflicts. \u201cThe American people have the right to know  \u2014   they ought to know  \u2014   exactly whether decisions are possibly being made that would benefit him, his family and his associates directly,\u201d Mr. Cummings said in an interview. The labor dispute in Nevada represents another potential complication. The president appoints all five members of the National Labor Relations Board. But over the past year, the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas has been in a battle with the culinary workers union, at first challenging an effort by hotel employees to unionize. The labor board ruled  against him in July. Then the hotel, which Mr. Trump   refused to begin negotiations with the new union, and the labor board again ruled against it, in November. Other labor disputes with employees are pending. \u201cWill he as president of the United States of America use the power he has to interfere  \u2014   given that he has a financial interest in the outcome of these matters?\u201d said Bethany Khan, a spokeswoman for the   Culinary Workers Union Local 226 of Nevada. Perhaps most troubling for Mr. Trump, several ethics lawyers said, is a relatively obscure provision of the Constitution, called the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits any government official from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government, or even from sharing in profits in a company that has financial ties to a foreign government. Mr. Trump has had business deals with foreign governments or individuals with apparent ties to foreign governments, including   real estate arrangements in Azerbaijan and Uruguay. His children have frequently traveled abroad to promote the Trump brand, making trips to Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Scotland. Closer to home, the Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower and is a lender for another building in Midtown Manhattan where Mr. Trump has a significant partnership interest. \u201cDoing business with a foreign corporation, be it in Azerbaijan, Turkey or Russia, if is it owned in part or controlled by a foreign government  \u2014   any benefit that would accrue to Mr. Trump could well be a violation of the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution,\u201d said Kenneth A. Gross, a political ethics and compliance lawyer in Washington. There are also more general issues that could prove troubling. For instance, Mr. Trump will nominate the Treasury secretary, yet he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to banks, and he benefits from low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, an institution he has criticized as political. The head of the Internal Revenue Service is also appointed by the president, and the agency is currently auditing Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes and sets tax policy that directly affects his businesses. But it is Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate and financial holdings that represent the most sensitive ethical areas, the ethics lawyer said. Mr. Trump\u2019s children are already deeply involved in the daily operations of the Trump Organization. Ivanka is executive vice president for development and acquisitions, and is in charge of domestic and global expansion of the company\u2019s real estate interests. Ms. Trump also has her own clothing, jewelry and footwear lines. Even this week, Ms. Trump turned her appearance on Sunday on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d  \u2014   with her father  \u2014   into a marketing opportunity for her line of jewelry, with one of her employees urging reporters to write about the $10, 800 gold bangle bracelet she wore during the interview. Donald Jr. is also an executive vice president in the Trump Organization, and the company\u2019s website says he directs new project acquisition and development in regions \u201cfrom Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia, the Middle East to South America, mainland China to the United States. \u201d Eric is in charge of the Trump Organization\u2019s golf course collection. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in New York and we\u2019ll take care of the business,\u201d Eric Trump said in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that was broadcast on Sunday. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we\u2019re going to make him very proud. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561957.9772105}
