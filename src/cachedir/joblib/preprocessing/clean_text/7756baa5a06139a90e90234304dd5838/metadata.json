However, that\u2019s all coming back to haunt them as investigators uncovered what Hillary left behind in her hotel room which should disqualify her from the presidential race. \\nSince the start of the re-investigation into Hillary\u2019s emails and supposedly disappearing server, a slew of secrets have trickled out that leaves one to wonder how they were missed in the first place. It\u2019s recently been discovered what was found in her hotel room on a 2010 trip to Beijing, China, and it could result in dire consequences for our country. \\nFox News reported that when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to the orient with an unnamed \u201csenior aide\u201d six years ago, they brought classified information with them. As prior investigations into her e-mails have proved, tipsy Hillary has a hard time keeping track of highly sensitive documents, and these in China were apparently no different. The unidentified aide, whose job it is to manage these things, left the information unsecured in the hotel room. \\n\u201cIn May 2010, Secretary Clinton was on official travel in Beijing, China, accompanied by senior staff. Upon Secretary Clinton\u2019s departure, a routine security sweep by Diplomatic Security agents identified classified documents in a staff member\u2019s suite,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby told Fox News in a statement. \\nConfirmation of this mishandling comes out now as Hillary herself and her longtime senior aide, Huma Abedin, are being investigated for mishandling of sensitive information on a private server that she wasn\u2019t supposed to have. Although it\u2019s a matter of national security, Clinton and her crack squad can\u2019t seem to be trusted with anything of importance that puts our nation in jeopardy. \\nFor this reason, Hillary Clinton shouldn\u2019t even be considered for the White House where she would have full access to nuclear codes. Ironically, she said Donald Trump couldn\u2019t be trusted with these, yet he\u2019s not the one with thousands of \u201clost\u201d emails and classified documents left in a hotel room overseas.'"}, "time": 1742562201.0741594}
