Ryan Zinke (R. .) was confirmed by the Senate as Interior Secretary with strong bipartsan vote  . [Sixteen Democrats joined 51 Republicans with Sen. Angus King (I. ) who caucuses with Democrats, to vote for Zinke.  Zinke told Brietbart News on Wednesday he had a good time during his last his last session of Congress as a Member of Congress, checking in with his buddies and taking in the spectacle. \u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoyed the camaraderie and I can\u2019t wait to get to work. \u201d The president gave a great speech, he said. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I was in the audience and I think he hit it out of the park,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, the tone was more important,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me it was presidential. He did reach out, not just to Democrats and Republicans, but to Americans to find common ground on the big issues ahead of us. \u201d Going into the vote, Montana\u2019s only congressman said he was not worred that he would not be confirmed. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not particularly controversial, so I\u2019m very confident that I will be the secretary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do. \u201d Zinke said his new boss is looking for results. \u201cThe president holds people accountable. He is a man of action and all of us understand that we are there to do a job, roll up our sleeves and get to it. \u201d Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue said after the vote: \u201cCongressman Zinke is a great choice to lead the Department of the Interior. Under his leadership, I have full confidence that America will unlock its full energy potential. Congressman Zinke\u2019s experience and commitment to preserving our wildlife and natural resources make him uniquely qualified for the position. \u201d Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said on the Senate floor Tuesday having Zinke lead Interior was good for Alaska and good for America. \u201cNow, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about Congressman Zinke and he comes to this job with great qualifications,\u201d said the Marine Reserve lieutenant colonel and combat veteran of Afghanistan. \u201cHe\u2019s a patriotic and ethical man from a patriotic and ethical part of America: the American West. \u201d Sullivan said he cherished Zinke\u2019s military service and welcomes a man of the retired Navy commander\u2019s experience taking the helm at Interior. \u201cHe\u2019s a Navy SEAL who\u2019s dedicated his life to protecting our great nation,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a lifelong sportsman. He\u2019s a trained geologist. He\u2019s a strong advocate for energy independence. He has a keen interest in protecting our environment, while not stymieing more economic growth. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D. ) took to the Senate floor Tuesday and was one of the Democrats rising to oppose Zinke. \u201cWe need a Secretary of Interior who will protect our public lands, make investments to conserve our endangered and threatened species and who will continue to confront climate change,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cCongressman Zinke voted to block funding for any listed endangered species on which the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to conduct a   review,\u201d she said. \u201cIt did not seem to matter to Congressman Zinke that the reason why these reviews did not take place was because Republicans and Congress failed to appropriate the necessary funding to produce these reviews,\u201d she said. \u201cHis record and past statements demonstrate that Congressman Zinke is not the right person to lead the Department of the Interior at this juncture \u2014  at this critical stage, I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination,\u201d she said. In the end, Zinke\u2019s nomination did not generate the animus among Senate Democrats and their base of Democrats still trying to process what happened to their party Nov. 8. Not only is Zinke an engaging and gregarious politician willing to work with Democrats, as he did a number of times as a congressman, his ascension to the president\u2019s cabinet means he will not challenge Sen. Jon Tester (D. . ). Tester was considered one of the most vulnerable of the 23 Senate Democrats up in 2018. Tester won in 2012 with less than 50 percent of the vote in a state where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points, 56 percent to her 35 percent. All House vacancies must be filled by a special election and Montana state law prohibits the setting of a date for a special election until after the vacancy occurs. Democrat Gov. Steve Bullock is required to set the date for the special election within 100 days of Zinke\u2019s swearing in. Shortly after Zinke\u2019s confirmation, senators invoked cloture on the nomination of Dr. Ben Carson for Housing and Urban Development Secretary. The motion started the chamber\u2019s 30 hours of debate on the nomination, which should be voted on by the Senate Thursday morning.'"}, "time": 1742563470.294676}
