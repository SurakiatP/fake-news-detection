He entered hundreds of couples into the bonds of matrimony and comforted the bereaved at more than a thousand funerals. When Few is asked about his legacy at Gonzaga, where he has coached the past 28 seasons, he thinks about his father\u2019s accomplishments, and not how he has won far more basketball games than he has lost. But results do matter to Few. His charge is to win, and in his 18 years at the helm, he has presided over Gonzaga\u2019s ascension from spunky upstart to midmajor darling to certifiable contender. He does not need validation or vindication, but now that the Bulldogs have advanced to the first Final Four in their history, he has it. Until Saturday, when   Gonzaga clobbered Xavier,   in the West Regional final, Few had won the most N. C. A. A. tournament games (24) among coaches who had never reached the national semifinals. This best version of Few\u2019s best team played with fury and purpose, burying Xavier\u2019s bid to become the fourth No. 11 seed to reach the Final Four. Gonzaga ( ) made a dozen   and disrupted the Musketeers near the rim with a fierceness that Xavier had yet to encounter during its unlikely stampede to the round of 8. As a measure of Gonzaga\u2019s offensive efficiency, consider that it allowed more points before halftime than it had in any other game this season  \u2014   39  \u2014   and it still led by 10. That lead ballooned to 17 less than five minutes into the second half, and although Xavier\u2019s fans chanted, \u201cWe believe,\u201d they had no better luck forestalling the inevitable than its players did. Few has coached some superb teams, but none like this one, which has coalesced despite the fact that five members of its   rotation did not even wear a Gonzaga uniform last season. One transfer, Nigel   led Gonzaga with 23 points, and another, Johnathan Williams, added 19 points, 8 rebounds and 3 blocks and was selected as the region\u2019s most outstanding player. The arrivals of all these talented players, accustomed to taking many shots and scoring loads of points, could have crashed the program, but the players subjugated their egos.   praised Josh Perkins, another point guard, for welcoming him. \u201cWe know how good you are,\u201d Perkins said of the team\u2019s attitude, \u201cbut we can be so much better together. \u201d And here the Bulldogs are, going to the Final Four, where they will play next Saturday in Glendale, Ariz. against the winner of Sunday\u2019s East Regional final between Florida and South Carolina. To get there, Gonzaga overwhelmed a university that resembled itself  \u2014   a small Jesuit school with no Final Four experience where basketball, not football, drives the sporting culture. \u201cThere\u2019s no pro team there\u2019s no football team,\u201d Perkins said of Spokane, Wash. home to Gonzaga. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much it. We\u2019re the celebrities we\u2019re the role models. It\u2019s fun, but you\u2019ve got to win basketball games, or it\u2019s not so good. \u201d On Perkins\u2019s first day on campus, he was recognized at a Chipotle restaurant. That introduced him to the intensity of Gonzaga basketball fandom, which was on display not only at San Jose\u2019s SAP Center  \u2014   where fans packed several of the lower sections  \u2014   but also back in Spokane. After the game, players in the locker room passed around a cellphone showing scenes of people there jumping around. \u201cSpokane\u2019s lit!\u201d someone shouted. To Perkins\u2019s point, things have been good at Gonzaga far more often than they have not  \u2014   28 victories last season, 35 the season before, 29 in   32 in  . Aside from Gonzaga, only Wisconsin and North Carolina have reached the round of 16 the past three years. That consistency is the envy of so many programs, but that popular benchmark of greatness  \u2014   the Final Four  \u2014   had managed to elude the Bulldogs. They lost in their two previous regional finals, in 1999 and 2015, when they were underdogs, and the only other time they were seeded No. 1, in 2013, they lost to Wichita State in the second round. Gonzaga\u2019s strong alumni base remains close to the program. Former players, like Kelly Olynyk, Jeremy Pargo and Matt Santangelo, have sent out encouraging text messages: \u201cHey, we couldn\u2019t do it, so you guys do it. \u201d The Bulldogs did it by silencing a team that had trampled over one favorite after another, baffling   Maryland,   Florida State and, on Thursday,   Arizona with impenetrable defense. Gonzaga detonated that defense early and often. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re really good,\u201d Xavier Coach Chris Mack said. \u201cSometimes, you just lose to a better team. \u201d That was about as close as Mack has gotten this postseason to acknowledging that a better team existed than his Musketeers, who proved they were far better than their seeding might suggest. On Tuesday, before they flew to San Jose, Mack showed players a video clip of confetti cascading onto a court. He asked how badly they wanted to experience that themselves, and then a ladder appeared. The Musketeers acted out a traditional   celebration, hooting and hollering as if in a packed arena instead of their auxiliary gym. They then placed the strands in a jar that contained the detritus of another motivational ploy, the ashes from the burning of February calendars that the staff had printed  \u2014   with the results from Xavier\u2019s five straight losses that month, all to teams that went on to make the N. C. A. A. tournament. Mack tried willing that act into a sequel here, but soon after the buzzer sounded Saturday, after Gonzaga\u2019s players danced at center court, it was his counterpart who climbed the ladder. Few clipped the net, turned to the crowd and hinted at the possibilities in Arizona. \u201cMight as well win it,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561933.4911008}
