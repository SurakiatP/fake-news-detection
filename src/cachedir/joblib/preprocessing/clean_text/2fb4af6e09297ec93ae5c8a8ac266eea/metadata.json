He rejoiced when the effort failed, yet was dismayed when the bloc kept gathering more members and powers, anyway. At the time, Mr. Verrelle, a former soldier, was a prison director, but he eventually felt compelled to enter politics and joined the   National Front. When he was elected mayor of this small town in Provence eight months ago, the first thing he did was to take down the European Union flag from City Hall. \u201cIn 2005, a majority voted against Europe, and we still find ourselves in Europe, by magic,\u201d he said, \u201cand I find it inadmissible. \u201d Today the European Union is wobbling under the weight of problems encouraged in part by that unchecked expansion  \u2014   stagnant economies, the euro crisis, new pressures from Russia and deep strains over migration, especially from newer members in Central and Eastern Europe. But a visit to Le Luc and other villages in southern France is a reminder that the European Union faces yet another serious problem long in the making  \u2014   a crisis of legitimacy  \u2014   that is fueling   nationalist politics even in the traditional core of the bloc. For Mr. Verrelle, 2005 was a watershed. Since then, opposition to a   poorer and vastly more diverse European Union has only increased. So has support for the National Front and its leader, Marine Le Pen, who has emerged as a serious contender in France\u2019s presidential race. Having already suffered a \u201cBrexit\u201d vote this year in Britain, Europe faces a series of critical elections in the year ahead. But none is more important than the vote in France, a founding European Union member. The British decision to quit the European Union was a major blow, but a victory by Ms. Le Pen could be the death knell. And with the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States, that prospect has taken on new weight. \u201cDonald Trump makes Marine Le Pen sound reasonable,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a special adviser to the Foundation for Strategic Research in France and chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cHis victory gives her respectability. Everyone knows she\u2019s not Trump  \u2014   she knows how to use a noun and a verb and is intellectually coherent about what she wants and doesn\u2019t want. \u201d What Ms. Le Pen wants is to lead France out of the euro currency and out of the bloc. She has said she would hold a popular referendum, \u00e0 la Britain, on French membership in the European Union  \u2014   a test of public will that mainstream French politicians, she says, are afraid to have. From the mood here in southern France, a \u201cFrexit\u201d push would probably prevail in a referendum, just as 55 percent voted in 2005 against the Constitution that a former French president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, had drafted. The French \u201cnon\u201d killed the treaty, intended to create new federal institutions for a bloc enlarged the year before by 10 countries, mostly former   countries like Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. \u201cIn a way, Frexit already happened,\u201d said a prominent regional Socialist member of Parliament,   Ciot. \u201cEurope did not keep its promises, to create a world of wealth and full employment. \u201d \u201cPeople feel peace has been attained but fear that the rest of the world has come to undermine this wealth,\u201d Mr. Ciot added. \u201cThey fear Europe is not protecting them from these migrants who come to pillage and steal their wealth. \u201d Brexit, he said, is \u201cjust a symptom of the rest  \u2014   the feeling that we no longer share a common destiny. \u201d Since 2005, said Mr. Verrelle, southern France has been shifting steadily toward the National Front and its opposition to the European Union. In the last three elections, he said, \u201csupport has been growing systematically. \u201d The former prison director is scathing about the radicalization of young French Muslims and the dangers he says he believes that uncontrolled immigration poses to France. \u201cWhen I saw the prayers in the corridors of the prison, and others hiding their crosses, I knew we were lost,\u201d Mr. Verrelle said. \u201cWhat\u2019s most dangerous about Europe is the loss of borders, and today we see the result,\u201d he added, speaking of terrorist attacks and migrant flows. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Daesh,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing in a Trojan horse times 1, 000. \u201d As for the European Union, it has no clear political direction, Mr. Verrelle said, adding that it is too diverse economically for a single currency and too weak to allow freedom of travel. \u201cWe\u2019re in Europe against our will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a prison. It\u2019s not a solution that will last. \u201d About 90 minutes away, in La Tour d\u2019Aigues, overlooked by the ruins of a Renaissance castle demolished during the French Revolution, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front organized a protest against plans to bring about 30 teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan to the nearby town of Grambois. The protesters, fewer than 200, were met by about 300 counterdemonstrators holding up banners showing solidarity with the refugees, while 90 riot police officers, dressed in black protective clothing, ringed the two groups to keep them apart. Marion   Pen, a niece of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s and a rising star of the National Front, addressed the crowd from a makeshift podium, tossing her blond hair behind her. \u201cIt is not the hate of others, it is love for Provence, love for France,\u201d Ms.   Pen, 27, shouted into the microphone, as counterprotesters whistled and booed to try to drown her out. She railed against a \u201cdictatorial\u201d European Commission that \u201cworks to undermine national sovereignty. \u201d Asylum seekers coming to France receive generous payouts, she said, while the Vaucluse region, the home of La Tour d\u2019Aigues, is the sixth poorest in France, where one in five people are without jobs. \u201cWe are against this completely crazy plan to redistribute migrants,\u201d Ms.   Pen said in a brief interview after her speech. The European project \u201cis a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to build another Europe. \u201d The wave of anger and identity politics is washing over France, with the   instrument of a modernized National Front under Ms. Le Pen, 48. She has now become both a symbol and an agent of a kind of defensive French nationalism that is proving very popular, especially in the southeast and north, near the Belgian border. As the European Union struggles with fundamental issues of coherence, policy and solidarity, she has also become a plausible, if unlikely, president of France  \u2014   almost sure to make the   runoff for the post in May. Brussels is an easy target, especially for politicians like her seeking to blame domestic ills on some supranational agency. \u201cThere is huge disappointment with Europe,\u201d said Sylvie Goulard, a French member of the European Parliament for this region. \u201cBut a tendency to blame Europe for national competencies  \u2014   hospitals and nurses, malaise of the police, housing  \u2014   these are all   failures, nothing to do with Europe. \u201d The mood is worse in the south, Ms. Goulard said. \u201cI\u2019m from the south, and people are angry and frustrated,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you realize that lack of transportation or the failure to integrate foreigners are not the fault of Europe, but Le Pen is exploiting these issues. \u201d But even Ms. Goulard, who has announced her candidacy to become speaker of the European Parliament, acknowledges Brussels\u2019s many failures. It has not created functioning external borders, and its response to the migrant issue has caused severe strains among member countries and undermined solidarity. \u201cIt would be stupid to be too optimistic,\u201d Ms. Goulard said. \u201cBut we have tried to do something never done on earth, to get so many people to live and trade together in peace. \u201d There are some strong proponents of Europe, too.   Merger, president of the Maison de l\u2019Europe de Provence, the regional chapter of an association that supports the European Union and promotes European citizenship, said that it would be a tragedy to break up the union, and that young people now feel a European identity that must be strengthened. \u201cEurope is an idea, but it must be seen to be working,\u201d he said. One of the members of the chapter, Caroline Brun, 23, said: \u201cThis has been a tough year for our hopes. \u201d Many blame Europe for the migrants, she said, adding: \u201cBut it\u2019s not Europe. It\u2019s the fault of the politicians of European states who use Europe as a scapegoat. \u201d At La Tour d\u2019Aigues, even the town\u2019s Socialist mayor,   Lovisolo, expressed disenchantment. Europe has \u201cfailed to fight for a European identity,\u201d he said. The monetary and economic union that underpins Europe did not translate into a closer political and social union, he said, \u201cand Europe is not working. \u201d Ms. Le Pen\u2019s supporters could not agree more. \u00c9douard, a former colonel who served in Kosovo who declined to give his surname, said at the rally that \u201cwe have not seen the benefits\u201d of Europe. \u201cMy generation was told, \u2018You are European,\u2019 and there was great hope and excitement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that translated into a recession. It has been a terrible disappointment. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628565.3182669}
