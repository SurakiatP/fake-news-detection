He belongs in jail for \u201cwaging his war\u201d against the United States by exposing its secrets, the conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity has said of him. An \u201c  operative with blood on his hands,\u201d Sarah Palin once called him. Yet last week brought the sight of Mr. Hannity speaking with Mr. Assange in glowing terms about \u201cwhat drives him to expose government and media corruption\u201d through Clinton campaign hacks that American intelligence has attributed to Russia. And Ms. Palin hailed him as a great truth teller, even apologizing for previous unpleasantries. (Cue sound of needle sliding across record album.) O. K. the fact that WikiLeaks\u2019   splash was bad for the Democrats and good for   Donald J. Trump may have a   bit to do with their change of heart. But what\u2019s up with Mr. Assange, who seems equally comfortable being a hero of the American left as he is being one of the American right, or even of Russian Putinists? What does he want, anyway? The answer has been in front of us all along. And the current imbroglio over Russia, WikiLeaks and their role in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory  \u2014   or, more to the point, Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss  \u2014   might be viewed as the realization of the vision Mr. Assange had when he started WikiLeaks over a decade ago. Mr. Assange spelled it out in prescient terms in an essay he posted online in November of 2006, the year of WikiLeaks\u2019 founding. He wrote it long before becoming the polarizing figure he is today, a \u201ccypherpunk\u201d folk hero with an outsize reputation for being messianic, impetuous and all too cavalier with the personal data that come his way. (He\u2019s currently living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he was granted asylum from Swedish authorities who are investigating a rape accusation against him that he says is false and politically motivated.) Yet even his toughest critics acknowledge how clearly he saw the politically disruptive potential of technology, back when some of us were getting our first BlackBerries. It\u2019s what prompted him to start WikiLeaks, which \u201cpioneered something extremely important and very dangerous to large organizations that keep lots of secrets digitally,\u201d as the journalist Glenn Greenwald told me in an interview last week. From the start, Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks\u2019 prime directive was to expose hidden data sets that \u201creveal illegal or immoral behavior\u201d in government and big business. But in the essay he also wrote in more ambitious terms about forcing regime change through data and technology rather than through the old, barbaric means of assassination. As Mr. Assange saw it, power was held by vast networks of conspirators who shared vital information in secret, giving them a superior understanding of reality that enabled them to hold on to power. The technology revolution, he wrote, was providing the conspirators with the means to achieve what he called an even \u201chigher total conspiratorial power. \u201d But it was also making them more vulnerable to sabotage, so that a governing conspiracy could be \u201cslowed until it falls, stupefied unable to comprehend and control the forces in its environment. \u201d As an example, he pointed to \u201ctwo closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings,\u201d the Democratic and the Republican Parties in the United States. \u201cConsider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence  \u2014   let alone the computer systems,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other. \u201d The essay got new attention when WikiLeaks, working in tandem with The Guardian, The New York Times and other outlets, released extensive diplomatic cables in 2010, making WikiLeaks more of a household name. No one seemed to grasp what Mr. Assange was hinting at more clearly than the conservative writer John Sexton, who foresaw the events of 2016 in a post that was published on Breitbart News and his own blogin 2010. \u201cYou can take his example further by imagining what would happen to, say, the D. N. C. if it suffered a massive Wikileak of secret data,\u201d Mr. Sexton wrote, referring to Mr. Assange\u2019s essay. \u201cIt seems entirely possible that a leak of the contents of their email for one month would be exceedingly damaging to them. \u201d And here we are, over six years later. Mr. Assange\u2019s essay has resurfaced yet again, after major data breaches of the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton adviser John Podesta, committed, allegedly, by   hackers and fed to the world via WikiLeaks. Clinton aides have said the breach impeded their ability to communicate electronically afterward, causing them to resort to holding more   meetings. But far more damaging were the spilled secrets. They forced the resignations of the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie   and of the interim chair, Donna Brazile, from her analyst job at CNN. And they provided Mr. Trump with a steady stream of fresh,   data points, which WikiLeaks fed out incrementally, creating a running story that the American news media voraciously seized upon. Political scientists will debate for years to come how decisive the leaks were in the election outcome. But the emails were undeniably in the mix of an election decided by fewer than 100, 000 votes in three key swing states. So, in the end, one political party was technologically compromised in a way the other wasn\u2019t, and that party did indeed \u201close to the other. \u201d It\u2019s a straight line from Mr. Assange\u2019s initial essay. But if WikiLeaks\u2019 disclosures abetted Mr. Trump, how does that square with Mr. Assange\u2019s goals to undercut \u201cauthoritarian conspirators\u201d and create incentives for \u201cmore humane forms of governance\u201d? Mr. Trump was less transparent than Mrs. Clinton was during the campaign (we\u2019re still waiting for those tax returns) and he made a number of   statements (\u201clock her up! \u201d) that were unique to modern American politics. A WikiLeaks journalist, Sarah Harrison, recently wrote in The Times that WikiLeaks was a news organization committed to disclosing vital information, not picking political sides. Mr. Assange addressed the question differently in an interview last month with the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi of La Repubblica. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the United States,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump and his allies, he said, \u201cdo not by themselves form an existing structure, so it is a weak structure which is displacing and destabilizing the   central power network within D. C. \u201d That, he said, could herald change, both good and bad. A weak power network in Washington, of course, is just what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wanted to see, too. Given Russia\u2019s own authoritarianism and opacity  \u2014   try independent journalism there, if you dare  \u2014   it\u2019s a wonder and, for some, cause for suspicion that it\u2019s not a bigger WikiLeaks target. Mr. Assange told Repubblica that while he had released plenty of   documents, WikiLeaks has no staff members who speak Russian. And he told my Times colleagues Jo Becker, Steven Erlanger and Eric Schmitt last summer that Russia was \u201ca bit player\u201d on the world stage compared with the United States and China. (Their article showed how WikiLeaks\u2019 releases often benefited Russia at the expense of the West despite American assessments that it is likely not directly tied to Russian intelligence services). Though Mr. Assange does not as a rule reveal sources, he has repeatedly said he is confident that the Clinton campaign and D. N. C. email caches that WikiLeaks received did not come from a \u201cstate party. \u201d He maintains that the United States has failed to offer conclusive proof of the Russian government\u2019s direct role, and he is not alone. On Friday, The Intercept, a news outlet   by Mr. Greenwald  \u2014   who led the Guardian team that shared a Pulitzer Prize in 2014 with The Washington Post for coverage of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations on mass surveillance  \u2014   declared the intelligence report \u201cunderwhelming. \u201d Mr. Greenwald has been highly critical of mainstream news reports that, in his view, have been too quick to accept intelligence reports pointing to Russia\u2019s role. That has added to the fun house mirror aspect of the latest Assange turn, given that Mr. Greenwald\u2019s past work was celebrated by people who are so solidly opposed to Mr. Trump now. But Mr. Greenwald has long criticized mainstream American journalists as being too credulous with government intelligence claims (see \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d). Unlike, perhaps, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Palin, he is being consistent. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the political earth around me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the same thing has happened to Julian. \u201d That earth is still shifting. Where Mr. Assange turns up on it next is anyone\u2019s guess.'"}, "time": 1742561801.889491}
