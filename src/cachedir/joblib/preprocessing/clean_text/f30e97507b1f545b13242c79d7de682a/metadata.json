A major law firm was hired to investigate. Two weeks later, Mr. Ailes was gone, ousted from the network he ran for two decades. Rupert Murdoch stepped in as chairman, sending a clear message: This is a fresh start. But the grim tales about life under Mr. Ailes keep coming. More women have come forward  \u2014   the latest was a former daytime host, Andrea Tantaros  \u2014   describing a culture of intimidation and misogyny, and telling of settlements they received to leave the network. Some of Mr. Ailes\u2019s top deputies who remain in charge at Fox News have been accused of aiding his behavior. Inside the newsroom, employees are still on edge about what new stories might surface and which executives could be ensnared. If the Murdoch family wanted to leap ahead of this scandal, it is now at risk of falling behind. Some people at Fox News are asking if meaningful change can occur inside a workplace still stocked with loyalists to Mr. Ailes. \u201cPeople are waiting to see,\u201d one staff member said. Leaders at 21st Century Fox, eager to contain the fallout from Mr. Ailes\u2019s departure  \u2014   and keep the profitable news network humming during a   election  \u2014   have remained quiet amid the new accusations. The company is also facing scrutiny over whether it knew, or should have known, about Mr. Ailes\u2019s alleged behavior. \u201cWhat this has illustrated quite well is, if it wasn\u2019t understood before, there was clearly a corporate control problem with respect to Fox News,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research in New York. A spokesman for 21st Century Fox, Nathaniel Brown, said in a statement on Wednesday, \u201cThe fact is, we have a robust compliance structure and strong controls embedded across our company. \u201d In response to questions about the claims of a hostile work environment made by other female employees after Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, Mr. Brown said: \u201cWe have demonstrated a willingness to act. \u201d The calculus for Mr. Murdoch and his management team is, to say the least, complex. Officials at 21st Century Fox think that removing Mr. Ailes sent an unequivocal signal  \u2014   to employees and the outside world  \u2014   that the company is taking harassment concerns seriously. They say that lawyers from Paul, Weiss are pursuing an aggressive internal investigation. Investigators so far have been focused on accusations of improper behavior by Mr. Ailes, not by others, according to people briefed on the inquiry. But the people have said the investigation is also looking at others who might have known of that behavior and not acted on it. Several women who have come forward with accusations said that investigators had not contacted them. In an interview, Ms. Tantaros, a former daytime host, said that the former chairman, in    meetings, complimented her figure, asked questions about her dating life and requested a hug, making her uncomfortable. Ms. Tantaros said that Fox News managers dismissed her complaints, then demoted her. Fox News officials denied this, saying that Ms. Tantaros was removed after publishing a book without previous approval, a breach of contract. \u201cThe real issue that makes women so fearful and so afraid is what comes next,\u201d she said. \u201cAt Fox, you have a company that not only sexually harasses, but is willing to empower its executives and use company resources to carry out ongoing harassment in the form of retaliation. \u201d Complicating matters for 21st Century Fox, Ms. Tantaros claimed that several Ailes lieutenants ignored her concerns, including the current general counsel, Dianne Brandi, and Bill Shine, a veteran producer who is now overseeing Fox\u2019s newsroom alongside Mr. Murdoch. Ms. Tantaros said in the interview that she complained about Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior and subsequent retaliation to Mr. Shine, who she said told her, \u201cDon\u2019t fight this. \u201d Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Shine replied: \u201cAndrea never made any complaints to me about Roger Ailes sexually harassing her. \u201d Ms. Brandi also disputed Ms. Tantaros\u2019s assertion. Mr. Shine is a popular figure with some of the network\u2019s veteran anchors. Removing Mr. Shine, temporarily or not, could reagitate the newsroom just as the fall presidential campaign begins, with tens of millions of dollars in advertising on the line. Corporate governance and ethics experts say that 21st Century Fox and its board ought to have been aware of problems involving sexual harassment accusations at the network, as well as any payouts related to them. If the parent company was unaware of the settlement, it would indicate \u201clax oversight,\u201d Lucy P. Marcus, a corporate governance expert, wrote in an email. \u201cIf they had been aware of it, they should have investigated it years ago. The board and executive team needs to dig deeper into the culture to root out the cliques and culture that allowed this to carry on for so long. \u201d Of particular issue is a $3. 15 million settlement that Laurie Luhn, a former booker at the network, said she received in 2011. In an interview with New York magazine, Ms. Luhn said that Mr. Ailes forced her into a yearslong sexual relationship. Executives at 21st Century Fox have said they were only made aware of the settlement recently. On Wednesday, when asked to clarify exactly when it learned of it, the company declined to respond. \u201cOne would hope that a $3 million settlement for sexual harassment would flow up the line to somebody in corporate management,\u201d said Kirk O. Hanson, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. \u201cAt least today, that kind of settlement should come to the attention of the audit committee of the board. \u201d Mr. Hanson added: \u201cThe question is, did they have procedures in place to look at issues like this? And secondly, did they have someone try to report this that was then quashed by Rupert Murdoch or anyone else?\u201d Fox News officials said that Ms. Tantaros reported accusations of sexual harassment  \u2014   and not directed toward Mr. Ailes  \u2014   only after she was informed that she was in breach of contract for publishing a book, featuring a provocative cover, without advance approval. Barry Asen, an outside counsel for Fox News, said in an interview that the network investigated her claims and found them baseless. \u201cWe wound up interviewing 12 or 15 people, all of whom denied everything she was alleging,\u201d Mr. Asen said. Ms. Tantaros maintains that she was within the terms of her contract and that the network is using it as an excuse to diminish her complaints about sexual harassment. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox, is a global corporation, with $27. 3 billion in revenue and thousands of employees. Some on Wall Street have appeared unbothered by the scandal, which merited little mention on a recent earnings call. \u201cMost investors would just hope that there wasn\u2019t a bigger problem and move on to the next thing,\u201d said Mr. Wieser, the media analyst. The company\u2019s stock closed on Wednesday at $25. 58 a share, down nearly 8 percent since Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster.'"}, "time": 1742563590.98616}
