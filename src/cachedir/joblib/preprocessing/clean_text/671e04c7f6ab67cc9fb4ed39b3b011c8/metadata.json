Though the showing of the Bison didn\u2019t stop the corrupt police attacks it did bring a renewed sense of purpose to the tired but motivated crowd. \\nThe Bison is a potent symbol of Native American heritage. In a blog post about the incident, Davidica Littlespottedhorse explained the legend of the bison by stating : \u201cThe great bison or buffalo of North America is a very powerful symbol to American Indians. Though best suited to cooler climates, bison roamed virtually in entire continent. The smaller woodlands bison and its bigger cousin, the plains bison were revered and honored in ceremony and everyday life. To the plains Indian, our Bison Brother meant sacred life and the abundance of the Creator\u2019s blessing on Mother Earth. The bison is powerful medicine that is a symbol of sacrifice and service to the community. The Bison people agreed to give their lives so the American Indian could have food, shelter, and clothing. The Bison is also a symbol of gratitude and honor as it is happy to accept its meager existence as it stands proud against the winds of adversity. The bison represents abundance of the Creator\u2019s bounty and respect for all creation knowing that all things are sacred.\u201d \\nThe moment was awe inspiring. Take a look for yourself. \\nFeatured Image Via Prairie Edge/ Ray Tysdal About Stephanie Kuklish \\nI am a 30 something writer passionate about politics, the environment, human rights and pretty much everything that effects our everyday life.
