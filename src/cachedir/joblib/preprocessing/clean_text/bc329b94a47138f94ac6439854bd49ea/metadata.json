Will, a conservative columnist and prominent Republican pundit for the past 40 years, said he has left the Republican Party because Donald J. Trump is the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. Mr. Will revealed his decision on Friday in an interview with PJ Media. He said he had switched his party registration to unaffiliated this month, adding that Republicans should \u201cgrit their teeth\u201d during a Hillary Clinton presidency and then hope to beat her in 2020. \u201cThis is not my party,\u201d Mr. Will said in a speech on Friday at the Federalist Society before the PJ Media interview. Mr. Will has criticized Mr. Trump throughout his presidential run. \u201cOnly he knows what he is hiding by being the first presidential nominee in two generations not to release his tax returns,\u201d Mr. Will wrote in his Washington Post column on Wednesday. \u201cIt is reasonable to assume that the returns would refute many of his assertions about his net worth, his charitableness and his supposed business wizardry. They might also reveal some awkwardly small tax payments. \u201d Mr. Trump has returned fire, denouncing Mr. Will often on Twitter and in his speeches. \u201cYou know he looks smart because he wears those little glasses,\u201d he said at a rally in November. \u201cIf you take those glasses away from him, he\u2019s a dummy. \u201d Few prominent conservatives have gone so far as to change their party registration since Mr. Trump clinched the nomination in May. But some have strongly condemned Mr. Trump and have said they will sit out the presidential race.'"}, "time": 1742563012.1115866}
