Putin against critics who called him a killer. Now, Mr. Trump is in a diplomatic clash with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, his administration accusing Moscow of trying to cover up a Syrian chemical weapons attack on civilians and his secretary of state delivering    ultimatums. Even in a presidency marked by unpredictability, the   shift from coziness to confrontation has left Washington and other capitals with a case of geopolitical whiplash. The prospects of improving   relations were already slim given the atmosphere of suspicion stemming from Kremlin meddling in last year\u2019s election, but the d\u00e9tente once envisioned by Mr. Trump has instead deteriorated into the latest cold war. For Mr. Trump\u2019s camp, the abrupt turnaround simply proved how false the conspiracy narrative was from the start. \u201cIf there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie,\u201d said Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son. For some critics, it seemed to be a cynical way of distracting attention from the multiple investigations into possible contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russia even as Moscow was trying to help Mr. Trump win the presidency. Either way, it suggested that the relationship between the two powers could be volatile in the months to come, subject to the impulsive reactions of a president with no prior experience in foreign policy, the often strident responses of a Russian leader given to his own moments of pique and the clashing national interests of both countries in key areas around the world. \u201cI was skeptical from the beginning that it would be possible for the United States and Russia, after all that happened in the last few years, to engage in a successful reset,\u201d said Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer on Russia now at Georgetown University. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is how quickly we returned to the status quo ante we had at the end of the Obama administration. \u201d John R. Beyrle, a former ambassador to Moscow, said the extremes of the relationship were being exaggerated and it would probably settle back into the middle. \u201cLevels of trust have deteriorated so much that these initial meetings will produce little in the way of agreements and the investigations into likely Russian interference in the election cast a huge shadow that both sides need to acknowledge,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump is the fourth president in a row who came into office determined to reboot the relationship with Moscow, an ambition that often eluded the other three. The difference is that the hacking of Democratic email during last year\u2019s election, for which intelligence agencies blamed Russia, made Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Putin politically problematic. His willingness to overlook Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, its armed intervention in eastern Ukraine and, until now, its support for President Bashar  \u2019s government in Syria mystified many experts. He called Mr. Putin \u201ca stronger leader\u201d than President Barack Obama, praised him for \u201cdoing a great job\u201d and expressed hope that he would be \u201cmy new best friend. \u201d Michael Morell, a former acting C. I. A. director, wrote last fall that Mr. Trump seemed to be an \u201cunwitting agent of influence\u201d for Moscow. By Tuesday, after Mr. Trump ordered a missile strike against Syria in retaliation for using chemical weapons on its own people, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson arrived in Moscow with a harsh warning that Russia had better give up its support of Mr. Assad. He was greeted with a cold shoulder, denied a meeting with Mr. Putin as no secretary of state has been on a first visit to Moscow going back to the days of Cordell Hull in World War II. Back in Washington, the White House held a briefing accusing Russia of shielding Syria\u2019s chemical weapons attack on civilians. The Russians have responded with harsh language of their own. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin compared Mr. Trump\u2019s action in Syria to President George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. And Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev suggested that Mr. Trump has turned out not to be what he presented himself to be during last year\u2019s campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he wrote on Facebook last week. \u201cThe last remaining election fog has lifted. \u201d In the end, he said, Mr. Trump was \u201cbroken by the existing power machine\u201d in Washington. Mr. Morell said on Tuesday that despite calling Mr. Trump a virtual Russian agent, he always believed Russian behavior would lead to a parting of the ways. \u201cThis seems to be happening now,\u201d he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has left it to Mr. Tillerson and others rather than speaking out himself. \u201cHe needs to do that, and he needs to be critical of the large number of other aggressive actions that Putin has undertaken over the past two years,\u201d Mr. Morell said. Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign last year, said the shift in tone in recent days did not mean there was not collusion during the election. \u201cEverything we believed happened in the election could be true  \u2014   Putin wanted him to be president and the administration took the action it took last week,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could all be part of the master ruse  \u2014   or Putin could be upset about it. \u201d Either way, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that it changes anything I think happened in the election or that Democrats should back off investigations. And moreover, it\u2019s really weird that he himself hasn\u2019t said anything. \u201d Mr. Trump will have the opportunity on Wednesday when he hosts NATO\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. European leaders will be listening to what Mr. Trump has to say, given that during the campaign he criticized NATO even as he praised Mr. Putin. Aides to Mr. Trump have been frustrated at the focus on the Russia investigations and the assumptions that the president\u2019s associates did something wrong even though several officials have said no evidence has emerged that proves collusion with Russia. They blame the media for creating a false narrative that they see as now disproved. How, they ask, could Mr. Trump\u2019s team have made secret deals with Russia if his own secretary of state cannot even get a meeting? \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we went from all of these direct links to Russia to now are we disappointed that we can\u2019t even get a meeting with him,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. \u201cThere is a bit of irony in the question. \u201d Eric Trump voiced that sentiment in an interview with London\u2019s Daily Telegraph published on Tuesday. The younger Mr. Trump said his father was influenced to retaliate against Syria for using chemical weapons on civilians in part by his sister Ivanka, who was \u201cheartbroken and outraged\u201d by the atrocity. Even though some question the president\u2019s approach to Russia, Eric Trump said his father would not be \u201cpushed around\u201d by Mr. Putin. \u201cHe is not a guy who gets intimidated,\u201d he said. The    over Russia left lawmakers trying to make sense of it. \u201cIt speaks to the broader incoherence of this administration\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe change in rhetoric on Russia is  . I\u2019m glad to see it and I hope it continues, but so far the only thing we know about this administration\u2019s foreign policy is that it will probably change in a week or two. \u201d But Mr. Murphy said the congressional intelligence committees still need to investigate what happened in last year\u2019s election. If the shift in tone from the administration happened two months ago, he said, it might have undercut that determination. But since then, he said, more evidence has emerged. \u201cThere\u2019s now some pretty important meat on the bones of this story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe imperative remains to get to the bottom of it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628332.8694212}
