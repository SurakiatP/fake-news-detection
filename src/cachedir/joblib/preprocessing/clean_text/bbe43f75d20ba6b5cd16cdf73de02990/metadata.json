Mark Kirk (R-IL) for his U.S. Senate seat in Springfield, Illinois, Kirk mocked Duckworth\u2019s ancestry, saying in rebuttal of her comments on the true cost of war, \\n\u201cI had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\u201d \\nHis remark came in response to her statement that, \u201cMy family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution. I am a Daughter of the American Revolution.\u201d \\nWatch courtesy of Deadspin : Senator Mark Kirk mocks disabled Iraq war vet Tammy Duckworth in debate for her mixed-race heritage: https://t.co/3Znpd2Uvfq pic.twitter.com/cpWYBKri4l \\n\u2014 Deadspin (@Deadspin) October 28, 2016 \\nKirk, of course, has claimed to receive military honors he did not, in fact, receive. For him to attack Duckworth is not only the height of hypocrisy but mocking her ancestry is appalling. \\nThe Republican position, as restated here by Kirk, is that it\u2019s okay to come from another country as long as you\u2019re white. Neither Kirk nor his campaign has apologized. Kirk has said Trump should quit over his misogynist comments; apparently, it\u2019s okay to make racist comments. \\nWhen Duckworth said her family had served since the American Revolution, she wasn\u2019t joking, and she set Kirk straight in a tweet : My mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution #ILSEN pic.twitter.com/ehEBHswFMs \\n\u2014 Tammy Duckworth (@TammyforIL) October 28, 2016 \\nThe Illinois senator has unendorsed Donald Trump, one malignant clown calling another a malignant clown , and this latest move has given Kellyanne Conway a rare opportunity to gloat, tweeting , The same Mark Kirk that unendorsed his party's presidential nominee and called him out in paid ads? Gotcha. Good luck. https://t.co/IV7miL317s \\n\u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 28, 2016 \\nWith a single sentence, Mark Kirk proved you don\u2019t have to support Donald Trump to be a deplorable.\""}, "time": 1742563165.7890782}
