The budget takes a meat cleaver to public education. \u201d  Trump\u2019s budget hurts the working poor. From taking a meat cleaver to pub ed to job cuts, this is wrong. #SkinnyBudget https:  .   \u2014   Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 16, 2017,  Weingarten and public education advocates have condemned Trump\u2019s push since the end of his campaign for school choice programs as a means to bring about social justice for families living in   areas. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos worked in her home state of Michigan to develop school voucher programs that allowed parents to use taxpayer funds to have their children attend public charter, private and religious schools. Trump\u2019s nomination of DeVos signaled his pivot toward school choice as the primary theme of his education agenda. Teachers\u2019 unions especially say that school choice will draw taxpayer funding away from traditional public schools and toward public charter schools as well as private and religious schools. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget calls for an increase in federal spending on school choice programs by $1. 4 billion, ultimately reaching an annual total of $20 billion. Additional spending in 2018 on school choice would include: A $168 million increase for charter schools, $250 million for a new private school choice program, and a $1 billion increase for Title I, dedicated to encouraging districts to adopt a system of   based budgeting and open enrollment that enables Federal, State, and local funding to follow the student to the public school of his or her choice. \u201cThe budget also includes both   and   voucher programs that further an ideological crusade against public education,\u201d Weingarten said during the press conference. She continued: What we have here is what we feared when Betsy DeVos was nominated for this job. That  \u2014   just like she did in Michigan  \u2014   she tried to defund public schools with the aim of destabilizing and destroying them, and then lifting up other things that had really shoddy  \u2026    track records. That\u2019s exactly what the Title I portability proposal does. It\u2019s a   voucher scheme which, frankly, was expressly rejected in the recently enacted bipartisan federal education law. Trump\u2019s budget plan also calls for either eliminating or reducing \u201cover 20 categorical programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds. \u201d Among those programs mentioned are: Striving Readers, Teacher Quality Partnership, Impact Aid Support Payments for Federal Property, and International Education programs. The plan also eliminates $3. 6 billion in support for programs for instruction support, before and   and summer programs  \u2014   all of which the blueprint observes, \u201clack evidence\u201d of meeting the goals of improving student achievement. Overall, Trump\u2019s budget for next year offers $59 billion in discretionary funding for the federal Department of Education, an amount the plan says represents \u201ca $9 billion or 13 percent reduction below the 2017 annualized CR level. \u201d More than $1. 2B on vouchers  backdoor vouchers, while $1. 2B cut to   programs.

And you can\u2019t just have a   with HBCUs and not create more funding for them. These schools have been under austerity for years, and if they\u2019re going to compete with others, they definitely need more funding. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563148.6734226}
