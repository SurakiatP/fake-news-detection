For 40 years, Giannecchini, 62, had used the talcum powder for feminine hygiene, but stopped when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three years ago. Now her lawyers say Giannecchini has an 80% chance of dying in the next two years, despite having undergone extensive treatment. \\nCarol Goodrich, a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson, says the company will appeal to the decision . \\n\u201cWe deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will appeal today\u2019s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\u201d \\nAdditionally, research into the link between talc and cancer have been been mixed or inconclusive, according to the American Cancer Society . \\nThat likely factored into a New Jersey judge\u2019s decision to throw out two lawsuits against Johnson in Johnson in September, which alleged that the company\u2019s talcum powder had caused their ovarian cancer.
