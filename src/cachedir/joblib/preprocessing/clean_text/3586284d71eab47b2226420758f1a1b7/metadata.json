[\u201cToday, Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, a U. S. citizen and former member of the U. S. Air Force, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) a designated foreign terrorist organization, and obstruction of justice,\u201d announced the Department of Justice (DOJ) noting that News Jersey resident was convicted in March 2016.  U. S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis sentenced the wannabe jihadist on Wednesday. \u201cI am a black man, I am a military man, I am a Muslim man,\u201d Pugh told the judge on the day of his sentencing before dissolving into tears, reports the New York Post. \u201cI protected this country and the Constitution,\u201d added the military veteran. \u201cAnd my service was repaid by stripping me of my career, shaming my wife, shaming my parents, shaming my children. \u201d Judge Garaufis did not express any sympathy towards Pugh. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about whether you\u2019re Muslim or Christian or Jewish,\u201d the judge told the defendant before handing down his decision. \u201cThis is about whether you\u2019re going to stand up for your country, which has done so much for you, or betray your country. \u201d \u201cYou made your choice,\u201d proclaimed the judge. \u201cI have no sympathy. \u201d In January 2015, Pugh traveled to Turkey from Egypt to cross the border into Syria and engage in jihad on behalf of ISIS. Turkish authorities denied the American Air Force veteran entry and returned him to Egypt. Pugh attempted to destroy evidence in Istanbul. \u201cForeign government officials quickly deported the defendant to the U. S. where the FBI closely monitored him, relying in part on a covert undercover employee who encountered the defendant at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City,\u201d notes the DOJ. Authorities arrested Pugh on January 16, 2015, in New Jersey. In a letter drafted before he left Egypt for Turkey, the defendant proclaimed: I am a Mujahid. I am a sword against the oppressor and a shield for the oppressed. I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State. There is only 2 possible outcomes for me. Victory or Martyr. \u201cDefense attorney Susan Kellman likened her client\u2019s interest in the Islamic State to a kind of \u2018voyeurism\u2019 but noted that there had been no evidence of any form of communication between Pugh and the group,\u201d points out the New York Post.'"}, "time": 1742563119.7175117}
