Trump took to Twitter to assert that the Times \u201cwrites total fiction\u201d about him, while White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that the president does not even own a bathrobe. More serious matters have been leaked as well, such as descriptions of Trump\u2019s call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Trump apparently said a U. S.  deal on refugees, agreed to by President Obama, was \u201cthe worst deal ever,\u201d and told Turnbull their conversation was \u201cthe worst call by far\u201d among several he had held with world leaders that day. \u201cThere have been a ton of leaks. It seems that everyone has their own leaking apparatus,\u201d said one of the dismayed Trump allies. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it affects morale, but it is certainly a distraction. They have 55 firehoses aimed at them. Enough of the palace intrigue!\u201d  The Hill reports on speculation the leaks are part of a struggle for supremacy between White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon (formerly of Breitbart News). \u201cInsiders\u201d shot this theory down as an \u201coversimplification,\u201d arguing that Priebus and Bannon get along much better than the press tends to portray them. Another theory is that knives are coming out for White House press secretary Sean Spicer, whose friends are presumably pushing back to protect him. The Huffington Post proposes that the leaks are coming from veteran officials who are \u201calarmed by the president\u2019s conduct,\u201d because while some of the leaks are \u201cbased on opposition to his policies,\u201d many others \u201cappear motivated by a belief that Trump\u2019s words, deeds, and Tweets pose a genuine threat. \u201d Actively sabotaging an administration one is supposedly concerned about would be a remarkably selfish and even dangerous strategy, which makes it entirely plausible for Washington lifers. The Huffington Post implies that \u201cwidespread leaks and warnings from the national security establishment\u201d over Steve Bannon\u2019s membership in the National Security Council might have played a role in the Yemen raid that went wrong on January 29th. The American people should feel no sense of appreciation or gratitude for those who put American troops in jeopardy and harm our national interests because they want leverage over the president. CNBC cites the advent of an encrypted messaging platform called SecureDrop during the 2016 election cycle, plus the increasing use of various other secure communication systems, as one reason for the high volume of leaks. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to name a news organization that has not gotten in touch with us about installing SecureDrop in the past six weeks,\u201d Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said of his organization\u2019s popular tool. He said he thought \u201cgeneral fear that Trump could turn the U. S.\u2019 surveillance on the press\u201d combined with \u201cunrest\u201d in the administration was driving interest in SecureDrop. That\u2019s an interesting contrast with how the press managed only a few days of outrage after President Barack Obama really did turn government surveillance systems on them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible that a combination of leaks, and whistleblowers and investigative journalism eventually lead to the downfall of Trump,\u201d Timm added. There might be some manufactured drama in all that talk of encrypted communications. As Randy Evans of the Republican National Committee pointed out to the Huffington Post, leakers aren\u2019t usually caught by wiretapping or email monitoring. The preferred method is the \u201c  test,\u201d in which bits of juicy information are given to suspected leakers, and the boss watches to see which tidbits turn up in the press. President Trump himself has blamed the leaks on \u201cObama people\u201d left over from the previous administration, in particular citing his leaked phone conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that they leaked because it\u2019s very much against our country.  It\u2019s a very dangerous thing for this country,\u201d Trump told Fox News.'"}, "time": 1742563558.7510228}
