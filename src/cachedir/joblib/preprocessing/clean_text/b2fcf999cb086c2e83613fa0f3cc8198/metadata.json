They made a computer simulation of the universe. And it looks sort of like us.\\nA long-proposed thought experiment, put forward by both philosophers and popular culture, points out that any civilization of sufficient size and intelligence would eventually create a simulation universe if such a thing were possible.\\nAnd since there would therefore be many more simulations (within simulations, within simulations) than real universes, it is therefore more likely than not that our world is artificial.\\nNow a team of researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany led by Silas Beane say they have evidence this may be true.\\nIn a paper named \u2018Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation\u2019 , they point out that current simulations of the universe \u2013 which do exist, but which are extremely weak and small \u2013 naturally put limits on physical laws.\\nTechnology Review explains that \u201cthe problem with all simulations is that the laws of physics, which appear continuous, have to be superimposed onto a discrete three dimensional lattice which advances in steps of time.\u201d \\nRead also: Scientists Believe They Have Discovered A Parallel Universe That Interact With Our World! \\nWhat that basically means is that by just being a simulation, the computer would put limits on, for instance, the energy that particles can have within the program.\\nThese limits would be experienced by those living within the sim \u2013 and as it turns out, something which looks just like these limits do in fact exist. For instance, something known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin, or GZK cut off, is an apparent boundary of the energy that cosmic ray particles can have. This is caused by interaction with cosmic background radiation. But Beane and co\u2019s paper argues that the pattern of this rule mirrors what you might expect from a computer simulation .\\nNaturally, at this point the science becomes pretty tricky to wade through \u2013 and we would advise you read the paper itself to try and get the full detail of the idea.\\nBut the basic impression is an intriguing one.\\nLike a prisoner in a pitch-black cell, we may never be able to see the \u2018walls\u2019 of our prison \u2014 but through physics we may be able to reach out and touch them.\\nWATCH WHAT ELON MUSK SAYS ON THIS SUBJECT: The post Physicists Leak Evidence That Supports Elon Musk\u2019s Theory \u2013 The Universe Is A Simulation appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628422.959269}
