C.  \u2014   Tom Perez, former Barack Obama labor secretary and establishment Democrat, was elected as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Atlanta on Saturday as the party slid into chaos over the course of nearly six hours. [While Perez made history Saturday becoming the first Latino leader of the Democratic Party, those present experienced,   the deepening of divisions that have mired their party since Election Day.  Perez\u2019s win was indicative of the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to heed the voices of its constituents\u2019 calls for change. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a major problem\u201d if Perez wins, Jane Flemming Keeb, chair of the Nebraska Democrats, said in an interview with The Young Turks. Former Bernie Sanders for President campaign manager called Perez a \u201ccandidate of the insider\u201d: Jeff Weaver says if @TomPerez (\u201dcandidate of the insider\u201d) wins DNC race, it\u2019ll \u201dsend a horrible message to millions  millions of people.\u201d  \u2014   Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) February 24, 2017, Perez called for a motion to suspend the DNC rules as he called to appoint Keith Ellison deputy chair of the DNC. The motion, met with overwhelming approval, was granted. \u201cThe silence is deafening. The motion passes,\u201d Perez said in the absence of any \u201cnay\u201d votes after those assembled voiced their \u201cayes. \u201d Perez received 235 votes, while Ellison received 200. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who endorsed Ellison, congratulated Perez on his victory but implored him to steer away from his establishment roots: At a time when Republicans control the White House, the U. S. House, U. S. Senate and   of all statehouses, it is imperative that Tom understands that the     is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before. Now, more than ever, the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1 percent and lead this country forward in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justice. However, one of the key issues on Sanders\u2019 platform, removing the use of lobbyist funds and its influence in politics, fell on deaf ears. A measure that would have reinstituted a ban on corporate lobbyists lining the pockets of the DNC to buy influence, was voted down. The measure was initially put in place by former President Barack Obama: Dems punt on reinstituting corporate lobbyist donations,  \u2014   Jonathan Easley (@JonEasley) February 25, 2017,  The fight over the measure signaled the fight between the Sanders wing of the party and the more   wing. The measure to ban corporate lobbyists was introduced by Christine Pelosi, daughter of House Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( ): We\u2019re not giving up! Already hearing from colleagues ready to give corp $ ban another go with new #DNCChair + officers. #marchon #persist https:  .   \u2014   (((sfpelosi))) (@sfpelosi) February 25, 2017,  Following the vote, outgoing and interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile declared, \u201cWe are Democrats!\u201d Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2019s daughter, Rev. Bernice King, spoke directly after the Democrats voted to keep corporate lobbyist money in the party. She implored the Democratic Party to unify, saying that it\u2019s \u201cno secret there\u2019s division even within this camp\u201d and asked party members to \u201clay aside those things that divide you to find common ground. \u201d After telling the story of a little boy whose father asked him why he was laughing as they both sat in a boat with a hole on its side in the middle of the water, King said, \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the boat called these United States of America. \u201d Her message seemed to suggest that if one wing of the Democratic Party goes down, so will the other. Brazile delivered her final speech as party leader. \u201cThe Trump administration must be investigated, and please continue this work\u201d probing the \u201cRussian hack of the election,\u201d she said. The drama continued as Ellison\u2019s team allegedly presented false information to garner votes: Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race and did not endorse a candidate. However, Ellison\u2019s campaign made false claims that they had Buttigieg\u2019s endorsement: Buttigieg confronted Ellison personally backstage to complain about text sent to DNC members saying he supported Ellison. https:  .   \u2014   Greg Krieg (@GregJKrieg) February 25, 2017,  Congratulations to newly elected DNC Chair @TomPerez  \u2014   looking forward to joining you and all who share our values to grow our party!  \u2014   Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) February 25, 2017,  Saturday\u2019s vote was largely seen as a litmus test for the party\u2019s style of leadership going forward the vote for Perez represents the Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton wing, which is seen as more establishment. However, Ellison\u2019s appointment as deputy chair maintains the base of the progressive wing of the party, which includes Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ). Labor did not back Perez. Several of the unions that endorsed Ellison over Perez were the American Federation of Teachers the National Education Association the Service Employees International Union the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and UNITE HERE, a union representing thousands of culinary and hospitality workers. The Republican National Committee issued a statement on Perez\u2019s victory. \u201cThe Democrat Party has lost touch with the American people. Voters spoke loud and clear last November that they wanted a change in Washington and to reverse the failed policies of the last eight years. \u201d It continued: By selecting a D. C. insider, Democrats only create deeper divisions within their own party by pushing a far left agenda that rejects a majority of their base outside Washington. The DNC would be   to learn from two straight election cycle losses, encourage the leaders in their party to listen to what the voters want, and get to work with Republicans to fix the mess they created. In his victory speech, Perez touted the notion of unity. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he said, as he called on his fellow Democrats to fight \u201cthe worst president in the history of the United States. \u201d \u201cWe need a chair who cannot only take the fight to Donald Trump, but make sure that we talk about our positive message of inclusion and opportunity and talk to that big tent of the Democratic Party,\u201d he said.
