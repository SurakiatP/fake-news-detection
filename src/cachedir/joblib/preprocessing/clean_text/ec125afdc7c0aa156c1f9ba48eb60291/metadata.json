This is the question I ask myself all the time. When are we going to start treating racism like a disease? That\u2019s my problem. When do we start treating racism like a disease? Because right now, think about it, if you look at an alcoholic, we go this person has a problem, and we treat you   \u2026     I\u2019m just saying. There was a time you would say, oh you\u2019re just a drunk. Now we say you\u2019ve got a problem. We need to help you. I think it\u2019s the same with racism. \u201d \u201cRacism is hereditary,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s passed down. You teach it to your children. It grows generation to generation, and you have to know that you have it inside you, you\u2019re susceptible to it. But if we treat it like a disease we wouldn\u2019t shun people. I don\u2019t understand how we think it\u2019s going to change when we go \u2018You are a racist, get out of here.\u2019 Then where do they go and why would they change? All you\u2019re doing is piling people into a group who then go, \u2018I guess we\u2019re all racists now,\u2019 and then it stops having the effect that you want. Do you want them to change or do you want to maintain a higher ground?\u201d Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo'"}, "time": 1742628508.4661286}
