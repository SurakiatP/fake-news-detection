Trump, has dropped another   remark about a different figure in the news: the N. F. L. football player Colin Kaepernick and his protest surrounding the national anthem. In an interview published on Monday by Yahoo News, Justice Ginsburg said that the San Francisco 49ers quarterback\u2019s move to kneel and not stand during the anthem, as a protest against police brutality and racial oppression, was \u201cdumb. \u201d The gesture has been adapted by other professional athletes and has even spread to high school teams. When asked by the news site\u2019s global anchor, Katie Couric, what she thought of the protest, Justice Ginsburg said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really dumb of them. Would I arrest them for doing it? No. I think it\u2019s dumb and disrespectful. \u201d \u201cI would have the same answer if you asked me about  . I think it\u2019s a terrible thing to do,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to arrest people for conduct that doesn\u2019t jeopardize the health or   of other people. It is a symbol they are engaged in,\u201d she said. Asked whether she meant it was their right to protest, Justice Ginsburg agreed. \u201cIf they want to be stupid, there\u2019s no law that should be preventive,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said. \u201cIf they want to be arrogant, there\u2019s no law that prevents them from that. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that. \u201d Justice Ginsburg\u2019s indignant dissents in the court have made her a sort of heroine of the left. But the    jurist has also earned the nickname \u201cNotorious R. B. G\u201d for her outspoken comments off the bench. Shannon Sharpe, a former professional football player who is now a   on the show \u201cUndisputed\u201d on Fox Sports, said, however, that while Justice Ginsburg had been a good champion for minority causes, she should be careful in expressing her opinions. \u201cI would ask Justice Ginsburg that when you see a man crying, don\u2019t tell him to stop crying. Ask him, say, \u2018Sir why are you crying?\u2019 \u201d he said. Mr. Sharpe added, \u201cWe are seeing far too many unarmed black men dying at the hands of police with no accountability taking place. \u201d As of Tuesday, Mr. Kaepernick had not publicly reacted to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s remarks. But his protest came to light on Aug. 26, when the national anthem played before the start of a preseason game with the Green Bay Packers. He did not stand, later explaining that he had decided to remain seated as a statement against racial oppression. \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d he told N. F. L. Media. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,\u201d he said. He drew swift backlash, with critics, including Mr. Trump, excoriating him for the protest. But the protest expanded, with more athletes joining him  \u2014   at professional arenas and on high school sports field. President Obama said it was Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s constitutional right. On the athlete\u2019s Twitter feed, he has curated a timeline of events that have been part of the recent national discourse about race, politics and police behavior, including a protest by white supremacists in front of the N. A. A. C. P. headquarters in Houston, an article about how Arizona teenagers were forced by their school to change out of their Black Lives Matters shirts, and stories about fatal police shootings. \u201cThere are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,\u201d Mr. Kaepernick has said. Mr. Kaepernick will be the starting quarterback against the Buffalo Bills at New Era Field this Sunday, the 49ers head coach Chip Kelly, said on Tuesday according to WKBW. Justice Ginsburg\u2019s remarks to Ms. Couric were the latest to draw some criticism beyond the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court. In July, she criticized Mr. Trump, at the time the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be  \u2014   I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be  \u2014   with Donald Trump as our president. \u201cFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be  \u2014   I don\u2019t even want to contemplate that. \u201d She later expressed regret. \u201cJudges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office,\u201d she wrote in a brief statement issued by the court, admitting her remarks were \u201cill advised. \u201d \u201cIn the future I will be more circumspect,\u201d she added in the statement. When Mr. Trump came up in the Yahoo interview  \u2014   Ms. Couric asked for her thoughts on his remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States  \u2014   the justice declined to answer, saying there was a real possibility that the issue could land on her desk. \u201cI can\u2019t answer a hypothetical question when it may turn into a real question,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said. \u201cI can\u2019t preview my decision. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628300.2817957}
