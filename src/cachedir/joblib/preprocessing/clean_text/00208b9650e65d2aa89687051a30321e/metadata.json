The size of individual deployments from different nations is unclear, but there will be four battalions, and the US is expected to provide the majority. \\nWith all these troops headed to the Baltic coast, reports out of Russia\u2019s media suggest that they are planning some new warship deployments into their Baltic Fleet, with an eye toward enhancing their targeting capacity along the shore.
