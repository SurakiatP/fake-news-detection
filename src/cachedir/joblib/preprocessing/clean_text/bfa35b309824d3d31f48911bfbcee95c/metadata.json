Stay glued to your phone or TV or set your alarm for 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). That\u2019s when West Coast polls close and history suggests a winner\u2019s declared. It was bang on the hour in 2008, and 15 minutes later in 2012. \\nOf course, if you go further back in history, 2004 was a nailbiter. I remember very well going to bed after the Kerry campaign said they\u2019d challenge the result based on Ohio, and getting up in the morning to find out they\u2019d caved. And of course election 2000 was what it was. \\nThere will be many sites tracking the results as they come in; here\u2019s Politico\u2019s for the presidency (they also have the House and the Senate). It\u2019s impossible to know which one is the best until data actually appears; I prefer maps with results as they come in by county. And speaking of counties\u2026 \\nThe final RCP averages put Clinton ahead in the national popular vote by 3.3%. However, with Trump ahead in Florida (0.02%), North Carolina (1%), and Clinton only ahead by 0.5% in New Hampshire, it still looks like a horse race, to me. (Of course, I may have become counter-suggestible to the idea that Clinton has it in the bag because almost the entire political class is yammering that she does.) \\nAnyhow, if indeed this is a horse race \u2014 and if our famously free press doesn\u2019t simply decide to call it \u2014 we\u2019ll be up late waiting for county data in the states that are close (presumably swing states like Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire).
