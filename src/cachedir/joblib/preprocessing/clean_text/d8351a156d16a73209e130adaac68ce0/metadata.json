[A poll conducted by Morning Consult reveals that more SNL viewers want the   NBC show to move on from lampooning Trump than want the sketch comedy show to keep \u201cribbing\u201d the president.  While 33 percent of respondents say they \u201cwould like to see more\u201d Trump skits on SNL, 19 percent say they \u201cenjoyed\u201d the jokes but \u201cwould like SNL to focus on something else. \u201d Another 16 percent say they have \u201cnot enjoyed the impersonations of the members of President Trump\u2019s administration. \u201d Perhaps oddly, 31 percent of respondents did not have an opinion. In total, 35 percent of SNL viewers want to see new    skits compared to the 33 percent who want more. The disparity is within the survey\u2019s two percentage point margin of error. Ironically, Donald Trump\u2019s political rise coincided with a surge in SNL\u2019s ratings. After slumping in late November, the sketch comedy show\u2019s ratings spiked in February to its highest level in six years. The rise in ratings came thanks to Melissa McCarthy\u2019s impersonation as White House press secretary Sean Spicer, and Alec Baldwin\u2019s record 17th outing as host. Baldwin first debuted his Trump impression during the 42nd season premiere of SNL and has continued to appear on the show to skewer the president.
