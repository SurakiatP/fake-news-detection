Just don\u2019t call them accidents anymore. That is the position of a growing number of safety advocates, including   groups, federal officials and state and local leaders across the country. They are campaigning to change a    mentality that they say trivializes the single most common cause of traffic incidents: human error. \u201cWhen you use the word \u2018accident,\u2019 it\u2019s like, \u2018God made it happen,\u2019 \u201d Mark Rosekind, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said at a driver safety conference this month at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cIn our society,\u201d he added, \u201clanguage can be everything. \u201d Almost all crashes stem from driver behavior like drinking, distracted driving and other risky activity. About 6 percent are caused by vehicle malfunctions, weather and other factors. Preliminary estimates by the nonprofit National Safety Council show deadly crashes rose by nearly 8 percent in 2015 over the previous year, killing about 38, 000 people. Dr. Rosekind has added his voice to a growing chorus of advocates who say that the persistence of crashes  \u2014   driving is the most dangerous activity for most people  \u2014   can be explained in part by widespread apathy toward the issue. Changing semantics is meant to shake people, particularly policy makers, out of the implicit nobody\u2019  attitude that the word \u201caccident\u201d conveys, they said. On Jan. 1, the state of Nevada enacted a law, passed almost unanimously in the Legislature, to change \u201caccident\u201d to \u201ccrash\u201d in dozens of instances where the word is mentioned in state laws, like those covering police and insurance reports. New York City adopted a policy in 2014 to reduce fatalities that states the city \u201cmust no longer regard traffic crashes as mere \u2018accidents,\u2019 \u201d and other cities, including San Francisco, have taken the same step. At least 28 state departments of transportation have moved away from the term \u201caccident\u201d when referring to roadway incidents, according to Jeff Larason, director of highway safety for Massachusetts. The traffic safety administration changed its own policy in 1997, but has recently become more vocal about the issue. Mr. Larason, a former television traffic reporter, started a blog called \u201cDrop The A Word\u201d and has led a campaign to get major media outlets to stop using the term. Last year, he enlisted supporters to join with   groups in urging The Associated Press to clarify how reporters should use the word \u201caccident. \u201d In April, The A. P. announced a new policy. When negligence is claimed or proven in a crash, the new entry reads, reporters should \u201cavoid accident, which can be read by some as a term exonerating the person responsible. \u201d (The New York Times\u2019s style guide does not take any position on the terminology.) But use of \u201caccident\u201d has its defenders, as Mr. Larason discovered in 2014 when he posted his thoughts on the word in a Facebook group popular among traffic reporters. \u201cWhy can\u2019t human error be an accident even if the error is preventable,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cWhat is being solved by having this debate? What injustice are we correcting?\u201d And when Mr. Larason suggested to officials at the Virginia Department of Transportation that they stop using \u201caccident,\u201d he received a note saying that drivers are familiar and comfortable with the word. Virginia officials also wrote that drivers might not consider a minor incident to be a \u201ccrash,\u201d and so the change could be confusing. Mr. Larason counters that accident is simply the wrong word. \u201cI\u2019m betting it\u2019s one of the most commonly used words that is used inappropriately,\u201d he said. On Facebook, he posted a   definition that describes accident as \u201can unexpected happening\u201d that \u201cis not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured. \u201d The word was introduced into the lexicon of manufacturing and other industries in the early 1900s, when companies were looking to protect themselves from the costs of caring for workers who were injured on the job, according to Peter Norton, a historian and associate professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s department of engineering. The business community even developed a cartoon character  \u2014   the foolish Otto Nobetter, who suffered frequent accidents that left him maimed, immolated, crushed, and even blown up. The character was meant to warn workers about the risks of inattention. \u201cRelentless safety campaigns started calling these events \u2018accidents,\u2019 which excused the employer of responsibility,\u201d Dr. Norton said. When traffic deaths spiked in the 1920s, a consortium of   interests, including insurers, borrowed the word to shift the focus away from the cars themselves. \u201cAutomakers were very interested in blaming reckless drivers,\u201d Dr. Norton said. But over time, he said, the word has come to exonerate the driver, too, with \u201caccident\u201d seeming like a lightning strike, beyond anyone\u2019s control. The word accident, he added, is seen by its critics as having \u201cnormalized mass death in this country,\u201d whereas \u201cthe word \u2018crash\u2019 is a resurrection of the enormity of this catastrophe. \u201d These days, the pressure to change the language stems partly from aggrieved families using social media like Facebook clubs and Twitter to lobby for change. Safety advocates often post Twitter messages to journalists and policy makers, urging them to stop using \u201caccident\u201d to describe a crash. When New York City changed its policy in 2014, it did so partly in response to such   efforts, including from a group called Families for Safe Streets. The group is led by parents like Amy Cohen, whose son, Sammy, was run over and killed in Brooklyn in 2013. She helped start a campaign called \u201cCrash Not Accident,\u201d and said that the drivers in deadly wrecks should not be given the presumption of innocence just because they have lived to tell their side of the story. \u201cWhose story do you have at the time of the crash? The driver! The victim is dead,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cThe presumption should be to call it a crash, which is a neutral term. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564430.1992438}
