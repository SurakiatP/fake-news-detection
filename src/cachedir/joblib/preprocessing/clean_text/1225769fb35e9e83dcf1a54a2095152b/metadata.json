S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem despite pressure against such a move. [\u201cI think this is a historic trip,\u201d said Huckabee. \u201cHe made the first ever flight from Riyadh to Tel Aviv. We had the first sitting U. S. president go to the Western Wall and offer a prayer. I think that is incredibly significant. \u201d  Huckabee said that Trump has been \u201cvery vocal in his support for Israel and I think that the people here sense it. \u201d Continued Huckabee: I also hope with all my heart that he will keep his campaign promise to move the U. S. embassy. I know there is enormous pressure for him not to do that. The rationale is that it will make certain people unhappy. Whoever those people are, they are unhappy already. They are not going to be made happy by the location of the U. S. embassy. Huckabee said Trump\u2019s visits to Israel and Saudi Arabia have demonstrated that a \u201cvery strong America is much better than a weak America. This is so incredibly different from the eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s administration. \u201d \u201cThe reception that Trump received in Saudi Arabia was a stunning contrast to the one received by Barack Obama,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn Obama, they [the Saudis] saw a weak American leader, whereas with Trump they see someone who exhibits strength. Whose strength in leadership is out front. They might not have agreed with everything that Trump said [in his address in Saudi Arabia] but they have to respect that he spoke the truth. \u201d Huckabee, who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election before endorsing him, is in Israel on a brief tour with   American activist Dr. Joseph Frager. On Sunday night, Huckabee and Frager went for a nighttime visit to Joseph\u2019s Tomb, Judaism\u2019s third holiest site, located in a complex controlled by the Palestinian Authority. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing experience to have to come to this type of difficulty just to be able to come to a holy site for Jews and frankly even for Christians, who pay tribute to Joseph,\u201d Huckabee said at the site, according to Ynetnews. \u201cTo have to do it in the dead of night, under armed guard, with the smell of tear gas in the air, burning tires along the route, it\u2019s a stark reminder [of how different] it is in the heart of Israel, where the Israeli government protects every Muslim that accesses their holy site,\u201d he added. \u201cIn Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] Jewish people do not have unhindered access to holy sites without having to go to extraordinary lengths in order to be able to access these places. \u201d Huckabee will also attend the annual Moskowitz Prize for Zionism reception. The prize was \u201cestablished in recognition of the people who put Zionism into action in today\u2019s Israeli society  \u2014   at times risking their own personal security, placing the collective before personal needs and doing what it takes to ensure a strong, secure Jewish homeland. \u201d It was established by the late   Irving Moskowitz, whose wife Cherna continues the family\u2019s philanthropy. U. S. law requires the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem. However, President Obama signed successive waivers delaying the move. The current waiver expires on June 1. Numerous reports in recent days cited White House officials saying that Trump is not expected to use the visit to announce an embassy move. Still, that prediction is subject to change. Even if Trump does not announce an embassy move, there are   that could be put into place, including the possibility of David Friedman, the U. S. ambassador to Israel, setting up shop at the U. S. consulate in Jerusalem instead of the beachfront embassy building in Tel Aviv. Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
