Oskar Schindler, the subject of the film \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d is credited with saving around 1,200 Jews during World War II. But have you ever heard of this humble diplomat-turned-lightbulb-salesman who was a hero to an estimated 6,000?! His name was Chiune Sugihara. It was 1939. The brink of World War II. Germany had annexed Czechoslovakia and invaded Poland. Jewish refugees from Poland were flooding the surrounding countries. At that time, a third of Lithuania\u2019s urban population were Jews. In 1940, Sugihara was the vice consul of the Japanese consulate in Lithuania. Hundreds were coming into Sugihara\u2019s office begging for visas that would give them passage to Japan and away from encroaching war, persecution, and almost certain capture \u2026 and death. He knew a way to help. Visas. The rules to get a visa were strict. And Sugihara\u2019s bosses back in Tokyo told him to follow the strict rules they\u2019d made. But if he followed the rules, the chances of getting visas to those in need went down. Too far down. Actually, it\u2019s more accurate to say that if Sugihara wasn\u2019t issuing the visas, the people\u2019s chances of getting the visas virtually disappeared . The Japanese embassy in Lithuania was ordered to close, all while Sugihara sought permission to approve the visas (as many as three times) and was denied permission from the foreign ministry in Japan. So, after consulting with his family, Sugihara decided to ignore the rules and issue visas without permission: \u201cPeople in Tokyo were not united. I felt it silly to deal with them. \u2026 I knew that somebody would surely complain about me in the future. But, I myself thought this would be the right thing to do. There is nothing wrong in saving many people\u2019s lives.\u201d by Nick Shepley So, he set to writing. Back then, that was how visas \u2014 especially these very special and more or less \u201cillegal\u201d visas \u2014 got made. By hand. A copy of one of Sugihara\u2019s handwritten exit visas.

These refugees weren\u2019t headed specifically to Japan but to Cura\u00e7ao and Dutch Guiana (now Suriname) and had to pass through the Soviet Union and Japan to get there. From the end of July to the end of August, until his consulate in Lithuania was scheduled to close in early September (about a month!), Sugihara issued visas, completely ignoring the rules. 45 years after he signed the visas, Sugihara was asked why he did it. He liked to give two reasons: \u201cThey were human beings, and they needed help,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I found the strength to make the decision to give it to them.\u201d He didn\u2019t stay involved in government after the war ended. To support his family, he became an interpreter and translator and even did a stint as a door-to-door lightbulb salesman. He wound up managing an export company for the last 20 years of his life. He was just an average working man \u2026 with a huge, dramatic, bittersweet, and wonderful secret. On a memorial built for Sugihara in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo, Sugihara is seated on a bench holding a visa. The quote that accompanies his statue is from the Talmud: \u201cHe who saves one life, saves the entire world.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have a movie, but wow. What a story. Score one for humanity!
