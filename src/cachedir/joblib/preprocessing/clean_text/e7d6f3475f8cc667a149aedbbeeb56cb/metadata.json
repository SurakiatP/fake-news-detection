Instead of hounding you again, we asked experts for tips on skin cancer prevention and using sunscreen that you\u2019re less likely to have heard: the counterintuitive, the new or the  . Here\u2019s what they told us. (We know this is a little \u201cEat your vegetables\u201d of us, so we\u2019ll give you a reward if you make it to the end.) We hope maybe you\u2019ve heard these before, but let\u2019s reapply. Depending on your body size, experts recommend using enough lotion to fill a shot glass, or an ounce, when you\u2019re at the beach. Even if people are smart enough to apply sunscreen, they may not use enough, said Dr. Jerry Brewer, a dermatologic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Even if the bottle says the lotion is waterproof, beachgoers should reapply after swimming. If you\u2019re not swimming, you should reapply every two hours, regardless of the SPF count. You should put sunscreen on 15 minutes before exposure. Look for products that are labeled \u201cbroad spectrum protection\u201d with an SPF of 15 to 50. Dr. Elizabeth Hale, a senior vice president for the Skin Cancer Foundation and a dermatologist in New York City, said that both men and women are likely to miss the tops of their ears and the tops of the feet. (Full disclosure: The nonprofit Skin Cancer Foundation receives some funding from sunscreen manufacturers.) Men are particularly likely to miss their scalps and the backs of their necks, while women are more likely to miss their chest and neck areas, she said. Dr. Brewer said beachgoers often miss the bottoms of their feet, which can be exposed if they\u2019re lying on their stomachs reading or napping. This is a tricky one. Not even the Food and Drug Administration is sure, and we still don\u2019t know how effective they are or whether inhaling them can be dangerous. While some medical professionals suggest you should not use them, \u201cI tend to think it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d Dr. Brewer said. He recommended using the creams and lotions when possible, but said the sprays can be useful if you\u2019re on the go and won\u2019t make time for a full reapplication. Dr. Hale said   sunscreen should be applied indoors in a   area, and never sprayed directly on the face. Trying to apply it on the beach could lead to much of it flying away in the wind, leaving you with inadequate protection. Though there\u2019s no quantifiable standard like the shot glass of lotion, Dr. Hale suggested spray users create \u201can even sheen on the skin. \u201d Because you\u2019re probably taking your phone to the beach, you could rely on it, instead of your faulty memory, to remind you that it\u2019s time to reapply. Android and iOS are rife with free and inexpensive apps that could alert you when you need it. You could also seek help from wearables. A   device called JUNE, which can be worn as a bracelet or a brooch, monitors sun exposure and syncs with an iOS app that can tell you how quickly you\u2019re using up your recommended sun allowance for the day. Or you could try a   wristband, like UVSunSense, that changes colors to signal you should reapply sunscreen or head indoors. Dr. Hale said that when she tries to persuade patients to take sunscreen more seriously, she sometimes targets their vanity more than their health. She tells them that using sunscreen every day  \u2014   not just when they\u2019re at the beach or the park  \u2014   can help prevent the brown spots and wrinkles that often lead people to seek out dermatologists, and that sun exposure is a primary driver of the skin\u2019s aging process. \u201cI truly believe sunscreen is the No. 1   ingredient,\u201d she said. Research in 2013 revealed that people who used sunscreen every day had markedly smoother and more resilient skin. The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, and no sunscreen makers contributed.
