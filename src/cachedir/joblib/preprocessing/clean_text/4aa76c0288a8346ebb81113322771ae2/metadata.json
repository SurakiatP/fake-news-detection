The Seelbach is named after the Seelbach Hotel (today the Seelbach Hilton) a storied   lodging in downtown Louisville, Ky. that is mentioned briefly in \u201cThe Great Gatsby. \u201d Shortly after being put in charge of the hotel\u2019s bar and restaurant operations in 1995, Mr. Seger declared that he had discovered a recipe for a   cocktail that was once the hotel\u2019s signature drink. He tested it, liked it and put it on the menu. The news media soon picked up on the tale, and within a few years, the Seelbach cocktail was regarded as a rescued classic. It\u2019s a tantalizing back story, one that has charmed cocktail writers and aficionados for years, and there\u2019s only one thing wrong with it: None of it is true. After two decades of   Mr. Seger, 47, who left the hotel in 2001 and recently helped open the Tuck Room in downtown Manhattan, has decided to come clean that he concocted not only the drink but also the story behind it. \u201cI was nobody,\u201d Mr. Seger said of his standing as a bartender then. \u201cI had no previous accolades in the bar world. I knew I could make a great drink. I wanted it to be this promotion for the hotel, and I felt the hotel needed a signature cocktail. How could you have a place that F. Scott Fitzgerald hung out in that doesn\u2019t have a damn cocktail?\u201d Mr. Seger\u2019s sin is hardly an original one bartenders have been telling   tales since there have been bars to tend. It is, however, an unusual instance of   legerdemain in an era when mixologists have made an effort to be more scrupulous about cocktail history. The Seelbach cocktail story began when Mr. Seger started digging into the hotel\u2019s history. \u201cWe found old menus,\u201d he said. \u201cI was convinced there had to be a Seelbach cocktail. \u201d Except there wasn\u2019t. So he created one, mixing bourbon, triple sec and Angostura and Peychaud\u2019s bitters, and topping it all with sparkling white wine. He then came up with an elaborate origin story involving a couple from New Orleans who had honeymooned at the hotel in 1912. The man ordered a manhattan, the woman a Champagne cocktail. The clumsy bartender, spilling the bubbly into the manhattan, set the mess aside and made the drinks anew. But the accidental m\u00e9lange got the barman thinking. Soon, the Seelbach cocktail was born. The Louisville   was the first to write about the   drink. Soon, it was included in \u201cNew Classic Cocktails,\u201d a 1997 book by Gaz Regan and Mardee Haidin Regan. Later, it found its way into \u201cVintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails,\u201d an influential book by the drinks historian Ted Haigh, known as Dr. Cocktail. To Mr. Seger\u2019s amazement, no one ever asked him to produce an old menu with the drink on it. \u201cWhen Ted\u2019s book came out, I thought, \u2018Oh, now this is getting too serious, because this is a history book,\u2019\u201d Mr. Seger said. Mr. Seger, who talked of how he had \u201ccarried this around\u201d for years, recently confessed his transgression to Mr. Regan. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d Mr. Regan said, \u201cI always suspected that Adam had created the drink, but I really, really loved it, his story was almost plausible, and I needed recipes for \u2018New Classic Cocktails. \u2019\u201d When informed by a reporter of the drink\u2019s new birth date, Matthew Willinger, the hotel\u2019s director of public relations, replied that the cocktail \u201chas certainly been a tradition of the hotel and will remain part of its future. \u201d Recipe: The Seelbach Cocktail'"}, "time": 1742561820.11143}
