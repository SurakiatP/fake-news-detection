That streak is safe for at least another year after Dustin Johnson withdrew on Thursday because of a lower back injury he sustained in a fall down the stairs of his rental home near the course on Wednesday afternoon. Minutes before he was expected on the first tee to begin his first round, he was still telling fellow competitors he was going to play. Or at least try. \u201cStanding next to the practice putting green, I still was expecting to give it go,\u201d Johnson said after withdrawing. \u201cBut even on the putting green, I was taking a few easy swings and my back was so tight. \u201cI was only swinging 80 percent and I couldn\u2019t get through the ball all the way. The backswing was fine but at impact and moving through, it hurt. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to compete. It\u2019s terribly disappointing\u201d On a windy day, Charley Hoffman used nine birdies to surge to the top of the leader board with a    65. He has a   lead over William McGirt, who is playing his first Masters at age 37. Lee Westwood is at   and Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose are part of an   group that is  . Johnson had an extended   session before his tee time just after 2 p. m. He hit dozens of balls on the practice range but also took numerous breaks to go inside at the Augusta National Golf Club to have work done on his back. Nonetheless, about five minutes before his tee time, he began walking toward the first tee and practice putting green. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad  \u2014   it feels like in two days I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Johnson said, standing alongside the first tee after his withdrawal. Johnson offered a few more details about the mishap at his rented home in the Augusta area. He said his son, Tatum, was on his way back from day care, and he was going to move the car. \u201cI slipped down the stairs, and there were only three stairs,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt would have been better if it was a full staircase because I might have slid more. Instead, I just kind of stopped and hit. \u201d He landed on his elbow and lower back. He said the elbow was swollen but did not inhibit his swing. His back remained a problem even after he had medical personnel treat it for hours on Wednesday night. \u201cI was up all night and didn\u2019t really sleep,\u201d said Johnson, last year\u2019s United States Open champion. \u201cIt got better, but not really better enough. \u201d Before the fall, Johnson\u2019s coach, Butch Harmon, who is doing commentary for   Sky Sports, suggested on the air that this Masters was Johnson\u2019s to lose. \u201cHe\u2019s probably playing the best he has ever played in his life,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cHe absolutely loves this place and finished fourth here last year so has to be the   favorite. But that means nothing once Thursday starts. \u201d Johnson, 32, who supplanted Jason Day at No. 1 in February, arrived here with victories in his last three starts. He was the pretournament consensus favorite to become the first player since Jimmy Demaret in 1940 to make the Masters his fourth consecutive P. G. A. Tour win. On Tuesday, Johnson was asked about going into the Masters as the favorite. His response foreshadowed this unexpected turn of events. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in my game right now, especially with the way I\u2019ve been playing the last few tournaments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you know, anything can happen. \u201d This is the second time in the past six years that an injury kept Johnson from competing in the Masters, which is about a   drive from Columbia, S. C. where he was born. In 2012, Johnson withdrew two days before the first round with a back injury, which he said he got from lifting a Jet Ski. Fred Couples, whose World Golf Hall of Fame career has been disrupted by chronic back issues, said he was disappointed to hear that Johnson hadn\u2019t been able to start. \u201cIt\u2019s a bummer,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t fall down any stairs. Maybe that would have helped my back. \u201d Follow the Masters leader board here. '"}, "time": 1742564617.2979302}
