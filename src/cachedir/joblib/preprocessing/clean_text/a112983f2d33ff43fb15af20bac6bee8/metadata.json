I only chose Weatherfield for the easy commute \u2013 which hopefully it will be, once the trams are up and running again.\u2019 \\nAs a near-teetotaller, Barry added that he does not envisage spending much time in the local pub, the Rovers Return Inn. \u2018Besides, what with the last four landlords packing it in in acrimonious circumstances, lorries crashing into it and it being burnt to the ground, an attempted murder in the cellar and arguments going on there most nights, it doesn\u2019t sound like my sort of place,\u2019 he added. \\nHis 17-year-old son Philip, who has now settled in well at the local fee-paying academy Oakhill School, said that he had no plans for romantic entanglements. \u2018Don\u2019t get me wrong,\u2019 he told reporters, \u2018I\u2019ve seen that Tracey Barlow from down the road and I definitely would, and I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s some lesbian action going on down at the Websters\u2019, but I just have no time for that sort of thing with my A-levels coming up.\u2019 \\nMeanwhile, Mary Glazebrook, 45, who decided against seeking work at the local clothing factory because she doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s healthy to spend all her time closeted in a single small street, is reluctant to mix with her neighbours. \\n\u2018I mean, take that Gail McIntyre,\u2019 she said. \u2018She seemed nice enough when she said hello to me, but it turns out she has a long history of feuding with her mother-in-laws, her first husband was murdered, her second one was a serial killer who tried to kill her whole family by driving her car into a canal, her daughter got pregnant at 13, her son is a borderline psychopath, her long-last father came back after 30 years and turned out to be gay, then to top it all she married the debt-ridden father of the son\u2019s girlfriend and ended up in prison accused of his murder when he fell off a boat. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t make it up.\u2019 \\nAs of today, the Glazebrooks have no plans to have a housewarming. \u2018To be honest,\u2019 continued Mary, \u2018I don\u2019t think we could fit it in, what with hosting our swingers parties and sacrificing animals to Satan. Besides, I really need to have that conversation with Barry about how he\u2019s not actually Philip\u2019s dad \u2013 his brother is.\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 19th, 2016 by Oxbridge Click for more article by Oxbridge ..
