[In a stunning upset, the   jury led by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and including Hollywood stars Jessica Chastain and Will Smith awarded the trophy to the movie\u2019s director, Ruben Ostlund.  \u201cOh my God, oh my God!\u201d Ostlund shouted from the stage after besting a raft of favourites for one of global cinema\u2019s most coveted honours. In a 70th anniversary edition marked by raging debate over sexism in the movie industry, Sofia Coppola became only the second woman in history to win best director for her     thriller \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell. Kidman, who appeared in four different projects at the festival, accepted a special 70th anniversary award from the jury. Diane Kruger clinched best actress for her first film role in her native German as a devastated mother who has lost her family in a Hamburg terror attack, in Fatih Akin\u2019s \u201cIn the Fade\u201d. \u201cI cannot accept this award without thinking of everyone who has been touched by an act of terrorism  \u2026     you have not been forgotten,\u201d the clearly moved actress said.   Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix nabbed best actor for his turn as a   hitman in the ultraviolent thriller \u201cYou Were Never Really Here\u201d. \u201cAny work that I did was linked to the work of Lynne Ramsay,\u201d the film\u2019s British director, Phoenix said, before apologising for his    look at the gala ceremony. \u201cI don\u2019t wear leather,\u201d the committed vegetarian explained.  \u2014   \u2018So much courage\u2019  \u2014   Greece\u2019s Yorgos Lantimos shared the best screenplay award with Ramsay for \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d an icy thriller set in a wealthy American suburb and starring Kidman and Farrell. The   Grand Prix went to moving French drama \u201c120 Beats Per Minute\u201d about the radical activists who helped shame the world into action on AIDS. \u201cThis film is an homage to those who died but also those who survived and are still alive, who had so much courage,\u201d said the movie\u2019s director, former ACT UP member Robin Campillo. Campillo also wrote the screenplay for \u201cThe Class\u201d a drama about a multicultural Paris high school that scooped the Palme d\u2019Or in 2008 as well as an Oscar nomination. \u201cLoveless\u201d by Andrey Zvyagintsev, a wrenching drama about moral rot eating away at Russian society under Vladimir Putin, took the third place jury prize.  \u2014   Magic of big screen  \u2014   \u201cThe Square\u201d coming in at two hours and 20 minutes, is an often hilarious art world satire exploring creative liberty, free speech and the blurred lines between the sexes. Danish actor Claes Bang plays a museum director and divorced father of two young daughters who finds himself in an increasingly absurd set of predicaments. The movie features Elisabeth Moss (\u201cMad Men\u201d) and Dominic West (\u201cThe Wire\u201d) in small roles viciously lampooning the   art world. One   featuring a wild,   man performing as an ape wreaking havoc at a posh gala dinner entered festival legend. Cannes\u2019 12 days of screenings and   soirees  \u2014   which were somewhat muted by the Manchester bombing  \u2014   were marked by unprecedented   measures and a raging row over how technology is shaping the future of the movie industry. Netflix had two movies in competition for the first time but faced blowback from critics who argue that online streaming is destroying cinema distribution and with it the magic of the   experience.'"}, "time": 1742563035.4849806}
