In the last several months, more and more papers have been published about the possible planet and how it might prove an explanation for other strange things happening in our solar system. \\nAt a press conference held this afternoon, at the AAS Division of Planetary Sciences annual meeting in Pasadena Ca, another announcement was made about Planet Nine\u2019s effects on the spin-axis tilt of our Sun. This time, the paper titled Solar Obliquity Induced by Planet Nine is lead by Caltech graduate student Elizabeth Bailey, with Brown and Batygin as co-authors.'"}, "time": 1742564473.3730035}
