(Why minus $29 million? Taxes.) \\nThis is perhaps one of the best corporate crime books ever written. \\nAnd the reason is that it clearly exposes our system of no fault corporate crime. \\nDeferred prosecutions. Non prosecutions. Neither admit nor deny consent decrees. Executives rarely sent to jail. \\nJust have the corporation write a check. Thank you. \\nBirkenfeld exposes the perverse outcomes of that system at almost every turn. \\nIt\u2019s not just that whistleblowers are doing prison time and corporate executives are not. \\nIt\u2019s that when corporate executives are sent to jail \u2014 \\nWell, take the case of Joe Nacchio. \\nWhile doing his 30 months in prison at Schuylkill Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania, Birkenfeld ran into Nacchio. \\n\u201cJoe Nacchio had been the President and CEO of Qwest, a huge telephone company,\u201d Birkenfeld writes. \u201cHe was close to the Bush people, even visiting the White House on occasion. Shortly after 9/11, the Bush administration had gone to all the phone companies and demanded their customer records and email. AT&T and Verizon had caved right away, but Joe told the Feds to fuck off.\u201d \\n\u201cWe\u2019re a private company,\u201d Naccio said. \u201cI can\u2019t do that\u201d \\n\u201cYes, you can,\u201d said the Bushies. \u201cMatter of national security.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201d Joe protested. \u201cWithout warrants from a judge, on a case-by-case basis, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d \\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d \\n\u201cSo the Bushies charged him with insider trading and put him away for seven years. Joe\u2019s replacement at Qwest got the message, and the Feds got the records.\u201d \\nI\u2019m in Washington and I like this book because it exposes the system of no fault corporate crime enforcement. \\nBut a lot of people in Washington are not going to like this book. \\nBirkenfeld asks some pointed questions \u2014 including \u2014 why was the Department of Justice so reckless as to allow UBS to disclose the identities of only 4,700 (including some relatively low income dentists) of the 19,000 illegal account holders? \\nThose protected probably included many names you would recognize. \\nWhy were these names never made public? \\nThat\u2019s why Hillary Clinton is not going to like this book. \\nBirkenfeld recounts the deal Clinton cut with the Swiss that Birkenfeld says kept the big names secret. \\nPrior to Clinton\u2019s deal with the Swiss, UBS had only seen fit to contribute $60,000 to the Clinton Foundation, \u201can amount that wouldn\u2019t even cover the bank\u2019s annual parking tickets,\u201d Birkenfeld writes. \\n\u201cAfterward the Clinton Foundation\u2019s cash registers rang up $600,000 in UBS gifts,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe bank also decided to partner with the Foundation on some inner-city development programs, issuing a $32 million loan at very reasonable rates. Oh, and suddenly UBS also thought that Bill Clinton would make a very fine paid speaker about global affairs, so they paid him $1.52 million for a series of fireside chats with the bank\u2019s Wealth Management Chief Executive, Bob McCann. It was Bill Clinton\u2019s biggest payday since leaving the office of the Presidency.\u201d \\nMost of the lawyers who Birkenfeld ran into are not going to like this book because they are caught up in the corporate crime industrial complex that defines inside the beltway lawyers. \\nFor example, when Birkenfeld approach Skadden Arps partner Bob Bennett to take his case against UBS, Bennett begged off. \\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Bob, they\u2019re your client,\u201d Birkenfeld asked. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re everyone\u2019s client,\u201d Bennett tells Birkenfeld. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the major financial firms do, especially if they have big interests and lobbyists here in Wonderland. They put everyone on retainer. It\u2019s like buying lawsuit insurance.\u201d \\nBut most importantly, the Justice Department is not going to like this book because Birkenfeld says it\u2019s not about the facts, the law and justice. \\nIt\u2019s about brute corporate power. \\nWhy did the Department of Justice fail to fine UBS adequately \u2014 settling for only $780 million in 2009 \u2014 not even commensurate with the billions of dollars illegally earned in profits by UBS over many decades? \\nWhy did the Department of Justice release from custody two of the most senior UBS executives who oversaw this massive fraud? \\nBirkenfeld says it\u2019s about corporate connections. \\nWhich he lays out in intimate detail. \\nAt the book launch party, Birkenfeld said he had sent a copy of the book to the President Obama at the White House. \\n\u201cThe American taxpayers need to know why the Department of Justice took such extraordinary actions to protect the perpetrators of the largest tax fraud in history.\u201d \\n\u201cWhy the keen interest to shield from the American public all of those getting a free ride off the backs of tax-paying, law-abiding citizens? I ask you Mr. President, what will you do to investigate these serious injustices?\u201d \\nThat question Birkenfeld asked sort of tongue in cheek. \\nAfter all, Birkenfeld knows about Obama\u2019s UBS connection. \\nIn August 2009, on the first Sunday after Birkenfeld was sentenced in prison, at the Farm Neck Golf Club in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, President Barack Obama had strolled out onto the links. \\n\u201cHis golfing partner that day was Robert Wolf, Chairman of UBS Americas,\u201d Birkenfeld writes. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was a fine day of patter and play, guarded by a throng of Secret Service agents, and I wondered if Obama and Wolf had high-fived over my downfall, or maybe sent a \u2018good job\u2019 text to (the sentencing judge.) But I\u2019d never know, because much like Swiss bankers, Secret Service agents don\u2019t talk.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563014.0150988}
