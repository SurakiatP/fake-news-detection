[Voters swept the Republican Party into full control of the federal government, expecting us to honor our promises to put a stop to a reckless status quo that is mortgaging their futures.  So what\u2019s the first order of business for Republicans in Congress? To pass a budget that doesn\u2019t balance.  Ever. To pass a budget that will put our voters on the hook for $9. 7 trillion of new debt over ten years. Is that really what we campaigned on?  Is that why voters turned out to the polls? I know it\u2019s not why Kentucky sent me to Congress.  The budget\u2019s defenders tried to sell me on it as just a \u201cvehicle to repeal Obamacare. \u201d  I\u2019ve even been told that it\u2019s \u201cjust numbers\u201d and not really a budget.  The legislation\u2019s own title clearly says otherwise.  The numbers \u201creally\u201d say it will add $9. 7 trillion of new debt. But if these are indeed only numbers on a page, and if what\u2019s in the budget doesn\u2019t actually matter, then why don\u2019t we at least use numbers that balance?  Why don\u2019t we put a vision into the budget that represents what we as Republicans claim to stand for? Republicans say we are the conservative party.  Are we?  During President George W. Bush\u2019s eight years, and under a partially Republican Congress, the national debt doubled from $5 trillion to $10 trillion.  The response?  \u201cWell, he had Democrats to deal with, and if we could ever take all three branches of government, things would be different. \u201d The debt has gone on to nearly double again under President Obama, and finally the conservative party  \u2014   the supposedly conservative party  \u2014   has won all three branches.  So what are we looking at?  More debt, with the same kind of numbers we rightfully railed against during the Obama years! Congress has special rules for passing a budget that we can use to repeal Obamacare.  I\u2019m all for that approach, as long as that budget moves us toward fiscal responsibility.  As a physician, you won\u2019t find anyone more excited to get rid of Obamacare than me.  But are we so hurried that we can\u2019t even be bothered to vote on a budget that represents our conservative view and doesn\u2019t add $9. 7 trillion to the debt? This is outrageous, and it is unacceptable.  And I\u2019m fighting back. We don\u2019t need to choose between either repealing Obamacare or putting forward a budget that balances.  We can do both  \u2014   without a single Democrat vote!  We have no excuse.  On Monday, the Senate will go on record on an amendment I am offering that will strike and replace the current budget resolution.  My alternative presents a conservative vision by freezing   spending and balancing by 2024  \u2014   without changing Social Security.  And it still repeals Obamacare! It even starts in 2018 so as to allow agencies plenty of time to adjust to new spending levels.  By containing zero specific cuts to any function of government, it also offers Congress and the administration a chance to work together to prioritize spending. Is there really a difference between how a Republican and a Democrat Congress act?  We\u2019ll soon find out.  But I need your help.  I need your senator and representative to hear from you with a clear message that says, \u201cEnough is enough. \u201d Let\u2019s balance the budget and repeal Obamacare.  Let\u2019s do both now, and let\u2019s honor our commitment to be the change voters called for in November.'"}, "time": 1742562054.9456065}
