The House vote on the health care bill was delayed amid a swirl of Republican deal making and White House wrangling, but the Senate passed a measure to dismantle landmark internet privacy protections. Exactly when the health care vote will occur is not yet clear. The current version of the compromise bill strips away minimum requirements for coverage, like maternity care, hospitalization and prescriptions. Here are the changes made to the bill so far. And here is an easy way to see how it differs from Obamacare. The Daily podcast looks at why the Republicans are so divided. _____ 2. In the other major fight on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats signaled a willingness to filibuster Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch. The judge, who emerged largely unscathed from 20 hours of Senate questioning over two days, appeared to be short of the eight Democratic votes he\u2019ll need to proceed to a final confirmation vote. If the Democrats dig in, the Republican majority could change the rules to allow a simple majority vote to move the confirmation forward. _____ 3. The Islamic State claimed the deadly attack outside the British Parliament. The suspect, who was shot and killed, was identified as a      man of Pakistani descent who had a long criminal history but no terrorism convictions. The four people he killed and dozens he injured came from around the world, and included a Utah man who\u2019d been traveling with his wife. London fell back on its famed resolve. \u201cIt takes a lot to shake a Londoner,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThe Blitz spirit lives on. \u201d _____ 4. A suspect in the some of the scores of bomb threats against Jewish community centers was arrested: a Jewish teenager in Israel. The authorities said the youth, a dual  . S. citizen, used \u201cadvanced camouflage technologies\u201d to mask the origin of his calls. His lawyer said he has a brain tumor. _____ 5. \u201cHe was particularly offended by black men who are with white women. His intent was to kill as many black men here in New York in particular. \u201d That was a prosecutor, explaining the case against this Army veteran, James Harris Jackson, who is facing murder charges in the fatal stabbing of a    New Yorker, Timothy Caughman. A relative of Mr. Caughman wanted people to know that he lived a full life. _____ 6. Good news from California: Using NASA data, we compared this year\u2019s snowpack in the Sierra Nevada with that of 2015, when the state was in the grip of drought. After a very wet winter, the totals have been remarkably big. And bad news from the Arctic, which has less sea ice at winter\u2019s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements. The extent of ice cover  \u2014   a record low for the third straight year  \u2014   is another indicator of the effects of global warming. _____ 7. \u201cIf my father were alive, I would not be spending the day in the bazaar. \u201d That\u2019s one of the  nearly 4 million boys and girls in Afghanistan who won\u2019t be at school on Thursday, the first day of the new school year, because of violence, displacement and poverty. Another such child is above. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Taliban captured the strategic district of Sangin in Helmand Province. More British and American Marines died in Sangin than in any of the country\u2019s roughly 400 other districts. _____ 8. When couples divorce, who gets to keep the pets? Courts are shifting from treating them as property. Above, Charlene Lima, a   Rhode Island state representative who has introduced legislation to encourage the legal system to act in the best interests of the animals. Alaska already has such a law. A particularly contentious legal fight in San Diego over Gigi the dog lasted two years, cost $150, 000 and involved a   \u201cbonding study\u201d by an animal behaviorist. _____ 9. John Mayer knows he messed up. As the   finished a   new album this month, he reflected on his 2010 undoing. (In comments to two magazines, he called his penis David Duke, and used a racial epithet, among other highlights.) \u201cWhat has to happen for a guy to believe that he\u2019s totally   and be that far out of touch?\u201d he said. \u201cMy GPS was shattered, just shattered. \u201d _____ 10. In other navigational fails, Stephen Colbert lamented that he missed a sex scandal involving a rear admiral named Bruce Loveless amid the cacophony of news from Washington. \u201cWhat has happened to us as a nation?\u201d he grumbled. Indeed, there\u2019s just so much news that keeping up can be overwhelming  \u2014   not to mention going the extra mile to see events from alternative perspectives. So we\u2019re making it easier, with a collection of political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen.
