Europe is in the throes of a refugee crisis. Hosting asylum-seekers from Syria is a \u201chistoric test of Europe,\u201d says Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. \u201cThe most responsibility [for refugees] is and will continue to be placed on Europe,\u201d adds European Council President Donald Tusk. \\nFor President Obama, \u201cuncontrolled migration into Europe\u201d is a \u201cmajor national security issue\u201d for the United States. Even the Dalai Lama agrees that there are \u201ctoo many\u201d refugees inside the European Union. \\nReally? \u201cToo many\u201d? \u201cHistoric\u201d? Consider these facts: More than 65 million people were forced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) , including 21.3 million people classified as refugees living outside the borders of their own countries. \\nAdmittedly, a record 1.3 million refugees sought asylum within the European Union last year, with thousands more applying for asylum every month. Yet what of Sub-Saharan Africa, home to 4.4 million refugees and a whopping 19.5 million \u201cpeople of concern\u201d to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees? \\nWe don\u2019t often hear about these particular refugees or asylum-seekers, do we? They are, to borrow a term from British historian Mark Curtis, \u201cunpeople,\u201d the poor, nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the Western media. \\nWhere is the rolling coverage of Kenya\u2019s Dadaab camp, for example? Dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world, but in a move that could displace as many as 300,000 people , Kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down. It puts the recent British media frenzy over the so-called \u201cJungle\u201d camp in Calais, France, with its 10,000 migrants, into some perspective, doesn\u2019t it? \\n{snip} \\nYet Europe\u2019s refugee crisis continues to suck up all the oxygen of global publicity. The UNHCR fundraises for a whole host of \u201cspecial situations\u201d involving refugees. As of the end of October, the \u201c Central African Republic situation \u201d was 17 percent funded; the \u201c Somalia situation \u201d 21 percent funded and the \u201c South Sudan situation \u201d 25 percent funded. The \u201c crisis in Europe ,\u201d however? Fifty-six percent funded. \\nThe double standard is as brazen as it is shameful. Remember: The European Union accounts for 17 percent of global GDP ; Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a little more than 3 percent . \\n{snip} \\nThis is not just navel-gazing hyperbole but white privilege, plain and simple. How else to describe a collective tendency to obsess over a refugee crisis in (rich, white) Europe, rather than in (poor, black) Africa? In what warped world are thousands of penniless and homeless refugees considered to constitute a crisis only when they wash up on the shores of western Europe?'"}, "time": 1742563864.1270626}
