It\u2019s time to begin drawing conclusions from this continuing experiment. You\u2019ll recall that NBC began the parade in December 2013 with \u201cThe Sound of Music Live! ,\u201d which starred Carrie Underwood as Maria. A year later came \u201cPeter Pan Live! ,\u201d also on NBC, and last December the network served up \u201cThe Wiz Live!\u201d Fox got into the act this year with \u201cGrease: Live! ,\u201d \u201cThe Passion\u201d and \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,\u201d and on Wednesday night NBC resumed its December tradition with \u201cHairspray Live!\u201d [ Review: \u201cHairspray Live!\u201d Had Power Voices but Still Lacked Power ] Let\u2019s cut to the chase: \u201cThe Wiz\u201d was the best by far. But in terms of ratings, which is what this is really all about, \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d is the king (more than 18 million viewers) fueled no doubt by a curiosity factor, since it was first. \u201cGrease\u201d is second at about 12 million, then and \u201cThe Wiz\u201d at 11. 5 million. Preliminary numbers for \u201cHairspray\u201d put it somewhat behind those. But in general the bloom seems to be off the rose, and these musicals are settling into a     ratings zone. So maybe the phenomenon continues indefinitely, maybe not. But at this point, we have a pretty good idea of how to make them work. Among the poorest ratings performers and least watchable productions was Fox\u2019s \u201cRocky Horror\u201d in October, which was not performed live. That made it little more than a remake of the 1975 film version, a wonderful cult favorite built around a   performance by Tim Curry. Laverne Cox had the unenviable job of stepping into his shoes as    and never looked as if she was doing more than imitating her onscreen predecessor, something that was true of the rest of the cast as well. And for the viewer the enterprise lacked that little bit of spark that comes from knowing you\u2019re watching a live performance. Granted, these are heavily regimented productions with little risk of a catastrophic misstep, but still  \u2014   it\u2019s fun to dream. Ms. Underwood, the country singer and \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner, was the unfortunate sacrificial lamb who proved this point in \u201cThe Sound of Music. \u201d She has a nice voice, but it\u2019s not a stage voice, the kind a classic musical requires. (Also, she\u2019s not an actress.) Anyone thrown into one of these productions as   to attract viewers  \u2014   and the ratings suggested that Ms. Underwood, with her substantial fan base, did attract viewers  \u2014   is in danger of seeming inadequate next to whatever veteran stage actors are in the show. Ms. Underwood\u2019s weaknesses were only underscored by the presence of Laura Benanti and Audra McDonald. Similarly, Allison Williams, as Peter Pan, was even more of a dud when compared with   like Kelli O\u2019Hara and Christian Borle.   can work, but only when the production plays to the strengths of those performers. \u201cThe Wiz\u201d did  \u2014   its     score was just right for   Mary J. Blige and other recording artists in that cast. And Jennifer Hudson, who has starred on Broadway but is better known for her screen and singing careers, was a \u201cHairspray Live!\u201d highlight, belting out powerful numbers like \u201cI Know Where I\u2019ve Been\u201d and \u201cBig, Blonde and Beautiful. \u201d Several of these productions, especially \u201cGrease\u201d and \u201cHairspray,\u201d have gone to downright desperate lengths to try to make an impact on social media and with young demographics (or at least, young demographics that condescending TV executives apparently define as \u201ctoo stupid to appreciate art for art\u2019s sake\u201d). \u201cHairspray\u201d kept pausing to introduce us to its   squad and to check in on   viewing parties in various cities. It\u2019s as if the producers don\u2019t trust the musical itself to be interesting. The thing is, all of these works, even the pop ones like \u201cGrease\u201d and \u201cHairspray,\u201d have story lines. Some of those stories, like the one in \u201cHairspray,\u201d are pretty powerful if they\u2019re left alone. But if they\u2019re interrupted so we can hear from supposed fans dressed in period clothes at a viewing party in Philadelphia, they have no chance. \u201cGrease\u201d had a live audience viewing parts of the show. So did \u201cHairspray. \u201d But both of these productions sent their casts galloping about from set to set, so the audience wasn\u2019t always there. And when it was present, it sometimes was more cheerleader than audience, whooping it up in a way that called attention to itself. Who wants to tune in a TV show to watch people watching other people perform? Either figure out a higher purpose for a live audience or jettison it, please. \u201cGrease\u201d went by in a blur of blandness. So did \u201cRocky Horror. \u201d But people will be talking about Ms. Hudson\u2019s chilling \u201cI Know Where I\u2019ve Been\u201d for a long time. And \u201cmemorable\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cwonderful. \u201d It can also mean \u201cdebatable. \u201d What other performance are people still talking about? Christopher Walken\u2019s odd Captain Hook in the   \u201cPeter Pan. \u201d Was he lost, dazed, confused? Or slyly brilliant? Hard to say, but kudos for the casting decision. Harvey Fierstein, in contrast, was a safe choice for Edna Turnblad in \u201cHairspray,\u201d since he played the part on Broadway. Sure, it\u2019s fun to hear his growly voice, but the selection felt like an opportunity missed.'"}, "time": 1742564089.4880612}
