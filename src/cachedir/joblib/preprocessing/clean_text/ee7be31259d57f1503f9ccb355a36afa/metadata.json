Jon Pareles, The Times\u2019s chief pop music critic, and Dwight Garner, a New York Times book critic, take to the podwaves with the pop reporter Joe Coscarelli to talk about the stakes for the literary world, about how lyrics are and aren\u2019t poetry and about Dylan on love and death. They also discuss whether rock needs validation as literature, favorite Dylan lyrics and concerts through the years and a Dylan performance just last week  \u2014   at the Desert Trip festival (also known as Oldchella) in California. \u201cPeople are crazy, and times are strange,\u201d as Mr. Dylan has observed. Please email us at popcast@nytimes. com with your thoughts and impressions, or maybe a question that you\u2019d like us to address in a future episode.'"}, "time": 1742564560.429649}
