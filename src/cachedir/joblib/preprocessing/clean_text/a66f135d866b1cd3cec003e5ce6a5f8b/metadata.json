C. home game features exactly what one would expect from an   soccer match on a rented field in England\u2019s capital. Water bottles. A collection of balls. Substitutes warming up. A crowd that United London\u2019s chairman, Mark North, describes as \u201cone man and his dog. \u201d What is missing is more notable: a manager. At United London F. C. the position of a traditional coach is unnecessary. Instead, the lineup is selected by the team\u2019s fans each week. Formed this year and currently playing in the Essex Alliance Premier League  \u2014   the 12th tier of England\u2019s competitive soccer pyramid  \u2014   United London F. C. claims to be the world\u2019s only managerless club. In place of a traditional coach, the team\u2019s business model brings together elements of reality TV voting and player analytics similar to those used in video games and by scouts. It employs a fantasy   system that awards points to or deducts points from the team\u2019s fans (acting individually as managers) based on whether their selections make the starting 11, score or record an assist, or play a role in posting a shutout. \u201cIn nonleague football, there\u2019s not much in the way of eyeballs, because the Premier League just takes over everything,\u201d North, 38, said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we want to be different, in that we are building an online fan base, rather than a localized one. \u201d To date, more than 2, 000 people have signed up with the club, which played its first competitive match in early September. The team claims support from fans in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Sweden and the United States. Each week, those fans vote on United London\u2019s starting lineup by reviewing player statistics, scouting reports and videos of previous weeks\u2019 matches posted online by the club. After voting closes each Friday, the squad for Saturday\u2019s match is announced. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool because it keeps the club\u2019s supporters involved,\u201d said John Frusciante, a    from Aberdeen, N. J. who recently signed up. \u201cThe fans have more input than, say, at Real Madrid. Zidane isn\u2019t going to ask you if Ronaldo should be starting or not\u201d  \u2014   as in Coach Zinedine Zidane and striker Cristiano Ronaldo. North said the idea behind the team came to him last year while he and his wife were watching TV on a Saturday night. Tired of ballroom dancing shows and singing contests, North, who worked in financial recruitment at the time, began devising ways to apply the reality TV voting model to soccer. Like the contestants on such shows, players for United London have something at stake in each week\u2019s voting. While researching how to find players for a   team, North realized he might be able to mine the large number of academy prospects that are released by English professional clubs each season. After this highly competitive annual cull, many players abandon their hopes of professional soccer, around age 18. United London has positioned itself as a second chance for such players the club\u2019s badge depicts a phoenix rising from flames. \u201cA lot of players, by the time they get to 18, 19, 20, they haven\u2019t got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d said Jon Willis, the head of recruitment at the Football Careers Centre, an organization that helps place former academy players with new clubs. He helped organize United London F. C.\u2019s summer trials. Willis said United London allowed players to reset their career path, or try to attract the attention of a new club. \u201cThis program is interesting,\u201d Willis said, \u201cbecause they record every game. It\u2019s going to put people in the shop window. \u201d Already, United London F. C. has created a diverse squad of     and even   among them a Turkish youth international a player who, the club claims, was the   soccer player in Britain last year and the nephew of an England international striker. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t really think about it,\u201d Georges Ketoka, who once played in the third tier of Belgian soccer, said of fans\u2019 having the power to pick, or cut, players. At 26, Ketoka is one of the team\u2019s oldest members. \u201cIf you play,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know it\u2019s because people like you, the way you play and what you bring to the team. \u201d For now, United London supporters can influence the team\u2019s lineup only before matches. On a   website  \u2014   North admitted that it had had some growing pains  \u2014   fans are met with a formation empty of players that they can fill by selecting names from   menus beneath each position. Clicking on a star above a player selects him as the captain, earning the manager double points for that player\u2019s performance. As technology improves, North said, the club would like to allow fans to make   decisions on substitutions and other questions. For now, those decisions, and practice sessions, are handled by United London staff members. North would not reveal how many of those     are active users. The reason, he said, is that knowing such information could allow him and his staff to manipulate voting for the players they prefer. However, North did joke that results so far had shown that he was perhaps not the best person to be making such decisions anyway. His role at the club includes   tasks like putting up the nets before matches, but he also sits down every Sunday to count every pass, tackle and shot from the previous day\u2019s match, so that fans have the information they need to vote during the week ahead. That has not lent him much of an insider advantage, though, when he picks his own lineup. Last week, he said: \u201cI was only ranked seventh  \u2014   some guy from Sweden was top of the leaderboard. And I should know everyone!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628323.3532867}
