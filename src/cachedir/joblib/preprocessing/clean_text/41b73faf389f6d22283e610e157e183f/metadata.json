A. has explored various options for rejuvenating its most popular women\u2019s sporting event, seeking to counter indifferent attendance at this marquee championship. A study in 2013 offered several bold ideas, like holding the Women\u2019s Final Four at the same site as the men\u2019s event, or even moving it to Europe, China, Russia or Qatar. Another, less radical, proposal was to return the Final Four to a   format, from  . The new schedule was adopted for this year, and so on Friday night, the national semifinals took place at American Airlines Center here, with South Carolina defeating Stanford,   in the first game before Mississippi State upset Connecticut,   in the second. Capacity crowds were expected for the two semifinals and the final, the N. C. A. A. said. With weekend games, fans do not have to miss a considerable part of the workweek to attend the Final Four, as they did when the championship game was played on a Tuesday night from 2003 to 2016. (The men\u2019s Final Four continues to have a   format.) Also, some believed the women\u2019s final had begun to feel anticlimactic when it was played a night after the men\u2019s final. That seemed especially true last year, when Villanova defeated North Carolina on a   shot the day before UConn swamped Syracuse by 31 points. \u201cThe reason we moved to   was based on a lot of surveys and people saying, from a fan experience, that having to take that whole additional week off when we played on Tuesday was difficult,\u201d said Rick Nixon, the N. C. A. A.\u2019s associate director of championships and a spokesman for the organization. \u201cTo be in a   situation here in Dallas on Friday and Sunday, I think it\u2019s worked out. \u201d In effect, the N. C. A. A. seems to have put a higher premium on a full arena than expanded television ratings. Friday\u2019s semifinals were to be broadcast on ESPN2, competing with an N. B. A. doubleheader on ESPN featuring San   City and Golden  . Sunday\u2019s championship game will not have its accustomed   slot on ESPN, either. Instead, it will start at 6 p. m. Eastern time, ahead of the network\u2019s opening night coverage of Major League Baseball, featuring the World Series champion Chicago Cubs at rival St. Louis. \u201cWe\u2019re anxious to see where the ratings play out,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cIt might not be all bad. \u201d ESPN said it would have preferred to retain the   format. Kara Lawson, a commentator, told The Hartford Courant that the move to ESPN2 of Friday\u2019s semifinals, usually broadcast on ESPN, was a \u201cbig bummer for exposure of the game. \u201d Carol Stiff, vice president for women\u2019s sports programming at ESPN, was more sanguine. An arena at capacity is \u201cgood for the game,\u201d she said, and in reference to the women\u2019s final, she added, \u201cI think we might pull in more numbers on a Sunday. \u201d The final will be promoted as part of a \u201cSuper Sunday,\u201d Stiff said. \u201cFrom the crowning of a champion to handing it over to the Cubs, it\u2019s a pretty big day. \u201d Not everyone was pleased with the time slots for Friday\u2019s semifinals. The tipoff for   Carolina was set for 7:30 p. m. while UConn was set to play Mississippi State at closer to 10 p. m. The Huskies draw the biggest ratings in women\u2019s college basketball, but Coach Geno Auriemma said he was not happy that his team would have to wait around all day to play. \u201cI\u2019ve said this in the past  \u2014   TV and what\u2019s going on in the actual arena don\u2019t go together,\u201d he said on Thursday. He added: \u201cWe have to figure out how to work together, make it work for the   because we always use that term, you know. What\u2019s best for the  ? Not playing at 10 at night. \u201d Another underlying issue in women\u2019s college basketball is the debate about whether the dominance of UConn  \u2014   with its   winning streak entering Friday, and its four consecutive national championships  \u2014   is good or bad for the development of the sport. On the face of it, it might seem absurd to claim that sustained excellence was somehow detrimental. While the women\u2019s regionals had their lowest average attendance in 20 years, according to The Associated Press, with an average of 4, 719 fans at each game, UConn sold out both the regional semifinal and the final in Bridgeport, Conn. drawing announced crowds of 8, 978. In February, when UConn won its 100th consecutive game, against South Carolina, it drew the highest television rating of the season, to that point, on ESPN2 for any college game, men\u2019s or women\u2019s. \u201cI think they\u2019re great for the game,\u201d Stiff said of Auriemma and the Huskies. \u201cEvery time they\u2019re on, people are tuning in. They want to know, what is special about this team? What\u2019s in the sauce? Can he coach men? What\u2019s the magic in the potion? This was supposed to be his down year. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561635.4905276}
