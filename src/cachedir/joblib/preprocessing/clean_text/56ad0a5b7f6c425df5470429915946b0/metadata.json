The surprise election of Donald Trump, a real estate    television star with no government experience, upended the political order in the United States and around the world. Mr. Trump marshaled   white and   voters disaffected by globalization and multiculturalism, waging a campaign that traded in derision and attacked the legitimacy of the political process. ____ 2. Mr. Trump turned to assembling his White House team. There are some familiar names among the potential candidates: Rudolph W. Giuliani, above, a former mayor of New York Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a crucial adviser on policy issues, and Steven Mnuchin, a businessman who was Mr. Trump\u2019s national finance chairman, are also among those being considered as cabinet secretaries and advisers. ____ 3. Both Hillary Clinton and President Obama were stung by the voters\u2019 repudiation, but reinforced the importance of a peaceful, orderly transition of power. Mrs. Clinton, who said the loss was \u201cpainful, and it will be for a long time,\u201d also insisted that the nation owed Mr. Trump \u201can open mind and a chance to lead. \u201d ____ 4. In cities across the nation, like Oakland, Calif. above, people hit the streets to vent their anger at Mr. Trump\u2019s election. A crowd of protesters in Oregon burned American flags and chanted, \u201cThat\u2019s not my president. \u201d But many Americans are glad. In a former Pennsylvania steel town that was once a Democratic stronghold, people watched the returns Tuesday with mounting satisfaction. \u201cHe\u2019s killing it  \u2014   that\u2019s our next president,\u201d said one voter. Mr. Trump reshaped the election map with large gains across rural America, most significantly from industrial Midwest counties where whites without a college education made up the majority. ____ 5. \u201cCall it pink and blue America. \u201d Our senior correspondent on gender issues writes that the election shows how much men and women still talk past one another. A crowd of women attended Mrs. Clinton\u2019s concession speech, to bid her an anguished farewell. \u201cI know now that we live in two different Americas,\u201d said one woman. \u201cAnd one clearly doesn\u2019t know the other at all. \u201d ____ 6. Global markets stabilized after an initial plunge. But uncertainty over Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, along with his distrust of trade pacts and climate change, raised international concerns. Vladimir V. Putin expressed hope for a \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d with Mr. Trump, whose lack of foreign policy experience and friendly positions toward Russia could play into the Kremlin\u2019s hands. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, sent a short congratulatory note, but made no mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to confront Beijing on trade and currency issues. ____ 7. Mr. Trump\u2019s sweep was unforeseen, undercutting the credibility of much of the American news media and the enormous efforts put into polling and analysis. As with the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum that astonished Britain a few months ago, much of the prominent coverage failed to capture the level of popular fury. The   host Stephen Colbert was swept up in a surreal, disconcerting broadcast when he and the guests on his live   special began realizing that Mr. Trump was winning. ____ 8. The Republicans will now control the White House and both houses of Congress, as well as more statehouses than at any point in history. Mr. Trump\u2019s unanticipated strength in several key battleground states helped G. O. P. candidates fend off numerous Democratic challengers in the Senate. The Supreme Court will tilt right again, with one vacant seat almost certain to be filled by a conservative. And there\u2019s the prospect of several more openings during Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure. ____ 9. With the help of the   House and Senate, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act could become reality. But it\u2019s not clear how many of the promises he made on the campaign trail  \u2014   like building a wall on the Mexican border or making sweeping changes to immigration policy  \u2014   will be pursued. Here\u2019s a look at where he stands on some of the issues that could fundamentally change the direction of the U. S. ____ 10. Finally, the presidential election wasn\u2019t the only marker of the country\u2019s changing attitudes. The national movement to legalize marijuana took a huge leap with the addition of three states  \u2014   California, Massachusetts and Nevada  \u2014   approving recreational use of the drug. With Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington having previously approved recreational marijuana measures, Tuesday\u2019s votes created a bloc that stretches across the West Coast. But the federal government\u2019s ban on the drug continues, and a Trump White House may not be friendly to overturning it. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
