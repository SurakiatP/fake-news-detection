The man never identifies himself, but he is constantly building and creating things with nothing more than his hands and the elements around him. \\nIn a recent video, the man, often called \u201cPrim,\u201d stumbled upon a method of creating iron. It came after he created a furnace out of clay. \\n\u201cMy intent was not so much to make iron,\u201d he says from his blog, \u201cbut to show that the furnace can reach a fairly high temperature using this blower. A taller furnace called a bloomery was generally used in ancient times to produce usable quantities of iron and consumed more charcoal, ore and labour.\u201d \\nStill, it is amazing to see him create a method of iron extraction out of nothing but the basics. \\nHe gets to work with his bow-drill blower and clay forge, first collecting orange iron bacteria (iron oxide) from the creek. He mixes it with powdered charcoal and wood ash, forms it into a cylindrical brick and fires it in a charcoal oven. The result is a melted iron ore slag with tiny, 1mm-sized specs of iron in it. \\nFascinating.'"}, "time": 1742563211.0311098}
