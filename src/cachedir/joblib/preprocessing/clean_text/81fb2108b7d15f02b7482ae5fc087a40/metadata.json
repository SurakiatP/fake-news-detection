Various counties, cities, state agencies and out-of-state law enforcement were helping the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the statement said. \\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign weighed in on the protests Thursday evening. \\n\u201cFrom the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects,\u201d Spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. \\n\u201cNow, all of the parties involved \u2014 including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes \u2014 need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cAs that happens, it\u2019s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators\u2019 rights to protest peacefully, and workers\u2019 rights to do their jobs safely.\u201d \\nProtest camp coordinator Mekasi Horinek told NBC affiliate KFYR on Wednesday that the protesters had no plans of leaving their encampment. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans on retreating. If they\u2019re going to come in here and they\u2019re going to arrest one of us, they\u2019re going to arrest every one of us,\u201d Horinek said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stand in unity, we\u2019re going to stand in prayer, we\u2019re going to stand in peace.\u201d \\nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe chairman Dave Archambault II told NBC News on Sunday the tribe had asked the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the escalating situation with law enforcement. \\n\u201cThe DOJ should be enlisted and expected to investigate the overwhelming reports and videos demonstrating clear strong-arm tactics, abuses and unlawful arrests by law enforcement,\u201d Chairman Dave Archambault II said.'"}, "time": 1742562004.361845}
