[Shakespeare in the Park,  On Friday night, two conservatives disrupted a New York performance of Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar that escalates the left\u2019s campaign of imagery designed to cathartically depict the death or murder of President Donald Trump. TheRebel. tv\u2019s Laura Loomer was arrested for running onstage during the Shakespeare in the Park production, while activist Jack Posobiec taped her demonstration and shouted at the crowd: \u201cThe blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands!\u201d \u201cOld Right\u201d Several authors at   conservative publications condemned Loomer and Posobiec, arguing that the two infringed on the free speech of Shakespeare in the Park and their tactics were too close to the Occupy of Black Lives Matter movement.   conservatives labeled this faction the \u201cold right,\u201d stating that there is no moral equivalence between this disruption and the violence of   protesters in dozens of recent incidents. The old right losers who are upset about what Laura did don\u2019t realize that unlike them, we fight  \u2014   and that\u2019s why our guy won. #FreeLaura,  \u2014   Cassandra Fairbanks (@CassandraRules) June 17, 2017,  Which is appropriate  She broke the law.  To fight an injustice  Just like #RosaParks https:  .   \u2014   Google \u201dCNN, 175, Sue\u201d (@NolteNC) June 17, 2017,  They\u2019re literally shooting at us and you want to play Marquis of Queensbury.  Cowardice.  Fight the enemy or fuck you.  \u2014   Google \u201dCNN, 175, Sue\u201d (@NolteNC) June 17, 2017,  Oh yeah, leftist students threatening conservatives with violence is the exact same as a 1 minute interruption of Shakespeare in the Park https:  .   \u2014   Scott Greer (@ScottMGreer) June 17, 2017,  This is the mentality that has sat, patted itself on the back, and watched for decades as America has gone further and further Left https:  .   \u2014   DanRiehl (@DanRiehl) June 17, 2017,  We went to one play and accomplished more for the message than the millions donated to think tanks and handed to K Street. Let that sink in,  \u2014   Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) June 17, 2017,  Schlichter vs. Podhoretz, One archetypical exchange in the aftermath of the Julius Caesar demonstration saw Tablet editor and \u201cNever Trump\u201d  John Podhoretz facing off with lawyer and author Kurt Schlichter. I\u2019d say I just learned tonight you\u2019re a drooling, immoral, melodramatic idiot, but alas, I learned that long ago. https:  .   \u2014   John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) June 17, 2017,  you want affirmative action for being a moron because you wore our country\u2019s uniform? Happy to oblige.  \u2014   John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) June 17, 2017,  Cernovich vs. Shapiro, Even more heated was the war of words between independent author and White House reporter Mike Cernovich, responding to criticism from former Breitbart News Senior    and \u201cNever Trump\u201d  Ben Shapiro. This obnoxious stupid snowflake crap is no better than the protesters who try to block college speeches. https:  .   \u2014   Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) June 17, 2017,  He doesn\u2019t matter. None of those guys matter anymore. They don\u2019t break news or make news. Controlled opposition for media to abuse. https:  .   \u2014   Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) June 17, 2017,  This is total, complete horse crap. She invaded a public performance to obstruct it. She has no right to the stage. https:  .   \u2014   Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) June 17, 2017,  \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffbThis is what a coward looks like. #FreeLaura \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb https:  .   \u2014   Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) June 17, 2017,  After trading a few intense personal insults, both men reiterated their arguments  \u2014   but no longer directly to each other. They took stage for 1 minute. The left pulls fire alarms, uses pepper spray, hits people with bike locks. It\u2019s not even close.  \u2014   Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) June 17, 2017,  Use free speech in ways that irritate the left. Do not impede other people\u2019s freedom of speech. This is not difficult.  \u2014   Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) June 18, 2017,  At the same time, the left was infighting over a much more   topic: targeted political violence. Steve Scalise, On Wednesday, a    Illinois man opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and putting him in critical condition through the weekend. The attacker  \u2014   James Hodgkinson, who was killed by police returning fire  \u2014   also shot Two Capitol Police officers, a congressional staffer, and a lobbyist. The Daily Caller has reported that investigators found a list of GOP lawmakers\u2019 names on Hodgkinson\u2019s body. Instead of universal condemnation, Hodgkinson\u2019s attack has brought about a   feud between the establishment left and the social justice left. Impulse Control, Over the weekend, several Verified progressives of varying prominence  \u2014   an L. A. Times blogger, the creator of #OscarsSoWhite, a rapper with 250 YouTube subscribers, an Uproxx editor, and TV actor George Takei  \u2014   argued that sympathy for Rep. Scalise should not outweigh his sinful acts as a lawmaker. In most cases, more traditional liberals scolded their more radical peers for generating bad optics. When will it be time to move Scalise\u2019s opposition to gun control from the last graf of a story to the first? https:  .   \u2014   Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) June 18, 2017,  You can despise Scalise\u2019s politics and also despise the fact someone thought gun violence would somehow change his or anyone\u2019s mind.  \u2014   John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) June 16, 2017,  Wounded Congressman Scalise, who the GOP are so sad about, voted TWICE to not recognize the #MLK holiday. https:  .   \u2014   Iskandrah (@iskandrah) June 18, 2017,  I ask you simply to look at Rep. Scalise\u2019s record. Do you have sympathy for other white supremacists?  \u2014   Iskandrah (@iskandrah) June 15, 2017,  Was Scalise a \u201dhuman\u201d when he voted against Marriage Equality and spoke at a white supremacy function? Or do only Dems need to be \u201dhuman?\u201d https:  .   \u2014   April (@ReignOfApril) June 16, 2017,  and don\u2019t tell me the man has a family and allat shit, because so do folk with their premiums traveling on a rocket to Mars,  \u2014   SUPER SIZE (@GrandeMarshall) June 14, 2017,  Made the mistake of looking up Steve Scalise voting record on women and LGBT rights. Time to break out Milkshake Duck.  \u2014   Donna Dickens (@MildlyAmused) June 14, 2017,  I don\u2019t have any tolerance for caveats on condemning political violence right now. You\u2019re opening the door a crack. It needs to stay shut.  \u2014   jessicashortall (@jessicashortall) June 16, 2017,  Cool  \u2014   I guess enough time has passed since Scalise got shot that we can go back to attacking him as a homophobic bigot. Stay classy, Sulu. https:  .   \u2014   Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) June 17, 2017,  Why do we have to list Philando\u2019s accolades? How come the headlines aren\u2019t, \u201dSteve Scalise, a bigot who is trying to kill you, got shot\u201d?  \u2014   Brandi Geography B. (@ItsTheBrandi) June 17, 2017,  Josh Barro, an editor at Business Insider, wrote a thread on how the dehumanization of the left\u2019s political opponents is \u201cbad for society. \u201d Dozens of progressives rebuked Barro in the responses, calling him misguided, \u201cinsincere,\u201d and \u201cwhite boy. \u201d This feels like the wrong week to do an analysis of whether Steve Scalise is a good congressman.  \u2014   Josh Barro (@jbarro) June 18, 2017,  On the other side of the argument, New Jersey Democratic strategist James Devine urged progressives to \u201chunt Republican Congressmen. \u201d Scarborough vs. Reid, On Saturday, MSNBC host Joy Reid called the situation \u201cdelicate\u201d because, while \u201ceverybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers\u201d from an apparent assassination attempt, Reid lamented that \u201cScalise has a history that we\u2019ve all been forced to sort of ignore on race. \u201d Joe Scarborough, one of Reid\u2019s colleagues, appeared to attack this segment  \u2014   without naming his target. CNN anchor Jake Tapper   the condemnation. Rep. #Scalise was shot by a white man with a violent background, and saved by a black lesbian police officer, and yet  \u2026     #AMJoy pic. twitter.   \u2014   AM Joy   Reid (@amjoyshow) June 17, 2017,  If you are attacking Steve Scalise\u2019s voting record right now, do yourself a favor and just stop now. I can\u2019t even believe what I\u2019m seeing.  \u2014   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 17, 2017,  Who would even think for one second that it is appropriate to attack a man who is fighting for his life after an assassination attempt?  \u2014   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 17, 2017,  Agreed. Unfathomable. https:  .   \u2014   Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) June 17, 2017,  Pelosi vs. Pelosi, Septuagenarian Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s conflicting reactions to the Scalise shooting provided the clearest example of progressive id vs. progressive  . On the day of the shooting, she said  \u2014   in direct contradiction to virtually every other statement she has made about President Trump and Republicans  \u2014   that she prayed for unity in the wake of the attack. On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our thoughts for the wounded. https:  .   \u2014   Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 14, 2017,  Yet the very next day, in a seemingly unscripted moment, she returned to her default position of partisan blame: Somewhere in the 1990s, Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons and that is the provenance of it and is what has continued. Again, I feel as if we\u2019re having a family moment that is very, very serious and we\u2019re talking about things that we can say, the discussion \u2014  save the discussion for another day. When you have a president that says, \u201cI can shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and nobody would care,\u201d when you have people saying, \u201cbeat them up and I\u2019ll pay their legal fees,\u201d when you have all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton, for them to be so sanctimonious is something. The New Political Landscape, Two parties  \u2014   Republicans and Democrats  \u2014   still essentially rule American politics, but their constituencies are becoming more tribal and divided, even against their electoral allies. Trump voters hate Republican lawmakers, such as Sens. John McCain and Ben Sasse, for publicly attacking the president and his agenda during and after the 2016 election. Democrats are still picking up the pieces from a contentious DNC leadership race, where   Obama ally Evan Perez narrowly defeated   Rep. Keith Ellison. These same divisions play out in cultural institutions, such as the social justice warriors purging classical liberal professor Bret Weinstein from the Evergreen State College campus or Fox News\u2019 internal fight over the future of its programming style. The arguments taking place now are over what are appropriate means to victory over the other side: for the right, whether to be polite or ruthless  \u2014   and for the left, whether to be ruthless or violent.'"}, "time": 1742628519.364626}
