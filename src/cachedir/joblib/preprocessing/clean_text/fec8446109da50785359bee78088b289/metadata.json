No other source has yet confirmed the report. Washington is pressuring Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi not to allow Hashd al-Sha\u2019abi forces to participate in the Mosul liberation operations. Spokesman of the Iraqi popular forces Ahmad al-Assadi had confirmed in August that General Soleimani would play a major role in operations to liberate Mosul, stressing that his country is in dire need of Iranian military advisors. \u201cThe presence of Brigadier-General Soleimani in the operations to free Mosul and Nineveh province is necessary and General Soleiman is the greatest advisor that has helped the Iraqi government in the war against the ISIL,\u201d al-Assadi told FNA. \u201cHajj Qassem Soleimani is one of the most important military advisors of the Islamic Republic of Iran who is in Iraq at the invitation, demand and agreement of the Iraqi government,\u201d he added. Stressing that the Iranian advisors are in Iraq at the demand of the Iraqi government and have played a big role in most operations conducted by the popular forces, al-Assadi said, \u201cThey provided the Iraqis with strong views and important consultations with respect to their experience and capabilities.\u201d In relevant remarks in June, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ebrahim al-Jafari underlined that General Soleimani is in Iraq to help the country in campaign against terrorism after receiving Baghdad\u2019s rigid request. \u201cGeneral Soleimani is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to provide military counseling to the Iraqi forces,\u201d the Arabic-language Sumeria news channel quoted al-Jafari as saying. Also in June, Hashd al-Sha\u2019abi Commander Abu Mehdi al-Mohandes underlined that General Soleimani is helping the Iraqi forces in their campaign against terrorism upon a request by the Iraqi government. \u201cThe Iranian advisors, headed by dear brother Qassem Soleimani, have been beside us since the start of war and his presence has happened upon the demand of the Iraqi government and agreement of the Armed Forces\u2019 top commander,\u201d Mohandes said in an interview with Sumeria news channel. He, meantime, said that the Iraqi nation is able to kick the terrorists out of Iraq with the possibilities in their hands now, adding that Hashd al-Sha\u2019abi doesn\u2019t have any political plan and merely supports the political process.
