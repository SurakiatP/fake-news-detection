S. embassy to Jerusalem, it would be considered \u201ca declaration of war\u201d on all Muslims, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s supreme Sharia judge Mahmoud   declared on Friday. [\u201cThe new American administration intends to transfer its embassy to Jerusalem. In a simple, calm, and rational manner, in clear words that need no explanation and which are unambiguous: Such a step, for every Muslim, is a declaration of war on all Muslims,\u201d said Habbash in a Friday sermon broadcast on the Palestinian Authority\u2019s official television network.  The speech, which was attended by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, was translated by Israeli watchdog Palestinian Media Watch. \u201cWe are no one\u2019s enemies, and we do not want to be. We are not enemies of the US and we do not want to be. However, when something harms our faith and our existence, we cannot stand by and do nothing,\u201d Habbash, who also serves as a senior aide to Abbas, said. \u201cOccupied Jerusalem is our eternal capital, the capital of our existence and the capital of our state. In politics, there can be compromises here and there  \u2026     In politics there can be negotiation. However, in matters of religion, faith, values, ethics, and history, there can be no compromises,\u201d he added. Trump\u2019s team has emphasized that the   is \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to transferring the embassy to Israel\u2019s capital as soon as possible. Saeb Erekat,   of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and chief Palestinian negotiator, said that moving the embassy would \u201cdestroy\u201d the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians and would cause the region to descend further into \u201cmore chaos, lawlessness and extremism. \u201d Erekat also warned that if Trump were to go ahead with the move, the PLO will revoke its recognition of Israel and the U. S. will be forced to shut down all of its embassies in the Arab world. In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that such a move would cause \u201can explosion, an absolute explosion in the region, not just in the West Bank, and perhaps even in Israel itself, but throughout the region. \u201d On Thursday, Jordan released a statement saying an embassy transfer would be a \u201cred line\u201d for the Hashemite Kingdom, warning that it would \u201cinflame the Islamic and Arab streets\u201d and would serve as a \u201cgift to extremists. \u201d On Friday, Abbas warned Trump not to transfer the embassy, saying it was an \u201caggressive\u201d move.'"}, "time": 1742628503.5724857}
