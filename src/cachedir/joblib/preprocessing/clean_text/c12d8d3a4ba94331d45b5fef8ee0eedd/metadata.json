They are: Damien Chazelle (\u201cLa La Land\u201d) Garth Davis (\u201cLion\u201d) Barry Jenkins (\u201cMoonlight\u201d) Kenneth Lonergan (\u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d) and Denis Villeneuve (\u201cArrival\u201d). The real news came further down in the announcement: Nate Parker received a nomination for outstanding achievement for a   director. This signals a redemption of sorts for Mr. Parker, whose awards hopes for his debut film, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d were torpedoed when controversy emerged around rape charges he faced and was acquitted of nearly 16 years ago. In the   category, nominations also went to Mr. Davis (a second one for his work on \u201cLion\u201d) Kelly Fremon Craig (\u201cEdge of Seventeen\u201d) Dan Trachtenberg (\u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d) and Tim Miller, whose satirical superhero film \u201cDeadpool\u201d has been a surprise presence in this year\u2019s awards race. In the main feature film category, the notable omissions were Mel Gibson, for \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d and Martin Scorsese, whose   passion project, \u201cSilence,\u201d received neither a Directors Guild nomination nor one from the Producers Guild, which found room for \u201cDeadpool\u201d in its nominations list this week. Taken with the film\u2019s shutout from the Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, Mr. Scorsese and \u201cSilence\u201d are all but guaranteed to be ignored in the best picture and best director Oscar races this year. (Academy Award nominations are announced Jan. 24.) Guild awards are given far more weight in the Oscars race than awards from critics or journalists because they represent industry sentiment, and because a huge number of guild members also belong to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The DGA Award nominations capped a busy week that began with the Golden Globes and included nomination announcements from the producers and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which also shares members with the American academy (and is now dealing with a #BAFTASoWhite controversy for picking an   slate of lead acting and directing nominees). Taken with Golden Globes wins, the guild nominations make clear the calcification of this year\u2019s race around the leading contenders, with \u201cLa La Land\u201d more out front than ever.'"}, "time": 1742561780.6708996}
