Wearing a sash inscribed with the word \u201cThespian,\u201d she was among 700 people who traveled here to ask lawmakers to oppose President Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. But the morning was a hectic one on Capitol Hill, and the senator, a Democrat, was busy. An aide listened as Ms. Alt and others in her group, in town for Arts Advocacy Day, asked for lawmakers to work together. This annual exercise has taken on a new urgency this year. Yes, Republican lawmakers have steadily begun to come out against shutting down the endowment, but it\u2019s still a   Congress responding to a Republican president. \u201cA lot of the staffers understand that their Congresspeople are generally in support of the arts,\u201d Ms. Alt said after the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s just whether or not they\u2019ll actually follow through. \u201d To prod them in the right direction, arts advocates have had to hone their message. On Monday, clutching   binders full of facts and figures, artists, teachers and nonprofit workers clustered in meeting rooms at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, discussing the best ways to ask lawmakers not only to preserve the funding, but also to increase it. Attendees worked on   scenarios, acting out what would happen if they were confronted with an uninterested lawmaker. On a couch in the lobby, two women from Florida pored over the layout of Senate office buildings. They decided to bypass a visit to Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s office. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to support us, regardless,\u201d one of the women said of the Florida Republican. They moved on, though the senator has not made any statement about how he views that funding cut. The activists set an attendance record for Arts Advocacy Day (also called the National Arts Action Summit) however, as they wandered the halls of government buildings, they were competing for attention during a vicious news cycle, which included a Senate confirmation hearing for a Trump nominee and an F. B. I. inquiry into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Proponents of the N. E. A. have long had their work cut out for them in stressing that the arts are sources of job creation and community enrichment in cities of all sizes. But these days, they\u2019re also concerned with simply breaking through the rest of the noise. Anne Katz, who traveled from Madison, Wis. said that \u201calthough the politics of Wisconsin are crazy,\u201d advocates have tried to zero in on any connection lawmakers may have to the arts. Do they play an instrument? Like concerts? \u201cMost lawmakers perform in their spare time,\u201d Ms. Katz said. The trick, she said, will be to push the message that the N. E. A. whose budget sits at about $148 million, is a good investment. (As the agency points out, this amount represents about . 004 percent of the federal budget.) N. E. A. grants are generally small, and most states, including Wisconsin, receive the equivalent of less than $1 per person. \u201cWe have to ask ourselves what sort of country we want to be,\u201d Ms. Katz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty stark choice, I think. \u201d An appearance Tuesday by Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who is the chairwoman of a crucial Senate appropriations panel that oversees arts and humanities endowments, was met with a round of applause from a crowd that gathered in the Russell Senate Office Building. The senator emphasized the need for maintaining \u201ccultural infrastructure. \u201d In a short interview during the walk to her next appointment, she pointed out that President Trump, the first president to propose completely eliminating the agency, seemed to show an appreciation for the arts as a developer. \u201cThink about what President Trump did with his buildings when he was not President Trump,\u201d Senator Murkowski said. \u201cHe built them so that there was a beauty to them. \u201d Her state has received more than $18 million in grants since 1995, but the senator wouldn\u2019t say whether she supported keeping the endowment at its current funding level. \u201cI don\u2019t support the elimination of the program,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s for darn sure. \u201d Narric W. Rome, vice president of government affairs and arts education for Americans for the Arts, the group that helped organize the event, said advocates hope to do more than just save the endowment. They also hope to block deep, debilitating cuts and avoid being used as a political football during the budgeting process. \u201cIt\u2019s not just fear of termination,\u201d Mr. Rome said. \u201cIt\u2019s of this false negotiation. \u201d The support of another influential lawmaker, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican who is the House appropriations committee chairman, was encouraging to the dozens of activists who traveled here from his state. \u201cIn the overall scheme of things I think the arts programs, which have been a target for many years in preceding congresses, it\u2019s not a heck of a lot of money and I enjoy those programs as much as any other American,\u201d he said in a telephone meeting with constituents on Monday. \u201cI think it\u2019s money well spent. \u201d Ann Marie Miller, the director of advocacy for the ArtPride New Jersey Foundation, said the job now would be to keep in constant contact with Representative Frelinghuysen so he doesn\u2019t change his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s making sure that advocates keep the pressure on,\u201d Ms. Miller said, \u201cbecause we know he\u2019ll be under pressure. \u201d Attendees were asked to put their political differences aside in their preparations. On Monday, as a group of about 90 New Yorkers readied themselves for visits, their group\u2019s organizer, Tod Kniazuk, encouraged attendees to have \u201cselective amnesia about where the representative stands on everything else, and to talk to them about the arts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628519.029543}
