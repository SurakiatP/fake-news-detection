Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama \u201cdoes intend to veto this legislation,\u201d and would work to persuade lawmakers in both parties to change course. If he cannot, the measure could lead to the first veto override of his presidency, as the legislation drew the backing of lopsided majorities in both the House and Senate. \u201cThe president feels quite strongly about this,\u201d Mr. Earnest said of the legislation, which Mr. Obama has said could dangerously undermine the United States\u2019 interests globally, opening the country to a raft of lawsuits by private citizens overseas. \u201cThe concept of sovereign immunity is one that protects the United States as much as any other country in the world,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, referring to the rationale behind a 1976 law that gives other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine other countries using this law as an excuse to haul U. S. diplomats or U. S. service members, or even U. S. companies, into courts around the world. \u201d The bill has placed Mr. Obama in an awkward position, pitting him against the grieving families of victims of terrorism and many of his strongest Democratic allies, including in New York\u2019s congressional delegation. \u201cThe families of the   victims have suffered so much and fought so hard for justice,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. \u201cI hope for their sake that the administration will rethink vetoing this bill. \u201d The legislation would alter that 1976 statute to allow nations to be sued in federal courts if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on United States soil. It also allows Americans to file financial claims against those who funded the attacks. Supported by the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, the measure also reflects a broader   in Washington of the alliance with Saudi Arabia, once an unquestioned partner. The measure passed the Senate in May without opposition, and sailed through the House by a large margin on Friday. It takes a   vote of both the House and Senate to override a veto. The president will lobby lawmakers to change their votes, Mr. Earnest said, including many members he said had privately agreed with Mr. Obama\u2019s position on the bill, but felt that voting against it would harm their political prospects. \u201cIn many cases, we had members of Congress who were sympathetic to our concerns, but I think those same members of Congress were concerned about the impact this might have on their political standing, to oppose this bill,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.'"}, "time": 1742564181.9066014}
