On Friday, Chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force, and the mayor said he would negotiate a   settlement, known as a consent decree. But that is no guarantee of results  \u2014   and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors. Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the Obama administration, which made police reform a signature issue. It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force, racial bias and poor supervision, issuing reports choking with outrage. Los Angeles, which was under a consent decree for 11 years, is regarded as one of the great success stories. \u201cLos Angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington think tank. In Detroit, which emerged from a   consent decree last year, officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly. But Pittsburgh, the target of the first consent decree based on a Justice Department finding of a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of misconduct, later backslid after changes in leadership, said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. And while Miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement, the Justice Department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms, underscoring some experts\u2019 view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements. Last year, Miami settled the 2013 inquiry by agreeing to improve supervision, training and internal investigations. The \u201cpattern and practice\u201d approach developed after the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1991 forced a period of national introspection over how to curb misconduct if individual officers could not be held accountable. A jury\u2019s decision not to convict the four officers charged in the attack on Mr. King incited deadly riots. Since the early attempts, Mr. Walker said, consent decrees have evolved to be more sophisticated and comprehensive. \u201cThe general pattern is that there is some backsliding on some issues,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a case where a department has completely collapsed back to where it was before. \u201d Still, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the nominee for attorney general under   Donald J. Trump, called them \u201cdangerous,\u201d writing in 2008 that they \u201cconstitute an end run around the democratic process. \u201d At his confirmation hearing this past week, he softened that critique, saying there were some circumstances that legitimately demanded consent decrees and that those already in place would be enforced. But, Mr. Sessions said, lawsuits could unfairly target whole police departments for the misdeeds of a few bad actors. \u201cThese lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,\u201d he said. His critique did not extend to how well consent decrees actually work. But experts say that even systemic changes, like greater oversight of officers\u2019 use of force, can be slow to yield results. \u201cThey change the \u2018inputs\u2019 through training, record keeping, community involvement and other internal reforms, but the inputs don\u2019t necessarily translate into changes in \u2018outputs\u2019 including racial disparities, use of force, or other constitutional issues,\u201d wrote Jeff Fagan, a Columbia University law professor, in an email. \u201cThe results have been quite variable. \u201d Consent decrees can span years and many of the Obama administration\u2019s key settlements have just begun, including those in Cleveland and Albuquerque. So it would be premature to assess their success. Some reform advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will fail to investigate police departments or enforce consent decrees, robbing them of what they view as a crucial lever to compel change. Even some police chiefs might mourn a retreat from consent decrees. Baltimore\u2019s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, has said that a consent decree would aid community relations. Charles H. Ramsey, who as Washington\u2019s police chief invited the Justice Department to review his department, said, \u201cThe DOJ gives legitimacy to the changes that you\u2019re making. \u201d Chiefs may want consent decrees in order to insulate them from political and union opposition to change, as well as make it easier to demand money to pay for reforms. Mr. Sessions wrote in his critique of consent decrees in 2008 that he is aware of that strategy. \u201cSuch decrees are particularly offensive when certain governmental agencies secretly delight in being sued because they hope a settlement will be reached resulting in the agency receiving more money,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus, the taxpayers ultimately fund the settlement enacted through this undemocratic process. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561702.707379}
