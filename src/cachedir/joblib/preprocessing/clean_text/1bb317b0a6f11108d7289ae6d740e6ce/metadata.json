Ambassador John Bolton about the Trump administration\u2019s evidently softening support for Israeli settlement construction. [\u201cI\u2019m concerned about it. I\u2019m concerned about the fact that the embassy hasn\u2019t been moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cIt has the mark of the kind of thinking you hear at the State Department, that questions like the final status of Jerusalem and the argument that settlements are an obstacle to peace. We\u2019ve been hearing these kinds of arguments for 30 or 40 years, and they appear to have gained some traction. \u201d  \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to read too much into it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the end of the world. But if you look at, for example, all of the campaign promises in effect that candidate Trump made, he\u2019s really done an unbelievable job and showed, I think, he\u2019s not a normal politician, in the number of those promises he\u2019s already begun to fulfill or actually fulfilled. The embassy move is kind of conspicuous at this point, so I worry about it. \u201d  \u201cI understand, and I would certainly advocate that when you\u2019re ready to announce it, you\u2019re going to need some very active diplomacy to calm our European friends down, to talk to our friends in the Arab world, to explain why it is we\u2019re doing it. You need a strategy. You need to be prepared for it. I grant all that. But that doesn\u2019t take forever to do, and we\u2019re now approaching the third week. So I don\u2019t know where the vibes are coming from, but I have to say that the fact that this has slowed down, and the comments about the settlements should lead us to ask, \u2018What\u2019s the story?\u2019 I think we need to hear more from the administration on that point,\u201d he said. \u201cThe State Department, all you have to do is tap them on the knee, and you get these kinds of responses. So it could be that somehow or another, this kind of thinking has wended its way over to the White House, and some people over there have been attracted to it, for reasons I don\u2019t frankly understand,\u201d Bolton suggested. \u201cI mean, the \u2018peace processers,\u2019 as they\u2019ve been called, have been at this for a long time, and ultimately it\u2019s always Israel that has to strike the deal, as it did for Egypt and the Camp David accord, as it\u2019s done with Jordan. Our theories about what\u2019s going to lead to peace or what we think the best way to proceed is, is not necessarily as acutely aware of the sensitivities in the region as Israel is. \u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate, I think, that Prime Minister Netanyahu, who will be coming next week, he and President Trump can sit down and hash all this out. Hopefully, both on Iran and on some of these things like the embassy and the settlements, maybe we\u2019ll see some clarity emerge from that meeting,\u201d he said. Bolton offered a fiery denunciation of British House of Commons Speaker John Bercow for effectively banning President Trump from speaking before Parliament. \u201cThis man is an embarrassment to the British Parliament,\u201d he declared. \u201cThere are just any number of stories of his behavior. The position of Speaker of the House of Commons is not the same as in our system, the Speaker of the House of Representatives that Paul Ryan holds. It\u2019s much more of a ceremonial position. This fellow Bercow, again for reasons I don\u2019t understand, is a Conservative Party member, but he doesn\u2019t follow the leadership. He\u2019s a completely independent figure. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s the British constitutional tradition. But somehow, they\u2019ve gotten somebody who seems to think that he has some voice that gives him a role in British politics way beyond his capabilities. \u201d \u201cI think Theresa May\u2019s government, the prime minister, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s outraged at this and would like to try and find a way to correct it. Hopefully, she will,\u201d he added. Marlow also asked Bolton about a new Rasmussen poll that shows Democrats believe Muslims in the United States are worse off than Christians in the Middle East. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of that poll, but that is simply bizarre,\u201d Bolton responded. \u201cIf you go to the U. S. Commission on International Religious Freedom or look at any number of people who have studied this question of the persecution of Christians around the world  \u2014   former Senator Joe Lieberman refers to it often  \u2014   you can see the real threat that they\u2019re under. \u201d  \u201cRight in the Middle East now, the Christians in Syria affected by ISIS and the civil war there, they\u2019re the ones we should be granting refugee status to in the United States. But they\u2019re even afraid to come into the refugee camps because the extremists are dominant there, and they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll be in danger even in U. N. refugee camps. So how people can come to that conclusion is beyond me. Maybe they just watch too much MSNBC,\u201d Bolton said. Marlow built on that point to suggest the Rasmussen poll is evidence that Democrats \u201clive in a bubble, and they don\u2019t seem to get any information outside of the establishment press. \u201d Bolton said he found the results of the poll \u201cinexplicable\u201d as anything but a partisan information bubble. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason, no justification for discriminating against anybody simply because of their religion in this country. That\u2019s what we have a First Amendment for. It was vital to the founding of our country. I think most Americans, whatever their feelings about party affiliation, really are prepared to be tolerant of any religion that respects and tolerates other religions, as well. So I think your point about Democrats living in a bubble is absolutely right,\u201d he told Marlow. \u201cThat should trouble us. It\u2019s not just that they\u2019re wrong it\u2019s that fundamentally, this is going to have a negative effect on our democracy if people are operating in such a   universe,\u201d Bolton warned. John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and founder of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
