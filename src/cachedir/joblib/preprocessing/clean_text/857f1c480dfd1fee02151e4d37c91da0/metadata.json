Trump screamed from behind his desk on the 26th floor of Trump Tower one day last summer, before he won the presidency. Moments later, Rhona Graff, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime executive assistant, popped in from her adjacent corner office. \u201cHow long have you worked for me, Rhona?\u201d Mr. Trump asked. \u201cA couple of dozen years  \u2014   I was 10 years old at the time  \u2014   I was a child prodigy,\u201d Ms. Graff joked. \u201cMr. Trump discovered me. \u201d \u201cMany of the people who are with me have been with me for a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump explained. In business, as a candidate and now as president, Mr. Trump has valued loyalty as the defining attribute in family, aides or Republicans in Congress. He does not always get it, as the defection of the Freedom Caucus last week on the health bill he was trying to pass made abundantly clear. But Mr. Trump can always count on Ms. Graff\u2019s allegiance, and that has made Ms. Graff, from her office in Trump Tower, a major figure in the operations of the White House for a simple reason: She is believed to have a direct line to the president. With her deep Queens accent and unerring deference to her boss (she has always referred to him as Mr. Trump or, usually, as Mr. T) Ms. Graff, 64, is a familiar voice to New York\u2019s business leaders, the nation\u2019s political reporters and now old associates hoping to circumvent the normal channels of communication to reach Mr. Trump. Ms. Graff is a senior vice president of the Trump Organization, and her unofficial role as a back channel to the president raises questions about whether Mr. Trump is skirting the Federal Records Act, which governs the preservation of schedules and correspondence from the president, something the White House denied in response to questions about her role from Politico. Reached on Sunday, Ms. Graff declined to comment. \u201cI like staying behind the scenes,\u201d she said in a conversation last year in which she rejected a reporter\u2019s proposal to shadow her for a day because so much private campaign, business and personal information crossed her desk. \u201cWe\u2019re so intertwined when he\u2019s here,\u201d she said. Or, as she once put it to Real Estate Weekly, \u201cEverybody knows in order to get through to him they have to go through me. \u201d Ms. Graff, a Queens College graduate with a master\u2019s degree in psychology, left a sports marketing job after college to spend more time at home with her ailing mother. Eventually in search of another job, she heard about an opening in Mr. Trump\u2019s office, and in 1987 called cold. They hit it off. Since entering the Trump Organization\u2019s secretarial pool, Ms. Graff has acted as Mr. Trump\u2019s media liaison, scheduler, sometimes spokeswoman,   planner, \u201cApprentice\u201d   and Miss Teen USA judge. And regardless of who is taking Mr. Trump\u2019s calls in Washington, it is Ms. Graff who occupies a more central space in the Trump orbit. In 1991, during Mr. Trump\u2019s brush with going broke, it was Ms. Graff, \u201cmy very loyal secretary,\u201d as he put it in \u201cThe Art of the Comeback,\u201d who came into his office to tell him that his estranged wife, Ivana, was on the phone with the message, as he put it in the book, \u201cI vant my money now. \u201d In 1993, Mayor David N. Dinkins presided at the wedding of Ms. Graff to Lucius Joseph Riccio, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, and later nicknamed Professor Pothole by The New Yorker for pioneering the field of pothole analytics at Columbia University. For decades, Ms. Graff worked under the tutelage of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime personal assistant, Norma Infante Foerderer, who died in 2013 from a heart attack after a difficult eye surgery. \u201cShe\u2019d still be here if she didn\u2019t have that problem,\u201d Ms. Graff lamented in Mr. Trump\u2019s office last year. \u201cA disaster,\u201d Mr. Trump agreed. But by 2005, the year Ms. Foerderer retired, Ms. Graff was already ascendant in an office that loomed large among the nation\u2019s secretaries. (A poll of secretaries by a staple company showed that Mr. Trump trailed only President George W. Bush when it came to the country\u2019s imagined toughest bosses.) In 2004, Ms. Graff became a recurring character on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and in 2008, she was briefly listed as the secretary for a luxury golf course in Scotland before a Trump confidant, George Sorial, replaced her. In 2013, she attained boldfaced name status in Page Six of The New York Post as \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s right hand. \u201d Since Mr. Trump has technically stopped running the Trump Organization, Ms. Graff now forwards messages to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal assistant in the White House, Madeleine Westerhout, whom Ms. Graff helped train. Sometimes she forwards messages to Katie Walsh, one of the deputy chiefs of staff a White House spokeswoman maintained that messages are routinely sent to an official point of contact, instead of directly to the president. Mr. Trump\u2019s dedication to his secretary and hers to him is much like the relationship Fred C. Trump, his father, had with his secretary, Amy Luerssen, treating her like family. He once had workers carry her up 12 flights of stairs when her elevator stopped working, lent her nephew his wife\u2019s pink Cadillac when his car was stolen and would see her off at the airport when she went on a trip. When Ms. Luerssen\u2019s niece, Kathy Quigley, tried to bring her aging aunt down to Florida, she said Donald Trump and his brother, Robert, insisted that Ms. Luerssen stay until she was senile. \u201cIt was a little bit of a battle because I was thinking, \u2018Gee, I\u2019d really like her to be down here with me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Quigley said. \u201cBut she was very happy. \u201d When her aunt died in 2006, a death notice appeared in The New York Times that read, \u201cThe Trump family mourns the passing of our beloved Amy, a trusted and loyal friend and employee for over 65 years. \u201d Mr. Trump compared his father\u2019s dedication to Ms. Luerssen to his own loyalty to Ms. Graff. \u201cMy father was very loyal to people,\u201d he said last summer. \u201cI think I am too. \u201d Ms. Graff was clearly touched. \u201cWell thank you boss,\u201d she said. \u201cWell it works both ways obviously. I\u2019d never leave him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563174.0682356}
