NBC announced on Wednesday that it was bringing back its celebrated comedy \u201cWill  Grace\u201d for 10 episodes during the   TV season. The show\u2019s original cast  \u2014   Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally  \u2014   will all return, as will the show\u2019s director, James Burrows, and the show\u2019s creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. TV is going through a 1990s and early 2000s nostalgia craze, and \u201cWill  Grace\u201d is far from the first show to make a comeback. Netflix\u2019s \u201cFull House\u201d revival, \u201cFuller House,\u201d has already had two seasons. The streaming service also brought back \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d in November. Fox brought back \u201cThe  \u201d with its original cast, and it was a ratings hit for the network last year. \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d will return in May, with many of the original cast members. \u201cWill  Grace,\u201d which ran from 1998 to 2006, was a hit and a critical darling  \u2014   each of the lead cast members won an Emmy for their roles, and the show won the best comedy Emmy in its second season. NBC is having the strongest year among the big four networks in the most important audience to advertisers: adults under 50. But it is still in the midst of retooling its comedy slate, and \u201cWill  Grace\u201d could give it a shot in the arm whenever the show winds up running in the next season. Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement, \u201cThis groundbreaking series for everything from gay rights to social and political commentary  \u2014   all disguised as a   train of witty pop culture  \u2014   is coming back where it belongs. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562843.217675}
