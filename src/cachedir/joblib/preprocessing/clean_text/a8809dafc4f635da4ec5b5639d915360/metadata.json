One mother, commenting on the program on the parenting site Mumsnet, said her daughter had questioned her gender identity and asked her \u201canxiously, if that means she was a boy\u201d. \\nBut the BBC has defended the show, insisting that it was merely trying to \u201creflect true life\u201d. It said there was enough context for children to understand the theme. \\nNorman Wells, a family campaigner disagreed. He said: \u201cIt is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562753.836425}
