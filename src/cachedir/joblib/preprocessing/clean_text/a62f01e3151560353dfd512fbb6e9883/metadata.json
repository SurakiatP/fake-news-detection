[Both the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) recently held their own suppressor demonstration for media members with the goal of showing what suppressors will and will not do. For example, suppressors reduce the sound of a gunshot \u2014  making it manageable and protecting hearing \u2014  but they do not silence firearms. NSSF\u2019s Larry Keane said, \u201cWe prefer to refer to them as \u2018suppressors,\u2019 because that more accurately describes what they do. \u201d He added:  They reduce the noise of gunfire, but they don\u2019t block it. They are simply a muffler for your gun. You hear a car go by without a muffler and it\u2019s loud, but you can still hear it with a muffler. Even former ATF agent David Chipman, a Gabby Giffords\u2019 gun control supporter, believes \u201csuppressor\u201d is the better term for devices that reduce the decibel level of a gunshot. But according to the Hill, Shannon Watts thinks the word \u201csuppressor\u201d is the result of a \u201cgun lobby\u201d tactic to confuse her members and other gun control proponents: \u201cIt\u2019s all semantics. Focusing on the name distracts people from the real conversation,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThey did the same thing with the debate over whether to use the term \u2018assault rifles\u2019 or \u2018semiautomatic rifles,\u2019 and then the whole conversation shifted to \u2018What are we going to call these things? \u2019\u201d \u201cThey want to get into semantics about the language, so we don\u2019t talk about how dangerous they are. \u201d Watts\u2019s fellow gun controllers at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are also taking issue with the difference between silenced and suppressed, warning their members to be wary of \u201cgun lobby\u201d claims that suppressors do not silence guns: . @NRA  @NSSF say silencers rn\u2019t dangerous   they don\u2019t fully suppress sound of guns.
