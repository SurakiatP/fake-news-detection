Teachers have said they\u2019ve heard some kids in the cafeteria chanting \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d or saying they don\u2019t want Muslims here,\u2019 Roger said. \u2018I mean, kids often repeat what they hear on the TV or the news, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK. (In other words, you don\u2019t think the First Amendment is OK) \u201cWe have a diverse community here. We want all our students to feel valued.\u201d (So we don\u2019t become the target of an Islamic terrorist attack?) \u2018It\u2019s important for our students to be able to express their opinions, but it\u2019s also important for them to be informed about it and not just repeating what they happen to hear,\u2019 Rogers said. (Especially if it goes against the Democrat talking points. This IS New York, after all)'"}, "time": 1742563713.113083}
