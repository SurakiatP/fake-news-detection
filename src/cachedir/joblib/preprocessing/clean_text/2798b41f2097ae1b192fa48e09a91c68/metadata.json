The weight loss had a lot to do with my break up with my ex \u2013 I was being served every meal daily, and when we broke up I had to take care of myself.I never feared death before \u2013 it was something I never thought about when I was getting bigger and bigger. But when I reached my lowest and couldn\u2019t walk to the bathroom without getting winded I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be there for my kids and grand kids. My struggles didn\u2019t fully surface until I was single and had no one to help me and couldn\u2019t cook, bathe, or leave the house \u2013 it was very lonely,\u201d she said in an interview. Today, with the help of her sons, Patty eats 3,000 calories a day and is more mobile. \\n\\nShe said: \u201cI stay away from fast food and eat more vegetables, fruits and poultry. Now I can do things that people take for granted that I couldn\u2019t do - like walk, bathe, and paint my toenails which I couldn\\'t reach for years.\" \\n\\n\\n\u201cMy children are very proud of me for changing my life around - we have a better relationship now,\" she added.\\n\\n\\nSizzling Feed SOURCE '"}, "time": 1742561750.9152174}
