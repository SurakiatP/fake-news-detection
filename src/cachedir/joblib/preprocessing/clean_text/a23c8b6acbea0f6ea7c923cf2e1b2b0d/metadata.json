Is Washington \u201cFalse Flagging\u201d The New Russia-Iran-Syria-China \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d, Into Nuclear War? By Peter Koenig on October 26, 2016 The penultimate goal is total militarization of the western world, to prevent and suppress protests and revolts . \\nby Peter Koenig \\nFalse flagging has hundreds of years of history; successful history that is, otherwise the method of lying and bullying people into false beliefs, that would not have survived the times. \\nBut false flags took on a new dimension since 9/11. The subsequent terror acts, including the Arab Spring and \u2018Color Revolutions\u2019; downing of a Russian plane over Egypt; shooting down of a Malaysian plane over the Ukraine; Paris murderous shootings at \u2018Charlie Hebdo\u2019 and \u2018Bataclan\u2019; Brussels; Nice; Munich; Orlando, Florida; San Bernardino, California \u2013 to name just a few over the last years \u2013 were perpetrated by the very actors claiming to fight terror, namely predominantly the secret services of the US, UK and Israel, the European vassals and NATO. The purpose of such acts of terror is to create fear, to justify a police crackdown on the populations and each time doing away with more of the democratic civil rights still left in western society. \\nThe penultimate goal is total militarization of the western world, to prevent and suppress protests and revolts if and when the population eventually wakes up to the flagrant lies that it has been force-fed by the presstitute media for years on end. \\nAnd that in itself is a crucial step towards the ultimate goal of Full Spectrum Dominance of the world, or world hegemony, by a small corporate and financial elite. Alas, militarization of the west and ongoing wars and chaos throughout the world, causing millions of death \u2013 estimated between 12 and 15 million in the last 15 years \u2013 will not suffice to dominate the eastern powers led by Russia and China. Do the elites who pull the strings in Washington want a nuclear war? It may fulfill their pathological objective of total annihilation of the world as we know it, possibly with hundreds of millions of casualties. Just look at Aleppo and multiply this image by a million. See also Kissinger\u2019s 1974 Plan for Food Control Genocide. https://www.schillerinstitute.org/food_for_peace/kiss_nssm_jb_1995.html . Emails expose close ties between Hillary Clinton and former Secretary of State and accused war criminal Henry Kissinger. Is reduction of world population by any means a major objective: Kissinger\u2019s 1974 \u2018study\u2019 on famine as genocide, was commissioned in full connivance with Monsanto and the GMO technology \u2013 a food war, the preparation of which is ongoing as the world is facing a nuclear threat. \\nIntensified through four decades of Cold War, the US has grown increasingly dependent on the military \u2013 security industry for its economic advances. Creating weapons to exploit and destroy in foreign lands what later needs reconstruction is an easy way to making huge profits, sustaining an otherwise outsourced production economy and an ever poorer local population that lives off imported junk. \\nThis is true for the misinformed US and European public. The West is sinking by its own inaction into a deep hole. \\nHowever, the need for more sophisticated weaponry and more destruction is spiraling exponentially, as greed, avarice and power know no limits. A WWIII scenario is becoming an imminent danger.   wars \\nDo the neocon architects of US foreign policy hope to survive a nuclear inferno in their lush bunkers? The western presstitute media portrays the US as fighting in the Middle East and elsewhere \u2018humanitarian wars\u2019 to stamp out terrorism and other atrocities committed by the new Killary anointed Axis of Evil, Russia-Iran-Syria, and by association, China. The basic premise is, they are the \u201cgood guys\u201d and the Russians under Putin\u2019s orders are constantly interfering with America\u2019s humanitarian deeds. This sick understanding, continuously touted by the western media controlled by the six Zionist-Anglo media giants, and repeated hourly, will make massive, credible false-flagging like a walk in the park \u2013 a walk in which about a billion \u2018westerners\u2019 are cheering for war against the eastern evil. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Russia \\nCurrently the US is secretly on DEFCON level 3 warning against a Russian nuclear attack (DEFCON = Defense Readiness Condition) . The American public doesn\u2019t know it. \u2013 Level 3 means an attack could be days away; level one would imply an imminent attack within less than an hour. \\nThis in itself is a false flag, a make-believe that a first strike may come from Russia, when the Pentagon hawks openly boast that a first preventive strike is not off the table. Some high level generals even push for it. \\nThere is a massive orchestrated build-up of potential false flags around the globe that would allow a first strike nuclear attack on several fronts against Russia, Syria, Iran and China, by the US armed forces, NATO and the European vassals\u2019 own armies. Israel is poised to launch an attack against Iran. \\nSyria \u2013 the 20-nation Peace Talks of Saturday 15 October 2016 in Lausanne, Switzerland, focusing on an Aleppo cease fire, predictably failed to produce any tangible results. Nevertheless, in a real humanitarian effort, Russia has declared an 8-hour truce to begin on Thursday, 20 October, \u201cWe have taken a decision not to waste time and to introduce \u2018humanitarian pauses\u2019, mainly for the free passage of civilians, evacuation of the sick and wounded and withdrawal of fighters. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoi, chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces \\nThe ceasefire would run from 0800 to 1600 local time (0500 GMT to 1300 GMT) \u201cin the area of Aleppo. During this period the Russian air force and Syrian government troops will halt air strikes and firing from any other types of weapons,\u201d as \u2018vanguardngr.com\u2019 quoted senior Russian military officer Sergei Rudskoi as saying at a press briefing. \u2013 Later the truce has been extended to 11 hours and at yesterday\u2019s (19 October) \u2018peace discussion\u2019 in Berlin, hosted by Madame Merkel, Mr. Putin said he would be prepared to extend it to 3 days, if all the parties were committed to observe it. \\nWhat if \u2013 in defiance of this mini-ceasefire \u2013 US, US-proxies, or NATO fighters keep bombing Syrian army ground troops in the Aleppo region, as well as hospitals and civilian populations, to encourage Al-Nusra, cum IS terrorists to stay their course and keep sowing misery and killing civilians? \u2013 Russia has warned Washington that any attack on Assad\u2019s troops would be the object of retaliation. Might such a scenario be a provocation to start a hot WWIII? \u2013 Precedents of defying cease fire agreements and blaming Russia for it exist in the not so distant past: 17 September, when the US air force \u2018by mistake\u2019 attacked Assad\u2019s ground forces killing 62 soldiers \u2013 and who knows how many civilians \u2013 then, through the complicit MSM blamed Russia for it. US attack on Syrian troops not an accident, definitely intentional \u2013 Assad to AP \\nIt is not inconceivable that US war planes painted to look like Russians, could attack their own Air Force in Syria or Iraq, blaming Russia, thereby triggering a US first strike. \\nWith the brainwashed western population, the false flag would be an easy sell as a Russian aggression, justifying Washington\u2019s \u2018first strike\u2019. \\nAmerica\u2019s indefectible British ally has recently given its fighter jet pilots \u2018permission\u2019 to fire on Russian aircraft in Syria. \u2013 What if they actually do so, as a US proxy? \u2013 And Russia retaliates against a NATO country \u2013 which is according to NATO rules an aggression against all NATO. This could mean an all-out war. US and NATO bases in Europe would not be spared. By now there are 24 bases, an increase from 14 since 1991, when the West promised not to expand NATO. This would plunge Europe for the third time in 100 years into \u2013 this time an all-annihilating \u2013 war scenario. How can Europe not see and understand this? \\nYemen \u2013 Since March 2015 a Saudi led coalition, for which until recently Washington provided weapons, logistical and intelligence support, is bombing the Houthi rebels. The Houtis, fighting for freedom from the western domination, have seized the Presidential Palace in Sana\u2019a, sending the despotic US puppet President Hadi to Saudi Arabia into exile. The Houthis enjoy the backing of the majority of the Yemeni population and are considered the legitimate government. They also receive logistics support from Iran. They control about a quarter of the Yemeni landmass but more than three quarters of the population. The Saudis have been cowardly targeting mostly civilian populations, family celebrations, like weddings and funerals, humanitarian food and medical supplies and hospitals, slaughtering tens of thousands of mainly women and children. A couple of weeks ago the US and UK Air Forces have joined the Saudis in this atrocious war. The Geo-Political Nature of the Strait of Hormuz \\nWhile the Houthis have called on President Putin for help, the US has now called, through the UN, for a 72-hour ceasefire to enter into effect on 19 October mid-night. The official purpose is \u2018humanitarian aid\u2019, but the real reason is for the alliance of aggressors to regroup and strategize. It is inconceivable that the Master of Chaos would let go of such an optimal strategically placed country, overlooking the Gulf of Oman and the Iran controlled Strait of Hormuz, through which currently about 25 % of the world\u2019s hydrocarbons sail. A western planted false flag, depicting a Russian intervention, could easily activate a full-scale war. \\nIsrael, entering friendly relations with the Saudis, has asked the House of Saud for access to Saudi airfields which they may use to launch a \u2018preemptive\u2019 attack against Iran. \\nInternet spying and cyber war accusations against President Putin \u2013 most ridiculous, but with sledgehammer propaganda the American and most of European population will gulp this lie as the truth \u2013 and encourage US, UK and Israeli secret services (the infamous trio) to do likewise. \\nThe argument is that Mr. Putin wants to derail US elections in favor of Donald Trump and hacking into DNC computers to divulge Democratic party corruption scandals \u2013 laying bare Madame Clinton\u2019s corruption and lies. Apparently the CIA has already declared a cyber war against President Putin. \\nRussia could potentially retaliate, jamming key US strategic war systems with DRFM (Digital Radio Frequency Memory) technology, already successfully applied in 2015 in Syria, near Latakia, disrupting all US-NATO Radar and Satellites Communication systems. \u2013 Might such a possible retaliation and escalation in cyber warfare be translated into a lethal aggression by Russia, justifying a full-out war, with nuclear consequences? \\nOn 19 October, Presidents Putin, Hollande and Poroshenko traveled to Berlin at the invitation of Madame Merkel to discuss Syria and implementation of a peace plan for eastern Ukraine. First, how come, a sovereign country like Syria is discussed by foreign powers, without \u2013 and I mean without any representation of Mr. Assad\u2019s government? It is a human and diplomatic aberration. But what else would we expect from the west. Still, people need to be reminded that what appears normal is NOT normal at all. \\nThe little that emerged from the meeting is that Mr. Hollande went home frustrated since Mr. Putin did not stand up to \u2018his responsibilities in Ukraine\u2019- what a flagrant lie! And Hollande knows it! \u2013 A lso was disclosed that no real agreement was reached on how to go about achieving peace in Syria. Putin answering questions regarding ISIS from a US journalist \\nObviously for the western stooges of Washington, present in Berlin, there is only one way a \u2018solution\u2019 could be found: \u2018Regime Change\u2019. They will not let go. Even though Hollande and Merkel know absolutely well, why the US instigated the war in Syria, by recruiting and preparing, arming and funding terror groups already in 2007 (look for \u2018Syria\u2019 in this article \\nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/its-not-just-the-oil-the-middle-east-war-and-the-conquest-of-natural-gas-reserves/5307589 \\nOn Ukraine \u2013 Poroshenko has promised a new road map for peace, nothing more exciting. The practical deadlock on Syria and \u2018no news\u2019 on Ukraine was to be expected. It is of course being blamed by both Hollande and Merkel on Vladimir Putin, who has never played a role in either conflict, both of them are the result of the evil fist of Washington. \\nMr. Putin entered Syria only at the demand of Mr. Assad, to defend and rid the country of western implanted terrorists. He is also doing everything possible to pacify Ukraine, to no avail. \\nThe west doesn\u2019t want peace, but they want to blame Russia for the conflicts. Failure of the Merkel meeting might possibly be followed by a false flag against Kiev or Aleppo, to be put on Putin\u2019s account, what else. Remember, the US Air Force has jets painted as Russian jets. \\nChina \\nWould a US provocation on the Chinese controlled Spratly Islands, or an infringement on China\u2019s air and land space, as there have been many in the past, become a trigger for engaging China in a nuclear aggression? South China sea \\nHot spots around the world devastated to chaos by the empire abound. Anyone of them is a potential launch path for an atomic mushroom. Should this happen before the upcoming US elections, Obama might just stay on for another term. He has all the experience it needs to create more chaos and more division to conquer than any of his predecessors. He is also an obedient servant to those that pull the strings and watch through the eye on top of the pyramid, so clearly depicted in the US dollar bill, the symbol for Zionist-Freemason total hegemony. But importantly, he, like Hillary, would most likely not hesitate to push the Red Bottom, when asked to do so by their masters. \\nCopyright \u00a9 Peter Koenig , Global Research, 2016 Related Posts:'"}, "time": 1742628565.8325903}
