For Bannon, raised in an Irish Catholic Democratic household in Richmond, VA, President Carter\u2019s botched rescue mission during the Iran hostage crisis was a political turning point. [From the Washington Post:  As Bannon has told it, the failed hostage rescue is one of the defining moments of his life, providing a searing example of failed military and presidential leadership  \u2014   one that he carries with him as he serves as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist.

S. military power and its commander in chief.   \u2026     Some of Bannon\u2019s shipmates recalled that the crew was given a ribbon for its modest role [in the rescue mission]. But Bannon and many other crew members were livid at Carter for the botched rescue. \u201cIt shattered his confidence in President Carter,\u201d Masso said. \u201cIt made him all the more in the tank for Reagan. \u201d In October 1980, with the Foster in port at Long Beach, Bannon went to Masso\u2019s home to watch a   debate. \u201cHe watched that debate like a prizefight,\u201d Masso said. Three months later, after Reagan won the election, Bannon was working for the new president, serving as an assistant in the office of the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon. He watched with satisfaction as Reagan increased the military budget and strengthened the Navy, with most of the focus on combating the Soviet Union. He served for three years and simultaneously studied national security and earned a master\u2019s degree at Georgetown University. Read the rest here. '"}, "time": 1742562992.6955106}
