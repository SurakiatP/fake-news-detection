Set in the 1930s, partly in Los Angeles, its script compulsively mentions Hollywood stars of the era. Joan Blondell! Robert Taylor! Barbara Stanwyck! Cagney and Crawford! Astaire and Rogers! Their names ring out like answers to trivia questions nobody had thought to ask. At a recent New York critics\u2019 screening, one fellow a few rows behind me chuckled at every name. I don\u2019t think because the allusions were especially funny  \u2014   the sentence \u201cAdolphe Menjou is threatening to walk off the set\u201d is not exactly a   even in context  \u2014   but because they signified a cultural awareness that the laugher in the dark wanted the rest of us to know he shared. And also perhaps because the dropped names stood in for jokes that the modern audience is too ignorant to get and that Mr. Allen has grown too lazy to make. He can gaze back fondly at the   golden age of   popular culture, and the rest of us can wistfully recall a time when he was able to spin those memories into better films than this one. There\u2019s no point in growing  . \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d is not \u201cRadio Days\u201d or \u201cBullets Over Broadway. \u201d We can live with that. I\u2019m happy to report that it\u2019s not \u201cThe Curse of the Jade Scorpion\u201d or \u201cMagic in the Moonlight,\u201d either. Which is to say that it\u2019s neither another example of bad, late Woody Allen nor much in the way of a return to form. It is, overall, an amusing little picture, with some inspired moments and some sour notes, a handful of interesting performances and the hint, now and then, of an idea. Like most of Mr. Allen\u2019s recent work, this movie takes place within the hermetically enclosed universe of its maker\u2019s   preoccupations. Rather than find fresh themes or problems, he likes to rearrange the old ones into a newish pattern, emphasizing some elements and letting others drift into the background. Here the dominant conceit is Mr. Allen\u2019s   ambivalence about California and the industry that has often seemed ambivalent about him. He loves movies, but Hollywood, with its shallowness and gossip, has always repelled him. But with the help of his gifted collaborators, the production designer Santo Loquasto and the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, he bathes \u201cthe film colony\u201d in golden light and swathes its denizens in lovely period clothes. He sends an ambitious Bronx boy, Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) out West to seek his fortune. At first   by his Uncle Phil (Steve Carell) a powerful agent, Bobby is eventually taken under Phil\u2019s wing and plunged into a swirl of parties and power lunches. He\u2019s suitably intoxicated by his new surroundings. \u201cI\u2019ve never mixed Champagne with bagels and lox,\u201d he says. \u201cWelcome to Hollywood,\u201d someone replies. That\u2019s not a bad line, and there are some other pretty good ones sprinkled throughout the sprawling script. Bobby\u2019s bickering parents, played by Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott, supply a few   laughs, as well as the requisite touch of metaphysical fatalism. (\u201cI accept death, but under protest,\u201d Dad says. \u201cProtest to who?\u201d Mom responds. Also not a bad line.) The ensemble is larger and the story looser than in Mr. Allen\u2019s last few movies, making room for Corey Stoll\u2019s relaxed turn as Bobby\u2019s charismatic gangster brother and Parker Posey and Paul Schneider\u2019s intriguing double act as a cynical and apparently happily married pair of bicoastal sophisticates. The axis on which everything turns is an   love triangle that includes, of course, the passion of an older man for a younger woman. It turns out that Bobby and Phil are both in love with a transplanted Nebraskan called Vonnie (short for Veronica) who is Phil\u2019s secretary. Kristen Stewart\u2019s performance in the role, which blends gravity and lightness, glamour and its opposite, is certainly the best part of \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society,\u201d but it also exposes just how thin and tired the rest of the movie is. Mr. Allen\u2019s literal voice, which supplies narration, sounds unusually sluggish and weary. The same is true of his voice as a writer and director. For every snappy scene or exchange there are three or four that feel baggy and  . We are treated to one survey of the clientele at the swanky Manhattan nightclub that is Bobby\u2019s   professional perch and then, a while later, to another. We wander into jazz clubs and dining rooms and seem unsure of why we\u2019ve come. Blake Lively, wandering into the movie\u2019s second half as a second Veronica, seems to feel the same way. The movie seems much longer than its 96 minutes. Every once in a while we hear or see something that makes us cringe a little: a harsh, unfunny encounter between Bobby and a prostitute shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles an anecdote about Errol Flynn\u2019s sexual interest in underage girls. It\u2019s hard to say if Mr. Allen is testing the audience\u2019s tolerance or trolling our sensitivities, or for that matter if he\u2019s just blithely carrying on as he always has, oblivious to changing mores or the vicissitudes of his own reputation. It doesn\u2019t really matter because \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d ultimately poses no interesting questions about its maker or its characters. The movie most closely resembles the kind of Hollywood product for which its deepest nostalgia is reserved. It\u2019s a   throwaway, a charming bit of trivia, the punch line to a   joke. \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). Surprisingly bloody murders and surprisingly bloodless romance. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes. '"}, "time": 1742561941.1843288}
