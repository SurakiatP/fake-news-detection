This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. \\nSome reporters in attendance were NBC\u2019s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC\u2019s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News\u2019 Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC\u2019s Phil Griffin; and CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. \\nUnfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , \u201cIt was like a f*cking firing squad.\u201d \\nTrump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: \\n\u201cThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.\u201d \\nThis claim was backed up by another person, who said: \\n\u201cThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. \\n\u201cTrump kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.\u201d \\nThis attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. \\nAmericans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter \\nInterestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: \\n\u201cExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.\u201d \\nDisgraceful. \\nFeatured image by Christopher Furlong via Getty Images Share this Article!
