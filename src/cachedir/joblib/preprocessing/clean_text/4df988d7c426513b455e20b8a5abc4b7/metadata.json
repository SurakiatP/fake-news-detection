The mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Erica Derryck, issue a statement on May 1 claiming that Schaaf\u2019s plan\u2019s use of the revenues is \u201cconsistent with the goals of the measure. \u201d City of Oakland voters approved Measure HH on the November ballot by an over 61 percent majority. The initiative assessed a tax of     on the distribution of   beverage products including sodas, sports drinks, sweetened teas, energy drinks and fruit products that were not 100 percent pure juice. The City Council\u2019s big selling point to voters for the tax increase was the Oakland City Auditor\u2019s \u201cImpartial Analysis of Measure HH\u2019\u201dthat promised soda tax revenues would be managed by a   \u2018Community Advisory Board comprised of medical, dental and School District parents to determine \u201chow and to what extent the City Council should establish and fund programs to prevent or reduce the health consequences of consuming   beverages in Oakland. \u201d The big reason that the City of Oakland is willing to anger voters is that the union wage and pension costs from the city council\u2019s July 2014 passage of a $15 minimum wage are jumping. With the latest spike to $12. 86 an hour on January 1, the mayor and her 5 council allies are desperate to find new cash. The Oakland City Council\u2019s own December 2014 minimum wage staff report highlighted that that there was no \u201clegislative solution\u201d to address the annual   impact from thousands of unionized city recreational aides, senior aides and   student trainees jumping in cost by 35 percent from $18, 155 to $24, 500 per year. The city\u2019s SEIU contract also requires equivalent higher contributions for sick leave and pension benefits. The California Policy Center reported that the Oakland\u2019s Human Resources Management Department also expected a $15 minimum wage to have a contractual ripple effect from the \u201ccompaction\u201d of city wage comparisons. SEIU labor contracts mandate that   public employees must also receive compaction wage and pension increases. Councilman Noel Gallo told the San Francisco CBS TV affiliate that there is no problem with how the soda tax will now be spent because \u201cIt will be used to support children and family activities. \u201d Gallo says the soda tax will support libraries, parks, fix potholes, and build affordable housing. Critics point out that the burden of the soda tax falls disproportionately on the poor. The first hearing of the mayor\u2019s budget will be on May 5. The final City of Oakland budget must be adopted by June 30.'"}, "time": 1742562492.0284822}
