Trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved Fifth Avenue. \u201cHaving ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis disgraceful. \u201d In another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as \u201cmy little darling. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re everything I hoped for,\u201d he wrote. In a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, \u201cI am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. \u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting Twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. But perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of Trump Tower. Churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. The tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. Tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. Viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. The 2009 letter that Mr. Trump sent to Mike Tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: It denounced a film by Mr. Tollin that explored Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the collapse of a football league as \u201cthird rate\u201d and \u201cextremely dishonest. \u201d In a fulminating flourish, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cP. S. You are a loser. \u201d Nevertheless, Mr. Tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. \u201cPeople come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,\u201d Mr. Tollin said with pride. Today, as Mr. Trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. His handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio host in Milwaukee, who has described Mr. Trump as a \u201cwhiny,   bully. \u201d \u201cCharlie,\u201d began Mr. Trump\u2019s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of The New York Times, next to an article about skeptical Republicans warming to Mr. Trump, \u201cI hope you can change your mind. \u201d Ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: \u201cLook forward to doing your show,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI will win!\u201d It did not change Mr. Sykes\u2019s dim view of Mr. Trump. But he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. \u201cGive him credit that he\u2019s doing this,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. \u201d The letters  \u2014   culled from personal and public archives  \u2014   reveal Mr. Trump\u2019s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. From early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. In the 1990s, Mr. Trump occasionally fawned over New York\u2019s brash mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. In one letter, Mr. Trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called Mr. Giuliani \u201cthe greatest mayor that the city\u2019s ever had. \u201d In case Mr. Giuliani missed the homage, Mr. Trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: \u201cRudy, you are the greatest!\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201csee you soon. \u201d There is never any question about authorship: Mr. Trump\u2019s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201ctremendous,\u201d abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. In a 1985 letter to Mayor Edward I. Koch, Mr. Trump predicted New York City\u2019s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, Arthur E. Imperatore Sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between New Jersey and Manhattan. \u201cReal estate values and taxes in New York would plummet,\u201d Mr. Trump prognosticated darkly. \u201cWhy would anyone want to live or shop in New York?\u201d (Mr. Imperatore started the ferry service without destroying New York\u2019s economy.) As a writer, Mr. Trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. In a 1983 letter to A. M. Rosenthal, then the executive editor of The Times and a lunch companion, Mr. Trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that Mr. Rosenthal had written about returning to  Poland for the first time in decades. \u201cIt is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, Ivana, who grew up in Eastern Europe, agreed. \u201cIt truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the Polish people,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. He could write with striking tenderness to Ivana, according to notes reviewed by The Times. \u201cI adore and love my little darling,\u201d he wrote to her in one. \u201cI truly believe that you are the greatest,\u201d he wrote in another. On the page, anyway, Mr. Trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of \u201clittle talent\u201d in a 1985 note to Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, then the publisher of The Times. (Mr. Trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) Mr. Trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over Franklin M. Jarman, who controlled a Manhattan department store that Mr. Trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for Trump Tower. Mr. Jarman rarely replied to Mr. Trump\u2019s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, Mr. Trump wrote in his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d laying the groundwork for an agreement. \u201cThe letters I wrote eventually did have an impact,\u201d Mr. Trump said. For years, Mr. Trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. But over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era  \u2014   sort of. He still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers\u2019 corrections and athletes\u2019 autographs, a black Sharpie. Now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. But he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. \u201cIf I had a secretary to do them,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be nearly as effective, they wouldn\u2019t be nearly as sharp. \u201d Each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or \u201ca seismograph,\u201d as Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair and a repeat recipient of Mr. Trump\u2019s screeds, described it. Many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. Mr. Trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in Texas, John Russell Niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. \u201cWork hard and be smart,\u201d Mr. Trump told him. The letter now hangs on Mr. Niederer\u2019s bedroom wall. \u201cFor him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,\u201d he said, \u201cwas really, really cool. \u201d A vindictive side is never far from view in Mr. Trump\u2019s correspondence. After the basketball legend Kareem   wrote a critical essay in The Washington Post about Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, Mr. Trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. \u201cNow I know why the press always treated you so badly  \u2014   they couldn\u2019t stand you,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cThe fact is that you don\u2019t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again!\u201d Mr.   said he was flabbergasted. \u201cIt was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, \u2018Well, nobody likes you!\u2019 \u201d he said. He likened Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to write his reply on the original article to \u201ca dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. \u201d Mr.   had to get rid of the letter. \u201cI crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,\u201d he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. Others cannot let go. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to keep it,\u201d Mr. Sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. \u201cProbably in a desk drawer. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561980.8898003}
