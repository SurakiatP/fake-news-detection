I think Iraq/perrsmerga said they lost about 4 around Mosel just yesterday alone. \\nThey ain't looking real exceptional at the moment. If its any consolation neither have any other tanks when up against this stuff. \\nThe only one I have seen yet to be able to survive them is the russian T-90. Any earlier than that like the T64 and T-72 have same problems because of the ammo being placed inside the operators compartment and this was moved in the T-90. I have seen 4-5 of these take direct hits and survive. \\nAlso some tanks wiht homemade slat armor mave made it but not many. GoldRulesPaperDrools   \\nWhile we (the U.S. gov't) have been spending money on MREs and MRAPs and bullets, the Russians have been improving their tech. Instead of sending money to a fat piggie affirmative action baby runnind the DoJ to investigate BLM `issues, the Smirking Chimp in the White House would be better served spending money on the military to upgrade our now-two decade old military tech.
