{"duration": 0.05184054374694824, "input_args": {"text": "'Speaking of \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d HBO\u2019s glossy new melodrama starring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern, an HBO executive has said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 here. \u201d Maybe they should have thought harder about that. Whatever surface advantage \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d may have in sophistication and seriousness over \u201cDesperate Housewives,\u201d it could have learned a few lessons from that   ABC potboiler in how to tell a story and keep an audience entertained. Like \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d in its first season, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (which begins Sunday and was based on a novel by the Australian writer Liane Moriarty) juxtaposes the mystery of a suspicious death with the seemingly perfect everyday lives of a group of mostly prosperous women. The main characters, all suspects in the mystery, are linked because their children attend the same progressive elementary school in Monterey, Calif. which is said to be \u201ca private school at a   price. \u201d Their lives, of course, are anything but perfect, and the show\u2019s drama comes from unspooling the tangles of violence, infidelity and frustration just below the surface. It doesn\u2019t come from the mystery, which, through six of the season\u2019s seven episodes, hangs offscreen like a dead fish. The show\u2019s writer, the veteran David E. Kelley, and director,   Vall\u00e9e (\u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d) do not show the process of detection at all  \u2014   no evidence, no clues, no cops showing up at inconvenient times. We don\u2019t even know who\u2019s dead, a cliffhanger (or red herring?) presumably saved for the last episode. What we do get are snippets of police interviews with a Greek chorus of minor characters  \u2014   other parents from the school  \u2014   who happily testify to the imperfections of the leads. Turning the mystery into such a complete MacGuffin as a way to foreground the domestic drama might make sense if that drama were, say, interesting. But the real problem with \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d is that the women\u2019s stories, however well acted and artfully photographed, are just a compendium of clich\u00e9s about    angst. Not interested in the mom who\u2019s bored with her husband and mired in a midlife crisis because she can\u2019t have it all? (The original big little lie.) Then how about the   Silicon Valley executive who goes ballistic when her daughter reports being bullied at school, the event that may or may not have led to the mysterious death? Or the abuse victim who\u2019s reluctant to leave her husband, a subplot that\u2019s more disturbing but also strays into \u201cFifty Shades\u201d territory? Ms. Witherspoon, Ms. Kidman and Ms. Dern do everything they can to bring their stock characters and situations to life, and from moment to moment they can be fun to watch. Ms. Dern is particularly sharp as the tech hotshot  \u2014   she has just been named to the board of PayPal  \u2014   who melts down as she finds she\u2019s unable to protect her daughter, or even to figure out what\u2019s happening to her. All their characters, as well as that of a new, less wealthy mom played by Shailene Woodley, are   \u201crounded\u201d  \u2014   their Type A outbursts balanced by moments of humor and compassion. This is done so obviously that rather than making them more realistic, it just makes them more mushy and indistinct. If they\u2019re so nice, why do they behave so badly to one another? The show is premised on the idea that that\u2019s just the way it is these days for overstressed moms, which may be true in real life but isn\u2019t, in itself, a satisfactory motivator for drama. Ms. Kidman and Ms. Witherspoon are executive producers of \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d and you can see what they probably thought they had  \u2014   a sexy   that would also be a commentary on issues important to women their age (40s). But the mystery is a sham, and the drama doesn\u2019t have anything new or interesting to say. (The plot involving Ms. Kidman\u2019s character and her violent, younger husband, played by Alexander Skarsgard, has a creepy energy, though. It\u2019s as unoriginal as the other story lines, but it keeps you watching.) Still, there\u2019s value in a series in which at least one of these accomplished actresses is almost always onscreen. And there\u2019s no shame in enjoying the lifestyle pornography. Setting the story in Monterey, a   tourist town, may not make much sense  \u2014   the characters portrayed here would be much more likely to live up the coast in Woodside or Atherton  \u2014   but it allows for many scenes to be shot in gorgeous oceanside homes. Visually, at least, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d is the perfect television beach read.'"}, "time": 1742628534.1812398}
