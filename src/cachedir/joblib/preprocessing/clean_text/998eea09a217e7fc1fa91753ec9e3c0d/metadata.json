[In fact, throughout the Cold War, the Institute for Policy Studies, or IPS, was repeatedly accused of holding   positions that undermined U. S. national security and serving as a de facto Soviet propaganda institution.  Yet that same group   and contributed to an annual report titled \u201cUnified Security Budget for the United States,\u201d an extensive yearly list of U. S. military defense spending recommendations compiled by progressive think tanks. The report seeks to   the Defense Department to \u201cstrengthen our capacity to prevent and resolve conflict by   means,\u201d according to one IPS description of the report. A 2011 report on the IPS\u2019s taskforce for the \u201cUnified Security Budget\u201d reveals how previous Unified reports influenced Obama administration defense proposals: The Unified Security Budget project has contributed to this debate by outlining a set of cuts in unneeded military programs that formed the core of a proposal by the Sustainable Defense Task Force for $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years. A majority, though not a supermajority, of the members of the President\u2019s Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform adopted the annualized figure of $100 billion, and many of the recommendations from this proposal. The IPS\u2019s influence over Obama administration military proposals remains largely unreported except for previous investigations by this reporter. The annual Unified Security Budget was   several times by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, who served as counselor to President Obama and later chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. A sampling of the IPS\u2019s defense spending recommending can be seen in its 2012 \u201cUnified Security Budget\u201d report. That extensive report was previously summarized by this reporter: The 2012 budget, reviewed in full by (this reporter) called on Obama to use the U. S. Armed Forces in part to combat \u201cglobal warming,\u201d fight global poverty, remedy \u201cinjustice,\u201d bolster the United Nations and increase \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d forces worldwide. The budget called for massive,   slashes to the military budget. The savings are to be used to invest in \u201csustainable energy\u201d and in fighting worldwide climate change. The report makes clear the stated objective of transforming the U. S. Armed Forces to stress conflict resolution and diplomacy. The report takes issue with the use of forces on the ground in various countries to secure or influence the   strategic position of other nations. It recommends scaling back all U. S. ground forces by 20 percent and reducing the Navy\u2019s surface fleet by 20 percent, including two carriers and carrier combat air wings. It also calls for reducing the Air Force by two combat air wings while cutting standing peacetime overseas deployments in Europe and East Asia by up to 50, 000 troops at a time. The budget\u2019s authors strongly argue for the reduction of the U. S. nuclear arsenal to no more than 292 deployed nuclear weapons and the complete elimination of the Trident II nuclear missile. It\u2019s a process Obama already initiated in April 2010 when he signed a deal with Russia reducing stocks of   plutonium. The report further recommended the U. S. cease all missile defense development, among other cut backs. Here is more of my previous summary: The report goes through a list of current missile defense programs, including   Midcourse Defense, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Energy Interceptors and a number of others, pushing for all programs to be cut. \u201cIt is unwise to fund more advanced systems for missile defense while current ones have yet to be proven effective against their targeted threats,\u201d complains the report. The military\u2019s vital Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation program is to be cut by $10 billion across the board. Next on the chopping block is the complete cancellation of the second   Virginia Class submarine. While the Unified Security Budget describes the new model as \u201cunnecessary to address any of the threats facing the United States today\u201d and \u201ca weapon looking for an enemy,\u201d the   is designed for covert collection of intelligence, transportation of special operations teams and launching of tactical Tomahawk missiles  \u2014   flexible capabilities tailored to rapid responses required by the  \u2019s conflicts with irregular combatants. Similarly targeted for cancellation are the   Osprey helicopter and the Navy and Marine Corps versions of the   Joint Strike Fighter. A closer look at IPS, which influenced Obama administration policy, is warranted. The organization was founded in 1963 by former government workers Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnet, both of whom were known for their ties to   groups and activism on behalf of communist regimes. Discover the Networks relates that after the group was founded, \u201cIPS headquarters quickly became a resource center for national reporters and a place for KGB agents from the nearby Soviet embassy to convene and strategize. \u201d Indeed, Ladislav Bittman, a former KGB agent, claimed in his book, The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider\u2019s View that the IPS worked as a de facto Soviet disinformation operation. Harvey Klehr, professor of politics and history at Emory University, documented the close links between the IPS and Soviet ideology in his 1988 book, Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today. During the Cold War, IPS fellows \u201cconsistently maintained that the Soviet threat is largely   and a product of the   complex in the United States,\u201d he wrote. Just like their 2009 defense budget recommendations, the IPS during the Cold War pressed for the U. S. to \u201cdangerously\u201d downsize its military, Klehr related. He wrote: This view encouraged the IPS to demand dangerously steep cuts in American defense efforts and to claim that they would represent no danger to American security. At the request of   congressmen, IPS made a study of the federal budget in 1977. In addition to recommendations for a socialist housing program and health system, and altering capitalist control over the educational system, the IPS suggested a fifty percent cut in defense spending, an end to the American role in the Middle East, and withdrawal from NATO. Klehr further documented numerous IPS links to alleged Soviet front groups. IPS signed an agreement in 1982 with the Soviet\u2019s Institute of the USA and Canada, headed by Georgiy Arbatov, for exchanges on peace and disarmament. Since then IPS has sponsored an annual meeting of American experts and Soviet officials. Although portrayed by the Soviets as an \u201cindependent\u201d   \u201cthink tank,\u201d the Institute of the USA and Canada has been widely identified as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy influence. Located in Moscow, the IUSAC is nominally under the direction of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In practice, however, it operates under the direction of the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee. According to the testimony of John McMahon, then deputy director of Central Intelligence (during the House Selected Committee on Intelligence Hearings on Soviet Active Measures in 1982) the International Department \u201cdirects Western dialogue activities of Soviet organizations such as the   Institute\u201d with a view toward influencing Western perceptions of peace and disarmament. In his book, Shadow World: Resurgent Russia, The Global New Left, and Radical Islam, author Robert Chandler further documents FBI memos describing the IPS as a   nerve center. The FBI produced thousands of documents on IPS\u2019s activities. Some are available to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI withheld hundreds of documents. The documents collected by the FBI described IPS as a   \u201cThink Factory,\u201d which \u201chelped train extremists who incite violence in the United States and whose educational research serves as a cover for intrigue and political agitation\u201d (FBI file  ) or \u201cthe Rand Corporation of the Left,\u201d and \u201cIPS apparently exercises considerable influence in the New Left Movement and may have as its goal the destruction of the United States Government. \u201d In this context, the mainstream media described the IPS in the 1970s and 1980s as follows: Wall Street Journal  \u2014   \u201cA funnel for disinformation,\u201d Forbes  \u2014   \u201cA radical Washington propaganda mill,\u201d National Review  \u2014   \u201cThe perfect intellectual front for Soviet activities which would be resisted if they were to originate openly from the KGB. \u201d This reporter previously documented the Cold     activities of the IPS. The IPS has been implicated in   activity. The Center for Security Studies was a 1974 IPS   and strove to compromise the effectiveness of U. S. intelligence agencies, according to Discover the Networks. The mastheads of two   and   publications, Counterspy and the Covert Action Information Bulletin, were heavy with IPS members. Further, the group\u2019s former director, Robert Borosage, penned a book shortly out of college attacking the CIA and ran the   CIA watchdog, Center for National Security Studies. The group has been particularly concerned with researching U. S. defense industries and arms sales policies.  Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
