Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem \u201cwas and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.\u201d \\nThe al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz\""}, "time": 1742562024.7649522}
