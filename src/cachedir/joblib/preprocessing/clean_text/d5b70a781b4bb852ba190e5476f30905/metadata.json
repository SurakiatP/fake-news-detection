Such a decision would signal that the potential threat of local Zika transmission had catapulted to a new level. It would no longer be confined to one zone of active local transmission in Miami  \u2014   the only one identified in the continental United States up to now. A broad travel advisory could threaten tourism in South Florida and deepen fears among pregnant women living in the area. The Miami Beach City Manager Jimmy Morales, in an email to city commissioners, confirmed that two cases of Zika have been tied to Miami Beach. One case is a tourist who had visited Miami Beach two weeks ago. Another case involves a Miami Beach resident who works on the island, Mr. Morales said in the email, which was first reported by The Miami Herald. \u201cI have been informed that two Zika cases have been linked to Miami Beach,\u201d Mr. Morales said in the email. At noon on Friday, Gov. Rick Scott will hold a news conference to discuss the developments. While the Zika virus has mild or negligible effects in most people, it can be devastating in pregnancy because it can damage the brain of a developing fetus, leading to babies born with unusually small heads, a condition called microcephaly. The Zika epidemic has swept across Latin America and the Caribbean since last year. In Brazil, which has been hardest hit by the virus, more than 1, 800 babies have been born with microcephaly. Until three weeks ago, all documented cases of Zika infection in the continental United States had been linked to people who had traveled to the outbreak region, or people who had sexual relations or close contact with someone who had traveled there. While officials have long expected cases of local transmission in the United States, especially in warm climates like Florida\u2019s where mosquitoes flourish, it was impossible for them to predict exactly where those cases would crop up. On July 29, health officials announced that the first cases of local Zika transmission in the continental United States had affected four people in   and Broward Counties. On Thursday, the health official with knowledge of the new developments said that in Miami Beach, there are \u201ca handful of cases\u201d of likely local transmission that involve people who were in \u201cclose proximity to each other,\u201d including two new cases that the Florida Department of Health announced Thursday. The official insisted on anonymity, saying that details about the location and any travel guidance for pregnant women are not likely to be officially announced until Friday at the earliest. The official said that expanding the travel advisory broadly would not indicate that health officials think that the Zika virus was spreading rapidly throughout the county or Miami Beach. Rather, it would be \u201cfor the sake of almost simplification to make it easy for people to understand the geographic area,\u201d the official said. \u201cNow that we have a second area of local transmission, I think officials wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see in the coming weeks another area,\u201d the official added. \u201cSo in an effort to simplify things and get ahead, there are discussions about expanding the area to possibly include the county or other parts of the Miami area. \u201d Jackie Schutz, Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s communications director, said Thursday that public health officials \u201chave not confirmed a new zone of active transmission,\u201d besides the    area in Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, that has been designated a zone of active local transmission of the Zika virus since Aug. 1. She added, \u201cthere are multiple cases being investigated. \u201d So far, 25 of the 35 cases of suspected local transmission that Florida health officials have announced have ties to the Wynwood neighborhood, most of them linked to two small businesses. Mara Gambineri, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said the department \u201cstill believes active transmissions are still only occurring in the area that is less than one square mile in   County. \u201d She added, \u201cIf investigations reveal additional areas of likely active transmission, the department will announce a defined area of concern. \u201d The mayor of Miami Beach, Philip Levine, said that state officials had not confirmed to him that there were cases in Miami Beach. But he said, \u201cThere could be a link to Miami Beach. \u201d He added, \u201cWe can expect to see Zika popping up here and there, but it\u2019s not an epidemic. \u201d The health official interviewed Thursday said Florida officials might be waiting to announce the new cluster until a decision was made about how large an area would be included in any new travel advisory, something that officials from the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were discussing Thursday night. \u201cAt a minimum is expanding the travel advisory to Miami Beach,\u201d the health official said. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the table right now is Miami Beach and making it bigger than Miami Beach. There are discussions about the whole of   County. \u201d The C. D. C. had not issued a statement as of Thursday night, and agency officials said it would do so only after the State of Florida released more details about a new cluster and location. A city of 92, 000 people, Miami Beach sits on a series of barrier islands east of Miami. Its crystalline waters, night clubs, restaurants and hip hotels make it one of the biggest tourist hot spots in the state. About seven million tourists stayed in Miami Beach hotels in 2015, and others visited without staying there, according to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. About half are international tourists, with Brazil leading the way. On Thursday, the health official with knowledge of the discussions said that any updated travel guidance would probably be similar to the advisory for Wynwood. Pregnant women were advised not to travel there and women who lived or worked in the zone, and their partners, were advised to protect themselves from mosquito bites and to practice protected sex. Among those affected by an advisory would be Batsheva Wulfsohn, who is seven and a half months pregnant, and her husband, Zak Stern. The couple live in Miami Beach, and Mr. Stern runs a bakery in Wynwood. \u201cI\u2019m still searching for that reasonable reaction to something that is still quite mysterious in its effects,\u201d said Mr. Stern, who had not heard about the Miami Beach cases on Thursday. \u201cMy wife is trying to kind of balance doing everything she can as a responsible mother, while not allowing herself to be crippled in fear all day. \u201d It is exactly that kind of balance that public health officials have also been striving for, said Dr. William Schaffner, the head of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University\u2019s medical school. In issuing travel warnings, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t want to do social and culture and economic harm and they don\u2019t want to do medical and public health harm by indicating that people are at risk when the risk may be very, very low. \u201d The authorities have limited travel advisories to Wynwood because it was linked to multiple cases, and because the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits Zika, can travel only short distances, does not live long and does not pass the virus to its larvae, he said. Also, in two other viruses the mosquito transmits, dengue and chikungunya, a mosquito has usually infected only one person, not many, he said. \u201cBut the world is sometimes a little messier\u201d than scientific precedent would suggest, he said. So far, health officials \u201chave been making reasonable decisions, and we have all wondered what\u2019s it going to take for them to expand the travel advisory,\u201d he added. \u201cThey tread a fine line between really aggressive and being really cautious. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562057.9679902}
