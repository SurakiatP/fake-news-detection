[Obama criticized Trump\u2019s decision as \u201can absence of American leadership\u201d that moved the United States backward.  \u201cEven as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I\u2019m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we\u2019ve got,\u201d he wrote in a statement. Obama recalled his \u201csteady, principled\u201d leadership on the climate change agreement and \u201cbold American ambition\u201d that convinced other countries to follow their lead. \u201cThe nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,\u201d he said. Obama praised business interests for investing in green energy, but did not mention the government subsidies that made it possible. Despite his assertion that he wanted to remain silent after leaving office, Obama has broken that promise on multiple occasions to criticize President Trump.'"}, "time": 1742628492.1142747}
