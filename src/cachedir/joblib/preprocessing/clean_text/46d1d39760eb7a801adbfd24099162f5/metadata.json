George Soros and other wealthy liberals who have spent tens of millions of dollars on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign are gathering in Washington on Sunday evening on a three-day closed conference to close their ranks in the fight against Donald Trump, the POLITICO notes . It\u2019s reported that the conference, which kicked off Sunday night at Washington\u2019s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups. It\u2019s safe to assume that liberals plan full-on trench warfare against Trump from day one. Soros\u2019 business practises have been heavily criticized by various analysts over the years, since this billionaire is often referred to as a speculator. The Quantum company that Soros heads over the last forty years has produced a fortune that remains unseen in the world of hedge funds \u2013 35 billion dollars. The US mortgage crisis alone allowed Soros to raise over a billion dollars in just two years. However, it\u2019s clear that Soros is not contended with the amount of money he has, since he\u2019s been displaying a paranoid desire to control the world, while investing his wealth into the so-called color revolutions that are aimed at toppling elected officials across the world. Due to a number of scandals when sensitive to Soros documents were uploaded on the Internet after being stolen by anonymous hackers, we now know that Soros\u2019 Open Society has been trying to influence certain political developments in a number of European countries. The billionaire has been repeatedly accused of staging color revolutions in a number of Eastern European countries, including Georgia. In 2015 a coup d\u2019etat in Ukraine resulted in Petro Poroshenko taking the power in the country. Now he has awarded Soros with the Order of Freedom to honor his \u201ccomitment to the democratic changes that are taking place in Ukraine.\u201d Moreover, last April WikiLeaks released documents that would show that the scandal that broke out around the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that is known to the world as the Panama Papers scandal was directly sponsored by the Soros Foundation. Last August, as it\u2019s been reported by various media sources, spent a total of 33 million dollars to fuel unrest in Ferguson. Up to 79% of the arrested individuals during the riots were not locals, those radicals have been brought to this town from all over the US to provoke clashes with local police units. The ongoing investigation has little doubt that Freguson riots were not spontaneous, they were cleverly staged and directed from a single center. One can easily find George Soros among the top donors of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, spending a total of 9 million dollars officially on supporting the Democratic candidate. However, Soros couldn\u2019t care less about \u201cdemocracy,\u201d as profits is all that he cares for in this life. That is why Soros has unleashed a veritable war against Trump, forming groups of so-called activists that are using the hashtag #NotMyPresiden, along with the MoveOn.org movement that billed over 200 \u201cUnited Against Hate\u201d actions as \u201cpeaceful,\u201d and while most of the protest activity has remained so, some rallies been marred by vandalism and violence.). The Washington Times would note : After five days of anti-Trump protests and mayhem led by left-wing groups, including one linked to top Clinton donor George Soros, Republicans said Sunday that it\u2019s time for Democrats to call off the dogs . A notorious financial analyst of Live Trading News Paul Ebeling is convinced that the Clintons, who both have received millions of dollars in campaign contributions and Clinton Foundation donations from George Soros, were, in fact, helping to launch Soros\u2019s Purple Revolution in America. The Purple Revolution will resist all efforts by the Trump Administration to push back against the globalist policies of the Clintons and soon-to-be ex-President Barack Hussein Obama. However, Donald Trump is no newcomer to financial markets and dirty tricks that are used on those, and he\u2019s been pretty clever throughout his election campaign. Therefore it\u2019s unlikely that Soros will find any success in spreading unrest during the Trump era that is now dawning.
