The article, written by Scott Lucas, appears in the February issue of San Francisco magazine:[He is the most consequential countercultural figure to come out of UC Berkeley since the Free Speech Movement. And he just helped get Donald Trump elected.   \u2026     Having recently assumed a position of almost unimaginable power in American journalism, Marlow could afford to smell the roses. Perhaps more than any other person working in media today, he has a direct line into the head of the 45th president of the United States. His most recent boss and constant adviser, Steve Bannon, stepped down as executive chairman of Breitbart in August to run Trump\u2019s campaign and has been named senior counselor in the White House \u2014  one of the two or three closest advisers to the most powerful man on earth. Throughout the race to become president, and in the surreal and improvised weeks after the election, Trump tweeted links to Breitbart News more often than to any other source.   \u2026     Marlow ran [Breitbart. com] all [election] day from his laptop in \u201cthe fishbowl,\u201d a large,   studio used for special events with seating for a small audience, until 3 a. m. when he returned to his room at the Park Lane Hotel, across from Central Park, and managed two hours of sleep before returning to the studio at 6 a. m. On the morning of November 9, he proclaimed a victory that he\u2019d seen coming a year and a half before it happened. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see incredible amounts of hot takes trying to make sense of the election in the coming weeks,\u201d he said on his radio show a few hours before Hillary Clinton conceded. \u201cThey could have listened to Breitbart radio. \u201d   \u2026     [Marlow is] every bit the             agitator that \u201960s free speech icon Mario Savio was. Even if the world he\u2019s busy tearing down is the one that Savio and his comrades helped to build, you could argue that Berkeley had a large hand in building Alex Marlow as well.
