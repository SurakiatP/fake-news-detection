[After Commissioner Dee Clemmons of Hampton, Georgia, demanded that the Nash Farm Battlefield Museum tear down the flags in its Confederate displays that explain the battle to visitors, the museum decided to close its doors, saying it could not properly explain history if half of its displays were to be censored, WFMY reported.  Tim Knight, who represents the nonprofit group that runs the museum, said Clemmons spoke with the color of authority of the county and felt that he was given no choice but to close the museum. \u201cNash Farms has always represented both sides of the conflict,\u201d Stuart Carter, a supporter of the museum, said of the    establishment. \u201cSure I understand some people find the imaging of (the Confederacy) offensive,\u201d Carter added. \u201cBut if we try and erase it from history, then we can\u2019t remember how we messed up and why we shouldn\u2019t go back there again. \u201d The group running the museum insisted that it could not properly relay the history of the 1864 battle without its Confederate artifacts and displays. But a county spokesperson said it was \u201creasonable\u201d to demand that the Confederate flag displays be censored. \u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable. I think there were plenty of artifacts in the museum that can tell the story of the Civil War. And I think it was a reasonable request,\u201d county spokeswoman Melissa Robinson said. The controversy comes amid similar discussions in states across the south, as Charlottesville, Virginia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, debate removing Confederate symbols and memorials.
