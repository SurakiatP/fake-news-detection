[Kelly announced in early January she was leaving Fox News after 12 years and going to NBC to headline her own weekday news program and a Sunday night, 60   show, and to appear on panels during big events.  However, according to a story in The Wall Street Journal, NBC still has not announced a definitive start date for Kelly, and neither of her shows seems to be coming together with any urgency. One proposal is for Kelly to anchor a 10 a. m. show in front of a live audience, but no producer has been named for the show and NBC won\u2019t even confirm the plan. The Sunday evening show, which would need to be ready by early summer because Sunday Night Football will replace it in the fall, is even less far along, the Journal reported. It is not even clear she has departed Fox News. She has not appeared on the network since Jan. 5, when she signed off from The Kelly File. Fox News announced on Mar. 9 it had released Kelly from her contract nearly four months before it was to run out, so she could begin her work at NBC. Yet Kelly\u2019s spokesperson, Leslee Dart, told the Journal, \u201cThe terms of the termination are still being negotiated. \u201d Kelly seemed ready to leave late last year. She batted down talk that she had been the subject of a bidding war among NBC, CBS, and ABC. She turned down a reported $20 million offer to stay at Fox News and accepted an offer similar to her Fox News salary of about $15 million to go to NBC because, she said, she wanted to have dinner with her children at night and put them to bed. NBC needs to make progress on this because it must present its list of new shows to advertisers in May, and she would be a major asset for the network in ad rate negotiations, the Journal reported, It is highly unlikely Kelly would return to the Fox News airwaves. Her questioning of Donald Trump during the campaign  \u2014   on his treatment of women, whether he would support the Republican nominee and other issues  \u2014   raised hackles among the network\u2019s viewers and led to an eventual reconciliation with the president. In her memoir Settle for More, released last year, Kelly accused Fox News chief Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her  \u2014   a charge, also leveled by other women at the network, which led to Ailes\u2019 departure. This also led to a spat with Bill O\u2019Reilly, another Fox News star, who said in November, \u201cIf somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. \u201d O\u2019Reilly later backtracked and called Kelly a \u201cvery smart, talented woman,\u201d and Kelly put it down to competitive juices. \u201cWe\u2019re both Irish. We\u2019re both Catholic. And we\u2019re both very competitive,\u201d she told Hollywood Reporter last November. \u201cSo the dynamic has changed. But I really will always be grateful to Bill. \u201d Then there are the     coworkers who told Breitbart News exclusively in December they were ready for the drama to end. \u201cEverybody in the building is sick of it,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe absolutely can\u2019t stand it anymore. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562052.0883608}
