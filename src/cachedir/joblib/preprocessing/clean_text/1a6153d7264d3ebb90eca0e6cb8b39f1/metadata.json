Bratton, the commissioner of the New York Police Department and the most widely recognized face in American policing, will step down next month to take a job with a private advisory firm, ending a   career in public life that spanned the country, from Boston to Los Angeles, and that reshaped the image of what a police commander could be. The timing of Mr. Bratton\u2019s departure and the choice of his successor were made final only on Monday evening, and the details remained under wraps until just a couple of hours before the official announcement on Tuesday afternoon at City Hall. In detailing the change in leadership, Mayor Bill de Blasio emphasized \u201ccontinuity,\u201d and Mr. Bratton highlighted a \u201cseamless transition. \u201d But like every previous change atop the Police Department, the nation\u2019s largest force, the news raised a host of questions about its direction. Mr. Bratton\u2019s departure comes at a time when police agencies around the country are under intense pressure to address questions about racial bias and the excessive use of force. \u201cPolicing is never done it\u2019s always unfinished business,\u201d Mr. Bratton said, speaking last in a kind of valedictory address. \u201cThe issues that we\u2019re facing now are going to require years to resolve. \u201d Mr. Bratton said his departure in September would also be his exit from public service. At the news conference, he and city officials repeatedly declined to disclose what his new job would be. But on Tuesday afternoon, Teneo Holdings, a company that advises corporate executives around the world, announced that he would join the firm as senior managing director and become the executive chairman of Teneo Risk, a new division of the company. The company would not divulge details of his compensation package. Mr. Bratton, 68, will be replaced by the Police Department\u2019s top uniformed officer, Chief James P. O\u2019Neill, a veteran New York commander who became an officer in 1983 and has a long relationship with Mr. Bratton, dating to their time together in the city\u2019s old transit police force. Chief O\u2019Neill, 58, at times visibly emotional as he spoke at the news conference, said he had been told he was the mayor\u2019s pick only 16 hours before. \u201cNever in my life, coming on this job in 1983, did I think I\u2019d be standing at the podium talking to everybody as the next police commissioner,\u201d said Chief O\u2019Neill, his mother and sister before him in   seats. \u201cWe never stop trying to drive down crime and quell disorder I\u2019m going to do it in lock step with the people we\u2019re dedicated to protect. It is, after all, what we do now. \u201d The choice of Mr. O\u2019Neill, virtually unknown outside law enforcement circles, ended two decades of almost continuous stewardship of the department by Mr. Bratton and Raymond W. Kelly, two towering figures who exerted enormous influence over local politics and national policing, even as they occasionally sparred. \u201cThe leadership of the N. Y. P. D. from Kelly to Bratton, has been too \u201d said City Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat who advocates police reform. Mr. Torres said he hoped a commissioner with a lower profile would be \u201cmore accountable to the democratically elected branches of government. \u201d \u201cGone are the days of the imperial police commissioner,\u201d he added. In his two and a half years as commissioner, Mr. Bratton oversaw the largest expansion of the Police Department in more than two decades, with the addition of 1, 300 officers last year, and the creation of large cadre of militarized officers equipped with assault rifles and body armor. With Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support and Mr. Bratton\u2019s advocacy, the department has benefited from bigger budgets, new patrol cars and bulletproof vests, and smartphones in the hands of all officers. The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey, and district attorneys and elected officials across New York City praised Mr. Bratton\u2019s tenure on Tuesday. \u201cHe will be sorely missed,\u201d Mr. Comey said in a statement. Without Mr. Bratton at the helm, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, may find himself under more pressure to advance reforms, which many advocates say have stalled, and less insulated from criticism on law enforcement issues. Although crime in the city has continued to go down on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s watch, New Yorkers in polls have expressed unease about public safety, a source of frustration for the Police Department and City Hall. The leadership of the department is still contending with a federal corruption investigation that has already ensnared several top commanders. And federal prosecutors are still weighing charges in the 2014 case of Eric Garner, who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold. \u201cThe trust gap and the empathy gap sadly persists,\u201d said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because Bratton has stubbornly held on to the philosophy of \u2018broken windows\u2019 policing. \u201d The announcement removed the question of succession from Mr. de Blasio\u2019s   bid next year. But it introduced new ones: Can Chief O\u2019Neill, who is grounded in the culture of the Police Department, enact the changes the mayor has promised? How will the   advocates who supported Mr. de Blasio\u2019s run in 2013 see the new commissioner: as an ally or an adversary? Will Mr. de Blasio lose support among black and Hispanic voters for once again appointing a commissioner who is white? Chief O\u2019Neill\u2019s career stalled under the former commissioner, Mr. Kelly, who removed him from his narcotics command in 2008 amid a scandal involving officers who paid informants with drugs in exchange for information. But after Mr. Bratton\u2019s return in 2014, Chief O\u2019Neill found his star rising. He was quickly promoted to chief of patrol and then to chief of department that year. Shortly before the announcement at noon, Mr. de Blasio made a flurry of calls to alert key officials, including Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat. \u201cI told him there will be some people who will be concerned that a diverse candidate was apparently not seriously considered, but I find Chief O\u2019Neill to be a good man,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. Mr. Bratton, at the news conference on Tuesday, beamed at Chief O\u2019Neill and praised Mr. de Blasio. \u201cWe have a passion for what government can do, what policing can do,\u201d he said of his relationship with the mayor. Calling himself a \u201cproud adopted son of New York City,\u201d Mr. Bratton said that \u201cit\u2019s now time to move on. \u201d (He said he would remain a city resident with his wife, Rikki Klieman.) The change came earlier than expected Mr. Bratton said in an interview last month that he would not stay into a second term if Mr. de Blasio were   next year. Mr. Bratton has said the choice of when to go was his alone. The selection of Mr. Bratton in 2013 was one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first major appointments after being elected, and it was seen at the time as bolstering the new mayor\u2019s    credentials after a campaign in which he pointedly criticized the Police Department for   practices in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Mr. Bratton embraced the chance to once again lead the nation\u2019s largest police force after having been pushed out of the job in 1996 after 28 months by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican. The departure this time, on his own terms, will come after 32 months as commissioner. Since then, Mr. Bratton has served as a key adviser and surrogate for Mr. de Blasio at some of the rockiest moments of his first term in office, especially after    officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals for two officers in December 2014 and January 2015 and engaged in a de facto work slowdown. Yet they often read different scripts, even when defending the same core policy  \u2014   a dedication to   broken windows policing  \u2014   that Mr. Bratton\u2019s critics contend is at the heart of the divide between the police and minority communities. Even as Mr. de Blasio defended the approach on Tuesday, referring to it as \u201c   enforcement,\u201d he said the department\u2019s future success would be determined by a new iteration of   neighborhood policing, rolling out across the department. \u201cIt will change everything,\u201d the mayor said. Mr. Bratton, who began as a beat cop in Boston in 1970, said his career as a police leader was finished. But his enduring legacy, defined by aggressive efforts to fight crime in New York City in the 1990s, may be defined by how well his reforms this time  \u2014   to solve entrenched problems of racial tension and mistrust that have plagued the police in Los Angeles, New York and across the nation  \u2014   take hold. Mr. de Blasio said that he had an \u201cintense bond\u201d with Mr. Bratton and that Chief O\u2019Neill was \u201cthe perfect person\u201d to succeed him. Mr. Bratton\u2019s departure did not  \u2014   for the moment, at least  \u2014   prompt an exodus among the department\u2019s command staff. John J. Miller, the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism and a longtime confidant of Mr. Bratton\u2019s, is staying on, Mr. Bratton said, as is Benjamin B. Tucker, the first deputy commissioner. Carlos M. Gomez, the chief of patrol, will succeed Chief O\u2019Neill as chief of department.'"}, "time": 1742628546.919705}
