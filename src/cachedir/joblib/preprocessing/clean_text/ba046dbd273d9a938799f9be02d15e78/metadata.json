According to Page Six, Jimmy Kimmel Live! canceled Coe\u2019s scheduled appearance on the show Monday night, though a producer was reported to have told him the cancellation was due to a timing issue. Many of the stars at Sunday night\u2019s ceremony have been critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy, including his order temporarily prohibiting immigration from seven   Middle Eastern countries, which has since been blocked by the 9th Circuit Court. The order would have temporarily suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, which in turn would have prohibited the arrival of refugees into the United States during that period while the refugee vetting process was being reviewed. A number of celebrities at the Oscars  \u2014   including Loving actress Ruth Negga and Moana songwriter   Miranda  \u2014   wore ACLU ribbons on their dresses and tuxedos to show their opposition to Trump\u2019s policies.
