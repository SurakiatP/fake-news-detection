After exposing Hillary Clinton and leaving the reporter speechless, it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s over for the lying Democratic candidate. \\nMiller went on Fox News on Wednesday to discuss what he was witness to in his state that Hillary definitely didn\u2019t want to get out. With election day just around the corner, when a crucial decision falls into the hands of Americans who will determine the course to the country for the next four years, the proud\u00c2 cowboy didn\u2019t hold back. He delivered a stunning statement that\u00c2 not only put Hillary in her place, it shut her down completely. \\nThis election has been unlike any other in history and apparently so has the early voter turnout, namely in the Lone Star State. It\u2019s not even voting day yet, but patriotic Texans have already turned out in record-breaking droves to be sure to get their ballot in early, with an overwhelming number voting for Donald Trump. The attendance at his rallies seems to have translated to the polls, but Miller also revealed something else in his statement that needs to be known. \\n\u201cWe have a record number of people registered to vote in Texas. We\u00e2\\x80\\x99re having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting. And it\u00e2\\x80\\x99s not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary. It\u00e2\\x80\\x99s not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary,\u201d he first announced before making\u00c2 the next stunning statement. \u201c It\u00e2\\x80\\x99s a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote. Many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so they\u00e2\\x80\\x99re not reported in the polls \u00e2\\x80\u015a\u201d YUGE RECORD BREAKING VOTES in TEXAS!!! & Its Not Bernie Fans or Obama Voters for Hillary Clinton!! ALLL Donald Trump Folks\u0111\\x9f\\x98\\x83 #wednesdaywisdom pic.twitter.com/Sn79fMhwXG \\n\u2014 DEPLORABLE TRUMPCAT (@Darren32895836) October 26, 2016 \\nTrump has awoken the American spirit in all of us, including those with no previous interest in politics or voting who now feel called to action by his energy and the need for that in our leadership.\u00c2 Hillary has tried her hardest to convince the public that the race is over before it\u2019s even ended by claiming the win and painting Trump as inept. She\u2019s employed tactics of oversampling Democrats to skew the poll results and \u201cprove\u201d her point, but the reality is revealed\u00c2 in the record we\u2019re seeing set already in Texas \u00e2\\x80\\x94 which is likely just the start. \\nThe only emotion Hillary has stirred in the majority of citizens is divisiveness and hate, while her counterpart has done something she is not and will never be capable of. Single-handedly, Trump brought back what Americans have been desperate for over the last eight years of lame duck leadership from Barack Obama. We want someone who proves that he loves his country, is ready to enact real change that everyone can see and not just be lied to about, a man who keeps his promises, loves the God that our country was built on, and will do whatever it takes to honor our rights and defeat our enemies.'"}, "time": 1742563740.276196}
