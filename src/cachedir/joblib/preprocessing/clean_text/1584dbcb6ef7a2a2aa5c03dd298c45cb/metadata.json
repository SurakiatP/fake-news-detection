It is their last major city within Iraqi territory, and the US has presented their imminent defeat in the city as spelling the effective end to the ISIS caliphate. \\nBaghdadi insisted there could be no surrender in the fight, a statement which is literally true since the US has insisted they intend to kill every ISIS fighter who attempts to flee the city with airstrikes Baghdadi suggested there would be retaliatory suicide attacks abroad that would wreak havoc on \u201cunbelievers,\u201d and \u201cmake their blood flow as rivers.\u201d \\nThe Pentagon, always upbeat about wars everywhere, said Baghdadi\u2019s confident statement proved he is losing control of ISIS in general, and that he was desperately trying to prevent infighting, adding \u201cwe don\u2019t believe it is going to work.\u201d Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz'"}, "time": 1742562860.1204906}
