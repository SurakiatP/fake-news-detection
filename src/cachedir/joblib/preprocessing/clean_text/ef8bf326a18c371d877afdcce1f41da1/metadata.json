Much to his surprise, he found 25-year-old Erika Hurt unconscious with her body slumped in the front seat and her head tilted back. However, the situation would soon turn to horror when the police officer saw what was in the driver\u2019s hand \u2014 and it was only made worse as he looked in the backseat. Erika Hurt \\nUnfortunately, the situation took a dark turn as soon as the officer opened the car door and saw what the woman was clutching onto \u2014 a heroin needle still in Hurt\u2019s hand. The situation was only be made worse when he looked in the backseat to see the woman\u2019s 10-month-old baby sitting there all alone, crying. \\nOfficers say that Hurt had overdosed on the drug and, after being revived by police, was quickly rushed to an area hospital where she is recovering. Since that time, Hurt has officially been charged with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. Heroin needle still in Erika Hurt\u2019s hand \\nThe troubling images were released to the public, and although most people understand why Town Marshal Matthew Tallent shared the image, a few naysayers have expressed their belief that it was inappropriate to show a woman in such a condition \u2013 but this isn\u2019t one man you want to mess with. \\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to show people that this just isn\u2019t a city problem. The heroin epidemic is leaking into small town America and it\u2019s getting really bad,\u201d he told Mail Online . \u201cNot only did this woman overdose and nearly die but, had she not passed out from the drug, she would have driven out of the car park and could still have been driving while passed out or under the influence. She could have killed another innocent family.\u201d \\nFortunately, Tallent did inform the public that the child was physically unharmed, but as he noted, things could have ended much differently. The drug problem here in America is very serious, and we\u2019re seeing it seep into the crack and crevasses of every small town in our nation at this point. \\nIf ever there was an argument to better secure our border, this would be it. If I\u2019ve learned one thing in this world, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t help anyone who doesn\u2019t want to help themselves. With that being said, though, a lot fewer people would need such help if these drugs weren\u2019t so easily making their way into this country. Build that wall, Mr. Trump.'"}, "time": 1742562068.3521554}
