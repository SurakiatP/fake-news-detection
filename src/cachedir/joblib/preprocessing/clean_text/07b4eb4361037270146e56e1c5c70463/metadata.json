But since ascending to the United States Senate this month, he has found his popularity threatened and his fellow Republicans troubled, largely because he accepted the appointment of Gov. Robert J. Bentley, a subject of an active investigation that the new senator spent months overseeing. A startling number of people in and around the State House openly suspect, but lack evidence to prove, that part of Mr. Bentley\u2019s reason for appointing Mr. Strange to the Senate was to try to undermine the inquiry. Beyond clouding Mr. Strange\u2019s early days in the Senate, the appointment to fill the seat of Jeff Sessions, President Trump\u2019s new attorney general, has exacerbated the controversy that has publicly swirled around Mr. Bentley for almost a year. The maze of scandal  \u2014   featuring sexually explicit conversations and the sudden firing of a top law enforcement official, and consuming hundreds of thousands of dollars from public and political bank accounts  \u2014   has led to swelling demands for the impeachment of the governor, a Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s like every time we turn around, there\u2019s somebody else who is potentially going to jail, or being too greedy, or being too arrogant,\u201d said State Representative Ed Henry, a Republican who has pushed for Mr. Bentley\u2019s ouster. Mr. Bentley, 74, who did not agree to an interview request, has been on the defensive for nearly a year. In March, Spencer Collier, whom Mr. Bentley had fired as the head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, accused the governor of having an affair with an aide and said the aide had served as the \u201cde facto governor. \u201d An audio recording of Mr. Bentley, said to be in conversation with the woman, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, was leaked and left Alabama residents listening to the governor utter phrases like \u201cwhen I stand behind you and I put my arms around you and I put my hands on your breasts. \u201d Mr. Bentley, whose wife of 50 years filed for divorce in August 2015, said he had apologized for \u201cany conversations and behavior that was inappropriate,\u201d but he insisted that he had not had a physical relationship with Mrs. Mason. Mrs. Mason, who declined to comment and whose husband leads the Governor\u2019s Office of   and Volunteer Service, resigned as Mr. Bentley\u2019s senior political adviser soon after the governor\u2019s public acknowledgment of misconduct. Mr. Bentley\u2019s words and Mrs. Mason\u2019s formal exit  \u2014   she and her husband have remained connected to the governor and traveled to last month\u2019s presidential inauguration with him  \u2014   did little to curb outrage. Lawsuits emerged, federal and state investigations began, and at least one grand jury here has been considering evidence. Mr. Strange, a former lobbyist widely regarded as ambitious and long seen as the future of Republican politics in Alabama, attended some of the grand jury testimony. Then Mr. Bentley, in his second and final term, chose Mr. Strange as Mr. Sessions\u2019s replacement in the Senate and scheduled a special election for 2018. When his appointment was announced, Mr. Strange, 63, said the rampant speculation about an inquiry involving the governor was \u201cunfair to him and unfair to the process. \u201d He also said, in a remark that has since been parsed, analyzed and criticized, \u201cWe have never said in our office that we are investigating the governor. \u201d Less than a week later, the man Mr. Bentley chose to succeed Mr. Strange as attorney general, Steven T. Marshall, appointed Alabama\u2019s equivalent of a special prosecutor and asked her to \u201cassume oversight of the state\u2019s interest in the current investigative matter relating to Gov. Robert Bentley, to include all potential criminal matters arising from that investigation. \u201d One of the lawyers leading the inquiry, Matt Hart, helped to secure the conviction last year of Michael G. Hubbard, then the speaker of the State House of Representatives. Although many senior Republicans in Alabama and in Washington strongly urged Mr. Bentley to appoint Mr. Strange, the only one of six finalists to have been elected statewide, the choice and Mr. Marshall\u2019s acknowledgment of an investigation still upset many people here. \u201cLuther would have been the man to beat in an election,\u201d said State Representative Corey Harbison, a Republican who decided to support Mr. Bentley\u2019s impeachment because of misgivings about why the governor named Mr. Strange to the Senate. \u201cHe would have been solid, and he probably would have beaten the governor\u2019s appointment. \u201d He added, \u201cLuther\u2019s ambition to become a United States senator caused him to do things that I don\u2019t think he would have done in normal circumstances. \u201d Mr. Harbison said he would have strongly considered supporting Mr. Strange in next year\u2019s special election. Mr. Strange said in a statement that he was confident that prosecutors in his former office would \u201crelentlessly pursue the rule of law,\u201d and his allies noted that his Senate appointment had hardly derailed the inquiry related to Mr. Bentley. \u201cMy own commitment to rooting out corruption in government speaks for itself,\u201d Mr. Strange said. \u201cThat vow has never wavered and will continue to guide me as I serve the people of Alabama in the U. S. Senate. \u201d But Republicans are talking regularly of the political obstacles the senator might confront next year, when he could face a primary campaign focused more on ethics than on devotion to conservative policy ideas. Perry Hooper Jr. a former member of the Legislature who was a finalist for the Senate seat, said he was considering a challenge to Mr. Strange that could center on the circumstances of the appointment. And Mr. Strange\u2019s new political patron, Mr. Bentley, is unlikely to be of much help. According to an internal poll commissioned by Republican officeholders and described by several Republicans who were not authorized to discuss a confidential survey, the governor\u2019s approval rating is at an abysmally low level. \u201cIt\u2019s very important in our state for our governor to be recognized and acknowledged as the strongest elected official in the state of Alabama,\u201d said John H. Merrill, a Republican and the secretary of state. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there are a whole lot of people in our state who would think the governor is in that position today. \u201d With Mr. Strange\u2019s turn at the ballot box more than a year away, Mr. Bentley is in more immediate political jeopardy. This is chiefly because his choice of Mr. Strange for the Senate seat has helped spur new support for an impeachment push that Mr. Henry conceded had been \u201cfizzling out. \u201d (Last year, Mr. Strange asked the Legislature to suspend its impeachment inquiry because his office was conducting \u201crelated work. \u201d For now, the Legislature\u2019s review, part of a murky process, remains on hold and a large number of lawmakers have said its findings would prove decisive in any votes they cast on impeachment.) \u201cI met with him the day he appointed Luther Strange and told him, \u2018If you do this, it will be the end,\u2019\u201d Mr. Henry recalled of a recent conversation with the governor. \u201cHe believed that was his best appointment, and it did nothing but   his impeachment, and I believe it has probably   a potential indictment. It reeked of corruption. \u201d One of Mr. Bentley\u2019s lawyers, William C. Athanas, said that Mr. Bentley would \u201ccooperate fully\u201d in the state\u2019s inquiry but that it would be \u201cinappropriate for the governor to comment on the substance of this matter. \u201d Even if the criminal investigations remain open, some House Republicans believe that by the end of May, they will have settled the matter of whether Mr. Bentley will keep his job. Despite winning two statewide general elections with ease, Mr. Bentley is frequently isolated. Still, after Mr. Bentley had decided to promote a man who was investigating him to the Senate, he called Mr. Hooper to talk. He spoke of old alliances and cherished relationships. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy loyalty,\u201d Mr. Bentley told Mr. Hooper, \u201cand you can\u2019t buy friendship. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628371.940637}
