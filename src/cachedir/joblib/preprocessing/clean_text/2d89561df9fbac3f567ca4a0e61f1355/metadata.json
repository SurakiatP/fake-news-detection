Kris Bryant, the precocious young slugger, isn\u2019t much for math, struggling to count back the years since the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series. For a franchise so saddled by its own history  \u2014   of bad baseball, bad breaks and billy goat curses  \u2014   the latest iteration of the Cubs has carried on in a blissful cocoon of ignorance. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t really weigh on this club,\u201d Theo Epstein, the Cubs\u2019 president for baseball operations, said before Game 6 on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to win tonight\u2019s game. These guys, a lot of them are in their early 20s, and they\u2019re not burdened by that stuff. The organization isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just about trying to win and keeping it simple. \u201d In the end, doing simple better, to use one of Manager Joe Maddon\u2019s pet phrases, carried the Cubs all the way to the World Series for the first time since 1945. The Cubs got there with a   victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers and their fearsome ace, Clayton Kershaw. The Cubs jumped on him early, added home runs from Willson Contreras and Anthony Rizzo, and protected the lead with artful pitching from Kyle Hendricks, who allowed just two hits over seven and a third innings. The Cubs\u2019 opponent in the World Series will be another team with a history of hard luck: the Cleveland Indians, who have not won a championship since 1948. Their futility, of course, pales next to that of the Cubs, who have not won a World Series since 1908. But when the Series begins in Cleveland on Tuesday night, someone\u2019s long wait will be near an end. \u201cMagic number\u2019s four  \u2014   four games,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cCleveland, that city is deserving of the World Series, too. This is going to be a clash of two cities with a long drought and this is really good for baseball. It\u2019s going to be amazing. \u201d When a    double play ended it  \u2014   Russell to Baez to Rizzo echoing Tinkers to Evers to Chance  \u2014   the Cubs poured out of the   dugout and mobbed each other on the infield as Wrigley Field shook to its   foundation. For close to an hour, most of the capacity crowd stayed in place, soaking in the scene and singing along with the team\u2019s victory anthems  \u2014   \u201cGo Cubs Go\u201d and \u201cSweet Home Chicago\u201d  \u2014   as the players celebrated on the field. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent up angst and emotion in this city and really all over this nation, Cubs fans that have been loyal over the years,\u201d left fielder Ben Zobrist said. \u201cWe know that, but the bottom line is you have to execute at the right time and stay here in 2016. These guys have done it all year long with all the expectations on our backs. \u201d The Cubs rolled to the best   record in the major leagues, winning 103 games and clinching a division title with more than two weeks to play, but they have had to prove their mettle in the playoffs. In their division series, they rallied from three runs down in the ninth inning to finish off   San Francisco, which had won a record 10 consecutive elimination games. And in the National League Championship Series, after being shut out in    games, the Cubs bounced back from a     deficit. The pivot point for the turnaround was a fittingly simple play: Zobrist\u2019s bunt, which was their first hit of Game 4. It started a   rally in the fourth inning, and the Cubs scored 23 runs in winning the final three games. \u201cThat\u2019s the butterfly effect right there,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cIt was a bunt this year. \u201d Although the Cubs were home on Saturday, with a loud, insistent Wrigley Field crowd urging them on, they knew it would not be easy to beat Kershaw, who had shut them out in Game 2 at Wrigley Field, allowing just two hits in seven innings. They would also have to beat back history. The last time the Cubs had been in this position  \u2014   playing a Game 6 at home in 2003, needing one victory to capture the National League pennant  \u2014   they had unraveled, blowing a   lead to the Florida Marlins after a fan named Steve Bartman interfered with a foul ball. On Saturday night, the seat down the   line that had been occupied by Bartman  \u2014   Section 104, Row 8, Seat 113  \u2014   was empty until just before game time. \u201cI sat in it,\u201d said Nancy Mazzone, whose seat was one row in front. \u201cI felt   vibes. It\u2019s all good. \u201d When a fan arrived to sit in the   Bartman seat, he identified himself as Bryan. He said he was 38 and worked for a   company, and he was wearing a No. 14 cap in deference to Ernie Banks, one of the great Cubs players who never made it to the World Series. Bryan was asked by one of a   reporters present if he knew the history of the seat he was now occupying. \u201cI kind of do now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay out of the way. \u201d The mix of anxiety and anticipation was hard to ignore as the crowd filtered into the old ballpark. The Cubs had been on the brink before, not just in 2003, but in 1984 when they needed one win over the San Diego Padres to reach the World Series, but lost three in a row. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to say next year  \u2014   not again,\u201d said Kristine Fuller, 70, a retired nurse whose children chipped in to buy her a ticket to Saturday\u2019s game. As it turned out, it was not the Cubs who were overcome by jitters, but the Dodgers. Left fielder Andrew Toles dropped a fly ball that led to a run in the first, and Josh Reddick was picked off first base in the second. The   Hendricks, who graduated from Dartmouth with an economics degree, has made a career out of a pinpoint but pedestrian fastball and operating in the shadows  \u2014   all the way back to high school when it was his teammate, Tyler Matzek, who was chosen 11th overall in the draft. Hendricks had not lasted more than five and a third innings in four previous playoff starts, but he was masterly Saturday night. He allowed a single to Toles on the first pitch of the game, but on the second pitch, Hendricks, who induced more soft contact than any pitcher in baseball this season, got Corey Seager to ground into a double play. \u201cKyle pitched a perfect game,\u201d Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. Hendricks did not allow another hit until Reddick singled with one out in the eighth. Maddon then strolled out to the mound to a chorus of boos and replaced Hendricks with closer Aroldis Chapman. The first batter Chapman faced  \u2014     Howie Kendrick  \u2014   hit a line drive that second baseman Javier Baez alertly fielded on a   instead of catching it on the fly, which allowed him to turn an easy double play and end the inning. \u201cThe outside forces felt different,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cYou felt the buzz around the stadium, definitely the energy. It was loud in there. At the end of the day, all I was trying to do was simplify and make good pitches. I was able to stay in that zone, kind of stay in my bubble. \u201d The Cubs showed no deference toward Kershaw, a   Cy Young Award winner. Dexter Fowler lofted a fly ball down the right side that bounced just inside the line and into the stands for a   double to start off the bottom of the first. Bryant followed with a   single to right, scoring Fowler with the only run the Cubs would need. After Toles dropped Rizzo\u2019s fly ball, Zobrist hit a sacrifice fly to score Bryant, and the Cubs had what seemed like a gift: an early advantage that would limit any anxiety from the crowd. In the second, Fowler, a . 409 career hitter against Kershaw  \u2014   the highest mark of any active player  \u2014   hit a   single. That scored Addison Russell, who had rattled a double off the   wall, and gave the Cubs a   lead. Contreras hit a solo home run in the fourth, ripping a line drive down the line that he celebrated with a bat flip, although the ball barely cleared the wall. When Rizzo homered to   in the fifth, Kershaw sank to his knees and exclaimed, \u201cNo!\u201d That made the score  . All that was left was for Hendricks to continue carving up the Dodgers and for Chapman to finish them off. The fans passed the time with a rousing \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d and rose to their feet for the entire top of the ninth, bellowing, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Cubbies. \u201d By then, there was little anxiety  \u2014   only anticipation, with some fans wiping away tears and others crossing their fingers until, finally, Yasiel Puig hit a slow bouncing ball with one out. When Rizzo took the throw from Baez, who had been fed by Russell, the celebration that was generations in the making commenced. It seemed to be worth the wait.'"}, "time": 1742563332.8272986}
