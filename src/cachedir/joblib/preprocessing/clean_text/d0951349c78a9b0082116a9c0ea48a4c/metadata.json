He also wrote a song of hope and possibility about the experiment of democracy in the United States that, perhaps, takes on a new kind of resonance in the wake of the election of Donald Trump.\\nCohen was asked in 2014 if songs can offer solutions to political problems. He replied, \u201cI think the song itself is a kind of solution.\u201d\\nAnd so, to pay tribute to a troubadour who died at 82 and whose artistic work only seemed to get better as he aged and his voice grew deeper, here is a retrospective on some of the more philosophical and sociopolitical songs he composed.\\n\u201cJoan Of Arc\u201d (1971) Cohen declared in an interview for Rolling Stone in 1971, \u201cWomen are really strong. You notice how strong they are? Well, let them take over. Let us be what we\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 gossips, musicians, wrestlers. The premise being, there can be no free men unless there are free women.\u201d He believed it was just for women to gain control of the world.\\nWith that context, this elegiac narrative takes on greater gravitas. It consists of a dialogue between Joan of Arc and the Fire, as she is burnt at the stake. The women\u2019s movement was flourishing at the time, and Cohen saw Joan of Arc as a symbol of courage. Yet, he also recognized she may have been lonely because she had to disguise herself as a male soldier, and he imagined what it was like to fight English domination of France and in her final moments face down the fact that she would never return to what could be considered an ordinary life.\\n\u201cDance Me To The End Of Love\u201d (1984) During a CBC radio interview in 1995, Cohen said the song came from \u201chearing and reading or knowing that in the death camps\u201d during the Holocaust \u201cbeside the crematoria\u201d the string quartet would be \u201cpressed into performance\u201d while \u201cthis horror\u201d unfolded. Cohen sings in the opening, \u201cDance me to your beauty with a burning violin. Dance me through the panic \u2019til I\u2019m gathered safely in. Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove.\u201d The song represents an embrace of passionate acts in the face of atrocities and death.\\n\u201cIf It Be Your Will\u201d (1984) This is a truly grim song in which Cohen is probably using the specter of a benevolent oppressor or fascism as a metaphor for the next stage of a relationship. And yet, the lyrics are subtle enough that Cohen may be addressing morality and how easy it is to convince men to carry out heinous acts. He sings, \u201cAll your children here in their rags of light/In our rags of light/All dressed to kill/And end this night/If it be your will.\u201d\\n\u201cFirst We Take Manhattan\u201d (1987) The song is about terrorism or militant extremism. It is told from the perspective of an individual who tried to work within the system in order to change it. That failed. Now the individual has taken solace in the \u201cbeauty of his weapons\u201d and turned to Manhattan and to Berlin to make his or her mark.\\nIn a 2007 interview for XM Radio, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s something about terrorism that I\u2019ve always admired. The fact that there are no alibis or no compromises. That position is always very attractive. I don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s manifested on the physical plane. I don\u2019t really enjoy the terrorist activities, but psychic terrorism. I remember there was a great poem by Irving Layton that I once read, I\u2019ll give you a paraphrase of it. It was \u2018well, you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there\u2019, he says. \u2018But our terrorists, Jesus, Freud, Marx, Einstein. The whole world is still quaking.'\u201d\\nWhat Cohen meant, albeit in a very cynical way, is the philosophies of these people have such a history of being used to justify horrible acts. He never engages with the subject fully (and probably never wanted to do so), but Cohen\u2019s song clearly approaches the issue of state-sponsored political violence versus political violence of the individual.\\n\u201cEverybody Knows\u201d (1988) It is one of the most well-known songs he ever recorded. The wry cynicism diagnoses the realities of a cruel world. In the neoliberal age of austerity, the opening lyrics are exceptionally appropriate, \u201cEverybody knows that the dice are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed. Everybody knows that the war is over. Everybody knows the good guys lost. Everybody knows the fight was fixed. The poor stay poor, the rich get rich. That\u2019s how it goes. Everybody knows.\u201d\\nCohen sings, \u201cEverybody knows that you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Those in charge of the social order are indifferent to the pain and suffering of the masses. But are the owners and politicians capable of maintaining control? Because everybody also knows that it is coming apart.\\n\u201cDemocracy (1990) Cohen described in an interview with Paul Zollo that he wrote the song after the Berlin Wall came down. \u201cEveryone was saying democracy is coming to the east, and I was like that gloomy fellow who always turns up at a party to ruin the orgy or something. And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen that way. I don\u2019t think this is such a good idea. I think a lot of suffering will be the consequence of this wall coming down.'\u201d\\nThat seems strikingly backward. But it motivated Cohen to ask, \u201cWhere is democracy really coming?\u201d He thought there may be more democracy coming to the United States. From a love of America, he wrote a song that is really about the irony of America, \u201ca song of deep intimacy and affirmation of the experiment of democracy in this country.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is really where the experiment is unfolding. This is really where the races confront one another, where the classes, where the genders, where even the sexual orientations confront one another. This is the real laboratory of democracy.\u201d\\nGiven the American exceptionalism of Cohen\u2019s statement, he could have easily produced something with lyrics Lee Greenwood would have proudly belted out on stage. However, each time Cohen sings, \u201cDemocracy is coming to the USA,\u201d there is a raw irony it, like he does not believe the forces running this nation are capable of democracy. Then, there\u2019s the inimitable line, \u201cI\u2019m sentimental, if you know what I mean. I love the country but I can\u2019t stand the scene.\u201d It makes it clear Cohen was a disappointed idealist. Like so many, he liked the idea of America but seeing it play out on that \u201chopeless little screen\u201d was never quite what he had in mind.\\n\u201cThe Future\u201d (1990) For this song, Cohen\u2019s character looks into the future, and it is not good at all. It is so frightening, in fact, that he thinks he would be willing to see fascist society restored. \u201cGive me back the Berlin wall. Give me Stalin and St Paul. Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima.\u201d\\nThe song hurdles onward into more nostalgia for familiar horror, \u201cDestroy another fetus now. We don\u2019t like children anyhow. I\u2019ve seen the future, baby: it is murder.\u201d He has no hope that humanity can right itself. Civilization can try and erect a social order with a tyrant or it can unravel tyranny and push for something more just. Yet, inevitably, to Cohen\u2019s character, there will be murder. In which case, what really is the right thing to do?\\n\u201cOn That Day\u201d (2004) Cohen wrote this as a response to the September 11th attacks. It is an artifact that represents reactions to what happened. He sings, \u201cSome people say it\u2019s what we deserve for sins against god, for crimes in the world.\u201d There are others who blame it on the fact that women live \u201cunveiled\u201d or because the country has its fortunes as well as people who are subjugated. Whatever the case may be, Cohen does not seek to settle the discussion. Rather, he seems more interested in whether those who survived were able to press onward. So he poses a rhetorical question: \u201cDid you go crazy or did you report on that day?\u201d Then the song abruptly ends.\\n\u201cAmen\u201d (2012) This song comes from the latter era of Cohen\u2019s life, where the sultry nature of his music took on a much more wistful and brooding characteristic. He wrote about love but love in a time of war or love with inescapable horror all around.\\nIn \u201cAmen,\u201d the character Cohen channels desperately wants to love. He must first see through the terror around him. He does not think he can love until the \u201cvictims are singing and laws of remorse are restored.\u201d He does not think he can love until the \u201cday has been ransomed and night has no right to begin.\u201d He awaits some kind of redemption and only then will he be able to feel wanted again, but there is too much despair and destruction right now for the character to indulge in pleasure.\\n\u201cAlmost Like the Blues\u201d (2014) We live in a world of permanent war, and so, in this gorgeously layered piece of music, Cohen grapples with atrocities he witnessed. \u201cI saw some people starving. There was murder, there was rape. Their villages were burning. They were trying to escape. I couldn\u2019t meet their glances. I was staring at my shoes. It was acid. It was tragic. It was almost like the blues.\u201d\\nFew of Cohen\u2019s songs are as profound. The song, which appears on \u201cPopular Problems,\u201d could easily be grappling with what goes through the minds of war criminals. He sings, \u201cI have to die a little between each murderous thought, and when I\u2019m finished thinking, I have to die a lot.\u201d The soldier witnesses torture or is party to it. He witnesses killing or is party to it. \u201cAnd there\u2019s all my bad reviews.\u201d It seems his superiors are unhappy with his performance. Maybe, they do not think he is killing enough. Whatever the case may be, he has lost his grip on morality entirely and finds himself confronting the scope of his sins.\\n\u201cA Street\u201d (2014) To Cohen, \u201cPopular Problems\u201d was all about dealing with defeat . He told the Telegraph the lyrics were about facing down failure, disappointment, bewilderment\u2014especially the \u201cdark forces that modify our lives.\u201d What is a person to do?\\n\u201cRecognize that your struggle and your suffering is the same as everyone else\u2019s,\u201d Cohen suggested. \u201cI think that\u2019s the beginning of a responsible life. Otherwise, we are in a continual savage battle with each other with no possible solution, political, social, or spiritual.\u201d\\nWhile referring to \u201cA Street,\u201d which is about a faltering romance during war, he added, \u201cWhen I say \u2018the party\u2019s over but I\u2019ve landed on my feet\\u2009. I\u2019m standing on this corner where there used to be a street,\u2019 I think that\u2019s probably the theme of the whole album. Yeah, the scene is blown up, but you just can\u2019t keep lamenting the fact. There is another position. You have to stand in that place where there used to be a street and conduct yourself as if there still is a street.\u201d\\nIn a very basic sense, the master of romantic despair, the high priest of pathos, has now gone up to that Tower of Song, meant people have to find ways to keep living. They have to exist, and by existing, that is in and of itself an act of resistance to all the depravity that unfolds around them.\\nThe post The Political Songs Of Leonard Cohen appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n\""}, "time": 1742563591.6903589}
