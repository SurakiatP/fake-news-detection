The parade organizers, the Allied War Veterans Council of South Boston, voted unanimously late Friday to reverse their decision made on Tuesday to exclude the group, OutVets, which had marched in the event the past two years. OutVets had been given two reasons for being excluded  \u2014   its application was late and the rainbow in the group\u2019s logo, worn on jackets, was in violation of the parade\u2019s code of conduct. But after the organizers voted 9 to 4 to exclude OutVets, council members came under increasing pressure to reconsider. Top politicians in the state, including the governor, Charlie Baker, and the mayor of Boston, Martin J. Walsh, announced they would skip the parade. The reversal came during a meeting arranged by Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, and other elected officials at the V. F. W. Post 561 in South Boston. After the meeting, members of the Allied War Veterans Council said the change was the right decision. \u201cThey volunteered like everyone else did, and they will be treated with respect and dignity at this parade,\u201d Edward Flynn, a member of the council, told    in Boston. The organizers voted 11 to 0 to make OutVets a permanent participant and will not require the group to resubmit an application for this year\u2019s parade. Dee Dee Edmondson, a lawyer for OutVets, said the group was stunned by the turn of events. \u201cEverything that we wanted to have happened has happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s history in making. \u201d OutVets will also be the lead group in the parade, she said.'"}, "time": 1742628499.4689846}
