DeGioia, the university\u2019s president, took a first step on Monday toward making amends to their descendants. He walked into the public library in Spokane, Wash. for a private meeting with Patricia   a     of Nace and Biby Butler, two of the slaves who were sold in 1838 to help keep the college afloat. The   meeting, which was followed by a lunch at the nearby Davenport Hotel, may well have been a historic one. More than a dozen universities have recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. But historians say they believe this is the first time that the president of an elite university has met with the descendants of slaves who had labored on a college campus or were sold to benefit one. \u201cI came to listen and to learn,\u201d Mr. DeGioia said in an interview, describing the discussion as \u201cmoving and inspiring. \u201d Ms.   an amateur genealogist and retired teacher, said she believed Mr. DeGioia was willing to take necessary steps \u201cto honor the sacrifice and legacy\u201d of her ancestors. \u201cHe asked what could he do and how could he help,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt was a very good beginning. \u201d The meeting comes as officials at Georgetown continue to grapple with how to address the college\u2019s complicity in the slave sale. The slaves, who were owned by the Jesuit priests who founded and ran the college, were sold for about $3. 3 million in today\u2019s dollars. A portion of the profit  \u2014   about $500, 000  \u2014   was used to help pay off Georgetown\u2019s debts at a time when the college was struggling financially. The slaves, who had lived on Jesuit estates in Maryland that had helped to finance the college\u2019s operations, were uprooted and shipped to plantations in Louisiana. A working group assembled by Mr. DeGioia in September has been considering whether the university should apologize for profiting from slave labor, create a memorial to those enslaved, or provide scholarships for their descendants, among other possibilities. The report is expected to be released this summer, Mr. DeGioia said. Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the roots of elite universities in slavery, said he did not know of another instance in which a university president had reached out to descendants. \u201cGeorgetown has made a decision to recognize the humanity of the problem they\u2019re dealing with, to treat it as more than a public relations problem,\u201d Mr. Wilder said. The search for descendants of the men, women and children sold in 1838 intensified in the fall after Georgetown students called on the university to remove the names of the Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry from two campus buildings. The priests were two of Georgetown\u2019s early presidents. Both were involved in the slave sale. Mr. DeGioia, who had already called for a campuswide discussion about the college\u2019s roots in slavery, agreed to change the names of the buildings. The student protests inspired a Georgetown alumnus, Richard J. Cellini, to found a nonprofit, the Georgetown Memory Project, to help identify and support the descendants of the people who were sold. Mr. Cellini hired eight genealogists, including Ms.   and several researchers who are working with her. University officials are also identifying descendants of the slaves. Ms.   said that she made a point of telling Mr. DeGioia what she knew about her ancestors and emphasizing the importance of the university\u2019s archival records. This year, Georgetown created an online archive that includes records that describe the slave sale and the Jesuit and Louisiana plantations. \u201cThese were real people,\u201d Ms.   said of her enslaved forebears, \u201cand I wanted to put faces on them for him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628511.0973575}
