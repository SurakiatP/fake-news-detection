S. Constitution and the overall \u201cfoundation of the American way of life,\u201d declared Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an expert at the Hoover Institution think tank, during a Senate panel hearing. [Meanwhile, Michael Leiter, the former director of the U. S. National Counterterrorism Center, argued that sharia law is compatible with the American Constitution.  \u201cMuslim\u2019s honoring of Sharia is not inherently in tangent with living in constitutional democracies anymore than it would be for Christians or Jews who also seek to honor their religious traditions while still complying with civil authority,\u201d testified Leiter. The     Ali  \u2014   an honor violence victim, a strong advocate against female genital mutilation (FGM) and author  \u2014   strongly disagreed. During a hearing on Islamic ideology and terror held by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Wednesday, Ali testified alongside the former U. S. official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \u201cMy central argument is that political Islam implies a constitutional order fundamentally incompatible with the US Constitution and with the \u2018constitution of liberty\u2019 that is the foundation of the American way of life,\u201d proclaimed Ali in her written testimony. She later stressed, \u201cLet it be said explicitly: the Islamists\u2019 program is fundamentally incompatible with the US Constitution, religious tolerance, the equality of men and women, the tolerance of different sexual orientations, the ban on cruel and unusual punishment and other fundamental human rights. \u201d Ali explained that intimidation and advancing the goal of imposing Islamic law (sharia) on society are fundamental tenets of political Islam. She noted that \u201cIslamism\u201d is the ideology that drives political Islam and \u201cdawa\u201d provides the means by which it is spread, adding: The term \u201cdawa\u201d refers to activities carried out by Islamists to win adherents and enlist them in a campaign to impose sharia law on all societies. Dawa is not the Islamic equivalent of religious proselytizing, although it is often disguised as such by blending humanitarian activities with subversive political activities  \u2026     The ultimate goal of dawa is to destroy the political institutions of a free society and replace them with strict sharia. Islamists rely on both violent and nonviolent means to achieve their objectives. The strategy used by the United States to combat violent Islamic extremism has \u201cfailed\u201d because it has solely focused on acts of violence while ignoring the ideology that drives jihadists and Islamists, argued Ali. She told lawmakers, \u201cThe dominant strategy from   through the present, focusing only on Islamist violence, has failed. In focusing only on acts of violence, we have ignored the ideology that justifies, promotes, celebrates, and encourages violence, and the methods of dawa used to spread that ideology. \u201d In order to reverse its failure, the United States has to fight \u201ca war of ideas against political Islam (or \u201cIslamism\u201d) as an ideology and against those who spread that ideology,\u201d advised Ali. President Donald Trump advocating for an ideological campaign against \u201cradical Islam\u201d is \u201crefreshing and heartening,\u201d testified Ali, adding, \u201cThis deserves to be called a paradigm shift. \u201d She noted that Trump\u2019s position marks a departure from his predecessors. Ali pointed out that Islam is on the rise across the world and jihadist groups have proliferated despite the U. S. spending at least $3. 6 trillion on combat and reconstruction costs in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and sacrificing more than 5, 000 American service members and the tens of thousands of wounded U. S. troops. \u201cAccording to one estimate, 10\u221215 percent of the world\u2019s Muslims are Islamists. Out of well over 1. 6 billion, or 23 percent of the globe\u2019s population, that implies more than 160 million individuals,\u201d mentioned Ali. \u201cBased on survey data on attitudes toward sharia in Muslim countries, total support for Islamist activities in the world is likely significantly higher than that estimate. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562250.9950013}
