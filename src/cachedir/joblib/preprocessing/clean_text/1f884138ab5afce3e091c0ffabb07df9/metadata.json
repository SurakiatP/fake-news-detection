Democracy is supposed to be about open, fair and free elections, and those elections must be predicated on open, fair and free access to information so that voters can make an informed decision. Yet all we have today is a media that\u2019s in the tank for Hillary, a justice system infiltrated by deep state corruption, a voting system rife with leftist fraud, a culture of extremist, violent intimidation of those who oppose Clinton and an Obama regime steeped in such criminality and fraud that it actively encourages illegal aliens to run across the border to America so they can vote. \\nThis isn\u2019t an election\u2026 it\u2019s a coordinated leftist coup d\u2019etat . \\nThe aim of the coup is to occupy all the positions of power in America with radical leftists, communists and criminal democrat party loyalists. From those positions of power, the strategy is to systematically dismantle the American Constitution, Bill of Rights and Supreme Court while crushing the American middle class with punitive economic policies that keep the masses trapped in poverty (Obamacare, anyone?). \\nIt\u2019s now abundantly obvious to nearly every thinking person that democracy has been ripped to shreds in America , and the deep state criminal regime in power exists solely to protect and enrich itself at the expense of everyone else. \\nGONE is the idea of representing the interests of the People. \\nGONE is any desire for government to operate with transparency and accountability. \\nGONE is any trust in voters by the powerful elite, who distrust the voters so much that they make sure every election is rigged in advance. \\nGONE is any economic policy rooted in sanity or mathematics. Now, numbers and dollars from Washington are all rooted in mental illness and delusion. \\nGONE is any semblance of the concept that justice is blind and that all laws apply to all the people just the same, no matter how powerful they may be. \\nGONE is any public trust in ANY institution of government, from Congress, to the federal courts, to the regulators like the EPA, to even the FBI. \\nGONE is any notion that the government should defend the nation\u2019s borders and control the flow of immigrants into the country for all the obvious reasons. \\nAnd GONE is any concept of journalistic integrity across the mainstream media, an institution that now holds actual journalism in contempt (i.e. the work of Wikileaks or Project Veritas). Now, the media insists that no one question the government, no transparency is necessary, and government operatives have no obligation to explain any of their actions or cover-ups. Richard Nixon is rolling in his grave\u2026 The illusion of democracy \\nThanks to the complete abandonment of democracy and honest government in America, We the People now wake up each day as slaves living in a totalitarian dictatorship pretending to be a democracy , complete with a pretend press, a pretend judicial system, a pretend legislative branch and even a pretend central bank pumping out pretend currency. \\nWe turn on our televisions to watch pretend journalists named \u201cStephanopoulos\u201d churn out pretend news that pretends Bill and Hillary Clinton are honest, affectionate, trustworthy elders instead of the phony frauds and crooks they\u2019ve really turned out to be. And then we\u2019re blasted with pretend polls that claim the most unpopular woman in America \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 is somehow ahead of Donald Trump by 12 points. Nobody believes the polls anymore\u2026 \\nEvery time REAL news breaks through the surface, the establishment tells us that\u2019s all fake. Wikileaks emails, we\u2019re ridiculously told, aren\u2019t real (even though they are). Project Veritas videos have been \u201cedited,\u201d we\u2019re told, as if that somehow negates the very clear words caught on video as they are uttered by Clinton operatives committing serious crimes. The only news that\u2019s \u201creal,\u201d we\u2019re told, is the fabricated fake news planted in the New York Times by the Clinton campaign. A call to arrest and imprison the presstitutes that are defrauding America and destroying democracy \\nIn truth, the leftist media is staffed by presstitutes \u2014 media whores who have sold out to the Clintons in exchange for \u201caccess\u201d to her bogus news releases (i.e. planted false narratives). As reported by The Free Thought Project , all the following \u201cjournalists\u201d are seditious whores who should no doubt be arrested, indicted and prosecuted for engaging in criminal collusion and racketeering with the Clintons: \\n\u201cProgressive Helpers\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562483.7744005}
