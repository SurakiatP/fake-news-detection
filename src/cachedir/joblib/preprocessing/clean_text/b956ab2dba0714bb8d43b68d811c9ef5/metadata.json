Four top Senate Democrats gave Comey an ultimatum \u2013give us a full accounting of what you know about this, and do so by Monday. \\nSenators Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Tom Carper, and Ben Cardin fired off a \u201cwhat the hell is going on here?\u201d letter to Comey and his nominal boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, demanding answers about Comey\u2019s \u201cvaguely worded\u201d letter on Friday afternoon. They are the ranking members of the Senate committees that were most involved in the email server investigation\u2013Intelligence (Feinstein), Judiciary (Leahy), Homeland Security (Carper), and Foreign Relations (Cardin). \\nRead the full letter here, courtesy Cardin\u2019s Twitter feed. \\n\u2014 Senator Ben Cardin (@SenatorCardin) October 30, 2016 \\nIn a colossal understatement, they pointed out that the letter didn\u2019t answer any questions, but in fact left a lot of them unanswered. For one thing, Comey\u2019s letter didn\u2019t clarify whether the FBI even had the emails in its custody, let alone had a chance to review them. Comey also didn\u2019t say whether Hillary sent the emails, or if they even had anything to do with the investigation. Additionally, it represented a radical departure from FBI and Justice Department policy against doing anything that could potentially influence an election. \\nThe Senators also noted that Comey had told his own troops that he didn\u2019t know just how significant those emails were, and that there was a possibility that his letter would be \u201cmisunderstood.\u201d In light of the fact that this letter has already been misunderstood, Feinstein, Carper, Leahy, and Cardin want Comey and Lynch\u2013in truth, Comey\u2013to give the Senate \u201cdetailed information\u201d about the FBI\u2019s actions no later than the close of business on Monday. To not do so, they add, \u201cwould be irresponsible and a disservice to the American people.\u201d \\nThere were already a number of reasons why Comey should be very afraid. For one thing, at the time, the FBI had not even obtained a warrant for the emails it discovered on the laptop of longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin while investigating her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, for inappropriate texts with a teenager. So Comey felt the need to alert the House and Senate about these emails, when his people hadn\u2019t even asked a court to review them. \\nWe also know that Comey\u2019s rumored excuse\u2013that the emails were likely to be leaked unless he told Congress about them first\u2013doesn\u2019t wash. Judge Jeanine Pirro , no fan of Hillary, thinks Comey could have easily solved that problem by privately notifying the committee chairmen and putting them on notice that he would know who was behind any leaks. \\nBut on Sunday afternoon, The Washington Post reported that the FBI hadn\u2019t gotten a warrant for those emails despite knowing for at least a month that those messages were potentially relevant to the email server case. It finally obtained a warrant on Sunday night. How is Comey going to explain that to the Senate, especially since he knew how explosive this could have been? \\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Comey\u2019s own troops are steaming mad at him, according to Newsweek and Vanity Fair\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald. Here\u2019s what Eichenwald has learned, by way of review. Word from inside @FBI . FURIOUS at Comey, think he\\'s mishandled public revelations from get go. \"Outrageous incompetence\" one agent told me. \\n\u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 \u2026his original decision to lay out info on clinton case, then opine on what it meant outside of criminal findings, infuriated these folks.. \\n\u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 Re: anger within @FBI at Comey. I am getting this at the Special Agent, ASAC and SAC level. Those are the troops. (Most of em GOPrs)\u2026. \\n\u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 \u2026for Comey to have so angered ppl at the field office level is really, really bad. \\n\u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 If Comey\\'s improper comment on ongoing investigation changes polls, @FBI reputation as apolitical will never recover cause of his screwup. \\n\u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 \\nWhile Feinstein, Leahy, Carper, and Cardin played good cop, their boss, Minority Leader Harry Reid, played bad cop, accusing Comey of breaking the Hatch Act . I wouldn\u2019t quite go that far. But when the best-case scenario is that Comey was grossly incompetent, that isn\u2019t good. \\nComey\u2019s actions may not have risen to the level of criminal conduct. However, it is clear beyond any doubt that he cannot lead. Eichenwald has talked to a number of DOJ officials from both parties who feel the same way. Every current/former Dept. of Justice official I speak 2, GOP or Dem, says Comey must resign/be fired 4 election interference. All outraged. \\n\u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 30, 2016 \\nUnless Comey has a very good explanation for this\u2013and frankly, I doubt there is one\u2013we need to hear only two things from him after he briefs the Senate. He needs to apologize to the American people, and he needs to resign. \\n( featured image courtesy FBI Flickr feed, part of public domain) About Darrell Lucus \\nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school.
