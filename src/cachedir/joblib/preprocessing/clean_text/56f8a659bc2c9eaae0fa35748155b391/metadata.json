[The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for example, called the move \u201cthe latest in a series of efforts by President Trump to avoid public accountability. \u201d  In reality, the White House visitor logs rarely informed the public of anything. They were a fig leaf that let the Obama administration claim transparency while hiding its real operations. (Update: Moreover, the Obama administration went to court to resist releasing the visitor logs, at least initially.) Andrew Breitbart was the first to catch onto President Barack Obama\u2019s con game. In March 2011, he posted an essay  \u2014   at the Huffington Post, no less  \u2014   titled: \u201cThe White House Guess List: How Obama Pulled a Fast One on the American People  \u2014   in the Name of \u2018Transparency. \u2019\u201d Breitbart pointed out that \u201cthe visitor logs may hide more than they reveal\u201d: The White House is still holding back \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of visitor logs, according to congressional testimony last week by Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, who also added that \u201cthe Obama administration is less transparent than the Bush administration. \u201d We also know that some of the most important presidential visitors don\u2019t even walk into the White House. The administration meets K Street lobbyists at Caribou Coffee, and holds secret meetings in Jackson Place townhouses  where there are no visitor logs. The visitor logs that have been released are problematic, because they are simply lists of names, with no way to verify whether a specific name belongs to a particular person.   \u2026     With no way to verify, there is no real transparency. The visitor logs were a key part of President Barack Obama\u2019s claim to have run \u201cthe most transparent administration in history. \u201d But in every other way, he was one of the least transparent presidents in the   era. Obama \u201cset a record\u201d for failing to comply with Freedom of Access to Information Act requests, among other   sins. Obama\u2019s visitor logs were no deterrent to the crooked and malevolent. Logs revealed that   activist Robert Creamer, a convicted felon and the man behind an effort to instigate violence at Trump campaign events, visited the White House some 340 times, with 45 visits including the president himself. The media never cared, nor did he. Arguably, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. The fact that the Trump administration took advantage of the Good Friday holiday to announce the policy change might suggest some degree of moral doubt. Yet the fact is that visitor logs were never a useful tool to enforcing executive transparency. Better tools are needed, and it is foolish to pretend otherwise. Joel B.
