Gathered in Philadelphia for their annual congressional retreat, less than a week after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, lawmakers exulted in the possibilities of total government control, grinning through forums about an aggressive   agenda that began with honoring a central campaign promise: repealing the Affordable Care Act. Adult beverages flowed. Members were given   socks. And the president showered praise on his most important partner, the man with the   pen, the man who would find the votes. \u201cSpeaker Paul Ryan  \u2014   very, very special,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe is writing his heart out, right? And we\u2019re actually going to sign the stuff that you\u2019re writing. \u201d \u201cNow,\u201d the president said, \u201cit\u2019s going to happen. \u201d It is not going to happen. At least not this time. Less than 18 months after being elected speaker, Mr. Ryan has emerged from the defeat of the health care bill badly damaged, retaining a grip on the job but left to confront the realities of his failure  \u2014   imperiling the   partnership that was supposed to sustain a new era of conservative government under unified Republican rule. So far, to the surprise of some close to Mr. Trump, the president has remained upbeat on Mr. Ryan, a frequent punching bag during the 2016 campaign and an ideological mismatch whose instincts informed the molding and selling of the health bill far more than the president\u2019s own. But after a humiliating defeat, which many Trump advisers are eager to pin on the speaker, Mr. Ryan is now tasked with defending not just his leadership abilities but his very brand of conservatism in a party fitfully searching for a coherent policy identity that can deliver tangible victories. In this first fight, Mr. Ryan\u2019s more orthodox   vision was   only halfheartedly by Mr. Trump, who has few fixed political beliefs, in service of a bill the president never well understood, even as he laid on the superlatives in praising it. Now, Mr. Ryan must tug a ruptured conference toward future agenda items, like overhauling the tax code, made all the more difficult by this initial failure. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get blamed,\u201d Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a vocal Trump supporter, said of the speaker as he left the Capitol on Friday, making clear he did not believe this would be fair. \u201cHe\u2019ll get blamed for everything. \u201d The episode not only demonstrated an inability to honor a longstanding pledge that powered Republicans through a string of election cycles. It was also a remarkable setback for Mr. Ryan as the body\u2019s principal   in his first major test as the speaker under a Republican president. In January, he coasted to   with almost unanimous party support, prompting allies to gloat that he had tamed the   House Freedom Caucus far more deftly than his predecessor, John A. Boehner. By Friday, his bill had at once alienated those archconservatives and more moderate members who abandoned the legislation as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump began caving to demands of the far right, to little effect. \u201cWe were a   opposition party, where being against things was easy to do,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a sheepish news conference shortly after the bill was pulled, adding with uncharacteristic candor that Republicans were not yet prepared to be a \u201cgoverning party. \u201d \u201cWe will get there,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201cbut we weren\u2019t there today. \u201d His job will not get easier. With disparate coalitions in his conference, outside groups like the political arm of the Heritage Foundation pushing lawmakers to pursue conservative purity, and a    president whom some members have appeared more willing to buck recently, there are few establishment forces helping Mr. Ryan keep the peace. \u201cThere is a lot more safety in opposition than there used to be,\u201d said Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader who was ousted by a more conservative challenger, citing pressure from the outside groups. At the same time, several Trump allies have suggested that Mr. Ryan has still failed to grasp fully the lessons of the president\u2019s election and its rejection of traditional political dogma. The most ominous signals have proliferated on sites like Breitbart, often the online id of Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Its lead headlines on Saturday morning included: \u201cPolls: GOP Legislators Dodged 2018 Headache When Leaders Dropped Ryancare\u201d and \u201cSpeaker Ryan Crippled? Replacement Chatter Erupts on Hill. \u201d But as the bill circled the congressional drain, Republicans appeared broadly supportive of Mr. Ryan, grateful for his steady hand and policy fluency and mindful of the risks he took last year as Mr. Trump\u2019s     campaign nemesis, giving members cover during a tumultuous election cycle. Most suggested there was nothing he could have done differently to secure the necessary votes. \u201cIf he can\u2019t deliver them, they can\u2019t be delivered,\u201d said Representative Chris Collins of New York, a close Trump ally. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not blaming Paul Ryan in the least. \u201d Others grew more wistful, recalling that Mr. Ryan had to be coaxed into seizing the speaker\u2019s gavel in the first place. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask to do it,\u201d said Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. \u201cWe wanted a speaker who could articulate our principles, who could go on everybody\u2019s radio shows and everybody\u2019s TV shows, and go district to district in many cases, selling and articulating our philosophy, as well as sometimes pretty nerdy legislative stuff. He was tireless in that effort. \u201d A handful of Republicans took veiled swipes at the House leadership as the bill flailed. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan wrote Friday night on Twitter that the House was \u201csupposed to be a deliberative body where outcomes are discovered, not dictated. \u201d \u201cCompromise  consensus cannot be centrally planned,\u201d said Mr. Amash, a member of the Freedom Caucus. But the chief wild card, as ever, is Mr. Trump. In his private conversations, the president has remained supportive of Mr. Ryan, declining to join in his advisers\u2019 frustrations over how the bill was handled in the House. One adviser described him as still \u201csmitten\u201d with Mr. Ryan. \u201cI want to thank Paul Ryan. He worked very, very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday. \u201cI will tell you that. He worked very, very hard. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s praise for Mr. Ryan seemed to owe, at least in part, to the fact that the speaker had repeatedly kept him informed throughout the negotiations. Mr. Ryan was also exceedingly deferential to the president, casting him for days as the consummate closer and a winner of the highest order. \u201cThe president gave his all in this effort,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s really been fantastic. \u201d Dynamics could shift quickly. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have for days been casting blame on Mr. Ryan, who is close with the president\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Mr. Trump is also known to grow angrier over time, particularly if faced with public embarrassment. On Friday, Mr. Ryan was quick to adopt Mr. Trump\u2019s favored rationale during the health fight, arguing that Republicans had been doing Democrats a grand favor by dismantling President Barack Obama\u2019s health law in the first place and that Democrats would eventually suffer the consequences. \u201cI\u2019m sure they may be pleased right now,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, but when they see \u201chow bad\u201d things get, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to like that, either. \u201d Mr. Ryan spoke from the same room where, just two weeks earlier, he delivered a slide show presentation live on cable, holding the attention of the political world  \u2014   clicker in hand, sleeves peeled above his forearms  \u2014   with a meditation on insurance premiums and Medicaid spending. For all the outward displays of collaboration, the exhibition demonstrated the gulfs, both philosophical and stylistic, that divided Mr. Ryan from the Trump White House. The administration had sought a different visual as the bill debuted to a critical panning: arranging competing stacks of paper in the White House briefing room, meant to demonstrate the relative simplicity of the Republican proposal compared with the thicker Affordable Care Act. \u201cThis is government,\u201d Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said at the time, gesturing first to the Democrats\u2019 bill, then the new one. \u201cThis is not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562458.7592459}
