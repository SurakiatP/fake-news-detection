Corporate governance experts are up in arms, because Tesla\u2019s visionary founder, the entrepreneur Elon Musk, also founded SolarCity and is the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity\u2019s chief executive is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin. There are overlapping directors. Critics called it blatant   and accused Mr. Musk of using valuable Tesla shares to bail out a struggling SolarCity. James S. Chanos  \u2014   an investor who, it should be noted, is betting against both stocks  \u2014   called it a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst. \u201d But what if the critics are wrong? Many auto industry experts also said the idea of combining Tesla, an   manufacturer, with SolarCity, which makes solar energy panels, makes no strategic sense. Even if energy generation, storage and an auto powertrain are a seamless product,   vertical integration, in which one manufacturer makes all the components, was the old Henry Ford model and later, General Motors\u2019. That approach has gone down in automotive history as a colossal failure. Adam Jonas, the influential auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his price target for Tesla and wrote in a note to clients that potential rewards would not adequately compensate investors for the greater risks and cash flow drain. Expanding into a   business like solar energy exposes Tesla to \u201cuntested cost, competitive and regulatory forces,\u201d he warned. Perhaps the harshest verdict came from the market itself: Tesla shares dropped more than 10 percent the day the deal was announced. It did not help Tesla\u2019s cause that a driver using its autopilot feature was killed in May, the first fatality of its kind. That news surfaced just after Mr. Musk made his offer. Mr. Musk \u201cwent overnight from being a genius to an idiot,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a large Tesla shareholder. Largely overlooked in the din, however, is that few, if any, of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics are Tesla\u2019s current shareholders. And they are the only ones who truly matter, because they\u2019ll have a vote on the deal and it\u2019s their money on the line. Tesla\u2019s four biggest shareholders after Mr. Musk are mutual fund managers, including the industry giants Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. None have announced how they\u2019ll vote, but they have a history of supporting management generally, and specifically Mr. Musk. Even before the deal was announced, a Fidelity portfolio manager, Gavin Baker, told investors, \u201cWe are fans not just of Tesla products but of the concepts underpinning the firm and potential future partnerships ahead of it. \u201d Ronald Baron, founder of Baron Capital, which owns 1. 5 million Tesla shares, said his initial reaction was, \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want to do this? Can\u2019t you buy these panels much cheaper in China?\u201d He said he had looked into investing in SolarCity several times, and each time decided to pass (a wise decision considering that SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year.) But after further research and discussions with Tesla management, Mr. Baron told me his concerns had been largely assuaged. \u201cUntil I read the proxy, I can\u2019t tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more we researched this, the more sense it made to combine Tesla with solar panels. We believe they can make better products, make them more efficiently, and realize tremendous savings by selling the two products together. \u201d Other investors have also been reconsidering the merits of the deal. Tesla shares have more than recovered what they lost after the deal was announced. And investors brushed off an announcement on Wednesday of    quarterly losses, focusing instead on higher vehicle production and new orders. Tesla tried to do its best to allay concerns about Mr. Musk\u2019s conflict of interest. Mr. Musk will not vote, nor will other insiders who own shares in both companies, a step that was not mandated by law. Tesla maintains that various committees of directors that it says are independent vigorously negotiated terms of the deal, and that Mr. Musk did not know the price before it was agreed on. When the deal became final on Monday, the price was slightly lower than that announced in June, suggesting some genuine haggling went on. But realistically, Mr. Musk\u2019s dominant role in both companies means that \u201cit\u2019s an intractable problem,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, an expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to resolve this. The only way would be not to do it. \u201d Tesla says that would elevate corporate governance purity at the expense of common sense. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take every appropriate step\u201d to minimize the conflict issues, Todd A. Maron, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cBut if there are synergies, which there are, and we can make the best product under one company\u2019s ownership, and we can persuade the independent shareholders to support the deal, there shouldn\u2019t be a strict prohibition just because someone is on both sides. \u201d Mr. Dennison of Zevenbergen Capital said that focusing on conflicts \u201cis missing the bigger picture. \u201d \u201cTo make these future products as good, integrated and efficient as possible,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need the two companies working together. \u201d He said his firm had not announced how it would vote, but he has typically sided with management. As for making its own batteries and solar panels and being vertically integrated, Tesla maintains it had little choice. \u201cTesla does not believe in vertical integration as an objective in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Maron said, but \u201cgoes down that path because there\u2019s no better option. \u201d Tesla has said its planned auto production volume would consume \u201ctoday\u2019s entire worldwide production of lithium ion batteries. \u201d Given Tesla\u2019s   vision and strategy, the deal should not have come as any great surprise. Mr. Musk talked about solar power in his \u201cmaster plan\u201d 10 years ago, and last month he elaborated in his \u201cmaster plan, part deux. \u201d \u201cCreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful     product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies. \u201d Admittedly, that\u2019s a   vision that has little to do with the latest quarterly earnings. If Tesla owners were plugging their cars into outlets with electricity from   power plants, there would not be much sustainability to get excited about. \u201cMusk\u2019s vision from Day 1 10 years ago was to accelerate sustainable energy, \u201c said Mr. Dennison. \u201cThat\u2019s a much bigger vision than building cars. \u201d And vision is what Tesla\u2019s shareholders are buying into, just as Amazon investors put their faith in Jeff Bezos. That\u2019s why, for all the controversy, the SolarCity deal will almost surely be approved by Tesla shareholders. \u201cIf you\u2019re investing in a Musk business, you\u2019re investing in something that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Mr. Baron. \u201cBut I love the guy. He\u2019s totally focused. He\u2019s already accomplished what people said could never be done. \u201d Mr. Dennison agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re investing in the people who make and execute decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obviously tied to a bigger picture and a   road map than most. But Tesla management has executed on all the goals they\u2019ve laid out. I\u2019d say this is an investment based on faith, but not blind faith. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562239.9387376}
