Domenech argued CNN was sacrificing \u201cbalance and centrism\u201d in its quest against Trump. Levin agreed with Domenech\u2019s findings but took it a step further by declaring that CNN was \u201cdestroying the First Amendment\u201d and that Trump was right to say the media are evil in some circumstances and singled out CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cYou can see how CNN has changed its coverage,\u201d Levin said. \u201cCNN is at war with Trump. CNN is violating  \u2014   CNN is destroying the First Amendment and freedom of the press. And when Jake Tapper says, \u2018How dare President [Trump] call us evil?\u2019 Jake, you\u2019re evil. You\u2019re unconscionable. All of you  \u2014   because you know exactly what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t care. \u201d Later in the segment, Levin argued there was more truthful reporting on Russia TV than CNN, adding that he had never watched Russia TV before. \u201cI think you get more truthful reporting on Russia TV, which I have never watched in my life, than you get on CNN,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do I know? Because you don\u2019t get truthful reporting on CNN. And you know what you\u2019re getting on Russia TV. They call themselves \u2018Russia TV.\u2019 \u2018Oh  \u2014   must be about Russia or something, Russia TV.\u2019 CNN pretends to be something it\u2019s not  \u2014   an objective news organization. It\u2019s not an objective news organization. They got one clown after another, one fool after another, one Democratic appointee after another.
