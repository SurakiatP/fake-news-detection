The daring rescue was unfolding at an altitude of nearly 12, 500 feet in the Mont Blanc massif near Chamonix after the cars came to a halt around 2 p. m. between the Aiguille du Midi in France and Pointe Helbronner in Italy. A    boy was among those stranded, according to   Leclerc, the prefect of   who spoke at a news conference. \u201cWe had to stop the rescuing operations when the night came because the helicopters can\u2019t do the rescuing operation when it is dark,\u201d Floriane Macian, a spokeswoman for the prefecture, said in a telephone interview. A dozen passengers were evacuated by an Italian rescue team. That part of the operation was not done by helicopter because the cable car was close enough to the ground, according to Mathieu Dechavanne, the chief executive of the company that manages the cable cars. The rescue effort resumed Friday morning. The cars stopped because supporting cables and towing cables crossed in several places. \u201cWe managed to uncross the cables in two places by pulling them, but we did not manage to uncross them in the third one,\u201d Mr. Dechavanne said in a phone interview. Mr. Dechavanne said he had called the rescue services at 5 p. m. to start evacuating the passengers. \u201cWe had to do it by helicopter and not vertically like we can do it in other places, because the ground underneath is of a glacial type so there is a risk of crevasses and it could lead to accidents,\u201d he said. The Daily Express, a British newspaper, reported that rescuers had harnessed themselves to the cables and climbed along to the cars and dropping down through hatches. Five rescue workers were remaining with some of the passengers, and the temperature was expected to drop to 32 degrees overnight. The passengers were given food and blankets. \u201cThey have a survival kit in each of the cable cars with cereals bars, water and survival blankets, and we contacted them by phone to explain everything,\u201d Mr. Dechavanne said. \u201cOnly two of the cable cars don\u2019t have rescue workers with them, they have the survival kit. \u201d The cable cars can usually carry up to 140 people, who often come to enjoy the view on the mountains at this time of the year in Chamonix. The ride takes 30 minutes. A passenger who was evacuated told The Express that he and his family had been trapped for hours. \u201cIt was me, my daughter and my son,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurer, 49, said. \u201cWe were two and a half hours in the cab locked under the sun. \u201d The cable car company said its Aiguille du Midi cable car holds the world record for the highest vertical ascent: 2, 807 meters, or 9, 209 feet.'"}, "time": 1742562363.222278}
