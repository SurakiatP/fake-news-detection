[On Twitter Thursday night in the midst of the attack and shutdown, Drudge questioned whether the U. S. government might be behind the attack, which he said was the largest in the website\u2019s history. Later, Drudge said the attack came from \u201cthousands\u201d of sources.  Attacking coming from \u2019thousands\u2019 of sources.  Of course none of them traceable to Fort Meade  \u2026      \u2014   MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) December 30, 2016,  Is the US government attacking DRUDGE REPORT?  Biggest DDoS since site\u2019s inception. VERY suspicious routing [and timing].  \u2014   MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) December 30, 2016,  Ace investigation reporter Sharyl Attkisson responded to one of Drudge\u2019s tweets, bringing up the fact that Drudge has been targeted by the left as a \u201cfake news\u201d site as part of a wider effort to censor and discredit    news organizations in the wake of the election of Donald Trump. @DRUDGE Maybe they think this is a proportional counterattack to Russia. After all they have decided @Drudge is Russian fake news, right?  \u2014   Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) December 30, 2016,  The disruption came the same night that the Obama administration issued sanctions against Russia over unproven allegations of hacking, a claim toward which Drudge has shown skepticism. The Drudge Report was one of the few news platforms that gave candidate Donald Trump fair coverage during the presidential primary, thereby incurring the wrath of the establishment Republicans as well as the Democrat establishment. At press time, there was no firm confirmation of who or what caused the attack.'"}, "time": 1742561981.930351}
