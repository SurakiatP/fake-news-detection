Is this all I can do?\u2019 That\u2019s basically the dole like. Things being largely out of your control. Good to get training in early,\u201d shared concerned parent Olwyn Nelligan. \\nAs youth unemployment remains worryingly high in Ireland at over 15%, teachers striking for better pay have inadvertently given their students a window into what life will be like post-second level education for many of them as despite being keen to learn and further themselves all they have is free time on their hands. \\n\u201cTeachers are striking for better pay, and if they were granted it, it would could serve as a way for the government to show it cares about education standards in Ireland and those who provide it,\u201d explained one teacher on strike, pleading with the government to show the education sector the respect it deserves. \\nA government spokesman did respond when we put the teacher\u2019s concerns to them earlier today. \\n\u201cWe. Don\u2019t. Care. I thought that was pretty obvious. Have you not being paying attention to our policies for the last few years at all?\u201d the spokesman responded. \\n\u201cHaving said that teachers are the rock bed of the foundation of the first steps of a child\u2019s life, blah, blah, blah,\u201d the spokesman added. \\nThe government refused to comment on ongoing funding concerns with several IT colleges, or lengthy waiting lists for third level students wishing to access counselling services. \\nSome 99% of the country was backing the ASTI\u2019s bid to be paid for supervision work until they learned it may require an increase in their taxes in order to fund it.'"}, "time": 1742563756.3549323}
