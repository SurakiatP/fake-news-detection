CNN\u2019s Dana Bash learned that the hard way when she asked the question on everyone\u2019s mind: What were you thinking? \\nRather than answer, Trump threw a hissy fit. \\n\u201cI say the following: You have been covering me for the last \u2014 long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I\u2019ve been doing this for weeks straight,\u201d Trump said. \\n\u201cFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you\u2019ll ask me that question. I think that\u2019s a very rude question, to be honest with you.\u201d Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising? Donald Trump: \u201cNo, not at all\u201d https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r \\n\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 \\nFor those keeping score that short answer checks a lot of boxes: Whining about the media Flagrant conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health Groundless accusation that asking a simple question is \u201crude\u201d No answer whatsoever \\nTrump may be testy due to his slow realization that his campaign is under water, he has no practical way forward, and it would take a miracle to win. \\nInstead of even trying, he seems to be retreating to the things he knows will make him money after the election. His campaign recently launched the prototype to \u201cTrump TV,\u201d a daily live stream filled with confused campaign staffers, shameless opportunists and Rudy Giuliani. He also seems desperate to salvage his failing properties, something that may not be possible after running a campaign that offended practically every group in America. \\nAlready there are signs that Trump\u2019s hotels have taken a hit. Yahoo explains : Rates for rooms at Trump\u2019s new D.C. hotel are being slashed as travelers weigh their options, and smartphone data suggest fewer people are visiting his properties compared to rival venues nearby. The Republican nominee for president is in danger of losing not just the election, but something dear to a man who claims the marketing value of his name alone is worth $3 billion: the many customers, mostly wealthy, who have stayed at his hotels, played a round at his golf courses or held galas at his oceanside resorts. \\nTrump may find that his bigotry has cost him not only the election, but the fortune he valued more than his reputation as well. \\nFeatured image via Twitter'"}, "time": 1742561806.3205206}
