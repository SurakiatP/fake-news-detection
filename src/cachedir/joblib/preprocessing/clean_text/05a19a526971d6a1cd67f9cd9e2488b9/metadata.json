The sentence  \u2014   in one of the most divisive police misconduct cases in recent New York City history  \u2014   came just moments after the judge took the unusual steps of ruling that the shooting was essentially an accident and reducing the jury\u2019s verdict on manslaughter charges to the less severe criminally negligent homicide. Though the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office promised to appeal the ruling, the sentencing was a decisive move in the politically contentious case that highlighted concerns over police accountability, especially in black neighborhoods, but never neatly fit the narrative of other killings by   officers around the country. It is rare for police officers even to be charged and brought to court in shooting cases while this one resulted in a guilty verdict at a   trial this winter, the sentencing was deeply disappointing to the family of the victim, Akai Gurley. As Justice Danny K. Chun of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn imposed five years of probation and 800 hours of community service, Mr. Liang sat still at the defendant\u2019s table showing little emotion. Behind him, the benches were packed with Mr. Gurley\u2019s loved ones. When the hourlong hearing came to an end and it was clear that Mr. Liang would not serve time in prison, Hertencia Petersen, Mr. Gurley\u2019s aunt, stepped into a hallway shouting: \u201cThere is no justice! Akai Gurley\u2019s life didn\u2019t matter!\u201d Mr. Gurley died on Nov. 20, 2014, when his heart was pierced by a ricocheting bullet that Mr. Liang had fired while on a night patrol in a dark stairwell in the Louis H. Pink Houses in the East New York neighborhood. In February, a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, rejecting his testimony that the gun had simply gone off in his hand and finding that he had failed to help Mr. Gurley as he lay dying on a   landing. Before the sentence was issued, Mr. Gurley\u2019s girlfriend, Melissa Butler, who was with him when he died, told Mr. Liang that even today, she was still in pain and needed the solace of justice. \u201cYou took a piece of me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou took a piece of my heart. \u201d Moments later, Mr. Liang himself stood and turned toward Ms. Butler and the others, apologizing for having killed a man they loved. \u201cThe shot was accidental,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life has forever changed. \u201d It was at that point that Justice Chun announced that he was going to reduce the manslaughter verdict, saying there was no evidence that Mr. Liang was even aware of Mr. Gurley\u2019s presence in the stairwell. \u201cThis was not an intentional act,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThis was a criminally negligent act. As such, I find incarceration not necessary. \u201d Just minutes earlier, Paul Shechtman, the former officer\u2019s lawyer, had said much the same thing, telling Justice Chun that while other police officers in recent years had maliciously hurt and killed young black men, Mr. Liang \u201cis not them. \u201d After the hearing, District Attorney Ken Thompson released a statement saying he planned to appeal Justice Chun\u2019s decision to reduce the jury\u2019s verdict  \u2014   an unusual move from a man who all along has taken a Solomonic approach to the complicated case. From the start, Mr. Thompson faced enormous pressure to pursue an indictment against Mr. Liang, who killed Mr. Gurley the same year that Eric Garner died during a police arrest on Staten Island. As Brooklyn\u2019s first black district attorney, Mr. Thompson had vowed to bring a heightened sense of social justice to the borough\u2019s communities of color. But after the conviction, Mr. Thompson issued a letter recommending that Mr. Liang should not serve time in prison. The letter referred to Mr. Gurley as \u201ca completely innocent man who lost his life for no reason,\u201d but also said Mr. Liang had no prior criminal history and posed no threat to public safety. In court on Tuesday, Justice Chun said that Mr. Thompson\u2019s recommendation was \u201centirely and completely appropriate. \u201d He added that on that November night two years ago, shooting Mr. Gurley was \u201cprobably the last thing\u201d on Mr. Liang\u2019s mind. Speaking after the hearing, Mr. Shechtman said he was pleased with the sentence and understood the disappointment of Mr. Gurley\u2019s family. \u201cWe have very mixed emotions,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said. \u201cBut this is a good day for Peter Liang in a year and a half when there haven\u2019t been many good days. \u201d As word of the sentence made its way onto the street, dueling groups of protesters erupted into chants and debate. About 60 people, waving signs and shouting, gathered around Ms. Petersen, Mr. Gurley\u2019s aunt. \u201cAnother black man has been murdered by the hands of the Police Department and the officer is not being held accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis right here is not the end. We\u2019re going to continue to fight until we get justice. \u201d Across the street, another crowd massed in support of Mr. Liang, who is of Chinese heritage. \u201cAccident does not mean crime,\u201d Helen Zhu said. \u201cChinese are no more silent. We just want justice  \u2014   justice for all. All people\u2019s lives matter. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561983.124721}
