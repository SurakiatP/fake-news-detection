To him, the fans seemed more interested in getting the perfect shot than in appreciating his   routine. But in late 2015, Mr. Chappelle discovered a technology called Yondr. Fans are required to place their cellphones into Yondr\u2019s   lockable pouch when entering the show, and a disk mechanism unlocks it on the way out. Fans keep the pouch with them, but it is impossible for them to snap pictures, shoot videos or send text messages during the performance while the pouch is locked. \u201cI know my show is protected, and it empowers me to be more honest and open with the audience,\u201d Mr. Chappelle said by email. After his first   performance, Mr. Chappelle was sold, and now he insists on deploying Yondr at all of his shows. Other entertainers have since used Yondr, including Alicia Keys, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Maxwell, and the actor, musician and comedian Donald Glover, who goes by the stage name Childish Gambino. Some have employed it for special listening parties, festivals, or   shows others, like Mr. Chappelle, have used it for entire tours. Of course, an artist or venue can always state that cellphone use is not permitted and trust fans to comply. But often people rebel. A   event \u201cis a very different experience,\u201d said Graham Dugoni, who founded Yondr. Chad Taylor, who manages Mr. Glover, among others, said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to meet people in the room when you\u2019re busy texting friends who aren\u2019t there. \u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to enjoy a concert experience when you\u2019re looking at it through an iPhone camera and trying to get the best shot. \u201d When the rocker Axl Rose reunited with his former Guns N\u2019 Roses bandmates, Duff McKagan and Slash, for the first time in 23 years, the concert was  . \u201cGod, it was wonderful,\u201d Mr. McKagan said of the first reunion show in April, at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. \u201cIt was the   feeling, where people were dancing and getting down. It was really cool. \u201d It was far different from a concert he did with his other band, Loaded, a few years ago in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. \u201cI started playing, and I was staring into a sea of iPads and bright lights,\u201d he said. He abruptly stopped the show and asked people to put their devices down, at which point the show improved vastly, he said.   bands might be more hesitant to try Yondr, as many rely on fans posting photos and videos to promote their shows. And some fans object to not being able to disseminate and see live shows via videotape. \u201cIf there were no cellphones, and you couldn\u2019t capture any video, it would be disappointing,\u201d said Steve Dintino, a Philadelphia music fan, who videotapes every concert he attends. He started filming shows in 1994 after attending a Frank Sinatra concert in Atlantic City, where he yelled \u201cI love you Frank\u201d from the front row, and Mr. Sinatra responded \u201cI love you too, pal. \u201d A friend recorded the show, and \u201cso I have the audio of that concert. \u201d Ever since then, \u201cI try to capture every concert that I go to in some capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to see it happening live\u201d from the comfort of your living room \u201cis incredible,\u201d said Chris Kooluris of Manhattan, a   music fan who has been to dozens of live shows and watched others online through Periscope, Twitter\u2019s video feature. \u201cI stayed up all night long looking for periscope feeds from the Guns N\u2019 Roses show in L. A.,\u201d Mr. Kooluris said. But when attending live shows, Mr. Kooluris said he prefers to see fewer cellphones. To resolve this issue, he suggests that bands allow one person to videotape the show and then give ticketholders access to the feed afterward. But Yondr is not just for concerts. The company has been renting its devices to schools, restaurants and wedding venues, and to movie studios for prescreening events, in the United States and abroad. In the future, it could also be used during live theater performances, at sporting events such as golf tournaments, and in spas and movie theaters, Mr Dugoni said. Mr. Dugoni, 29, was born in Portland, Ore. where his father is a physician and his mother is a homemaker. After graduating from Duke University with a B. A. in political science in 2009, he took a series of jobs  \u2014   teaching English in Vietnam, playing soccer in Norway in 2010, working at investment advisory firms in Portland and Atlanta, and joining a virtual currency   which failed, in San Francisco in 2013. Throughout his 20s, Mr. Dugoni became increasingly aware of  \u2014   and annoyed with  \u2014   the way people were glued to their cellphones as    social interaction took a back seat. He also saw issues with smartphones and privacy. \u201cAt a festival at Treasure Island in San Francisco in 2013, I saw some guy dancing pretty drunk and saw two strangers recording the guy, and they posted it to YouTube without the guy\u2019s knowledge,\u201d he said. With $15, 000 in his pocket, Mr. Dugoni set out to build Yondr. He spent about six months sketching designs, experimenting with 40 fabrics and locking devices, visiting hardware stores, and consulting with manufacturers in China before developing a prototype in 2014. But getting seed money to manufacture Yondr was a challenge. Silicon Valley investors thought the idea of   events was preposterous and almost laughed him out of the room. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. Undaunted, he turned to his hometown, where he raised $100, 000 from angel investors. \u201cI thought the idea had legs and great market potential,\u201d said Tony Arnerich, one of Yondr\u2019s investors and a longtime family friend. The company raised an additional $75, 000 in 2015. Yondr makes money by renting the devices for $2 a case each day, although it offers discounts for large quantities or for schools that use them for extended periods. The company\u2019s first paying job was in   and within six months it had turned a profit, Mr. Dugoni said. The technology has been used in 57 venues and 300 schools in 2016, up from five venues in 2015. Comedy Works, which has showcased such comedians as George Lopez and Wanda Sykes, has been using Yondr devices at its two clubs in Denver since May. \u201cAll of the big artists have said: \u2018Wow. Thank you. This is amazing,\u2019\u201d said Wende Curtis, the owner. Patrons have asked if they could buy the device for their homes, she said. (The company only rents the devices now, but is considering selling them in the future.) Some fans have been disgruntled. A few demanded refunds rather than give up their phones, Ms. Curtis said. And one drunken party of eight \u201cgot nasty\u201d and posted complaints on social media,\u201d she said. At a Dave Chappelle show, one inebriated fan chewed through the bottom of the pouch, recalled Corey Smyth, chief executive of Blacksmith Records, who works with Mr. Chappelle among others. The pouch allows phone signals to get through, so someone can feel a phone vibrate when a message arrives. Anyone who needs access during a show may leave the room, have the device unlocked and use the phone in the lobby or outside  \u2014   similar to the way smokers light up outside a nonsmoking theater. \u201cSome venue staff have access to their phones at all times inside the space,\u201d Mr. Dugoni said, in case of an emergency. Yondr is not a fad it is the wave of the future, Mr. Dugoni said. \u201cI view it as a social movement, and this is one piece of the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping people live in the digital age in a way that doesn\u2019t hollow out all of the meaning in your life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628515.0082583}
