[Responding to a photo of a Trump property in Istanbul, Nance tweeted: \u201cThis is my nominee for the first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property. \u201d He later deleted the tweet but has yet to issue an apology or explanation.   In the   to last year\u2019s presidential election, Nance described Donald Trump as the \u201cISIS candidate,\u201d and following his victory, predicted that Donald Trump\u2019s security and military advisors would lead to \u201cthe end of U. S.  East relations as it exists today. \u201d He also questioned whether Trump\u2019s victory meant America was \u201cteetering on the edge of fascism. \u201d Despite being a   expert, Nance also has a history of denying terrorist acts\u2019 connection to Islamism, describing the terrorist responsible for the bulldozing of civilians with a truck in Nice as \u201cmentally unstable,\u201d Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen as suffering from a \u201cphyschosexual problem,\u201d and the San Bernadino mass shootings as \u201ca hybrid act of   violence. \u201d Nance\u2019s comments also come at a time of a rising Islamist terror threat in Turkey, as the country\u2019s President Recep Erdo\u011fan turns the country into a religious state. In 2016 alone, the country was the target of dozens of terror attacks, ranging from car bombs to nightclub shootings.
