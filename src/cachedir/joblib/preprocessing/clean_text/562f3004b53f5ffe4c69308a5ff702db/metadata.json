Trump only weeks away, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain scolded Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday night for his speech criticizing Israel  \u2014   a public jab that would have been highly unlikely any other time during the Obama administration. In a statement that echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce criticism of the Obama administration, Mrs. May chided Mr. Kerry for, among other things, describing the Israeli government as the \u201cmost   in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. \u201d Mrs. May does \u201cnot believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally,\u201d a spokesman for the prime minister said, using the department\u2019s customary anonymity. Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech was praised by other European nations, including France and Germany. So the British slap  \u2014   especially after Mrs. May\u2019s government voted last week for a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction  \u2014   was something of a shock to Washington. \u201cWe are surprised by the U. K. Prime Minister\u2019s office statement,\u201d the State Department said in a statement, noting that Mr. Kerry\u2019s remarks \u201cwere in line with the U. K.\u2019s own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations. \u201d But Mrs. May, who leads a Conservative government, has been trying, with mixed success, to make inroads with the incoming Trump administration. A strong political and trading relationship with the United States has become even more important for Britain after its vote this year to leave the European Union. Ian Black, a visiting senior fellow at the Middle East Center of the London School of Economics, wrote on Twitter that Mrs. May\u2019s remarks were an \u201calarming early sign of \u2018Trump effect\u2019 on fawning Brits desperate to stay \u2018special\u2019 in Brexit era. \u201d So far, there have been some notable hiccups. The British government was vocally unhappy that the first British politician to meet with Mr. Trump after his election victory was not Mrs. May. Instead, it was one of her rivals, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the     U. K. Independence Party. The visit was even memorialized in a photograph of Mr. Farage and Mr. Trump standing in front of gilded doors at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Trump suggested publicly that Mrs. May appoint Mr. Farage as Britain\u2019s ambassador to the United States, a suggestion Mrs. May firmly rejected. Britain\u2019s relations with the Obama administration have not always been smooth, either, with major disagreements over Syria policy and military spending. But the countries are close, especially when it comes to NATO and the sharing of intelligence. Mrs. May\u2019s criticism of Mr. Kerry represented an extraordinary public rebuke, even if President Obama is about to exit the scene. But it also offered her a chance to establish common ground with the new American administration. Mr. Trump, a firm defender of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, has publicly disparaged the Obama administration for abstaining  \u2014   rather than using its veto  \u2014   last week in the Security Council vote on Israeli settlements. The   was also critical of Mr. Kerry\u2019s    speech, which defended the   solution for the   conflict, and called for an end to Israeli settlement activity that, he said, undermines that possibility. The British government has been working with Trump aides on an early visit to the White House by Mrs. May, to show the continuing strength of   ties. Kim Darroch, the British ambassador in Washington, has said that Mrs. May and Mr. Trump want to \u201cbuild on the legacy of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. \u201d In an election night diplomatic message about the Trump victory, leaked to The Sunday Times of London, Mr. Darroch discussed how the inexperienced Mr. Trump might be malleable to British advice and guidance. \u201cThe   is above all an outsider and unknown quantity, whose campaign pronouncements may reveal his instincts, but will surely evolve and, particularly, be open to outside influence if pitched right,\u201d Mr. Darroch wrote. \u201cHaving, we believe, built better relationships with his team than have the rest of Washington diplomatic corps, we should be well placed to do this,\u201d he continued. But Mr. Trump\u2019s initial discussions with foreign leaders have been haphazard. His first conversation with Mrs. May came after a string of other phone calls, when traditionally it has been the British prime minister who has the first call with an elected president. In an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper, Azriel Bermant, a lecturer in international relations at Tel Aviv University, suggested that, by criticizing Mr. Kerry and currying favor with both Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu, Mrs. May may be hoping to, as Mr. Darroch suggested, persuade Mr. Trump to act more moderately in the Middle East and support the   solution that Mr. Kerry was defending. \u201cMay might have calculated that retaining influence with the Netanyahu government requires her to distance herself from the Obama administration which is not flavor of the month in Jerusalem,\u201d Mr. Bermant wrote. \u201cBritain remains one of Israel\u2019s strongest allies in Europe and May wants to keep it that way. \u201d The issue Mrs. May took with Mr. Kerry\u2019s remarks was not about the legality of the Israeli settlements. The British government voted in favor of the Security Council resolution because, like other European members of the Council, Britain has long considered settlements beyond the 1967 armistice lines to be illegal. \u201cBut we are also clear that the settlements are far from the only problem in this conflict,\u201d Mrs. May\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cIn particular, the people of Israel deserve to live free from the threat of terrorism, with which they have had to cope for too long. \u201d In fact, while Mr. Kerry concentrated on the settlement issue, he also spoke of the need for Israelis to live with security, and he criticized Palestinians as not doing enough to combat terrorism. But with Mr. Trump elected, Britain is moving on.'"}, "time": 1742628555.0352635}
