Its mysterious nature continues to fascinate different areas of science, but now a group of researchers has discovered a new truth about it: the \u201csoul\u201d does not die; it returns to the universe. \\n\\n\\nSince 1996, Dr. Stuart Hameroff, an American Physicist and Emeritus in the Department of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Sir Roger Penrose, a mathematical physicist at Oxford University, have worked in a Quantum Theory of Consciousness in which they state that the soul is maintained in microtubules of the brain cells.\\n\\nTheir \u2018provocative\u2019 theory states that the human soul is be contained by the brain cells in structures inside them called microtubules.\\n\\nThe two researchers believe the human brain is in fact a \u2018biological computer\u2019 and the \u2018consciousness of humans\u2019 is a program run by the quantum computer located inside the brain that even continues to exist after we \u2018die.\u2019\\n\\nFurthermore, both scientists argue that what humans perceive as \u2018consciousness\u2019 is in fact the result of \u2018quantum gravity\u2019 effects located within the so-called \u2018microtubules.\u2019 This process is named by the two scientists \u201cOrchestrated Objective Reduction\u201d (Orch-OR). \\n\\nThe theory indicates that when people enter a phase known as \u2018clinical death,\u2019 the microtubules located in the brain lose their quantum state but maintain the information contained within them. In other words \u2013 as experts explain it after people die, their soul returns to the universe, and it does not die\u2019. \\nSpeaking to the Science Channel\u2019s Through the Wormhole documentary, Dr. Hameroff said: \\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the heart stops beating, the blood stops flowing; the microtubules lose their quantum state. The quantum information within the microtubules is not destroyed, it can\u2019t be destroyed, and it just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large. If the patient is resuscitated, revived, this quantum information can go back into the microtubules and the patient says \u201cI had a near-death experience.\u201d If they\u2019re not revived, and the patient dies, it\u2019s possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body, perhaps indefinitely, as a soul.\u201d \\nAccording to this theory, the human souls are more than just \u2018interactions\u2019 of neurons in our brain and could have been present since the beginning of time.\\n\\nAncient-Code \\nSOURCE '"}, "time": 1742561924.066243}
