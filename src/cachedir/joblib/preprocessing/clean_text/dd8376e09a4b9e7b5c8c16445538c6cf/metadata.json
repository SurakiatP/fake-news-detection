He will die in his bed\u2014like Pinochet and Franco\u2014and totally escape justice. The American media can be counted on to eulogize him as a great and \u201ctough-minded statesman.\u201d Bet on it. \u201cThe ICC move would mark the first time that a formal ICC investigation has scrutinized US actions and sets up a possible collision with Washington. Established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on July 1, 2002, it\u2019s mandated to prosecute individuals for genocide and aggression, as well as crimes of war and against humanity. Instead, it functions solely as an imperial tool, supports powerful interests, targets independent states Washington and other Western nations oppose. It lets America, its NATO partners, Israel and their rogue allies get away with mass murder. .. Bosco cites unnamed sources, indicating chief ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda \u201cwill seek to initiate an investigation in the coming weeks, likely after the US presidential election but before the end of the year\u2026 US officials visited The Hague,\u201d letting her know who\u2019s boss. It\u2019s unclear where she intends to go. On October 7, 2001, US-led NATO forces attacked Afghanistan without just cause \u2013 less than four weeks post-9/11, naked aggression planned months before that fateful day. .. Appalling war crimes followed, continuing daily. All post-WW II US wars were and continue being waged illegally against nonbelligerent countries reflecting over 70 years of unaccountability. No US government or military official ever faced charges for Nuremberg-level high crimes. It\u2019s irrelevant what Bensouda does or doesn\u2019t do. The 2002 American Service Members\u2019 Protection Act (ASPA, aka The Hague Invasion Act) \u201cprotect(s) United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international court to which the United States is not party.\u201d .. CIA boss and notorious war criminal Richard Helms. This scoundrel died in 2002, so he definitely escaped justice. \\nIt authorizes the president to use \u201call means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any US or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court.\u201d It prohibits the extradition of anyone from America to the ICC. In a November 2000 open letter, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Zbigniew Brzezinki, former CIA director Richard Helms and other US signatories said Washington must put \u201cour nation\u2019s military personnel safely beyond the reach of an unaccountable international prosecutor operating under procedures inconsistent with our Constitution.\u201d .. Kissinger\u2019s high crimes are well-documented. Brzezinski got Jimmy Carter to sign a secret directive, authorizing aid for Mujahadeen fighters combating the pro-Soviet Russia government in Kabul, aiming to induce Moscow\u2019s military intervention which followed, what Brzezinski called \u201cthe Afghan trap.\u201d .. Helms at CIA orchestrated Operation Phoenix in Vietnam, an assassination program claiming thousands of lives. Hillary Clinton, as junior New York Senator, supported the Hague Invasion Act. America and Israel, among other countries, failed to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. .. They remain unaccountable for the highest of high crimes. Expect Bensouda\u2019s investigation, if initiated, to accomplish nothing. Bosco admitted she\u2019ll \u201cbe launching one of the most difficult investigations the court has undertaken, both practically and politically.\u201d No internal or external judicial body ever tried holding America accountable for decades of Nuremberg-level high crimes.
