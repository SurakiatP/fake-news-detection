Mr. Netanyahu also announced that he would halt his country\u2019s contributions to several United Nations institutions, as well as   the presence of the body\u2019s representatives in Israel. In a televised address at a Hanukkah   ceremony honoring wounded soldiers and the victims of terrorism, Mr. Netanyahu excoriated the Obama administration for not vetoing the Security Council\u2019s measure. He said he would work with the incoming administration of   Donald J. Trump to rescind it. Describing the resolution passed on Friday as \u201cdistorted,\u201d \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cabsurd,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said it was \u201cpart of the swan song of the old world that is biased against Israel. \u201d \u201cBut, my friends, we are entering a new era,\u201d he added. Mr. Netanyahu, who is expecting the incoming Trump administration to be more forgiving of Israel\u2019s settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and in East Jerusalem, accused the Obama administration of carrying out a \u201cdisgraceful   maneuver. \u201d Mr. Netanyahu has already recalled Israel\u2019s ambassadors from New Zealand and Senegal, two of the four countries that sponsored the resolution and pushed it through, and has ordered Israeli aid to Senegal be halted. There was also a report that Mr. Netanyahu had canceled a visit to Israel by the prime minister of Ukraine, because of that country\u2019s vote in favor of the resolution. Mr. Netanyahu also said he had instructed the Foreign Ministry to   all of Israel\u2019s relationships with the United Nations, a body that Israel has long viewed as biased against it, and said he was stopping 30 million shekels  \u2014   about $7. 8 million  \u2014   in funding to five United Nations institutions that are \u201cparticularly hostile to Israel. \u201d There is no complete consensus in Israel about settlement projects, and domestic critics of Mr. Netanyahu saw the resolution as a severe blow to his recent claims about Israel\u2019s improved standing in the world. But Mr. Netanyahu tried to appeal to Israeli emotions by emphasizing that the resolution made no distinction between Jerusalem and the West Bank  \u2014   considering the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City and the Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, as occupied territory. Israel wrested the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including the Old City, in the   war of 1967. Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and defense minister, said it was Mr. Netanyahu who had failed to make any distinction between building in East Jerusalem and the settlement blocs close to the 1967 lines, which Israel expects to be able to keep under any peace agreement with the Palestinians. \u201cThe principal enemy of the settlement blocs and the Jerusalem neighborhoods is Netanyahu himself,\u201d Mr. Barak, an increasingly vocal critic of Mr. Netanyahu, said on Israeli television on Saturday night. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the   Zionist Union and head of the parliamentary opposition, said in a Facebook post, \u201cThe man who just a month ago told us that the world worships him, declared war this evening on the world, on the United States, on Europe, and is trying to calm us with conceit. \u201d Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the     Jewish Home party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, goaded Mr. Netanyahu to respond with more drastic measures, like annexing parts of the West Bank to Israel. \u201cThe time has come to transition from withdrawals to sovereignty,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562711.335792}
