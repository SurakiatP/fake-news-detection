The law, enacted in 2013 in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. made it a crime to sell or possess the firearms, which critics call assault weapons. The decision not to hear the case, not long after the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. does not set a Supreme Court precedent. But it is part of a trend in which the justices have given at least tacit approval to broad   laws in states and localities that choose to enact them. The case, Shew v. Malloy, No.  was brought by four individuals, a business and two advocacy groups. They said the ban was irrational, ineffective and unconstitutional. \u201cConnecticut dubs a semiautomatic firearm\u201d with one of several common features \u201can \u2018assault weapon,\u2019 but that is nothing more than an argument advanced by a political slogan in the guise of a definition,\u201d they told the Supreme Court in their petition seeking review. In October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, upheld the ban almost entirely. It acknowledged that the affected weapons were in common use and assumed their possession was protected by the Second Amendment. But the appeals court ruled that the Connecticut law passed constitutional muster. The law was \u201cspecifically targeted to prevent mass shootings like that in Newtown, in which the shooter used a semiautomatic assault weapon,\u201d Judge Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes wrote for the court. \u201cPlaintiffs complain that mass shootings are \u2018particularly rare events\u2019 and thus, even if successful, the legislation will have a \u2018minimal impact\u2019 on most violent crime. \u201cThat may be so,\u201d Judge Cabranes continued. \u201cBut   legislation \u2018need not strike at all evils at the same time\u2019 to be constitutional. \u201d The Supreme Court also turned down on Monday a challenge to a similar New York law in Kampfer v. Cuomo, No.  . It was filed by Douglas E. Kampfer, a New York resident who had litigated the case without a lawyer. The Second Circuit denied his appeal in a brief order in March. It has been eight years since the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to keep guns at home for   in District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down parts of an exceptionally strict local law. Since then, the justices have said almost nothing about the scope of that right. When the court rejected a Second Amendment case in December from a Chicago suburb, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, dissented. They accused the majority of abdicating its responsibility to enforce the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. (Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in the Heller case, which was decided by a    vote.) \u201cRoughly five million Americans own   semiautomatic rifles,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including   and target shooting,\u201d Justice Thomas added. \u201cUnder our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564216.2502308}
