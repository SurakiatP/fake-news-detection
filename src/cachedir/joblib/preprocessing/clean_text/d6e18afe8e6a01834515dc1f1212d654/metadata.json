Trump and the cast and creators of the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton,\u201d setting off furious debate over American principles like free speech, respect and the ability to challenge authority in the Trump era.   Trump demanded an apology from the cast for making a rare, politically charged appeal from the stage on Friday night to Vice   Mike Pence, who was in the audience, urging him and Mr. Trump to \u201cuphold our American values\u201d and \u201cwork on behalf of all of us. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s response significantly escalated an unusual protest inside a theater into a furor on social media and cable news. Mr. Trump, who has stirred bipartisan concern over his habit of attacking those who challenge him, said on Twitter that the actors had \u201charassed\u201d Mr. Pence, and he issued a battle cry to his supporters by saying that the musical\u2019s cast had criticized \u201cour wonderful future VP Mike Pence. \u201d He continued to assail the show on Twitter on Saturday night, writing that the actors had been \u201cvery rude and insulting\u201d to Mr. Pence and claiming that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t even memorize lines\u201d  \u2014   though he offered no evidence and then deleted the message. The clash between the \u201cHamilton\u201d actors and Mr. Trump captured the sharply divergent feelings of many Americans 11 days after the election: a showdown between the values of multiculturalism on the left, including the racially diverse \u201cHamilton\u201d cast and the world of entertainment, and the conservative principles of the incoming Republican administration, which was backed strongly by   white voters and traditional Republicans. Mr. Trump framed the cast\u2019s appeal as a violation of \u201ca safe and special place\u201d  \u2014   borrowing a favored phrase of the left and of campus protesters it was not clear whether he did so derisively or in earnest. His maneuver, in two posts to Twitter early Saturday, stunned the cast members and, judging by social media, jolted many Americans who are worried about the  \u2019s tolerance for dissent after a campaign in which he was criticized for inflaming racial tensions. But it also touched off reaction among other Americans who treasure the traditions of, and respect for, the office of the presidency, and viewed the statement  \u2014   and the booing of Mr. Pence by some theatergoers before the performance  \u2014   as out of line. On Saturday, one supporter of Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the \u201cHamilton\u201d statement was \u201ca staged hit job. \u201d Another wrote that actors should never \u201chumiliate a member of the audience. \u201d Even some artists said it was wrong to deliver a surprise political message to an audience member after curtain call. \u201cYou don\u2019t single out an audience member and embarrass him from the stage,\u201d the musician Steven Van Zandt, a bandmate of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s, wrote on Twitter. \u201cA terrible precedent to set. \u201d Mr. Pence\u2019s \u201cHamilton\u201d seats were bought, not provided by the production as complimentary seats, according to two people with knowledge of the transaction. Matt Borges, the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, who was often critical of Mr. Trump this year, said that though he would always support free expression, he was dismayed that the left was demanding respect from Mr. Pence while lecturing him disrespectfully in the eyes of many on the right. \u201cIt never ceases to amaze me how liberals desire acceptance and diversity for everything except political philosophy,\u201d he said. But many theater artists cheered the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast on Saturday. \u201cThe theater will always be a place that encourages   and free thinking  \u2014   which is exactly what makes the art form so vital and, frankly, exciting,\u201d said Heather Hitchens, president of the American Theater Wing, a nonprofit that supports the arts and helps oversee the Tony Awards. \u201cHamilton,\u201d itself a deeply political show about the United States as a nation of immigrants  \u2014   with black or Hispanic actors playing George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers  \u2014   has been celebrated by President Obama, Hillary Clinton and many other Democrats, as well as Republicans including former Vice President Dick Cheney. The \u201cHamilton\u201d company learned late Friday that Mr. Pence and his family members would be attending that night\u2019s performance. The show\u2019s creator,   Miranda, and others discussed the appropriateness of making a statement from the stage and decided to do it only after the show was over. Remarks were written and refined, and after curtain call, Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Vice President Aaron Burr, took a microphone and pointed toward Mr. Pence. \u201cYou know, we have a guest in the audience this evening  \u2014   Vice   Pence, I see you walking out but I hope you hear just a few more moments,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. As some in the audience booed, Mr. Dixon hushed them, then added, \u201cSir, we hope that you will hear us out. \u201d As Mr. Pence stood by the exit doors, Mr. Dixon said, \u201cWe, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us  \u2014   our planet, our children, our parents  \u2014   or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. All of us. \u201d The \u201cHamilton\u201d episode is the first major collision between the two Americas brought into sharp relief by the Nov. 8 election. The values and politics championed by the cast are in conflict with the remarks and actions of Mr. Trump, who has called for deporting undocumented immigrants, has declined to forcefully denounce expressions of bigotry among his allies and has so far appointed only white men to major cabinet positions. He has also pledged to change libel laws and sue news media organizations whose coverage he does not like, and he has demonized street protesters who have criticized him. Although Mr. Pence listened to the entreaty inside the Richard Rodgers Theater on Friday and then stepped onto the sidewalk smiling, Mr. Trump took time out of preparing his new cabinet on Saturday to rally his supporters. Around 9 a. m. he wrote two Twitter posts saying the \u201cHamilton\u201d actors had harassed Mr. Pence and had been \u201cvery rude last night to a very good man. \u201d \u201cApologize!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. Mr. Dixon, who read the statement after playing the nation\u2019s third vice president, quickly replied with a post of his own: \u201c@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen. \u201d Mr. Trump lashed out at the show, the most acclaimed Broadway production in years, at a time of demonstrations against his coming presidency. Those include frequent street protests outside Trump Tower along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is less than a mile from the theater showing \u201cHamilton. \u201d The   has both castigated the protesters and, after being chided for doing so, praised them for their passion. Advisers, however, say he has been frustrated by the suspicion and hostility that the demonstrators and other Americans continue to hold about his election. Mr. Trump\u2019s escalation of the \u201cHamilton\u201d matter also came a day after his $25 million settlement of a lawsuit against Trump University, leading some critics to claim online that he was trying to create a distraction amid negative attention to his surrender on a legal case he had vowed to fight. Some Republican strategists said they were not surprised that Mr. Trump chose to attack \u201cHamilton,\u201d noting that the   believed deeply in trying to project strength in the face of any kind of opposition. \u201c  Trump is signaling that he will fight for his team and his policies,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a strong Trump supporter. \u201cPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher would have approved,\u201d a reference to the former conservative leader in Britain who often tangled with artists and the left. But other Republicans said Mr. Trump\u2019s posts on Twitter were inappropriate. \u201cFidelity to the First Amendment is an absolute requirement for an American president,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a veteran Republican strategist who advised John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cThe address from the cast was respectful, but even if it wasn\u2019t, they have a right to say it. \u201d The statement from the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast on Friday was, on one level, a breach of theater protocol: Rarely if ever do actors on stage directly address a member of the audience and throw down a gauntlet like Mr. Dixon and his castmates did. The actors, with guidance from the show\u2019s creators and producers, chose to wait until the show had ended and they had taken their bows before breaking the wall between performers and audience. They did so, they said, because it was such a tense and anxious time for the country, and because they thought they would be remiss in not taking an opportunity to address Mr. Pence directly. The   tensions over the election seemed close at hand. Mrs. Clinton, who held a   at a \u201cHamilton\u201d performance this summer, embraced many of the values and views that the cast members described. Mr. Trump, who loves the theater music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and invested in a Broadway play early in his career, is otherwise not in sync with the liberal political outlook of many in the theater world  \u2014   at least since he adopted sharply more conservative positions recently after many years as a socially liberal New Yorker. The first lady, Michelle Obama, described \u201cHamilton\u201d as \u201cthe best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life,\u201d and President Obama held a   at a \u201cHamilton\u201d performance. Mr. Miranda was an outspoken supporter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s during the presidential race, saying in July, \u201cAre you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall, or for someone who\u2019s building bridges?\u201d The plea to Mr. Pence was written by Mr. Miranda the show\u2019s director, Thomas Kail and the lead producer, Jeffrey Seller, with contributions from cast members, according to Mr. Seller. In an interview after the show, Mr. Seller said he learned \u201cvery late that Mr. Pence was coming to the show, and the creative team and cast members quickly reckoned with how to respond. \u201d \u201cWe had to ask ourselves, \u2018How do we cope with this? \u2019\u201d Mr. Seller said. \u201cOur cast could barely go on stage the day after the election. The election was painful and crushing to all of us here. We all struggled with what was the appropriate and respectful and proper response. We are honored that Mr. Pence attended the show and we had to use this opportunity to express our feelings. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561839.21125}
