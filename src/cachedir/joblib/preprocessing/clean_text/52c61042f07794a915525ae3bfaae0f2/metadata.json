[Reuters reports that \u201csix people were killed and eight wounded when [a gunman] opened fire   \u2026     during Sunday night prayers. \u201d  According to The University of Sydney\u2019s GunPolicy. org, \u201conly licensed gun owners may lawfully acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition [in Canada]. \u201d Those seeking a license to own a gun \u201cmust pass a background check which considers criminal, mental health, addiction and domestic violence records. \u201d Additionally, applicants for a gun owner\u2019s license must give \u201cthird party character references\u201d and demonstrate \u201can understanding of firearm safety and the law. \u201d Those who are able to acquire a license \u201cmust   and   for their firearm licence [sic] every five years,\u201d which basically means the background check is ongoing. Also, the ownership of certain categories of firearms is prohibited and \u201crecords   \u2026     of individual civilians licensed to acquire, possess, sell or transfer a firearm or ammunition\u201d are maintained. As law enforcement officials continue to divulge to journalists more information on the Quebec mosque attack, there is no indication gun laws had an effect in keeping the perpetrator from acquiring the weapons needed to conduct the shooting. The attack was similar to those in other European countries with restrictive gun control laws. For example, twelve people were shot and killed on January 7, 2015, when terrorists opened fire on Charlie Hebdo headquarters in   Paris. Just months later, on November 13, 2015, more terrorists in Paris opened fire and killed 130 innocents. These transpired despite France\u2019s ban on entire categories of weapons, and it requires the kind of expanded background checks that the Obama administration, Senators Chris Murphy ( ) and Joe Manchin ( ) and gun controller Gabby Giffords pushed as a way to make Americans safe. More recently, on July 22, 2016, a   attack in Munich, Germany, was successfully executed despite similar background checks, gun bans on entire categories of weapons, and licensing requirements for gun ownership. Nine innocents were killed in the Munich attack. Strict gun control failed to protect innocents in Paris and Munich, and it has now failed to protect them in Quebec.
