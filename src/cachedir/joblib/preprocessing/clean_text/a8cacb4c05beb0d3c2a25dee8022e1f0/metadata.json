North Dakota is responsible for reimbursing out-of-state police agencies for costs that have to do with wages, overtime, officer benefits, meals while on duty, a per diem while off duty, lodging and mileage for the communities that sent vehicles. \\n\\nGovernor Jack Dalrymple will vote on Tuesday, November 8th on whether to borrow $4 million from the state-owned bank. \\n\\nThe panel has already borrowed and spent $6 million from the bank in September. \\n\\nNorth Dakota officials have also requested federal officials to reimburse the state for the additional law enforcement costs. \\n\\nAll of this money going towards the police brings a lot into question. How much taxpayer money will be used to protect the investment of a company over investments on human health? How much money is given to law enforcement, military, and corporations in order to silence the people fighting for justice? \\n\\n '"}, "time": 1742563067.7098303}
