Mr. Sharon may be as perky as you might imagine the   \u201cguru of a cappella\u201d to be, but little can prepare you for his infectious good cheer. \u201cThis is me mellow!\u201d he exclaimed with boundless enthusiasm  \u2014   a mood even more striking considering he was waiting for a C train in the chaotically busy 42nd Street station. Looking fetchingly   in a blazer and jeans, he showed no sign of the stress that comes with opening a rather unconventional Broadway show. As if travel to workshops, camps, master classes, concerts and recording studios, as well as overseeing the touring group Vocalosity, weren\u2019t enough, Mr. Sharon has spent the past few months on the vocal arrangements for \u201cIn Transit. \u201d It\u2019s the first a cappella musical on Broadway, created by a quartet of songwriters including Kristen   a   of songs for the animated film \u201cFrozen. \u201d The short commute from his temporary Manhattan apartment to the Circle in the Square Theater, where \u201cIn Transit\u201d is in previews, constituted field research for Mr. Sharon, as the show\u2019s characters all cross paths on the subway. \u201cI would come down here and listen,\u201d said Mr. Sharon, a tall and lanky Bay Area resident. \u201cBut I also wanted to get a sense of the relationship between people, because a cappella is about the interconnectedness of voices and individuals. \u201d This last point is the crux of what Mr. Sharon, 48, calls his lifelong mission of creating harmony through harmony. To that end he leaves no outlet unturned. His   jobs have included serving as executive producer, coach and arranger on the NBC reality show \u201cThe  \u201d (which spawned the hugely successful vocal group Pentatonix) and writing the arrangements for both \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movies. In the second film, he also sang many of the backup harmonies for the villainous   team Das Sound Machine and had a cameo as a German judge. Mr. Sharon has created a cappella arrangements for about 2, 000 songs and has written several books, including the new \u201cThe Heart of Vocal Harmony. \u201d So when time came to retool \u201cIn Transit\u201d for a bigger stage after an Off Broadway run in 2010, Ms.   and her   immediately thought of him. \u201cWe were really into \u2018The \u2019 and of course we knew Deke was in the House Jacks, which was the first big professional,   a cappella group,\u201d Ms.   who sang in a vocal group at Williams College, said in a phone interview. Mr. Sharon was a   of the House Jacks in 1991, with singers he had met on the college circuit. It was a bold move at a time when a cappella was not popular, aside from freak hits like Bobby McFerrin\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy\u201d and Boyz II Men\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday. \u201d Yet in hindsight, Mr. Sharon had the background and dedication required to take a cappella to the next level. This, after all, is someone who says he could sing before he could talk and whose parents signed him for a church choir at the ripe age of 5. He later participated in musical theater but had an a cappella epiphany in his freshman year at San Francisco University High School, where he led the barbershop quartet in a production of \u201cThe Music Man. \u201d A few years later, Mr. Sharon enrolled at Tufts University just so he could join that school\u2019s Beelzebubs, an a cappella group. The love wasn\u2019t immediately returned: He got in only on his third audition. \u201cThey said I was overzealous,\u201d Mr. Sharon recalled. \u201cMy   was perfect, so when I pointed out a small mistake I\u2019d made, they thought I was pretentious. \u201d (Benji in the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movies is partly based on Mr. Sharon.) College was also when Kurk Richard Toohey Jr. officially became Deke Sharon. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant as a stage name,\u201d he explained. \u201cEverybody called me Deke, and my mom had remarried, so I had all these different names in my childhood. I just wanted an identity of my own. \u201d The same year he helped found the House Jacks, Mr. Sharon also created the Contemporary A Cappella Society as part of his effort to cement the   community and improve its outreach. But it\u2019s    where his temperament  \u2014   earnestly upbeat, but with a   humor and a subtly forceful undertone blocking any threat of saccharine  \u2014   is most effective. \u201cMy knowledge of a cappella was limited, but Deke is very good at meeting people where they are and giving them what they need so they can get where he wants them,\u201d recalled Birgitte   who played the leader of Das Sound Machine in \u201cPitch Perfect 2\u201d and stars in the Broadway revival of \u201cLes Liaisons Dangereuses. \u201d Mr. Sharon\u2019s interpersonal and technical skills were critical for a show like \u201cIn Transit,\u201d which presented several challenges for the cast and crew  \u2014   starting with the fact that the actors double up as the orchestra and almost never stop singing. \u201cSometimes they go offstage, change their costume, walk around the back of the house and come back in from another side, singing all the while,\u201d Mr. Sharon said. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t miss a beat, go out of time or rhythm. The technical difficulty is the highest not only that I\u2019ve ever worked on, but that I\u2019ve ever known to be done a cappella. \u201d To sync with each other, the actors wear   monitors so they can best hear all the vocal layers as well as the musical supervisor, Rick   who voices his cues from backstage. Getting used to the earbuds was a steep learning curve. Margo Seibert, one of the stars, said it was like trying to sing while putting your head under water in a bathtub  \u2014   a \u201c  moment\u201d for her. \u201cThe first week, their faces looked like they\u2019d just eaten a bad lemon,\u201d Ms.   said of the cast, laughing. \u201cBut Deke was so confident and positive that everyone went, \u2018O. K.!\u2019 And that\u2019s a gift to have in the room. \u201d A   \u201chuge a cappella nerd,\u201d Justin Guarini, one of Ms. Seibert\u2019s   was in a vocal group in high school. Still, he appreciated Mr. Sharon\u2019s input. \u201cI\u2019m learning from him, and it\u2019s an awesome feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a teacher so much as an educator. \u201d For the tireless Mr. Sharon, a Broadway show is just one more way to bring about a culture in which everybody sings and where diversity is not just lip service but a structural asset. \u201cMost choral ensembles want a homogeneity of sound,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want a different configuration of sounds and notes and voices. The overall experience of seeing these very diverse people onstage together makes a statement that is so necessary in today\u2019s society. \u201d Ms.   added: \u201cHe truly believes that groups of people singing together creates goodness in the world. And at this moment in time, we really need that kind of harmony. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563350.111765}
