It\u2019s not the first time. The Salton Sea, straddling the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, is the latest incarnation of a body of water that has been drying and refilling over eons with water from the Colorado River. Native Americans once fished and camped on Lake Cahuilla, a prehistoric and larger version. The Salton Sea was born in the early 1900s after a canal burst sent water from the Colorado flooding into the valley over a period of two years. Beginning in the 1950s, entrepreneurs transformed it into a tourist mecca, building marinas and resorts. There were beauty pageants and boat races. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra visited. But in time, runoff pollution, drought and blistering heat conspired to end the fun. As the saline lake evaporated, its salt concentration soared, killing fish en masse. The blooming and decomposition of algae had a powerful stench. Today, the Salton Sea is surrounded by abandoned buildings. For people fighting to revitalize it, there are two big concerns, said Michael Cohen, a researcher with the Pacific Institute, a   think tank. One is dust. The receding water is exposing vast areas of the lake floor that, if unabated, could kick up more than 100 tons of dust every day by 2045, scientists say. (This winter\u2019s bountiful rain largely avoided the Salton Sea). The particles are so fine that they cannot be coughed up, threatening the health of local children whose asthma rates lead the state. The other is the threat to wildlife. The Salton Sea is a precious way station for more than 400 species of migrating birds. Part of the solution, said Mr. Cohen, lies in restoring habitat  \u2014   essentially moving earth around in ways that keeps the dust from flying while providing the birds with places to stop and refuel. A $9. 6 billion revitalization plan endorsed by state officials has been on the back burner for years. Mr. Cohen said he was often asked why we don\u2019t just let nature take its course. \u201cAre we fighting nature? Yes,\u201d he said. But, he said, pristine wilderness really no longer exists  \u2014   all of California is manipulated in some way by humans. \u201cSo from that perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need to make sure those places that are valuable for wildlife are preserved. \u201d Frank Foster, a photography instructor at Victor Valley College in Victorville, has been capturing images of the Salton Sea for years.

[Quartz] On Monday, we wrote about a state proposal that would let bicyclists treat stop signs like yield signs. We asked if you liked the idea. Hundreds of emails poured in, with opinions sharply divided. Here is a sample: \u201cTerrible idea. While there are many conscientious bicyclists, I regularly see bicyclists who are simply reckless. Many times I have seen bicyclists go right through red lights, at great risk to themselves and others. This measure would embolden them to engage in such dangerous behaviors, and raise the risk of crashes and serious injuries. \u201d  \u2014   Paul D. Lerner, Beverly Hills \u201cYes, this would be a welcome change. Safety hardly ever requires a full stop by bikes at a stop sign. Because of that, most bicyclists currently don\u2019t surrender their   momentum by making full stops at stop signs where the traffic does not warrant them. The result is that the existing law requiring full stops at stop signs is rarely observed or enforced, which encourages disrespect of the law and stokes the resentment of motorists already annoyed by the presence of bikes on their streets and roads. \u201d  \u2014   Len Colamarino, Atascadero \u201cI\u2019m a   year San Francisco bike commuter. I am dubious about the rolling stop rule. I often see cyclists roll through stops when pedestrians are in crosswalks. A law change, I fear, will make this worse. \u201d  \u2014   Alyson Jacks, San Francisco \u201cCyclists are well aware of the risks they assume when \u2018sharing the road\u2019 with vehicles. It\u2019s hard to imagine how forcing cyclists to stop at empty intersections makes either group any safer. \u201d  \u2014   Ryan Martin, Roseville California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
