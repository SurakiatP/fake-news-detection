[Speaking to CNBC, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, \u201cWell the recovery is not done yet but we have been working with the Irish authorizes and we can see that they are moving forward to do the recovery of the unpaid taxes. \u201d   Vestager explained some of the issues faced when trying to recoup the taxes, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to do because it\u2019s a large sum so of course you have to figure out how to do that. It\u2019s not as an escrow account in some of the other cases where it might be 25 or 30 million euros   \u2026     and therefore I do respect that it\u2019s a complicated matter and it may take a little more time. \u201d The EU Competition Commission ruled last year that Apple must pay $13. 9 billion owed to Ireland as it was found that the tech giant was paying as little as 0. 005 percent tax in Ireland in 2014. Apple had until January 3rd to pay the tax bill into an escrow account, a deadline which has since been missed.  A spokesperson from Ireland\u2019s Ministry of Finance told CNBC, \u201cWe are continuing to make progress of the recovery from Apple with the full cooperation of the company and the EU Commission. The Commission are satisfied with the progress we are making. We have committed to complying with the decision and we fully intend doing that. \u201d Both Apple and Ireland are planning on fighting the EU decision in court. When asked for comment by CNBC, Ireland\u2019s Finance Minister Michael Noonan said, \u201cThe appeal is in now and it\u2019ll go to a European ordinary court first and then whoever loses will probably appeal it to the European Court of Justice. So you\u2019re looking at a   time frame,   time frame. (A) slow bicycle race between the Apple case and Brexit seems to be emerging now. Let\u2019s see which will reach the destination first. \u201d Noonan previously stated his disapproval of the EU\u2019s ruling, telling CNBC in August, \u201cWe stand by the legitimacy of what was done in the past   \u2026     we think the Commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. \u201d  \u201cThis is an approach through the back door to try and influence tax policy through competition law,\u201d he said.  Speaking to the Irish Independent last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the ruling was \u201ctotal political crap\u201d which has \u201cno basis in law or in fact. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
