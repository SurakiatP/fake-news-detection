Just say a few nice words about the bride and groom, then ask the assembled crowd to raise their glasses. But such toasts often come up short  \u2014   or worse, become the low point of the wedding weekend. Should you be asked to give a toast, there is no need for it to live in infamy. Here are a few guidelines with some memorable toasts from television and movies as examples of what to avoid. 1. Keep the alcohol at bay. Even Dean Martin sipped apple juice when performing. If there is one common denominator for the world\u2019s worst wedding toasts, it could probably be measured in blood alcohol content. Giving a good toast is tricky enough without trying it with half of your wits about you, so wait until afterward to enjoy your favorite beverage. 2. Don\u2019t wing it. Think about what you are going to say long in advance. Then write it down. \u201cYou should start writing a wedding toast months before,\u201d said Peggy Klaus, a speech and presentations coach in Berkeley, Calif. And practice your toast in front of a mirror several times to nail the delivery. \u201cIf you don\u2019t prepare, your nerves will take over, and it just won\u2019t work,\u201d Ms. Klaus said. Everyone needs an editor, and if you don\u2019t have one handy, ask a friend or a spouse to play one for a few minutes and show them what you plan to say. 3. Keep it short and simple. No more than three minutes. (Lincoln finished the Gettysburg Address in less time, and that seemed to turn out O. K.) \u201cYou basically want to tell one nice story about the couple and wish them well, and that\u2019s all anyone wants to hear,\u201d said Sarah Parker, who wrote a   book on wedding toasts. \u201cBut you should find time to identify yourself and your relationship with the newlyweds, and perhaps remark upon the beauty of the ceremony. \u201c Keeping it short will allow you to spend time polishing those few sentences that you will have to deliver. 4. Don\u2019t rush it. Speak slowly and loudly enough for everyone to hear. Nonprofessional speakers tend to rush through a speech, or talk so softly that many people strain to hear what they are saying  \u2014   if they can hear it at all. Some speakers post a friend at the back of the room to signal whether the speech is being heard there. 5. Tell one story about the bride and groom. An embarrassing anecdote may be funny  \u2014   but this may not be the time to share it. Try to say something the couple would enjoy hearing. It\u2019s their day, not yours. Some toastmasters seem to gravitate toward roasting the couple, rather than praising them. But sarcasm is overrated, and often focuses on shortcomings rather than strengths. Concentrate on what is particularly nice about the bride and groom, and try to celebrate that. 6. If you want to get fancy by staging a skit, singing a song or performing some elaborate dance, be careful. Most of us dance more like \u201cSeinfeld\u2019s\u201d Elaine than the Jackson Five\u2019s Michael. And remember who are the real stars of the show. Ms. Klaus cautions anyone going in this direction, since she thinks it can be a little  : \u201cRemember, the toast is not about you, it\u2019s about the couple. \u201d And there is a risk of trying to do too much: There was a reason they kept a hook just off the stage during the old vaudeville shows. 7. Have fun. Think of giving a toast as a great opportunity, not a burden. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift to the bride and groom,\u201d said Ms. Parker, the author of a book on how to toast at weddings. And if you do it just right, you may start a few tears running down their cheeks.'"}, "time": 1742562742.5677152}
