[She wants to go to the White House and perform her rendition of Queen\u2019s 1977 classic, \u201cWe Are The Champions,\u201d for President Donald Trump.  \u201cThat is my goal,\u201d she said of singing that song for Trump. \u201cThat is what I would love to do. I would like to show an outpouring of support and perform for the president. And that would be just the cherry on top of everything. \u201c Villa continued: \u201cAnd also to create a wave of support for our president for Americans for patriotism and just for tolerance and love. And just changed the narrative. In the award shows. In the Grammys. In the red carpet. Anything that pops up. So it is a more fair portrayal of actually what Americans are feeling and thinking. Because we don\u2019t all think like how they are telling us to think. And that is my whole platform. \u201d Villa was speaking in an interview to air on this reporter\u2019s Sunday night talk radio program, \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d broadcast on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM. Upon arriving at the Grammys, Villa took off a white robe to reveal a red, white and blue dress emblazoned with the sparkling words \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and had \u201cTrump\u201d on the hem. Villa\u2019s   Grammys appearance skyrocketed her album to #1 on Amazon\u2019s digital chart. In an initial interview last week, Villa confirmed to this reporter that she is a Trump supporter and that she voted for the president. Asked why she decided to essentially troll the Grammys, Villa explained that she was \u201ctired\u201d of Hollywood\u2019s treatment of Trump supporters. \u201cI was tired of the bullying,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI was tired of being pushed down so that I couldn\u2019t say my beliefs. And being fearful of losing sales. Losing fans. Losing bookings. Losing contracts and sponsorship. You know, that\u2019s my day to day. And a lot of my friends have the same thing. And we live in Hollywood, which is supposed to be the most open viewpoint city. But the truth is there was a lot of hate and a lot of negativity and I wanted to change the storyline to love and support and unity as an American. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
