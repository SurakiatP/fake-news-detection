Not because Edward Enninful, the renowned   friend of Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, isn\u2019t supremely talented, but because he is a black man, born in Ghana, raised in London and working in New York. To give Mr. Enninful the reins of one of the most storied woman\u2019s fashion magazines would be to make a statement about diversity and gender that would resonate far beyond hemlines, upending decades of tradition and assumptions about men\u2019s and women\u2019s roles and reaffirming the importance of a global viewpoint for the fashion industry at a time when barriers are going up around the world. But on Monday, Jonathan Newhouse, the chief executive of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, did just that, naming Mr. Enninful the first male editor of British Vogue since its founding in 1916, and the first black editor of any edition of Vogue. Though Mr. Newhouse, contacted by email, was reluctant to engage in discussion of   other magazine insiders  \u2014   and many on social media  \u2014   were not. Twitter lit up with the news, and \u201cBritish Vogue\u201d became a trending topic. Anna Wintour, artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast and editor of American Vogue, where Mr. Enninful is a former contributor, said: \u201cIt is a brilliant choice, and I am thrilled for him. Edward will undoubtedly shake things up in a way that will be so exciting to watch. \u201d Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W (and one of the few men atop a women\u2019s fashion magazine) who hired Mr. Enninful as creative and fashion director in 2011, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a really historic moment. \u201d Of the 22 global editions of Vogue, three others are edited by men: Kullawit Laosuksri at Vogue Thailand, Kwang Ho Shin at Korean Vogue and Emanuele Farneti at Italian Vogue. The two editors of Italian and British Vogue, which along with American Vogue are arguably the most influential of the Vogues, were appointed this year. Mr. Enninful and Mr. Farneti were picked to replace two of the     female editors of any Vogue: Franca Sozzani at Italian Vogue and Alexandra Shulman at British Vogue. In email, Mr. Newhouse offered only the   \u201cwe try to appoint the best person for the job. \u201d Yet given that up to now conventional wisdom had it that the best person to run a women\u2019s fashion magazine of the stature of British Vogue was, well, a woman  \u2014   someone who could wear the clothes, model the clothes and understand what her readers want from their clothes, both in terms of everyday functionality and personal identity  \u2014   it is not an insignificant line. As gender boundaries blur and the old distinctions between men\u2019s wear and woman\u2019s wear (not to mention men\u2019s and women\u2019s pronouns) disappear, perhaps, too, should the old assumptions about men\u2019s and women\u2019s magazines. Increasingly, fashion brands, including Burberry, Calvin Klein and Gucci, are beginning to combine their men\u2019s and women\u2019s shows in recognition of this new reality. Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, has explained it this way: Both collections are part of the same story and reflect the same point of view, so why should they be separate? Louis Vuitton used Jaden Smith to model its women\u2019s collection last year, and Chanel has signed Pharrell Williams for its new handbag campaign. Men and women increasingly occupy the same space in real life fashion is simply representing that truth. And now, too, are fashion publications. \u201cFashion is always among the first industries to recognize a new reality,\u201d Mr. Tonchi said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an old notion that there are magazines for women and magazines for men, and it is time to just have magazines for people interested in fashion and creativity, whatever their gender. \u201cIt is true: I don\u2019t look at women\u2019s collections and think, \u2018Oh, I want to wear that,\u2019 or \u2018Will it fit me?\u2019 But I do think about the concept behind the clothes and the culture of the clothes. \u201d As ceiling smashing as Mr. Enninful\u2019s gender is, however, so is his race. Fashion is a notoriously undiverse industry for one that is supposed to cater to a diverse clientele, and though the industry goes through regular paroxysms of mea culpas, most often in terms of the absence of minority models on the runways, the power structure itself rarely seems to change. Nearly all of the design heads of major brands are white, as are the chief executives, so the fact that a black man will be in such a visible position is an important step  \u2014   especially as Britain prepares to withdraw from the European Union and prejudice and cultural isolationism become more prevalent. Mr. Enninful\u2019s background and experience of the world are bound to inform the sensibility of the magazine he will make. As Ms. Wintour said: \u201cHe\u2019s fearless. At a time when values are being challenged, Edward always stands up for what he believes in. You can see that clearly in the recent \u2018I Am an Immigrant\u2019 and \u2018I Am a Woman\u2019 videos he made for W. Each was so perfectly timed and hit the mark. \u201d Mr. Enninful himself is aware of what his new role means, on many levels. \u201cI believe we live in a world of possibility, and my appointment is a testament to this,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe world is   as are traditional roles of male and female. The outpouring of support from people of all backgrounds has been humbling. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561892.4012694}
