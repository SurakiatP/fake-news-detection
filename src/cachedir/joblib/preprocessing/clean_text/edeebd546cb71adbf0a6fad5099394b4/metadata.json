But at one store, a clerk told him a   Moncler and other coats were \u201csample sizes\u201d and not for sale. A second clerk, selling a wolf   Yves Salomon, said the coat was reserved. Mr. Ji sighed. In both cases, the fur wouldn\u2019t match their labels, he suspected  \u2014   and the clerks knew selling a fake to Mr. Ji, who is well known on sight in many of China\u2019s shops, meant big trouble. \u201cMa\u2019am, I don\u2019t want to make things difficult for you,\u201d he told a sales clerk, who nodded and bowed. \u201cI\u2019ve found problems with your clothes, so please correct them. \u201d Mr. Ji is what is known in China as a professional counterfeit hunter. Part Ralph Nader, part bounty hunter, Mr. Ji rummages for fake or substandard goods in shops. Then, using China\u2019s consumer protection laws, he collects tens of thousands of dollars from the companies that make or sell them. The laws are part of China\u2019s growing effort to weed out the fake clothes, electronics, food and furniture that swamp its stores and frustrate companies and consumers alike. But Mr. Ji\u2019s livelihood is now under threat. Some government officials say Mr. Ji and the unknown number of others like him abuse a law that was meant merely to empower consumers to report fakes. If proposed new government rules get accepted, people like Mr. Ji will no longer be able to go pro. Even as China grows and matures, and moves to protect brands and ideas, it still struggles with how to get rid of fakes. Overseas governments, overseas companies and even its own increasingly choosy consumers complain that China\u2019s counterfeit products hurt brand names and common people alike. Chinese leaders have stepped up efforts to cull them, in part to protect homegrown companies that are starting to produce their own innovative products. Last year, China\u2019s courts handled about 120, 000 intellectual property cases, up 9 percent from 2014, according to official media. One   effort was intended to empower the consumer. In 2009, the government promised consumers that if they found a product that flouted food safety laws, they could win 10 times the value of that product in compensation. In 2013, China bolstered an earlier consumer protection law by increasing payouts to buyers of other kinds of fake goods, while a decision from China\u2019s supreme court was widely seen as supporting counterfeit hunters. Mr. Ji and his peers have used these laws to their advantage, buying knockoffs in bulk  \u2014   the more they turn in, the more they are paid  \u2014   and filling their storerooms withcounterfeit products. Mr. Ji\u2019s group, the Jinan Old Ji   Rights Defense Work Studio, has a network of about 20 informers who report suspected fake products. He says his biggest success to date is collecting about $178, 000 in compensation from a company that tried to pass off its blankets as pure cashmere. China\u2019s   boom has given counterfeit hunters a new front. \u201cThe main purpose of suing them is to ask them to correct themselves,\u201d said Yu Fengxing, another counterfeit hunter, who chases merchants who sell fakes on online marketplaces run by the Alibaba Group, China\u2019s largest   company. He became an   counterfeit hunter after he bought an item marketed by a merchant on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform as a foot treatment and discovered that it was probably just makeup. In a statement, Alibaba said it was committed to fighting fakes on its platforms. Among overseas companies, people like Mr. Ji have fans. \u201cA lot of my clients would, in some circumstances, support the activities of these kinds of consumer warriors because ultimately they may be uncovering information that helps us do our job,\u201d said Scott Palmer, an intellectual property lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter  Hampton, which represents American corporations in China. But government officials complain that the program is increasingly expensive and increasingly abused. Even some foreign business groups complain. Counterfeit hunters often profit \u201cfrom complaints that target minor product labeling errors instead of true quality or safety issues,\u201d said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, in emailed comments. Proposed government rules released in August and under official consideration said that payouts for fakes would not be available to those who sought them \u201cfor commercial purposes. \u201d Mr. Ji, defending his work, says he has to recoup his legal fees, which he incurs when the companies he accuses of selling fakes fight back. He says he makes about $148, 000 a year but his   pay is only about $30, 000 to $44, 000 after expenses. \u201cWhen they encounter a fake product, more than 80 percent of Chinese people will just suck it up and not take it very seriously, as long as their lives are not in danger,\u201d Mr. Ji said. \u201cIf there are more professional counterfeit warriors, the quality of goods will improve at once. \u201d Mr. Ji never set out to be a consumer rights activist. Born in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, he was so poor he could not afford to enroll in a university. His jobs have included running a carwash, selling clothes on the street and operating a   food stall. In 2000, a friend of his bought a children\u2019s educational compact disc that turned out to contain pornographic content. Furious, he and his friends \u201claid siege\u201d to the store where they had bought it, demanding compensation, Mr. Ji said. \u201cAt that time, I did not understand what defending your rights is,\u201d he said. Later, Mr. Ji bought a copy of China\u2019s consumer law and a manual on how to tell fakes from genuine products. From that point, he had a new career. On a recent week in October, Mr. Ji traveled to four courthouses in five days across China, filing lawsuits against shopping malls, accusing them of fraud for selling substandard goods. Based in the eastern city of Jinan, he says he goes to court about 100 times a year. Mr. Ji\u2019s work has earned him the enmity of counterfeiters and their thugs, who he says have beaten him up, bound his hands and feet, and telephoned him with death threats. In 2007, police in the southern province of Fujian detained him for 37 days, charging him with extortion, but released him. Still, Mr. Ji views the work as necessary. Every month, he says, he receives more than a hundred phone calls from people curious about how to get compensation from a fake product. On a recent afternoon, a man from the eastern city of Tai\u2019an called Mr. Ji, who was en route to check out a shopping mall in Beijing. How, the caller asked, could he emulate Mr. Ji? Mr. Ji told the aspiring   that he could not \u201cjust casually enter any shop and buy eight or 10 pieces and demand compensation. \u201d His profession was built on navigating tricky relationships with local courthouses and police, Mr. Ji said, adding that recently some thugs from Tai\u2019an wanted \u201cmy life, my arms and my legs. \u201d \u201cNot everyone can be a counterfeit hunter. This industry isn\u2019t a gift that falls down from heaven,\u201d Mr. Ji told the caller. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the hardships and suffering we\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve only seen our glorious side. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562010.427667}
