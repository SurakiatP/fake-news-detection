He also copyrighted and trademarked the      sculpture that stands near Wall Street. Since March 7, \u201cCharging Bull\u201d has faced off against \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d a statue of a girl posed with her fists on her hips that was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, a financial firm based in Boston. Mr. Di Modica said that \u201cFearless Girl\u201d was an insult to his work, which he created after the stock market crashes in the late 1980s. \u201cShe\u2019s there attacking the bull,\u201d he said. Even as Mr. Di Modica was denouncing \u201cFearless Girl\u201d at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan, State Street Global\u2019s home page highlighted the statue for its message about \u201cthe power of women in leadership\u201d and urged \u201cgreater gender diversity on corporate boards. \u201d Mr. Di Modica and his lawyers did not disagree with that idea at a news conference  \u2014   \u201cNone of us here are in any way not proponents of gender equality,\u201d said one of Mr. Di Modica\u2019s lawyers, Norman Siegel, a former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. They demanded that \u201cFearless Girl\u201d be moved somewhere else. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who spoke out in support of \u201cFearless Girl\u201d last month, reiterated its importance on Twitter on Wednesday: \u201cMen who don\u2019t like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl. \u201d \u201cFearless Girl\u201d was seen by many as a unifying symbol during International Women\u2019s Day last month. Chelsea Clinton and the actress Jessica Chastain posted on Twitter expressing support for the statue. But on Wednesday, Mr. Siegel said, \u201cPrinciple trumps popularity, and there are principles here. \u201d For his part, Mr. Di Modica became emotional, explaining later that when he had heard about \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d his reaction was to go to the site in Lower Manhattan and try to do something to end the   between the two statues. \u201cI said, \u2018Now I\u2019m going to turn around the bull myself,\u2019\u201d he recalled. The lawyers said that \u201cFearless Girl\u201d had subverted the bull\u2019s meaning, which Mr. Di Modica defined as \u201cfreedom in the world, peace, strength, power and love. \u201d Because of \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d Mr. Siegel said, \u201c\u2018Charging Bull\u2019 no longer carries a positive, optimistic message,\u201d adding that Mr. Di Modica\u2019s work \u201chas been transformed into a negative force and a threat. \u201d The lawyers accused State Street Global of commissioning \u201cFearless Girl\u201d as a   work that was conceived with \u201cCharging Bull\u201d in mind. They said that that had improperly commercialized Mr. Di Modica\u2019s statue in violation of its copyright. They asserted that the city had violated his legal rights by issuing permits allowing the    \u201cFearless Girl\u201d to stand across from the   bronze bull without Mr. Di Modica\u2019s permission. Mr. Siegel and other lawyers for Mr. Di Modica released letters they had sent to the mayor Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley, the president and chief executive of State Street Global and Harris Diamond, the chairman and chief executive of McCann Worldgroup, State Street Global\u2019s marketing agency. Among other things, the letters demanded the removal of \u201cFearless Girl. \u201d Anne McNally, a spokeswoman for State Street Global, said the firm was reviewing the letter. She added, \u201cWe continue to be grateful to the City of New York and people around the world who have responded so enthusiastically to what the \u2018Fearless Girl\u2019 represents  \u2014   the power and potential of having more women in leadership. \u201d Mr. Siegel said he had filed Freedom of Information requests for city records about the permits for \u201cFearless Girl. \u201d It was initially issued a   permit, but after it became a social media sensation, Mr. de Blasio announced that the permit was being extended. The mayor said that the sculpture could remain until next year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day. In March, the mayor called the statue a symbol of \u201cstanding up to fear, standing up to power, being able to find in yourself the strength to do what\u2019s right. \u201d He also said the timing of the placement of \u201cFearless Girl\u201d mattered, coming early in Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency and not long after the women\u2019s rights marches that followed his inauguration. \u201cShe is inspiring everyone at a moment when we need inspiration,\u201d the mayor said. Mr. Siegel said he hoped that the dispute over the two statues could be resolved amicably. But he added, \u201cWe never dismiss the possibility of litigation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562257.7747438}
