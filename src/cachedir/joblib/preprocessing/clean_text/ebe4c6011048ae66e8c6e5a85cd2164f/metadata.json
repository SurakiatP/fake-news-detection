He is either disinclined or unable to lay out his agenda in that way. So perhaps it was inevitable that Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who does have a gift for thinking systematically, would be so often invoked by Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents. They need him not just as a hate object but as a heuristic, too. There may never be a \u201cTrumpism,\u201d and unless one emerges, the closest we may come to understanding this administration is as an expression of \u201cBannonism. \u201d Mr. Bannon, 63, has won a reputation for abrasive brilliance at almost every stop in his unorthodox career  \u2014   as a naval officer, Goldman Sachs mergers specialist,   financier, documentary screenwriter and director, Breitbart News   impresario and chief executive of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. One Harvard Business School classmate described him to The Boston Globe as \u201ctop three in intellectual horsepower in our class  \u2014   perhaps the smartest. \u201d Benjamin Harnwell of the Institute for Human Dignity, a Catholic organization in Rome, calls him a \u201cwalking bibliography. \u201d Perhaps because Mr. Bannon came late to conservatism, turning his   energy to political matters only after the Sept. 11 attacks, he radiates an excitement about it that most of his conservative contemporaries long ago lost.   \u2026     Many accounts of Mr. Bannon paint him as a cartoon villain or internet troll come to life, as a bigot, an   a misogynist, a  . The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, have even called him a \u201cwhite nationalist. \u201d While he is certainly a   conservative of some kind, the evidence that he is an extremist of a more troubling sort has generally been either massaged, misread or hyped up. There may be good reasons to worry about Mr. Bannon, but they are not the ones everyone is giving. It does not make Mr. Bannon a fascist that he happens to know who the   Italian extremist Julius Evola is. It does not make Mr. Bannon a racist that he described Breitbart as \u201cthe platform for the  \u201d  \u2014   a broad and imprecise term that applies to a wide array of radicals, not just certain white supremacist groups.   \u2026     When Mr. Bannon spoke on Thursday of \u201cdeconstructing the administrative state,\u201d it may have sounded like gobbledygook outside the hall, but it was an electrifying profession of faith for the attendees. It is through Mr. Bannon that Trumpism can be converted from a set of nostalgic laments and complaints into a program for overhauling the government.
