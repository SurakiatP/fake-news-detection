Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, had previously said some of the \u201cpersonal\u201d emails she deleted from her secret, homebrew server \u2013 the subject of another FBI probe \u2013 were related to Chelsea\u2019s wedding. \\nBand\u2019s email, which was revealed after Podesta\u2019s Gmail account was hacked and subsequently uploaded to WikiLeaks, came at a time of turmoil and upheaval within The Clinton Foundation. Aside from the internal audit, previous emails show a prolonged effort to untangle Teneo from the Foundation. When Band launched the company in summer 2011, he was still employed by the Foundation and Bill Clinton was listed as a Teneo adviser. \\nBut after much haggling, Clinton\u2019s and Band\u2019s roles were clearly delineated: Band continued on as a personal aide to Clinton and Clinton became a Teneo client. During the back-and-forth that produced the final document spelling out each of the men\u2019s roles, Band on Nov. 12, 2011 wrote an 11-page memo outlining how Teneo was created and how it had helped to enrich Clinton and the Foundation . In that draft of the memo, Band wrote he had \u201csought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation.\u201d \\n\u201cI am sure I have done so imperfectly,\u201d he added. Marc Lasry and Bill Clinton \\nIn another section of the memo, which was later deleted, Band wrote about billionaire hedge fund manager Marc Lasry as a \u201cgood example of the complex relationships a friend/supporter can have within the foundation.\u201d Chelsea Clinton worked for Lasry, Lasry held Foundation fundraisers and Band was a paid adviser for Lasry\u2019s firm, Avenue Capital, an investment company whose holding American Media Inc. publishes The National Enquirer. \\nBut fundraisers and jobs weren\u2019t Lasry\u2019s lone contribution to Team Clinton. \\n\u201cHe has been helpful on a number of fronts, including \u2026 responding favorably to our requests to use his plane for Foundation and the Clintons\u2019 personal purposes, killing potential unfavorable stories in the Enquirer [of which he owns a controlling share of the debt]\u2026\u201d Band wrote. \\nLess than a month after Band\u2019s Teneo memo went out, lawyers from Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP, the firm contracted to run the internal Foundation audit, emailed a draft of a governance memorandum and recommendations to Podesta, who was serving as a special adviser to the Foundation, and Bruce Lindsey, then the Foundation\u2019s CEO. \\nThe audit draft noted substantial issues, including a Conflict-of-Interest Policy that had not been implemented, conflicts that were not disclosed in a timely fashion and board members not following the policy when they became aware of conflicts. \\n\u201cIn addition, some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts,\u201d according to the Dec. 5, 2011, draft. Another section of the document noted that \u201cinterviewees also mentioned instances in which gifts and payments received by staff had not been properly disclosed.\u201d \\nThere were other problems, including 1,298 \u201ccomplimentary\u201d $20,000 memberships for the Clinton Global Initiative as opposed to just 500 paid memberships. Of the \u201ccomplimentary\u201d group, \u201c276 were coded \u2018discretionary,\u2019\u201d the audit noted. \u201cInterviewees informed us that there is no transparency into how the comp list is developed,\u201d the document stated. \\nThe lawyers conducting the audit also noticed problems in the Foundation\u2019s IRS Form 990, the tax return document of an organization that is exempt from income tax. While charitable groups are allowed to pay board members and staff a reasonable salary, none of the reasonable compensation calculations identified by the lawyers were ever done, the 990 form showed. The lawyers also wrote the 990 indicated the Foundation had a written conflict-of-interest policy that was enforced. \\n\u201cHowever, we did not find evidence of that enforcement,\u201d the memo stated. \\nOther problems included a \u201cvery small\u201d Foundation Board \u201ccomprised solely of \u2018insiders\u2019\u201d; unsigned Board minutes that \u201cappear to have been cloned from one year to the next; \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in the \u201csegregation of accounting duties, review of journal entries, audit adjustments and financial statement preparation, and lack of Board meetings.\u201d \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562190.9517975}
