In the 1960s and \u201970s Reader\u2019s Digest printed a series of   essays with titles like \u201cI Am Joe\u2019s Lung. \u201d These were popular, and weird. In \u201cI Am Joe\u2019s Heart,\u201d this vital organ emoted like a stereotypically aggrieved Jewish mother. \u201cWhen Joe thinks of me at all, he thinks of me as fragile and delicate. Delicate! When so far in his life I have pumped more than 300, 000 tons of blood?\u201d Some of our organs, this time of year, are beyond speech. Recall the headline in The Onion, the satirical magazine, about a   country singer: \u201cLiver Flees George Jones\u2019 Body. \u201d James Hamblin\u2019s first book is titled \u201cIf Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body. \u201d He\u2019s a graduate of Indiana University\u2019s medical school and a senior editor at The Atlantic. His book began its life as an online video series, also called \u201cIf Our Bodies Could Talk. \u201d His   segments are like \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d if \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show\u201d were produced by   quirky interns from public radio\u2019s \u201cThis American Life. \u201d Sadly there are no talking spleens or thyroids or wombs in Mr. Hamblin\u2019s book. Sadly too there is little identifiable soul in it. Its cardinal humors are wan. \u201cIf Our Bodies Could Talk\u201d is a numbingly upbeat grab bag of anecdotes and factoids and curiosities with no  . As your literary M. D. I cannot recommend it, except in the tiniest doses. To sit by its bedside for very long is to watch a patient expire. The strangling thing about \u201cIf Our Bodies Could Talk\u201d is that someone has told Mr. Hamblin that he\u2019s funny  \u2014   there\u2019s an attempt at a joke in almost every other paragraph  \u2014   but he isn\u2019t actually so, at least not on the page. You recognize his jokes as \u201chumor,\u201d but they don\u2019t make you smile. A typical formulation: \u201cAdrenaline is the hormone that\u2019s meant to be released when we are under stress and need energy, say, to outrun a bear or lift a fallen boulder off our climbing partner. (He\u2019s probably not alive anymore, but it\u2019s worth checking. )\u201d Not abysmal, you might think. But over the course of a long book these pokes in the ribs are monstrously wearing. They\u2019re like having a pebble in your ski boot partway down a long slope, or a lash you can\u2019t remove from your eye. Mr. Hamblin is at his best in \u201cIf Our Bodies Could Talk\u201d on those rare occasions when he drops his dementedly amiable tone. Once in a while he goes on the attack against greed and waste and stupidity in health matters, and things pick up. \u201cWhat is gluten?\u201d \u201cWhat makes hair curl?\u201d \u201cDo I need eight glasses of water a day?\u201d \u201cWhy do males have nipples?\u201d This is the sort of trampled ground that Mr. Hamblin\u2019s book mostly covers. He maintains an interest in offbeat diseases, such as one that makes some people scratch constantly and one that causes the human skin to easily rub off. He dispenses offbeat facts as if they were canap\u00e9s on a tray. \u201cThe average person has about six pounds of skin. \u201d \u201cPeople with tattoos are six times more likely to have hepatitis C. \u201d \u201cWe produce 1. 5 liters of saliva a day. \u201d Then he turns to address the charlatans in the supplements industry, and his blood finally begins to simmer. Suddenly your eyeballs don\u2019t have to be forced to remain on the page. He takes aim at a   1994 law called DSHEA (the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act) that prevents almost any regulation or safety testing of supplements. Supplements, he writes, is \u201ca meaningless word that refers to nothing so much as a parallel pharmaceutical industry  \u2014   one that has accomplished the spectacular feat of selling billions of dollars\u2019 worth of most anything it likes, in almost any way it chooses, promising people anything conceivable about their bodies. \u201d You read this patriotic and   riff and realize that, in the bizarro world we occupy, it can\u2019t be long before Lance Armstrong and Barry Bonds are named   of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Hamblin is just as good on drinks marketed under names like Smartwater and Vitaminwater and Fruitwater and Electrolyte Water. He quotes a doctor who tells him about Electrolyte Water, which is sold at Whole Foods, \u201cThe city water in Philadelphia has more electrolytes. \u201d (The city water in Philadelphia is notoriously mediocre. In her 1974 novel, \u201cOreo,\u201d the novelist Fran Ross reminded us that it has long been called, after one of the city\u2019s rivers, Schuylkill Punch.) It\u2019s typical of Mr. Hamblin to step on his riff on dubious water products with a joke that\u2019s D. O. A.: \u201cDon\u2019t drink the Oil Water. It\u2019s for cars. \u201d We have a   relationship with medical knowledge. It\u2019s so interesting and so terrible. Lucia Berlin, in her brilliant collection of stories, \u201cA Manual for Cleaning Women\u201d (2015) wrote about a nurse who considered the nature of clear colostomy bags and thought: \u201cWhat if our bodies were transparent, like a washing machine window? How wondrous to watch ourselves. Joggers would jog even harder, blood pumping away. Lovers would love more. God damn! Look at that semen go! Diets would improve. \u201d Like Little Milton, I\u2019d guess, I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have that either.'"}, "time": 1742562127.628352}
