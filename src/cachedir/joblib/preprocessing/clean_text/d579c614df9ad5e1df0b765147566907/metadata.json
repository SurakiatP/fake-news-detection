Hillary Clinton, encouraged by   Republican defections from Donald Trump, is reaching out for more. Her campaign introduced Together for America, a coalition of prominent Republicans and independents building support for her. But a release of her State Department emails renewed questions about overlaps with the Clinton Foundation. Above, an animal rights supporter was tackled by Secret Service agents at a rally in Iowa. _____ 2. A subdued Mr. Trump campaigned in Virginia and Florida, as he and his supporters tried to beat back criticism of his comment that \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d might act against Mrs. Clinton if she wins. They portrayed his remark as a call to vote, dismissing the idea that he was suggesting violence. (Watch the video.) Mr. Trump is barely ahead or trailing in some reliably red states  \u2014   possibly because he is doing poorly among   white Republican voters, and there are not enough white   Democratic voters for him to flip. His campaign is particularly worried about his falling popularity among Republican women. _____ 3. We\u2019re following the story of the man who made it part way up the exterior of Trump Tower in New York City. He used suction cups to aid his climb, which lasted about three hours. It ended when New York City police officers grabbed him and pulled him inside the building. _____ 4. The Justice Department\u2019s searing report on Baltimore\u2019s policing and its targeting of black residents stunned even activists. In a city that is 63 percent black, 91 percent of those arrested for discretionary offenses like \u201cfailure to obey\u201d or \u201ctrespassing\u201d were black. And 82 percent of traffic stops involved blacks. \u201cHearing the actual numbers,\u201d one black resident said, is \u201cblowing my mind. \u201d Above, a mural of Freddie Gray, whose death prompted the report. _____ 5. At the Olympics in Rio, an American woman became the first person to win the same Olympic cycling event three times in a row. Kristin Armstrong, 42, triumphed in the individual road time trial. And  Katie Ledecky led the U. S. team to gold in the women\u2019s 4x200 freestyle relay. Can you tell the difference between the physique of a swimmer and a golfer? Take our body quiz. And while you\u2019re marveling at Olympic greats, revisit the glory of the past with our obituary of the extraordinary achievements of Babe Didrikson Zaharias. _____ 6. The Obama administration is expected to end a monopoly on marijuana research by the University of Mississippi, which could encourage a new burst of science on the uses of the plant. Half of the states have approved medical use of marijuana for a burgeoning list of conditions, but research on its effectiveness is sparse. _____ 7. Our technology columnist challenged himself to figure out Amazon\u2019s closely held plans for the future. He took the little the company itself would say, interviewed analysts, partners and competitors, and triangulated. His conclusion: Amazon has a   strategy. First, it\u2019s spending heavily to increase delivery capacity and efficiency. Second, in one word: robotics  \u2014   in warehouses,   trucks, and drone deliveries that could reshape retail. _____ 8. Our movie reviewer has an interesting argument about all the summer franchise blockbusters. He says there\u2019s really just one theme playing out: the modern office. They might as well, he writes, be workshops on \u201c  and how to deal with office romances (\u2018Star Trek Beyond\u2019) on office rivalries and   drafting (\u2018Captain America: Civil War\u2019) on   (\u2018Ghostbusters\u2019) and I. T. disasters (\u2018Jason Bourne\u2019). \u201d Above, a scene from \u201cBourne. \u201d _____ 9. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was back in the headlines over the 2013 Bridgegate scandal. Newly filed court papers said one of the governor\u2019s aides texted another that Mr. Christie had \u201cflat out lied\u201d when he denied that any senior member of his staff knew about a plan to snarl traffic heading to the George Washington Bridge. Prosecutors say the backups were meant to punish a local mayor for declining to endorse Mr. Christie\u2019s   bid. _____ 10. Much of the dysfunction plaguing Iraq was encapsulated in a few horrifying hours after a fire broke out in the maternity ward of a hospital in Baghdad. Hospital workers raced to the nursery, but no one could find the keys. Fire extinguishers didn\u2019t work. It took nearly an hour and a half for firefighters to arrive. At least 13 infants died. \u201cOh my God, what a big crime today,\u201d one Iraqi wrote on Facebook. _____ 11. Finally, plan ahead if you want to see the Perseids meteor shower, possibly the year\u2019s best in the Northern Hemisphere. As many as 200 meteors will burn across Earth\u2019s atmosphere every hour late Thursday into Friday morning. Try to find an area away from concentrated urban lights with a view of the entire night sky, preferably before dawn on Friday. \u201cIt will rival the stars in the sky,\u201d one astronomer said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
