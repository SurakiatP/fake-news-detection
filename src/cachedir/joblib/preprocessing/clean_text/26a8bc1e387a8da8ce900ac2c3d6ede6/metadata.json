Parker called for a White House \u201cwhitewash,\u201d saying all of the black Patriots players should boycott the visit. \u201cI think there should be a whitewash at the White House, and I mean black players should boycott the visit,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWhen a guy shows you his cards and tells you what he thinks of you and your people and minorities in this country, take notice, because he\u2019s telling you the truth. I think if you\u2019re a black player and you\u2019re going there just to take a photo op with the guy who has basically said and done the things that he\u2019s done to this point, what would be the purpose of that?\u201d Parker went on to applaud 2016 Patriots defensive lineman Chris Long, a white player, for not going but said the minority players are the ones who should be boycotting the visit.
