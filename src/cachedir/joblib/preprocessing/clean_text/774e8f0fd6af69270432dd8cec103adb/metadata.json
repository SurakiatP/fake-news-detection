The official, Charlotte Hogg, offered her resignation on Monday and it was accepted on Tuesday morning, the central bank said. Ms. Hogg, whose family has deep roots in British politics, had been named the bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking. But she faced opposition after admitting she did not disclose that her brother held a senior position at Barclays during her time at the central bank, despite her having a role in drafting a code of conduct policy that required a disclosure of such conflicts. Her resignation is the latest controversy to face Bank of England as some politicians have questioned whether it had become politicized under the bank\u2019s governor, Mark J. Carney, in the   to Britain\u2019s referendum last June on whether to leave the European Union. Ms. Hogg, 46, was part of a team brought in by Mr. Carney to modernize the central bank\u2019s operations. She began her career at the Bank of England before returning as its chief operating officer in July 2013. In the interim, she worked at a variety of companies, including the consulting firm McKinsey  Company, the banks Morgan Stanley and Santander, and the credit reporting company Experian. She was later selected to replace Nemat Shafik as a deputy governor. Ms. Shafik is set to become director of the London School of Economics this year. But a parliamentary committee said in a report that it found Ms. Hogg\u2019s professional competence \u201cfalls short of the very high standards\u201d required to be deputy governor, adding that her failure to disclose her brother\u2019s role was a \u201cserious error of judgment. \u201d Mr. Carney said on Tuesday that he deeply regretted Ms. Hogg\u2019s decision to resign, saying in a statement that she had \u201ctransformed\u201d its management and operations. Her resignation is the latest in a set of controversies that have dogged the Bank of England under Mr. Carney, particularly since the   Brexit referendum. Britain\u2019s economy has performed better than expected since the June vote despite dire warnings by the central bank about the potential impact of Britain\u2019s leaving the   bloc. As a result, some politicians who supported Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union called for the governor\u2019s resignation last year. Mr. Carney has said he would continue to lead the bank through June 2019. In the case of Ms. Hogg, the Treasury Committee said that she did not deliberately conceal her brother\u2019s role as director in group strategy at Barclays or that any prior conflict had arisen. But it said that her conduct was \u201cmore serious\u201d than a simple omission given the length of time before it was disclosed, her role in helping to draft the central bank\u2019s code of conduct and her \u201cfailure to appreciate the seriousness of that history of noncompliance. \u201d Ms. Hogg initially declared her brother\u2019s role at Barclays in a questionnaire submitted to the Treasury Committee on Feb. 22. In a letter dated March 2, she admitted that she had failed to formally declare her brother\u2019s position before joining the central bank in 2013 or subsequently. In her resignation letter, Ms. Hogg said she believed that she made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d and that she never made a secret of her brother\u2019s job. She said in the letter that she first offered her resignation last week. In her new role, she would have been a member of the Prudential Regulation Committee, which discusses \u201c  information and reaches supervisory judgments, both of which the bank describes as \u2018highly \u2019\u201d the Treasury Committee noted. John Mann, a Labour politician and member of the Treasury Committee, said on Twitter that the report was the \u201cstrongest opinion\u201d ever published by the committee. While praising improvements in the central bank\u2019s transparency, accountability and governance, the Treasury Committee said that the incident involving Ms. Hogg raised \u201cwider concerns\u201d about the bank\u2019s governance and that further reform may be needed. On Tuesday, the Bank of England said it would reconfigure its reporting lines and internal structures in order to better safeguard the governance of its code of conduct, compliance and disciplinary procedures. It also said its nonexecutive directors would conduct a review to ensure compliance at the most senior levels of the bank. Ms. Hogg\u2019s family has close ties to Britain\u2019s Conservative Party. She is the daughter of Douglas and Sarah Hogg, who both served in former Prime Minister John Major\u2019s government. Her mother, an economist, a former journalist and now a baroness, was the first chairwoman of a listed company in the FTSE 100, an index of the biggest companies traded in London. Her paternal grandfather, Quintin Hogg, was also a   member of Parliament. Her father gained particular notoriety in Britain during a parliamentary expenses scandal in 2009 that led to his resignation from politics. At the time, he was found to have submitted a claim of 2, 000 pounds, or $2, 400 at current exchange rates, for the clearing of the moat at his country house.'"}, "time": 1742628516.1777587}
