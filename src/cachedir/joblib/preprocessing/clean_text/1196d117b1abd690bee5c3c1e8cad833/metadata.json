He supports racist hatred, state terror, ethnic cleansing and slow-motion genocide. \\nOn Sunday, he threatened Security Council members, saying that \u201c[t]here is a discussion that in the coming months the UN Security Council will force a resolution on Israel.\u201d \\n\u201cIf that happens, we need to have an appropriate Zionist response, immediate sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, including Maaleh Adumim, Gush Etzion, Ariel, Ofra and Beit El.\u201d \\n\u201cIt is time to extend out sovereignty in the land of Israel . . . the entire story of settling and Zionism is a story of a great vision and the determination to see that vision through.\u201d \\nIn September, Israeli-installed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said he intends urging SC members to declare Israeli settlements illegal\u2014knowing Washington will veto any resolution proposed. \\nIn 2011, it vetoed a Palestinian backed draft memo, denouncing Israel\u2019s settlement policy as an illegal obstacle to peace. \\nLast month, 88 US senators urged Obama to veto any similar Security Council resolution proposed. Extremist settlers and Knesset hardliners demand legislation authorizing annexation of Ma\u2019aleh Adumim, Israel\u2019s third largest settlement, home to over 37,000 residents. \\nIsrael\u2019s settlement project flagrantly violates international law. Over 600,000 settlers occupy stolen Palestinian land. \\nFourth Geneva prohibits an occupying power from transferring its citizens to the territory it occupies, as well as displacing people from their land to permit it. \\nIsrael wants historic Palestine exclusively for Jews, Palestinians denied their fundamental rights\u2014terrorized for decades with no international support. \\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago.
