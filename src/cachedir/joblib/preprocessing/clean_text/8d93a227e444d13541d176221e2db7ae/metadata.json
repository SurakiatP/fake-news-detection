[The agreement requires countries to cut greenhouse emissions on a    basis, with Obama committing the U. S. to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.  The U. S. is expected to have a representative at the United Nations\u2019 climate change meeting in Bonn, Germany, next week but Trump\u2019s advisers  \u2014   including daughter Ivanka and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt  \u2014   are meeting on Tuesday in Washington to decide whether to stick with or withdraw from the deal. Last month, in an interview with FOX and Friends, Pruitt said that the \u201cParis [agreement] is something that we need to really look at closely. It\u2019s something we need to exit, in my opinion. It\u2019s a bad deal for America. It was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. \u201cChina and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030,\u201d Pruitt added. \u201cWe   all of our costs. \u201d Trump, on the other hand, has expressed support for the agreement and has backing from some in the U. S. oil and gas industry, including Exxon Mobil, which was led by Rex Tillerson before he was nominated for Secretary of State, a post he now holds. \u201cThe industry campaign to stick with the Paris accord comes amid deep divisions in the Trump administration over the   agreement,\u201d Bloomberg reported last month. \u201cBoth the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House special adviser, have urged the president to stay in the deal, along with Tillerson. \u201d \u201cThe decision to participate in next week\u2019s U. N. climate talks shouldn\u2019t be construed as a sign that Trump has decided to stay in the Paris pact,\u201d a State Department official told the AP. \u201cTo the contrary, the U. S. will be sending a \u2018much smaller\u2019 delegation than it has in years past, the official said, adding that they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss specifics and requested anonymity from the AP. According to the United Nations, 144 of the 197 countries that signed the Paris agreement have ratified it. It is unclear which 53 countries have not ratified it.'"}, "time": 1742562728.9842427}
