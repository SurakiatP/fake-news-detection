JUST NOW: Donald Trump was just rushed off stage during his Nevada campaign rally: https://t.co/7fTJ3N3MQN pic.twitter.com/Hm7CRdFDTU \\n\u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) November 6, 2016 Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump\u2019s motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. Two audience members told DailyMail.com that they had seen the man holding a firearm. That has not been confirmed by law enforcement. As police and good Samaritans took him down, the crowd surged backward and strained against the press section. \u2018CNN sucks!\u2019 one man yelled. \u2018You people caused this!\u2019 Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued. Saturday\u2019s incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to get Trump out of harm\u2019s way. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. The man,Thomas Dimassimo, was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. \u2018I was ready for him, but it\u2019s much easier if the cops do it, don\u2019t we agree?\u2019 Trump said at the time. \u2018And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?\u2019 At this time a motive is not clear. source  \""}, "time": 1742562029.5825408}
