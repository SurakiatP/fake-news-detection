[The Los Angeles Daily News reports:  The resolution, proposed by board members Monica Garcia and Ref Rodriguez, comes shortly after the arrest of Romulo   an [illegal alien] who was detained by U. S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents as he took his daughter to school on Feb. 28 in Highland Park. ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] officials stated that   was targeted based on prior criminal convictions, including a DUI conviction from 2009 and an outstanding order of removal from 2014. The arrest was caught on tape by his    daughter Fatima Avelica, who recorded video on her smart phone.  On the video, obtained by local Los Angeles affiliate KABC Channel 7, Fatima can be heard sobbing as she collects footage of her father\u2019s arrest through the windshield of the family vehicle.   \u201cI\u2019m here to ask that the (LAUSD makes) schools sanctuaries so that nobody else can pass through what I passed through and not be scared to go to school,\u201d Avelica reportedly said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday. As a result of  \u2019s arrest, Garcia and Rodriguez have pulled together a   coalition of organizations that includes the ACLU and California Charter Schools Association, which has been dubbed the \u201cCalifornia Schools Are Sanctuaries Coalition. \u201d Not only does the resolution designate every LAUSD campus as a \u201csafe place\u201d for illegal aliens and their families, but it goes further, as quoted by the Daily News: \u2022 schools can\u2019t ask about a student\u2019s or family member\u2019s immigration status, \u2022 the district will partner with legal services organizations to create \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d presentations for students and their families to educate them about their rights when interacting with law enforcement and immigration agents, \u2022 district employees can refuse, to the fullest extent possible under the law, to share information with immigration agents, \u2022 the district will help with legal support for immigrant students and their families by offering referrals to reputable legal organizations, \u2022 the district will create a \u201crapid response network\u201d to help students or family who have been detained by immigration officials. According to a report by KABC 7, ICE released this statement about the incident: Officers with one of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Los   Fugitive Operations teams took Mr. Avelica into custody Tuesday morning. Mr. Avelica was targeted for arrest because relevant databases indicate he has multiple prior criminal convictions, including a DUI in 2009, as well an outstanding order of removal dating back to 2014. After conducting surveillance to confirm his identity, the officers arrested Mr. Avelica during a vehicle stop in the 3200 block of Pasadena Avenue, approximately a half mile from the charter school described in the related social media post. No one else was detained during the vehicle stop. Mr. Avelica remains in ICE custody at this time. Ricardo Mireles, the executive director of the Highland Park charter school, told KABC 7 that \u201cthe girls\u2019 father had a nearly   DUI conviction and an incident 20 years ago where the father said he bought a car with an incorrect registration sticker, unbeknownst to him. \u201d Peter Greyshock, an attorney representing the family, told the Daily News, \u201cThey stepped over a line, and the ripple effect this could have on the community is frightening. \u201d One goal of newly formed coalition is to secure the commitment of every California school district to become \u201csanctuary schools\u201d for illegal alien students and their entire families to shield them from deportation orders, which are reportedly on the rise under the Trump administration. At a time when the new administration is threatening to cut off federal funds to sanctuary entities  \u2014   and schools are heavily dependent on federal matching funds  \u2014   other districts may be less willing to take the risk.
