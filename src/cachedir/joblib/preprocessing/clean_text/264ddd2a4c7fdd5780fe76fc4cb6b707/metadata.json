There\u2019s no returning the \u201cfavor\u201d by taking a Hillary sign since they are practically non-existent in almost all neighborhoods. So, one proud patriot took retaliation to new heights ensuring liberals stay away from his sign. \\nThe unnamed owner of the Trump sign, who is believed to be in Arizona, is aware that his sign may not cost a lot but is worth much more than the plastic it\u2019s printed on based on what it represents \u2014 a chance to take America back. Hillary-supporters are an odd group of people who seem to believe that the Constitutional right to free speech is only bestowed upon them, along with the power to take it from anyone who says something that they don\u2019t like. \\nPerhaps this the driving purpose behind the nationwide rash of Trump sign theft, paired with the fact that they think that they\u2019re \u201chelping\u201d by removing these visual statements of support from public view. Either way, where there is a Trump sign, there\u2019s a liberal nearby waiting for their chance to make a stupid statement of their own in stealing it. \\nHowever, this sign owner beat them to the punch by putting it in a place that was not only impossible to reach but showed his support of the GOP candidate loud and proud. It sat up high in a tall tree, keeping it out of reach for thieving liberals. Taking Trump sign to new heights to prevent it from being stolen and make a bold message at the same time. \\nIf liberals really want to show their support for Hillary, they\u2019ll have to climb this massive tree and tear it down, but chances are, they\u2019re not as tough as they think they are and prefer to stick to easy to steal signs. We commend the hero for Trump who showed his bravery in putting the sign up so high, knowing that no liberal would dare to go there since it\u2019s so far out of their safe space and more work than they are willing to perform.'"}, "time": 1742563166.2225733}
