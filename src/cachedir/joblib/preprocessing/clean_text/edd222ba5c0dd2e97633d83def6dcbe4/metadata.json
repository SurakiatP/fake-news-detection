Only ONE Candidate is Up To Her Neck in FBI Probes and Her Name Isn\u2019t Donald\u201d Breaking News By TruthFeedNews November 4, 2016 \\nBy Piers Morgan When I competed in Donald Trump \u2019s first season of Celebrity Apprentice , he pitched me in the finale against country music star Trace Adkins. NBC promoted our showdown in endless commercials as \u2018USA versus UK, good versus evil.\u2019 Trace was portrayed as a strong, kind, polite, hard-working, all-American hero. I was depicted as an arrogant, obnoxious, ruthless British villain. There was just one problem, as I pointed out to Trump in a boardroom exchange that tragically never got aired. \u2018One of us,\u2019 I explained, \u2018is a violent alcoholic who\u2019s been shot by an ex-wife, stabbed in bar-room knife fights, and has a criminal record for a DUI.\u2019 I competed in Donald Trump\u2019s first season of Celebrity Apprentice \u2013 and I was once portrayed as evil, not unlike how Donald has been branded these days Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn\u2019t get the \u2018rise above the monster\u2019 memo, shrieking herself hoarse (pictured today speaking in North Carolina) I paused for effect. \u2018The other\u2026. is me\u2026. the bad guy.\u2019 Trump roared with laughter. He got the irony, even if viewers never got the chance to. I was reminded of this today as I watched President Obama tear into Trump, branding him a small-brained, star-f***ing, Ku Klux Klan tolerating \u2018loser\u2019 born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It was an astonishingly personal and nasty attack from a man whose own wife Michelle recently declared from atop her lofty moral plinth: \u2018When they go low, we go high.\u2019 Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn\u2019t get the \u2018rise above the monster\u2019 memo either, shrieking herself hoarse as she once again laid into Trump supporters she recently described as \u2018The Deplorables\u2019. \u2018I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and the anger of people who support Donald Trump,\u2019 she raged. This follows a familiar pattern from Team Clinton as election day draws closer: when in doubt, trash Trump and his followers in the meanest, ugliest, most personal way possible. The mantra seems to be: \u2018When they go low, we plummet even lower.\u2019 A similar mistake was made in Britain during the EU referendum debate when the Remain campaigners belittled and berated the Brexiters in a snide, sneering, superior manner. They lost. The problem for Mrs Clinton as she gallops across the fields of America like a crusading white knight trying to single-handedly save the nation from imminent Armageddon at the hands of Mr Evil is that she\u2019s the Trace Adkins of this battle. In other words, she ain\u2019t no saint herself. Her supporters don\u2019t accept this of course. To them, Hillary is a vestal political virgin of unimpeachable integrity. \u2018Why would I want to criticise her?\u2019 a female Clinton-ite actress indignantly asked me on Twitter yesterday. \u2018She\u2019s up against a mad man. Compared to him, she\u2019s bathed in golden light.\u2019 It was the kind of thing I\u2019d expect Tom Cruise to say in defence of his beloved basket case Scientologists. Yet as I write this, Clinton is facing potential FBI criminal investigations on two fronts. One is the re-opened case of her ongoing email scandal, this time centering on the contents of sexting pervert Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. The second, according to the Washington Post, is an investigation into an alleged \u2018pay-or-play\u2019 operation Hillary ran out of the State Department that favoured donors to the Clinton Foundation charity. At the root of it lies a central charge that the Clintons have cynically and greedily exploited political power and status to enrich themselves, under the convenient protective umbrella of their Foundation. Big sponsors have been repeatedly \u2018invited\u2019 to donate big sums to the Foundation, then also donate big sums to the personal fortunes of Bill or Hillary in the form of cash, holidays, private jets and other benefits. On the face of it, this seems like a prima facie case of potential corruption. Yet the Post further reports the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation has been held up by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to the fury of many in the FBI. This is the same Loretta Lynch who Bill Clinton hijacked for a 30-minute conversation on a private airstrip days before the original FBI email investigation verdict exonerating his wife was made public. We can all draw our own conclusions, none of them I suspect very pretty. I know from first-hand experience there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. There is no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. I know from my own dealings it\u2019s quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his I\u2019ve interviewed Bill Clinton twice, for CNN. On both occasions, the request was only granted once I had agreed to moderate a panel for the former president at his annual Clinton Global Initiative event in aid of Clinton Foundation. It was a strict quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his. So I scratched away, as do many other TV journalists each year who want an interview with him. There\u2019s a similar pattern to almost everything in Planet Clinton: they trade favours. But when that trade involves millions of dollars raked into personal bank accounts on the back of charity donations, it stinks to high heaven. \u2018Trace\u2019 Clinton should get off her high horse, before she gets a nosebleed. \\nH/T \u2013 DailyMail \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.
