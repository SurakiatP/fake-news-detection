A snarling swarm of   green monsters is hot on his heels. One fast plot twist later, he stands atop a monumental stone wall, one guarded by thousands of Chinese warriors in dazzling uniforms. Cut to generals with furrowed brows fretting in Mandarin as the monsters come tumbling over a hill. Will their megastructure do its job? The same question, more or less, faces \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d as it begins its global theatrical release. The movie, filmed entirely in China, was engineered not just as escapist entertainment but also proof that the Chinese film industry can serve up global blockbusters too  \u2014   that event films can rise in the East and play in the West. The last   film to become a breakout hit in North America was \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d which awed with its martial arts and stunt work and took in a surprising $180 million in 2000, after adjusting for inflation. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work, then I don\u2019t know what will,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a   professor at the University of Southern California who has studied China\u2019s efforts in recent years to emerge as a moviemaking superpower. \u201cThe film addresses a lot of the previous issues that China has faced as it\u2019s tried to internationalize its film industry, like language and the lack of internationally known stars. \u201d \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d passed its first test. Released in Chinese theaters on Friday, the movie collected a strong $67 million in tickets over its first three days, according to the Beijing box office tracker Ent Group. The film\u2019s total after five days was $82 million, as much as \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d collected in China during its entire run. \u201cStep 1 went really, really well,\u201d said Thomas Tull, chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, which produced \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d with Universal Pictures, China\u2019s Le Vision Pictures and China Film Group. \u201cGiven market conditions, I feel like it was a big success,\u201d Mr. Tull added, noting that the Chinese box office has lately been in a funk, with growth slowing sharply, partly because of a glut of fantasies. Even so, \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d remains a long way from the box office threshold Legendary ultimately hopes to hit in China  \u2014   $200 million or so for its full run  \u2014   and some analysts were underwhelmed by turnout given the marketing push the film received. Before its release, expectations for the film had become as considerable as the epochal structure for which it was named. Marketing efforts included two trailers, three music videos, 60 online video ads and stunts in 260 shopping malls owned by the Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese conglomerate that bought Legendary for $3. 5 billion in January. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say,\u201d Mr. Tull said, when asked whether he thought the film, which drew mixed reviews in China, would be profitable. The crucial test lies ahead. \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d arrives in North American multiplexes on Feb. 17. Movie executives say prospects in the United States and Canada come down to one question: Are ticket buyers ready to embrace a film that is very much Chinese, even if it does have an American star in a lead role? \u201cIt\u2019s daunting,\u201d said Peter Loehr, a Legendary executive in Beijing and one of the film\u2019s producers. \u201cI do hope it works, but I don\u2019t know. \u201d The People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, even weighed in on \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d this week, publishing a commentary following what it called \u201clively online criticism\u201d of the film. \u201cEven if it is successful in overseas markets, the road on which Chinese culture goes out to the world is bound to be bumpy,\u201d the article said. Directed by Zhang Yimou, known for films like \u201cHouse of Flying Daggers\u201d and for orchestrating the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d finds Mr. Damon in ancient China as William Garin, a bedraggled European mercenary. Garin and his partner (Pedro Pascal, known for Netflix\u2019s \u201cNarcos\u201d) soon discover that the wall was not, as history tells it, erected to keep out invading nomads, but rather to protect against the mythical   creatures that rush the wall every 60 years in an attack on humanity. Garin spends much of the film learning about the Chinese culture of   and sacrifice. Meanwhile, there are astounding action sequences as the wall is defended (similar to the siege of Minas Tirith in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d) and a subplot involving sneaky Westerners, who covet China\u2019s \u201cblack powder. \u201d Chinese stars include Andy Lau, Jing Tian and the pop idol Lu Han.   Industrial Light  Magic handled the visual effects. To appeal to international audiences, about 80 percent of the dialogue is in English. (Those portions were subtitled in Chinese for the Chinese run Western audiences will get a version that is 20 percent subtitled in English.) Mr. Zhang\u2019s extreme   pacing and use of   effects that come straight at viewers are likely to stand out as a departure from Hollywood\u2019s usual cinematic language, but Ms. Jing\u2019s character may best sum up the cultural needle the movie tries to thread. Her general is at once the supreme leader (in keeping with a recent trend in Hollywood movies to depict women as every bit as tough as men) and strikingly demure when not in battle (something the filmmakers felt made her more viable to Eastern audiences). Trying to appeal to everyone often warps the result. Movie executives, citing past experiences, say that audiences leave thinking that something was off the mark, even if they aren\u2019t quite sure what. \u201cThe biggest challenge in the film was integrating the two cultures,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing this month. \u201cWe knew it would not be enough to rely on the novelty of the film\u2019s Chinese elements to attract Western audiences. So we spent a lot of energy and time working on the story. \u201d Part of the plot  \u2014   the inclusion of a white hero  \u2014   has incited controversy. Some critics, judging the film by its trailers, accused Mr. Zhang of giving Mr. Damon a part that should have gone to an Asian actor, a practice known as whitewashing. In truth, the role was written specifically as  . Mr. Damon was sought for the part because he is a proven box office star around the world, including in China. \u201cThere are five major heroes in our story and he is one of them  \u2014   the other four are all Chinese,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in a statement when the outcry erupted online in August. \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d will attract additional scrutiny when it arrives in the United States because it comes as some lawmakers question China\u2019s increasingly aggressive efforts to use motion pictures to promote itself. But the movie, if successful, could foster more collaboration between Chinese and American filmmakers. It qualified under Chinese rules as an official \u201c\u201d a coveted governmental status that entitles   film companies to a greater share of the ticketing revenue.   receive 43 percent of   ticket sales, compared with 25 percent for typical Hollywood imports. American studios have struggled to meet the   requirements, which mandate the inclusion of \u201cChinese elements,\u201d a nebulous umbrella term that touches on everything from the film\u2019s financing to its casting, story line and shooting location. \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d was filmed in locations across China, including in Qingdao, the eastern port city where the real    behemoth Dalian Wanda is building an $8 billion movie facility and tourism complex to attract American productions. \u201cI have a feeling that Qingdao is going to be calling a lot of us back over the next few years,\u201d Mr. Damon said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible. \u201d But does he think \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d will be a hit on his home turf? \u201cI\u2019m not really the target audience for the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun and spectacular in the true meaning of the word. But, then again, I don\u2019t know how to predict what that will mean. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561798.6099508}
