Let go of that   you\u2019ve had since middle school, the cracked mirror that you haven\u2019t had time to replace and the lamp that works only when you kick it on the third try. When you\u2019re trying to maximize a small space, every inch counts, from under the bed to unclaimed wall space over your head. While moving is considered one of life\u2019s great stressors, living in a small space doesn\u2019t have to be. All it takes is some thoughtful planning and smart storage options. For Julia Haney Montanez, an interior designer living alone for the first time in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, purging is the first step to making the most of what you have. \u201cYou have to stop being a hoarder,\u201d Ms. Montanez, 30, said this week in her studio apartment. \u201cThe secret to   living is trying to avoid owning too much stuff that\u2019s a good practice for life. You don\u2019t have to be a minimalist, but you have to get really creative where you store your things and maybe think twice about buying something new. \u201d (Related: A beginner\u2019s guide to home d\u00e9cor) Once you\u2019ve winnowed down your belongings, it\u2019s time to consider how to use your limited space. Ms. Montanez, a producer for the Architectural Digest show and a freelance designer, lives in a    studio. When she first moved in, Ms. Montanez spent hours looking at the floor plan and figuring out the ideal configuration for her furniture. By living in the space for a while before making any major purchases, Ms. Montanez said, you get an idea of how to make your home as functional as possible. \u201cAs you live in the apartment you\u2019ll know and understand what you need,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have your freeloader friends crashing all the time? Then get a longer sofa. If not, get a smaller sofa because they take up so much space. Get to know your own space before you start throwing money at those things. \u201d If you have the opportunity to splurge, Ms. Montanez recommends creating a custom piece. For her it was a California Closet and a table that doubles as her office desk. \u201cIt was the best decision,\u201d she said of the custom closet. \u201cEverything goes in there. \u201d Shoes, cleaning supplies and home office material like fabric swatches all live in her closet, neatly tucked away in designated cubbies alongside double hanging clothes racks. \u201cTake your dinner money for the next month and put it toward something that will fit perfectly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Tetris, and it\u2019s that one thing you need. \u201d Making a tight spot work can require bending the rules on traditional uses of space. Consider using a medicine cabinet for storing glassware or kitchen cabinets for sweater storage if cooking isn\u2019t a priority. Every space has to serve a purpose, said Susan Winberg, an interior designer based in New York City. \u201cIt has to have more than one function,\u201d she said. Ms. Winberg typically takes on larger residential projects, she said, but with two children in their 20s, she began designing projects with much more limited space. Her daughter\u2019s San Francisco   apartment, for example, had a Murphy bed alcove with no bed in it, she said. They put her bed elsewhere in the apartment and converted the alcove into a closet. If you have limited closet space, prioritize where you store your things, Ms. Winberg advised. The Murphy bed closet is tucked away, so Ms. Winberg\u2019s daughter uses that area to store winter clothes and boots, saving her more accessible closet for things that she uses more regularly. If you\u2019re working with a dresser, add another piece or shelf above the dresser for extra storage, she said. Madeline Fraser, one of the founders of a new app called Homee, which offers personal design services and a virtual showroom, summed up a similar approach to coping with small spaces in two words: up and out. \u201cThe use of the wall space is where you\u2019re going to maximize your overall space,\u201d she said. Ms. Fraser recommended putting storage on walls with open floating shelving, an affordable option, she said, especially for renters who can easily Spackle the wall when it\u2019s time to move out. And shelving can go beyond the living room and bedroom, too. Open shelving in kitchens, especially in a galley or small kitchen, can make the room feel more open. \u201cWhen you have cabinets, it can appear closed off like there\u2019s a wall there,\u201d she said. Everyone thinks, \u2018Oh, I have to have cabinets,\u2019 but you can easily do open shelving and arrange your kitchen stuff to look cool. It will feel more like a restaurant. \u201d To keep things looking tidy, Ms. Fraser suggested bringing symmetry to open shelves by displaying dishes, cutting boards and kitchen accessories stacked in clusters or leaning against the wall. Books and bookends offer a way to ground shelving, too, she said. And for miscellaneous items, wire baskets can help contain odds and ends that may be without a home. At a bare minimum, get the mattress and box spring off the floor, Ms. Fraser said. Every big piece of furniture should have legs if possible, to provide storage space underneath. \u201cYou can get an   bed frame that gives you more storage under your bed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can do a bed skirt and put a lot under your bed. Your mom will not be happy with you if she comes over and sees the bed on the floor. \u201d Want more?
