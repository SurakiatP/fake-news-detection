However, it seems that Hillary made sure to do one dirty thing before walking down those stairs. \\nCrooked Hillary is a cowardly schemer \u2013 and her recent actions go to prove just that. Mad World News reported Friday that after the news broke of FBI Director James Comey reopening their investigation, Hillary was seen rapidly exiting her plane and ignoring reporters before darting into her SUV. Just In: Clinton declines to answer questions about the FBI as she deplanes in Cedar Rapids. Sat on tarmac for 30 minutes after news broke. pic.twitter.com/zC115U7YNp \\n\u2014 Adam D. Brown (@aduanebrown) October 28, 2016 \\nHowever, recent reports indicate that her dodging the matter at hand began far before that point . In fact, Hillary\u2019s staff made sure to disable the plane\u2019s Wi-Fi after the news broke so that the reporters onboard wouldn\u2019t learn of the matter until they got on the ground. Of note as we wait for Clinton: plane had no wi-fi today. One adviser after we landed: \"We\\'re learning about this just like you all are.\" pic.twitter.com/CjsH71LJNo \\n\u2014 Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) October 28, 2016 \\nOf course, Hillary made sure to stay far away from the media seats until she got off the plane, but it didn\u2019t end there. As reporters had questions about Hillary, an adviser used President Barack Obama\u2019s time-old line saying \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re learning about this just like you all are.\u201d Clinton\u2019s plane did not have WiFi. Her advisors learned about the FBI letter when you did. https://t.co/C0uSXheh1i https://t.co/BAGhckS2aN \\n\u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 28, 2016 \\nAlthough CNN tried their best to make it sound as if they didn\u2019t have Internet access on the plane at all, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Byron Tau came forward saying that Hillary\u2019s plane is equipped with Wi-Fi. Hillary has been dodging the consequences of her actions since the beginning of her campaign, but this is a new low for even her. The Hillary plane has wifi. https://t.co/dLZ0tigZhP \\n\u2014 Byron Tau (@ByronTau) October 28, 2016 \\nAt this point, she knowingly put those in charge of getting information to the world in the dark in order to protect herself. Too bad for her, running only gets you so far in terms of justice. She will one day have to face the music. \\nAs the saying goes \u2013 \u201cyou can run, but you can\u2019t hide,\u201d and the noose that all those guilty of treason get in the end seems to be getting closer and closer every day.'"}, "time": 1742628593.081415}
