First, you will see a background section that is in 2-D and not 3-D, like a projected image on a wall would look. Secondly, you see when anyone steps in front of that background, there appears a darkened halo around them. Why would that be? Well, that happens in what we call green screen technology, and in this case, poorly done green screen.\\nStart watching at the 1:03:00 mark to see where Crooked Hillary starts speaking: \\nAnother salient clue that she used a green screen is that when she turns around to wave to these people, they are mere feet away and yet she shakes hands with none of them. Why, because they weren\u2019t there. Liberal news rag CNN is infamous for pretending to be in a location but in reality it\u2019s nothing more than green screen. CNN did it here, here, and also here.\\nTHE HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA EXPOSES THE LIE: Look in the viewfinder of the video camera filming Crooked Hillary \u2013 it\u2019s black behind her yet in the official video it\u2019s filled with people. Hmm\u2026awake yet, America?\\n\\nLastly, if you look close at the end of the video, you will see the real people behind her with cameras, but then the main group of people behind them are flattened out in 2-D because they are not actually there.\\nHILLARY\u2019S RALLY WAS UBER-TINY SO IT\u2019S LITTLE WONDER THEY HAD TO RESORT TO GREEN SCREEN: Clinton supporters beginning to enter Broward College for Hillary Clinton early voting rally in Coconut Creek #tcpalm pic.twitter.com/8HhLkFltks \\n\u2014 Eric Hasert (@TCPalmHasert) October 25, 2016 \\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742562339.0524535}
