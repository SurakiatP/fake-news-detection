It turns out the subway cricket lady was a prank. The   subway riders? Flimflam. Even, it seems, that      New Yorker the Pizza Rat may have been schooled and rehearsed for the camera. Is no crazy thing sacred, or at least genuine? The subway cricket lady, for those not paying attention, was videotaped last week on the D train as she was supposedly trying to sell crickets and worms out of a bucket. As the story went, a group of teenagers bumped into her and she flew off the handle and dumped the crickets and worms into the train. \u201cStraphangers Go Berserk After Woman Tosses Bugs in Subway Car,\u201d The New York Post reported. The emergency brake was pulled  \u2014   a truly useless maneuver, bringing the train to a dead stop on the Manhattan Bridge. The first reports of this were accompanied by a cellphone video of the chaos. Then another video surfaced and the   reporters Rafi Schwartz and Soraya Auger of Vox noticed that it was quite a polished bit of filmmaking. Through advanced interrogation techniques, they extracted an admission of responsibility from the woman who posted it. She declared herself to be the   and said she was engaged in performance art having something to do with homelessness. The bucket of bugs was knocked out of her hands by another member of her troupe. Who knows how many other passengers were part of the staging or just fated to be along for the ride. Eventually, the brakes were reset and the train moved off the bridge. On Tuesday, having been exposed, she was arrested on a charge of reckless endangerment by the police, who had previously been willing to let her slide. So actually, you can make this stuff up, and be believed. But why bother? The implausible is the daily bread of the subway, served without irony. Real events: Trysts. Preachers. Makeup artists. The \u201c    \u201d acrobats. Buckets of dead crabs, as Gothamist reported, and a condom tied to a pole on the F train, apparently for weeks, and seemingly, we regret to say,  . All manner of live creatures: chickens, frogs, goldfish, cats, a monkey. And of course, microbes, by the kajillion. (The Central Intelligence Agency took it upon itself in 1966 to see how quickly germs would be propelled through the tunnels via the piston effect of moving trains. At strategic spots, the C. I. A. people dropped light bulbs filled with what they termed innocuous bacteria, then measured how far they traveled.) Then there is the snake guy. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t talking at all,\u201d Conor C. Walsh remembered. \u201cHe had an intern, a young kid helper, and a duffel bag filled with five or six snakes. \u201d It was Halloween night two years ago, and Mr. Walsh and some friends were on a train that was moseying to Williamsburg. At first, the man draped the snakes on an overhead handrail. Then he walked through the car with them. \u201cUnless you really protested, he was putting them on people,\u201d Mr. Walsh, 28, said. \u201cThere was a   woman shrieking and screaming. He wasn\u2019t going to put it on her. \u201d Some of the passengers seemed thrilled about having a snake coiled around their bodies. \u201cI don\u2019t like them at all,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s my one thing. I kept him away, at all times. I was just imagining his apartment, or his warehouse, wherever he kept them. \u201d Although the man did not speak, he appeared to be marketing the snakes. \u201cHe had business cards that he passed out,\u201d Mr. Walsh said, \u201cbut no one was walking away with a snake. \u201d Mr. Walsh, who grew up in New York and teaches high school in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, is also a singer and guitarist with the indie band  . He has put subway exotica to excellent use in his music. \u201cThere are days when you hate the subways and days when you meet some awesome people,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat down next to this guy one time, and we got talking, so I asked him what he did. He said: \u2018I\u2019m a shaman. I\u2019m an actual shaman. I help my clients speak to the spirits.\u2019 He was a nice kid, 26. Had gone to Hampshire, that college in Massachusetts. \u201d Mr. Walsh turned his encounter with the young shaman into a brisk, fun pop tune, \u201cShaman,\u201d which begins: \u201cI met a shaman who grew up in Queens   On the D train his knees touching me. \u201d After all, there\u2019s magical realism to spare.'"}, "time": 1742561710.3494122}
