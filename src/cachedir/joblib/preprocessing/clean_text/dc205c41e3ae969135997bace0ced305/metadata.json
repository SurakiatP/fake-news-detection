J.  \u2014   Nicole Adamczyk\u2019s drinking water used to slosh through a snarl of pipes dating from the Coolidge administration  \u2014   a rusty, rickety symbol of the nation\u2019s failing infrastructure. So, in 2012, this   port city cut a deal with a Wall Street investment firm to manage its municipal waterworks. Four years later, many of those crusty brown pipes have been replaced by shiny   ones, reflecting a broader infrastructure overhaul in Bayonne. But Ms. Adamczyk\u2019s water and sewer bill has jumped so much that she is thinking about moving out of town. \u201cMy reaction was, \u2018Oh, so I guess I\u2019m screwed now? \u2019\u201d said Ms. Adamczyk, an accountant and mother of two who received a quarterly bill for almost $500 this year. She\u2019s not alone: Another resident\u2019s bill jumped 5 percent, despite the household\u2019s having used 11 percent less water. Even as Wall Street deals like the one with Bayonne help financially desperate municipalities to make   repairs, they can come with a hefty price tag  \u2014   not just to pay for new pipes, but also to help the investors earn a nice return, a New York Times analysis has found. Often, these contracts guarantee a specific amount of revenue, The Times found, which can send water bills soaring. Water rates in Bayonne have risen nearly 28 percent since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  \u2014   one of Wall Street\u2019s most storied private equity firms  \u2014   teamed up with another company to manage the city\u2019s water system, the Times analysis shows. City officials also promised residents a   rate freeze that never materialized. In one measure of residents\u2019 distress, people are falling so far behind on their bills that the city is placing more liens against their homes, which can eventually lead to foreclosures. In the typical private equity water deal, higher rates help the firms earn returns of anywhere from 8 to 18 percent, more than what a regular   water company may expect. And to accelerate their returns, two of the firms have applied a common strategy from the private equity playbook: quickly flipping their investment to another firm. This includes K. K. R. which is said to be shopping its 90 percent stake in the Bayonne venture, a partnership with the water company Suez. Rich Henning, a Suez spokesman, said that \u201cBayonne had chronically underinvested in their water and sewer infrastructure, which has certainly contributed to rate increases during the past few years. \u201d He added, \u201cWe understand that these increases create stresses for ratepayers. \u201d   Donald J. Trump has made the privatization of public works a centerpiece of his strategy to rebuild America\u2019s airports, bridges, tunnels and roads. Members of his inner circle have sketched out a vision, including billions of dollars of tax credits for private investors willing to tackle big infrastructure projects. And Mr. Trump himself promised in his victory speech \u201cto rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. \u201d Private equity firms like K. K. R. have already presented themselves as a willing partner, and Bayonne provides an important case study. Its arrangement is one of a handful of deals across the country in the last few years in which private equity firms have managed public water systems. While these deals are a small corner of private equity\u2019s sprawling interests, they represent the leading edge of the industry\u2019s profound expansion into public services. For residents, the financial   from these water deals can be painful. The Times analyzed three deals in which private equity firms have recently run a community\u2019s water or sewer services through a   contract. In all three places  \u2014   Bayonne, and two cities in California, Rialto and Santa Paula  \u2014   rates rose more quickly than in comparable towns, which included both publicly and privately run water systems. In Santa Paula, where Alinda Capital Partners controlled the sewer plant, the city more than doubled the rates. A fourth municipality, Middletown, Pa. raised its rates before striking a deal. Now, some of these cities are trying to take back their water. Missoula, Mont. wrested away its water system, which had been owned by the Carlyle Group. Apple Valley, Calif. whose waterworks were also owned by Carlyle, has filed a similar lawsuit. Santa Paula bought its sewer plant from Alinda last year. Of course, there\u2019s a reason many communities look for private partners to begin with: Their water systems are in poor shape. Budget shortfalls and political mismanagement can represent a real threat to both infrastructure and citizens. For evidence, look no further than the crisis in Flint, Mich. where the drinking water became tainted with lead. \u201cKeeping rates down may sound like the ultimate righteous good for ratepayers, but the truth is, not if you\u2019re failing to provide basic care and maintenance,\u201d said Megan Matson, a partner at Table Rock Capital, the boutique private equity firm that invested in Rialto\u2019s water and sewer system. She added that it helps for deals to \u201cprovide more obvious public benefits,\u201d noting that her firm partnered with Ullico, the nation\u2019s only   insurance and investment company. Proponents of the   partnerships, citing recent studies in Canada and Europe, argue that private businesses operate more efficiently than governments do and that this translates into cost savings for citizens. And private equity firms, lacking technical expertise in how to manage infrastructure, often team up with private water companies. Supporters also say that the deals require private equity to spend millions of dollars a year to fix things (money that towns may not spend on their own) and that the firms sometimes pay towns millions more up front. Bayonne, for instance, got $150 million up front from K. K. R. \u2019s team, which the city used to pay off a pile of debt. In a statement, a K. K. R. spokeswoman said, \u201cOur partnership has provided Bayonne residents with better service, modernized technology to detect leaks and conserve water, improved infrastructure and safer conditions for workers  \u2014   all without a tax increase or public expenditure. \u201d In Bayonne, a city of about 65, 000 on a peninsula in the shadow of the fallen twin towers, a crucial test for its private equity deal came in July 2012. By then, Bayonne had already spent nearly a year haggling with some of K. K. R. \u2019s top negotiators. Next, city officials presented the deal to a more skeptical crowd: their own residents. Bayonne\u2019s sales pitch to its citizens illustrates the bold steps town officials can take  \u2014   including making promises that are at odds with the actual terms of the deal  \u2014   to attract private equity money. Private equity, in turn, can earn significant returns. At a public meeting in city hall, a lawyer for the city promised that, after an initial rate bump, there would be \u201ca rate freeze for four years,\u201d according to a meeting transcript. Bayonne\u2019s mayor, Mark Smith, later reiterated the   freeze in a magazine article. That promise turned out to be fleeting. The contract allowed additional rate increases after only two years. There was no   freeze. In fact, rates rose even more than the Bayonne contract predicted  \u2014   in part because K. K. R\u2019s team had to make unexpected infrastructure upgrades, but also because residents were using less water than expected. The contract guarantees revenue to the team  \u2014   more than half a billion dollars over 40 years  \u2014   so water rates have jumped, in part, to make up the difference. The city said it saw the revenue requirement as a way for K. K. R. \u2019s team to earn steady returns, but not a windfall. But the Times analysis showed that Bayonne\u2019s water rates grew almost 28 percent under the deal, growth that far exceeded that of three other municipalities to which Bayonne has compared itself. (Daniel Van Abs, an associate professor at Rutgers University who specializes in water management, said that a true    comparison of water rates in different towns was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d because of the different factors that can influence rates, including the size of the utility, the municipality\u2019s population, droughts and infrastructure investment  \u2014   or lack thereof. The Times analysis for Bayonne did not include sewer rates.) Former Bayonne officials who had promised the   rate freeze said in interviews that they had not meant to mislead residents. They said they had earmarked some of the K. K. R. team\u2019s $150 million   payment to offset rate increases in the contract\u2019s early years. But then voters ousted Mayor Smith. And once he left office, the new administration put that money elsewhere. \u201cI think we could have accomplished that   minimum,\u201d the former mayor said in an interview. The town\u2019s water rates, he said, are now \u201cexorbitant. \u201d Tim Boyle, who took over Bayonne\u2019s utilities authority after Mr. Smith was voted out of office, said that various regulations required the city to use that money for property tax relief rather than to stabilize rates. He also blamed the previous administration for guaranteeing too much revenue to K. K. R. \u2019s team in the early part of the deal, calling those figures \u201cwildly optimistic. \u201d Bayonne officials also stress the deal\u2019s benefits, including the   payment that let Bayonne pay off more than $100 million in old debts. Within three months, Moody\u2019s Investor Service revised the city\u2019s debt outlook from \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201cstable\u201d for the first time in five years, and it has since upgraded the city\u2019s credit rating. K. K. R. \u2019s team contributes about $2. 5 million annually to pay for repairs to water infrastructure, plus $500, 000 to the city itself. K. K. R. and Suez said they have upgraded their safety equipment and replaced inoperable hydrants around town. They also installed sophisticated water meters that can detect leaks in people\u2019s homes, and sent nearly 2, 000 letters to customers warning when such leaks occurred. As such, use has declined, according to Mr. Henning, who said Suez had received \u201cmany notes of thanks\u201d for the warnings. But   meters could lead to higher bills for some residents whose water use wasn\u2019t fully captured in the past. When negotiating the deal, K. K. R. called this process \u201cmeter uplift,\u201d according to emails obtained through records requests. \u201cWe gave away too much,\u201d said Gary La Pelusa Sr. a city councilman and former commissioner of Bayonne\u2019s utilities authority, which approved the deal over his objections. Bayonne originally promised residents that the city\u2019s utilities authority would oversee K. K. R. and Suez. But the City Council recently decided to shutter the agency and handle the oversight itself. Stephen Gallo, who headed that authority when the deal was struck, still believes that it benefits Bayonne. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to watch them, you\u2019ve got to keep an eye on things,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing that now. \u201d In interviews with The Times, more than a dozen Bayonne residents, including Ms. Adamczyk, expressed dismay over the rate increases. One reason is that people who fall behind on payments face   risks: Unpaid water and sewer bills can be sold to investors who try to collect on that debt, a common practice across the country. Failure to pay can ultimately lead to foreclosure. In 2012, the year Bayonne struck its deal, water bill delinquencies led to 200 government liens against local properties, tax records show. That figure more than tripled the next year, the first full year under K. K. R. \u2019s team. In 2015, the most recent year with data available, the number remained elevated, at 465. The city publishes its lien notices in the local newspaper and residents receive mailed delinquency letters. Still, when a reporter asked one Bayonne resident, Carlos Jimenez, about a water and sewer bill lien that had been listed against his property, he expressed surprise, saying he wasn\u2019t aware of it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this could happen,\u201d Mr. Jimenez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different ballgame. \u201d One of the few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on is that the nation faces an infrastructure crisis. In water infrastructure alone, the nation needs about $600 billion over the next 20 years, according to federal estimates. And yet federal spending on water utilities has declined, prompting state and federal officials to try to play matchmaker, courting private investors to fix what needs fixing. For years, the Obama administration has been cheerleading   partnerships. In a statement, the White House said it backed them \u201cwhen they are well structured, include strong labor standards, and when there is confidence that taxpayers are getting a good deal. \u201d During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s team outlined a new plan to incentivize private investors to take on large infrastructure projects. Wall Street has responded to the call to action. There are now 84 active financial infrastructure funds, according to Pitchbook, a private financial data platform, up 25 percent in just three years. Some belong to big banks like Goldman Sachs, but many are run by private equity firms. \u201cAcross our country, we need solutions for infrastructure deficiencies,\u201d said James Maloney, a spokesman for the American Investment Council, the private equity trade group. \u201cPrivate equity serves as one of these solutions. \u201d Some critics are wary of expanding private investment in public infrastructure. Although cities may get cash up front in these deals, \u201cthere is no \u2018free\u2019 money\u201d in   partnerships, says a 2008 Government Accountability Office report. Using roads as an example, the report observed \u201cit is likely\u201d that tolls will increase more on a privately operated highway than one run by the government. Ms. Matson, of Table Rock, who has attended White House meetings on infrastructure, has tried to dispel concerns about these deals. Table Rock is part of a team that finances and manages the water system in Rialto, Calif. a deal that provided the city about $41 million to improve the water and wastewater infrastructure, she said. Rialto residents have seen their water rates increase about 68 percent since the deal, according to the Times analysis, more than any other comparable city. But Table Rock said rates were artificially low after the city had declined to raise them for about a decade, giving it the lowest rates among those towns. And unlike in most other deals, Rialto residents had a say in the increases and ultimately approved them in a public vote, as required under state law. This year\u2019s rate increase was delayed. When the deal closed in 2012, all the public water utility employees kept their jobs. Everyone has since received raises. And Table Rock, like its partner Ullico, has committed to all 30 years of the arrangement. \u201cWe don\u2019t do flips, we invest for life,\u201d Ms. Matson said, meaning that Table Rock doesn\u2019t seek quick profits by unloading its investments. She also said that Table Rock declined to make deals that provided big   payments to towns without a sufficient commitment to infrastructure repairs. \u201cThose deals give the rest of us a bad name,\u201d she said. In an upscale Washington, D. C. restaurant in 2012, an executive from the Carlyle Group, one of the world\u2019s largest private equity firms, put his arm around the mayor of Missoula, Mont. \u201cMayor,\u201d the executive said, \u201care you ready to buy a water system?\u201d Three years later, the comments by the executive, Robert Dove, were recounted from a witness stand in the Missoula County Courthouse. The city was suing Carlyle, which ultimately refused to sell to Missoula, to gain control of its water system. Missoula is one of several places in recent years that have tried getting back their water systems from a private company. But after waging costly battles, the towns cannot always guarantee the same services at lower rates. At the time of that dinner in Washington, Missoula was the only city in Montana that did not own its water system  \u2014   and John Engen, Missoula\u2019s mayor, wanted to change that. So, months before, he had supported Carlyle\u2019s purchase of the regional water company (Park Water) that owned Missoula\u2019s local system (Mountain Water) believing that Carlyle would then sell Mountain Water back to his town. But the mayor\u2019s plans derailed. In October 2013, Missoula made an informal offer to buy its local system. Carlyle declined. Missoula made a formal offer. Carlyle declined again. Missoula then sued, and it won. But the court decided the system was worth $88. 6 million, substantially more than what the city had offered. On top of that, the city must spend millions of dollars on legal and other fees and must also pay some of its opponents\u2019 costs, according to court records. Those costs included lawyers\u2019 fees, limo services and dinners at some of Missoula\u2019s finest restaurants. They also included at least one order of boneless chicken wings at Hooters, and one bottle of Metamucil. In a statement, a Carlyle spokesman said that the firm had considered the city\u2019s offers in good faith. \u201cThe city offered many millions less than the company was worth, and an independent panel agreed,\u201d the spokesman said. He also said that under Carlyle\u2019s watch, \u201ccapital expenditures more than doubled, leakage was reduced by 19 percent, water quality was excellent and employment was stable. \u201d And under Missoula\u2019s watch, water rates may rise anyway. Further costly repairs are still needed, for one thing. For Carlyle, the deal was a financial success. The firm sold Park Water in January to another private company for $327 million, more than double what Carlyle had paid. Missoula is not the only city seeking control over its infrastructure. Last year, Santa Paula bought its wastewater recycling plant for about $70 million from Alinda Capital Partners. Alinda, which specializes in infrastructure investing, had teamed up with a private water recycling company to finance, design, build and operate the plant after the city awarded them the contract in 2008. The new facility, Alinda noted, replaced an old plant owned by Santa Paula that had been violating state environmental regulations, saving the city from paying fines. But after years of raising sewer rates, partly to pay \u201cservice fees\u201d to Alinda, Santa Paula\u2019s thinking changed: It would be better for Santa Paula to issue its own debt to purchase the plant than to saddle citizens with annual rate increases. Now the town  \u2014   at the urging of its city manager, Jaime Fontes, and several council members, including Ginger Gherardi  \u2014   has started issuing rebates to citizens. Still, there will be bumps along the road. After all, cities like Missoula and Santa Paula are now responsible for running an important, and occasionally messy, public service. Soon after Santa Paula regained control of its sewer plant, an equipment failure let partly treated wastewater pour from the plant. The discharge turned a pond green and flowed onto a nearby organic farm. And wastewater, Mr. Fontes said, is \u201cnot the kind of organic you want. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562280.6903567}
