What has happened, of course, is that the Religious Right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. It\u2019s no wonder they feel in a fog . Metaphorically or physically, they\u2019re selling their souls. \\nWallnau claims \u201cThe left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of Christ who doesn\u2019t work together,\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma that America\u2019s in right now,\u201d even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the Religious Right has been organizing since Goldwater lost in \u201964 . \\nA hypocrite just can\u2019t catch a break, it seems: \\nThe web literally is coming down on America. And what\u2019s sad is, how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times? Do you feel that? It\u2019s almost like everything\u2019s going wrong. We don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the American culture and discipling the country. And that fog that\u2019s on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there\u2019s spirits being authorized to be released. \\nWherever there\u2019s agreement, there\u2019s power. The more unbelievers agree with the narrative that they\u2019re hearing, the more power and authorization Satan has to manifest. So unless the church has an exposure of what the enemy\u2019s doing and begins to agree together with a counter-strategy, we\u2019re going to deal with more and more fog. And the worst part is\u2014we don\u2019t have to surrender nations to the devil. \\nSo if you disagree with Wallnau, if you oppose Trump, it can only because you\u2019re manifesting the power of Satan (who in the Old Testament is God\u2019s lieutenant, not his adversary). So pick your Testament, I suppose. \\nLance Wallnau insists he is \u201cnot a big conspiracy theorist buff,\u201d but this doesn\u2019t do anything to convince us he\u2019s not some wack-a-doodle instead. This is nothing new, as a non-Christian being told that you represent a \u201cdevil\u201d you don\u2019t even believe exists. \\nThere are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize (or worse) their opponents. \\nWithout charges of Satanism and witchcraft, you don\u2019t have the genocide of European and Middle Eastern Paganism; you don\u2019t have anti-Jewish pogroms; and you don\u2019t have the Crusades or the Spanish Inquisition; you don\u2019t have witch-burnings. \\nWhat this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that we\u2019re not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. \\nNot only do they deal in a conspiracy-laden world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason \u2013 and let\u2019s go ahead and say sanity \u2013 do not. \\nLet\u2019s face it: Donald Trump\u2019s biggest enemy is not Satan, but Donald Trump himself. And Wallnau can claim \u201cbelievers have an edge\u201d all they want, but all the belief in the world won\u2019t overturn reality.'"}, "time": 1742628530.4890778}
