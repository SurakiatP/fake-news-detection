All over America, those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead, casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices. On October 31st, most people will simply ignore the dark side of Halloween. We can assure you however, that the Creator does NOT\u2026 \\n\\nFrom Michael Snyder, End of the American Dream : \\nThe vast majority of the population will dress up in costumes, go to parties and eat candy without ever even considering where the holiday came from or what certain people are doing behind closed doors. But the truth is that Halloween night is one of the biggest nights of the year for witches, occultists and Satanists. All over America, those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead, casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices. As you will see below, there is a reason why animal shelters across the country ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year. But even our \u201cinnocent\u201d Halloween traditions such as dressing up in costumes, \u201ctrick or treating\u201d and carving jack-o\u2019-lanterns all have their roots in ancient pagan practices. And every year the costumes for our young girls become even more sexually suggestive, the horror movies become even more demonic, and the public\u2019s fascination with the occult just continues to grow. It truly is a festival of death, but most people don\u2019t seem to care. In fact, experts are telling us that Halloween has now become America\u2019s second biggest holiday. \\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, nearly 70 percent of all Americans plan to celebrate Halloween this year, and spending is expected to shatter the all-time record\u2026 \\nAccording to the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics, total spending for Halloween is expected to reach $8.4 billion, an all-time high in the survey\u2019s 11-year history. \\nU.S. consumers are expected to spend an average of $82.93, up from last year\u2019s $74.34, with more than 171 million Americans planning to partake in Halloween festivities this year. \\nTo give you some context, total Halloween spending for 2009 came in at just 4.7 billion dollars. So to say that the celebration of Halloween is growing would be a tremendous understatement. \\nSadly, most people have no idea where this holiday originally came from. The truth is that a long time ago Catholicism attempted to \u201cChristianize\u201d an ancient pagan holiday known as Samhain\u2026 \\nThe origins of Halloween are Celtic in tradition and have to do with observing the end of summer sacrifices to gods in Druidic tradition. In what is now Britain and France, it was the beginning of the Celtic year, and they believed Samhain, the lord of death, sent evil spirits abroad to attack humans, who could escape only by assuming disguises and looking like evil spirits themselves. The waning of the sun and the approach of dark winter made the evil spirits rejoice and play nasty tricks. Believe it or not, most of our Halloween practices can be traced back to these old pagan rites and superstitions . \\nOn the Wiccan calendar, Samhain is one of the most important points on \u201cthe wheel of the year\u201d. Wiccans believe that it is the day when \u201cthe god dies\u201d, and subsequently they celebrate his rebirth at Yule. \\nIt is also a time when they believe that the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest, and so it is an opportune time for them to contact the dead. The following is much more on what Wiccans believe about Samhain from wicca.com\u2026 \\nSamhain, (pronounced SOW-in, SAH-vin, or SAM-hayne) means \u201cEnd of Summer\u201d, and is the third and final Harvest. The dark winter half of the year commences on this Sabbat. \\nIt is generally celebrated on October 31st, but some traditions prefer November 1st. It is one of the two \u201cspirit-nights\u201d each year, the other being Beltane. It is a magical interval when the mundane laws of time and space are temporarily suspended, and the Thin Veil between the worlds is lifted. Communicating with ancestors and departed loved ones is easy at this time, for they journey through this world on their way to the Summerlands. It is a time to study the Dark Mysteries and honor the Dark Mother and the Dark Father, symbolized by the Crone and her aged Consort. \\nOriginally the \u201cFeast of the Dead\u201d was celebrated in Celtic countries by leaving food offerings on altars and doorsteps for the \u201cwandering dead\u201d. Today a lot of practitioners still carry out that tradition. Single candles were lit and left in a window to help guide the spirits of ancestors and loved ones home. Extra chairs were set to the table and around the hearth for the unseen guest. Apples were buried along roadsides and paths for spirits who were lost or had no descendants to provide for them. Turnips were hollowed out and carved to look like protective spirits, for this was a night of magic and chaos. The Wee Folke became very active, pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans. Traveling after dark was was not advised. People dressed in white (like ghosts), wore disguises made of straw, or dressed as the opposite gender in order to fool the Nature spirits. \\nThe ancient practices described in those paragraphs sound very similar to what we do today in many ways, but without a doubt some of the traditions have evolved. For example, instead of carving turnips, those that celebrate Halloween carve pumpkins today. \\nYou may not realize this, but Wicca is actually one of the fastest growing religions in America. And on October 31st, Wiccans all over the nation will get together to conduct rituals and cast spells. Here is a blurb from Wikipedia about the Wiccan belief in \u201cmagic\u201d\u2026 \\nDuring ritual practices, which are often staged in a sacred circle, Wiccans cast spells or \u201cworkings\u201d intended to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing, for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences. [63] Many early Wiccans, such asAlex Sanders, Sybil Leek and Alex Winfield, referred to their own magic as \u201cwhite magic\u201c, which contrasted with \u201cblack magic\u201c, which they associated with evil and Satanism. Sanders also used the similar terminology of \u201cleft hand path\u201d to describe malevolent magic, and \u201cright hand path\u201d to describe magic performed with good intentions; [64] terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil. [65] \\nIf you are not familiar with these things, you may scoff at such practices. But the cold, hard reality of the matter is that they are very real. The dark side has power too, and those that have come out of witchcraft can tell you some stories that will stand your hair on end. \\nWiccans think of themselves as \u201cgood\u201d, and so they tend to reject blood sacrifices and things of that nature. \\nBut for those that are deeper into the occult, blood sacrifice is an essential part of Halloween. As I mentioned above, many animal shelters all over the nation ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year\u2026 It\u2019s the week of Halloween, and maybe you don\u2019t know this, but if you suddenly wanted to adopt a black cat, you would probably have a hard time. That\u2019s because thanks to their association with witchcraft, accepted wisdom holds that Halloween is a time when people ritualistically mutilate black cats. \\nTo test if this really was still accepted wisdom, I contacted some animal shelters near to our Los Angeles office, and they all told me they wouldn\u2019t let me adopt a black cat. One, The Lange Foundation\u2014the type of animal rescue that takes in cats from city shelters before they can be euthanized\u2014was willing to talk to me on the phone and explain: If someone were to call and ask specifically for a black cat, that would trigger the policy. \u201cI would say \u2018not today!\u2019\u201d said one of the foundation\u2019s board members, Diana Nelson. \\nYou may not want to believe it, but animals will be killed and little children will be abused on Halloween night. The following is what one ex-witch has sharedregarding her experiences\u2026 \\nMy parents told me before we went around the neighborhood we were going to go by the church (Mormon Church) to get some candy there. The church was very close to my grandmother\u2019s house, and I knew so from going often. \\nWe went to the church and what happened next made my blood curdle. I was given candy, but that was just a preclude to the sexual abuse that would happen in a satanic ritual. On Halloween Satanists use young children, such as myself, as sexual idols to worship. Other children receive a far worse fate. Death. I know for some this is more than you can even think to believe, but it is true. I can barely write these words because the pain of the truth is almost more than I can bear. If it wasn\u2019t for the grace and love of Jesus Christ, I would not even be here writing this at all. \\nYou may say \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that to me\u201d, but you are just fooling yourself. \\nCould you take a Satanic Black Mass and turn it into a celebration of Jesus? \\nOf course not. \\nAnd yet so many Christians fully embrace Halloween and pretend that there is nothing wrong with it. \\nFor the record, Satanists absolutely love Halloween. The following comes from the official Church of Satan website\u2026 \\nSatanists embrace what this holiday has become, and do not feel the need to be tied to ancient practices. This night, we smile at the amateur explorers of their own inner darkness, for we know that they enjoy their brief dip into the pool of the \u201cshadow world.\u201d We encourage their tenebrous fantasies, the candied indulgence, and the wide-ranging evocation of our aesthetics (while tolerating some of the chintzy versions), even if it is but once a year. For the rest of the time, when those not of our meta-tribe shake their heads in wonder at us, we can point out that they may find some understanding by examining their own All Hallows Eve doings, but we generally find it simpler to just say: \u201cThink of the Addams Family and you\u2019ll begin to see what we\u2019re about.\u201d \\nSatanists consider Halloween to be one of the most important \u201cholidays\u201d of the year. On page 96 of the Satanic Bible, Anton LaVey wrote the following\u2026 \\n\u201cAfter one\u2019s own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht (May 1st) and Halloween.\u201d \\nIsn\u2019t that lovely? \\nDespite all of this, most Christians in America will happily celebrate Halloween on October 31st. In fact, one recent survey found that just 8 percent of all Christian pastors want their congregations to skip the holiday altogether. Instead, most of them want their members to invite people to a \u201cChristian version of Halloween\u201d at their churches. The following comes from Charisma\u2026 \\nTwo-thirds (67 percent) encourage church members to invite friends and neighbors to a fall festival, trunk-or-treat or judgment house. Pastors at bigger churches (those with 250 or more in attendance) are most likely to ask church members to invite their neighbors (86 percent) to an event at the church. Those from small churches (50 or less in attendance) are least likely (48 percent). \\nIf the gospel is preached, I am all for people going to church on October 31st. But all too often these \u201calternative celebrations\u201d are nothing more than repackaged versions of the same Satanic holiday that the world is celebrating. I like how Pastor Jamie Morgan described what our approach to this day should be\u2026 \\nSetting aside a day to celebrate evil, darkness, witchcraft, fear, death and the demonic brings disdain to God. Period. A Christian celebrating Halloween would be like a Satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at Christmas while singing, \u201cHappy Birthday, Jesus!\u201d The two just don\u2019t go together. Jesus has nothing in common with Satan (2 Cor. 6:14), and neither should we. \\nAnd the truth is that God has wanted us to have nothing to do with occult practices from the very beginning. The following is what Deuteronomy 18:9-13 says in the Modern English version\u2026 \\n9 When you enter into the land which the Lord your God gives you, you must not learn to practice the abominations of those nations . 10 There must not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or who uses divination , or uses witchcraft , or an interpreter of omens, or a sorcerer , 11 or one who casts spells , or a spiritualist , or an occultist , or a necromancer . 12 For all that do these things are an abomination to the Lord , and because of these abominations the Lord your God will drive them out from before you. 13 You must be blameless before the Lord your God. \\nThere will be many people that will read this article and will continue to celebrate Halloween just as they normally do. If that is you, then you need to understand that engaging in dark practices can open up doors to spiritual darkness for yourself and your entire family. \\nIf you do that, then that is your choice, but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.'"}, "time": 1742563119.9565213}
