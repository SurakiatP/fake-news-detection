Image Credit: WikiLeaks \\nClinton aide Maya Harris appeared to clear things up within the email thread by noting, \u201cEric Garner not included because he was not killed by gun violence.\u201d (Garner died in police custody after being placed in a \u201cchoke hold.\u201d) Image Credit: WikiLeaks \\nBut if the Clinton campaign thought it had \u201can Erica Garner problem\u201d before the emails were leaked, their problems multiplied when she caught wind of the things they had said: What are they talking about here? https://t.co/tgQH2VxuHZ \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 What really pisses me off is that the Clinton camp won\\'t just admit these emails belong to them... Fucking liars. \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 These people will co opt anything to push their agenda. Police violence is not the same as gun violence. \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 I\\'m vey interested to know exactly what @CoreyCiorciari meant when he said \" I know we have an Erica Garner problem\" in the #PodestaEmails19 \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 Wouldnt yall like to know why the #Hillary campaign thought that I my objecting to them exploiting my dads death was a \"problem\" @mtaibbi https://t.co/i5cahlS6VZ \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 I\\'m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed \"using\" Eric Garner ... Why would you want to \"use\" my dad? \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nShe thanked aide Maya Harris for setting everyone straight: I\\'m glad you had Maya on your team to explain why you wont be USING my dad in you fucking gun violence piece... Black woman saved your ass \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nThen she blew the lid off the Clinton agenda: https://t.co/jzfUl0FbXF In this #PodestaEmails leak @CoreyCiorciari n @NickMerrill plot to use police violence victims to push gun control \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nAnd blasted Podesta personally for his position regarding her father\\'s death: Personelle equals policy @johnpodesta said that Eric Garner\\'s killing was justified . And this is who we want to hold our nose and vote for? https://t.co/5nWnjxA7Nq \u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nGarner has been active in the continuing investigation into the NYPD officers who were involved in her father\\'s death. \\nAlthough she has not endorsed a presidential candidate since Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders left the race, she has retweeted tweets by the Green Party\\'s Jill Stein, which were critical of the Clinton campaign.
