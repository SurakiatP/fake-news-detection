[In this week\u2019s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie questions why lawmakers can\u2019t seem to get the three things Americans want most  \u2014   health care, tax reform and the continuing resolution  \u2014   passed once and for all.  \u201cI could see where it\u2019s impossible to climb two mountains at the same time, or drive two cars at the same time, or dance with two elephants at the same time,\u201d Jackie says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t pass three resolutions at the same time? How long does it take?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s assume somebody said it was a fundraiser, are you coming? Yes or no? Would you be able to answer them? What if they told you there\u2019s two fundraisers, or four fundraisers?\u201d Jackie challenges. \u201cWould you say you have no time to do all of them? You would have time to do ten thousand of them. But as soon as a vote is involved, which takes a second, you have no time. \u201d Jackie also wonders about the qualifications needed to become a congressman. \u201cIf you want to become a barber, you know there\u2019s a state test to become a barber? In other words, in this country, they protect you from a bad haircut, but if you want to run the country, they\u2019ll take any schmuck in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cEven a plumber has to take a state test,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhy do you think the toilets in this country are working perfectly, but the government is full of  \u2026     you know what I\u2019m talking about. \u201d Sadly, Jackie says things will never change because lawmakers make the same amount of money whether the country is running or not. And despite all the fear of a government shutdown, Jackie thinks it could actually be a good thing. Check out the video above to see why.
