This of course closely mirrors recent Pentagon talk of wars in the decades to come. \\nThe timing of his calls for extreme US bellicosity are centered on trying to influence the upcoming US election in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has campaigned heavily on picking fights in Syria and against Russia. Rasmussen underscored this fact by declaring Donald Trump, who openly said the US cannot be the world\u2019s police, as \u201cvery dangerous for the world.\u201d  \""}, "time": 1742562960.0164502}
