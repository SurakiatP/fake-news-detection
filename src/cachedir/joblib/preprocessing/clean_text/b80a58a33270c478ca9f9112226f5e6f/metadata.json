In the latest inexcusable enforcement of an antiquated law, 76-year-old disabled veteran Lee Carroll Brooker will live out what should be his golden years behind bars \u2014 for simple possession of cannabis. \\nBrooker had been treating multiple chronic conditions with cannabis he grew in his son\u2019s backyard; but when officials in Alabama officials discovered the three dozen plants, they threw him in prison for life \u2014 without the possibility of parole. \\nThanks to a pointless mandatory minimum sentencing catchall \u2014 and the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to hear his case this week \u2014 Brooker has been left little recourse but to ultimately die in jail for treating his ailments with a plant. \\n\u201cAlabama, like three other states, mandates a life without parole sentence for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana by people with certain prior felony convictions \u2014 and Mr. Brooker had been convicted of a string of robberies twenty years earlier in Florida, crimes for which he served ten years in prison,\u201d The New York Times explained . \u201cIn such a case, the law doesn\u2019t require prosecutors to prove any intent to sell the drug.\u201d \\nEssentially, Brooker has been imprisoned twice for the same crime \u2014 because he sought relief from nature instead of arguably dangerous, legal and often lethal pharmaceuticals, courtesy of Big Pharma. Worse, Alabama\u2019s already irrational law sets the cutoff in a case like this at 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram), and Brooker\u2019s plants weighed just 2.8 pounds \u2014 but that included unusable parts, like stalks and leaves. \\nMake no mistake \u2014 this is an unjust law, an unjust conviction, and a ridiculous capitulation by the Supreme Court to Alabama\u2019s archaic notion a nonviolent offense should somehow land a vet behind bars for life and separate him from his medicine \u2014 as if law were an inflexible monster to be beholden to, no matter its worth. \\nIn fact, as the Times pointed out, \u201c[W]hile the sentence was mandatory, the prosecutor was not required to bring the precise charges that triggered it. Prosecutorial discretion here, as in most cases, is a central factor in determining what punishment defendants face.\u201d \\nIn other words, the prosecutor railroaded Brooker over his personal, medicinal plants \u2014 by choice. Brooker, who joined the U.S. Army at age 17 and came under fire in both Lebanon and the Dominican Republic, eventually rose to the rank of sergeant in the 82nd Airborne \u2014 where he was decorated for infantry service. \\nVox reported that even \u201cnotoriously conservative\u201d Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore characterized Brooker\u2019s sentence as \u201cexcessive and unjustified.\u201d And according to the Times , the judge deciding the vet\u2019s fate would have preferred to hand down a lighter sentence, but once the charges had been brought as they were, he was obligated to enforce the letter of the law. \\nYes, this disabled man technically broke the law; but proffering such a rebuttal rings hollow, if not cold, considering the majority of Americans support cannabis legalization. Legality does not dictate morality. \\nA growing segment of officials and public figures do, as well, as The Free Thought Project reported recently , more than 1,000 police, world leaders, celebrities, and others signed a letter calling to summarily end the disastrous war on drugs. \\nIn fact, though little comfort to Brooker now, the Drug Enforcement Agency will likely downgrade cannabis from its inexplicable Schedule 1 classification to Schedule 2 \u2014 as early as July of this year. Note that while a plethora of viable arguments can be asserted for rescheduling, considering states with laws like Alabama\u2019s \u2014 and cases like Brooker\u2019s \u2014 the slight concession by federal law would make a comparative, whopping difference. \\nBrooker attempted to bring his case before the highest court in the land as an inarguable violation of the Constitution\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment \u2014 to no avail. The court\u2019s stonewall, in itself, could be considered as much \u2014 in an increasing number of states, Brooker\u2019s so-called crime would have been perfectly legal. \\nFor now, though, it appears the 76-year-old will suffer the consequences of bad policy, unjustifiable law, and the cruelty of ostensible authority figures who were all just doing their jobs. \\nGoogle + Harry Houston \\nThis is a MOTION FOR DISMISSAL that has worked in the NJ court system BROUGHT TO YOU BY NJWEEDMAN.
