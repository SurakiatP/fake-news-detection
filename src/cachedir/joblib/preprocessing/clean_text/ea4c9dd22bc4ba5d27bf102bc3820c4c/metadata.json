People in Federal investigations have gone to jail for much lower acts of dishonesty and deception . \\nThe rebooted FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails was spurred by emails turned up during the Anthony Weiner sexting investigation. Those emails that Huma Abedin swore she gave up . \\nBut the new information that the FBI found State Department-related email on her home laptop also calls into question whether Abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at State. \\nOn June 28, 2016, Abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the State Department. (These records were subsequently reviewed by the FBI.) \\n\u201cHow did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?\u201d Attorney Ramona Cotca for Judicial Watch asked her. \\n\u201cI looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned \u2014 returned \u2014 gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents.
