One case, Buck v. Stephens, No.   arose from a psychologist\u2019s testimony that black defendants were more dangerous than white ones. The case concerns Duane Buck, who was convicted of the 1995 murders of a former girlfriend and one of her friends while her young children watched. Texas law allows death sentences only if prosecutors can show the defendant poses a future danger to society. During the trial\u2019s sentencing phase, Mr. Buck\u2019s lawyer presented testimony from the psychologist, Walter Quijano, who said that race was one of the factors associated with future dangerousness. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad commentary that minorities, Hispanics and black people, are overrepresented in the criminal justice system,\u201d Dr. Quijano testified. A prosecutor followed up. \u201cThe race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons  \u2014   is that correct?\u201d Dr. Quijano answered, \u201cYes. \u201d One of Mr. Buck\u2019s trial lawyers, Jerry Guerinot, has a dismal record in death penalty cases, having represented 20 people sentenced to death in Texas, more than are awaiting execution in about half of the states that have the death penalty. In their petition seeking Supreme Court review, Mr. Buck\u2019s new lawyers said that his trial lawyers had been ineffective and that Mr. Buck\u2019s death sentence was infected by racial bias. \u201cLeft uncorrected, trial counsel\u2019s injection of explicit racial discrimination into Mr. Buck\u2019s capital sentencing profoundly undermines confidence in the integrity of both Mr. Buck\u2019s death sentence and the criminal justice system over all,\u201d Mr. Buck\u2019s lawyers told the justices. The cases will be argued during the court\u2019s next term, which starts in October. In turning down an earlier appeal from Mr. Buck in 2011 based on assertions of prosecutorial misconduct, five justices expressed misgivings about what had happened at his trial. Calling Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony \u201cbizarre and objectionable,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen G. Breyer, indicated that there were serious questions about the conduct of Mr. Buck\u2019s own lawyers. \u201cDr. Quijano\u2019s testimony would provide a basis for reversal of petitioner\u2019s sentence if the prosecution were responsible for presenting that testimony to the jury,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. \u201cBut Dr. Quijano was a defense witness, and it was petitioner\u2019s attorney, not the prosecutor, who first elicited Dr. Quijano\u2019s view regarding the correlation between race and future dangerousness. \u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, said she would have voted to hear the case even as a challenge to prosecutorial misconduct. She noted that in 2000 the state\u2019s attorney general, John Cornyn, had seemed to promise to allow new sentencings for several inmates, including Mr. Buck, who had been sent to death row based in part on Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony. Texas prosecutors now say Mr. Buck\u2019s appeal is barred on procedural grounds. The justices also agreed on Monday to hear an appeal from Bobby J. Moore, who has been on death row since 1980 for fatally shooting a    Houston supermarket clerk, James McCarble, during a robbery. That case, Moore v. Texas, No.   raises questions about whether Texas uses outdated standards in assessing whether a defendant\u2019s intellectual disability was severe enough to bar his execution. When the court ruled in 2002 in Atkins v. Virginia that the Constitution forbade the execution of people with mental disabilities, it gave states only general guidance. It said a finding of intellectual disability required proof of three things: \u201csubaverage intellectual functioning,\u201d meaning low I. Q. scores a lack of fundamental social and practical skills and the presence of both conditions before age 18. The court said I. Q. scores under \u201capproximately 70\u201d typically indicated disability. In 2014, in Hall v. Florida, though, the court ruled that Florida\u2019s I. Q. score cutoff was too rigid to decide which mentally disabled individuals must be spared the death penalty. \u201cFlorida seeks to execute a man because he scored a 71 instead of 70 on an I. Q. test,\u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority in a    decision. In Mr. Moore\u2019s case, a trial court found that he was intellectually disabled and constitutionally ineligible for the death penalty. An appeals court reversed that decision, saying the lower court had erred by \u201cemploying the definition of intellectual disability presently used. \u201d The appeals court ruled that a    standard applied instead and that, under it, Mr. Moore was not intellectually disabled. When the Supreme Court announced on Monday morning that it would hear Mr. Moore\u2019s case, it said the justices would also consider a second question: whether executing a condemned inmate more than 35 years after he was sentenced to death violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Some two hours later, the court issued a revised order, limiting its review to the   issue. Two members of the court, Justices Kennedy and Breyer, have invited challenges to prolonged solitary confinement. \u201cYears on end of near total isolation exact a terrible price,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote, for instance, in a concurrence last year, adding that \u201cthe condition in which prisoners are kept simply has not been a matter of sufficient public inquiry or interest. \u201d The two justices will now have to await another case. The court also agreed to hear an appeal in a gerrymandering challenge to Virginia\u2019s legislative map,   v. Virginia Board of Elections, No.  . That case will also be argued in the next term.'"}, "time": 1742628546.0865762}
