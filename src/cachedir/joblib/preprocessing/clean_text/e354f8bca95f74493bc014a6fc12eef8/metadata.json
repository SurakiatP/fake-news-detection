These blunt patriots weren\u2019t messing around, and they sent a clear message to our lame duck president, who didn\u2019t like it at all. \\nThe leader of the free world hasn\u2019t done much in his two terms of trying, and he\u2019s not about to start now on his way out of office. He has taken the liberty of awarding himself substantial tee time, only reserving his efforts and energy to promote who he hopes to be his successor, Hillary Clinton. As annoying at it is to watch him do nothing, it\u2019s worse to see him take a side to campaign with one candidate while slandering the other, which Donald Trump\u2019s supporters have noticed and are fed-up over it. \\nThere\u2019s a war happening on our own soil, between sharply divided citizens who are sick of seeing democracy destroyed during this election. While Hillary has everyone from the mainstream media to our president in her pantsuit pocket, patriots are expected to just accept it, along with the skewed results \u2014 and don\u2019t want to pay a single dime for our president to spit in our faces any longer as he promotes Hillary on our hard-earned tax money. \\nA petition started on StandUnited has received 41,000 signatures from frustrated patriots who are asking Congress to stop paying our president as he plays favorites in campaigning for Hillary. \u201c We the People demand that Congress withhold President Obama\u2019s salary, pension, travel expenses, etc. for any time he spends actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton between now and the election in November,\u201d the petition on conservative site states. \\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for the current president to endorse a candidate on their way out of the White House, \u201cRarely, however, does that same lame duck President spend weeks or even months prior to the November election actively campaigning for his successor,\u201d the petition laments. \\nConsidering Obama\u2019s salary of about $400,000 a year and the cost of Air Force One at $180,000 for every single hour of flight, the amount he\u2019s siphoning from an already strained budget for a candidate that a mass amount of Americans don\u2019t want in office is astronomical and insulting. Congress probably doesn\u2019t even care about the cash or true conservatives and their petition, since the establishment is for keeping things how they want it at the cost of this Republican candidate who could better the country with change we need.'"}, "time": 1742561725.9633775}
