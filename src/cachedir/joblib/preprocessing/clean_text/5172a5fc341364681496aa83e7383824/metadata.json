Band did not respond to request for comment. \\nIn November 2011, according to the memo, the telecommunications company Ericsson agreed to give Bill Clinton $400,000 in private plane travel. The company also paid the former president an additional $750,000 to speak at its conference that month in Hong Kong. \\nIt was the largest speaking fee Bill Clinton had received up until that point, and with the added plane fare, the payment reached well over $1 million. \\nAlthough Hillary Clinton reported in her disclosure filings that her husband received a $750,000 honorarium for the speech, she did not disclose the additional $400,000 in private plane expenses from Ericsson in the spousal income or gifts and reimbursements sections . \\nIn another Nov. 17, 2011 email, Band complained that Bill Clinton was not required to submit an internal conflict-of-interest disclosure form \u2013 unlike other top officials at the Clinton Global Initiative \u2013 despite the fact that the former president received \u2018expensive gifts\u2019 for his home from CGI sponsors . Bill Clinton and Doug Band \\nBill Clinton \u2018does not have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by 3 CGI sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc,\u2019 wrote Band. \\nHillary Clinton did not disclose any gift or travel expenses that she or her husband received while at the State Department. The federal disclosure form requires officials to report gifts to themselves or a spouse totalling more than $350 from a single source, such as \u2018tangible items, transportation, lodging, food, or entertainment\u2019 and \u2018travel-related cash reimbursements.\u2019 \\nHowever, a federal official does not have to disclose gifts to a spouse that are \u2018totally independent of their relationship\u2019 \u2013 for example, business-related benefits that a spouse receives from his employer. While many of the companies involved in CGI and Bill Clinton\u2019s for-profit business had interests before the State Department, government ethics experts said it can be difficult to determine whether a gift to a public official\u2019s spouse is connected to their relationship . \\nIt is also unclear whether Hillary Clinton travelled on any of these \u2018personal trips\u2019 and \u2018in-kind vacations,\u2019 which Band wrote were given to Bill Clinton\u2019s \u2018family.\u2019 The Clintons have a 36-year-old daughter, Chelsea, who is also involved in the Clinton Foundation. \\nA spokesperson for Clinton\u2019s campaign did not respond to request for comment. \\nAccording to the National Legal and Policy Center, a government watchdog group, failure to report certain gifts in a financial disclosure form could violate the Ethics in Government Act or the Federal False Statements Act. \\nFederal laws \u2018require full disclosure of such expensive gifts and reimbursements when special interests use a spouse to target a government official,\u2019 said Ken Boehm, chairman of the NLPC. \\n\u2018The just-disclosed emails of Clinton associate Doug Band that Bill Clinton and his family members benefitted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in free travel and gifts from special interests while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State raises substantial ethical and legal issues because the Financial Disclosure reports filed by Secretary Clinton does not show these expensive gifts and reimbursements,\u2019 said Boehm. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742628502.7280128}
