Craig Burke, the publicity director at Penguin USA, said that the publisher had ordered 75, 000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a big bump in sales,\u201d Mr. Burke said. He added that the rise \u201cstarted over the weekend and hit hyperactive\u201d on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Since Friday, the book has reached a 9, 500 percent increase in sales, he said. He said demand began to lift on Sunday, shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, gave on \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that Mr. Trump had attracted the \u201clargest audience ever to witness an inauguration,\u201d Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of \u201c1984. \u201d When asked on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false, Ms. Conway replied airily, \u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. \u201d Mr. Spicer, she said, \u201cgave alternative facts. \u201d In the novel, the term \u201cnewspeak\u201d refers to language in which independent thought, or \u201cunorthodox\u201d political ideas, have been eliminated. \u201cDoublethink\u201d is defined as \u201creality control. \u201d On social media and elsewhere on Sunday, the book\u2019s readers made a connection between Ms. Conway\u2019s comments and Orwell\u2019s language, and the attention on the book \u201ckind of took a life of its own,\u201d Mr. Burke said. The dictionary publisher   described the interview as \u201cfraught with epistemological tension. \u201d The dictionary also reported that searches for the word \u201cfact\u201d spiked after Ms. Conway\u2019s comments, and then, as an apparent reminder, tweeted the dictionary\u2019s definition. Even outside the United States, interest in \u201c1984\u201d has grown. So far this year, sales have risen by 20 percent in Britain and Australia compared to the same period a year ago, according to Jess Harrison, a   editor at Penguin Books. The novel is usually a   she said, and it sold 100, 000 copies last year in   countries outside the United States and Canada. \u201cBut we\u2019ve definitely seen an uplift\u201d in sales, she added. Dystopian novels are \u201cchiming with people,\u201d Ms. Harrison said, adding that \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d by Philip K. Dick, an alternative history in which the Nazis defeated America to win World War II, is also selling well. A television series based on Mr. Dick\u2019s novel is now in its second season at Amazon. Penguin also published Sinclair Lewis\u2019s \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here,\u201d about the rise of a demagogue, last Friday in Britain for the first time since 1935, \u201cand we\u2019re already on to our third printing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. On Wednesday, that book was also ranking among Amazon\u2019s best sellers, as was Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d another dystopian classic. Prof. Stefan Collini, a professor of intellectual history and an expert on Orwell at the University of Cambridge, said that readers see a natural parallel between the book and the way Mr. Trump and his staff have distorted facts. \u201cEveryone remembers \u20181984\u2019 as containing various parodies of official distortions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of unreality that is propagated as reality is what people feel reminded of, and that\u2019s why they keep coming back. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564300.2426116}
