[Gorka, who followed Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog and World Jewish Congress president Ronald S. Lauder, was interviewed onstage by the Post\u2018s    Yaakov Katz.  Katz did not waste time before jumping into the most controversial issues, questioning Gorka about rumors  \u2014   spread largely by   blogs and websites  \u2014   of his membership in an   Hungarian order. Gorka denied those reports, noting his father\u2019s efforts to protect Jews from the Nazis, and his own lifelong struggle against totalitarian ideologies. He noted that he was \u201cproud\u201d to wear a medal his father had won from the   Vitezi Rend order for his anticommunist activism, adding that the new order had nothing to do with its   predecessor, which was disbanded after the Second World War. At the @Jerusalem_Post #Jpost17 conference @SebGorka \u201cI have spent my life fighting against totalitarian ideologies\u201dhttps:  .   \u2014   Seth Frantzman (@sfrantzman) May 7, 2017,  Gorka pointed out that Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, had honored one of the members of the Vitezi Rend as one of the \u201cRighteous Among the Nations\u201d for saving Jews during the Holocaust. And he noted that he had long been an advocate for Jews and for Israel, noting that even those publications that had set out to destroy him found no evidence of any antisemitic statements. In addition Gorka dismissed reports that he was leaving the administration as \u201cvery fake news,\u201d and downplayed media speculation about infighting in the White House, describing all of the different advisers to the president as \u201cpatriots. \u201d Tragic that a decent man has to respond to such libel. Crowd here at #jpost17 seemed to appreciate that  gave @SebGorka a standing ovation. https:  .   \u2014   Jeff Ballabon (@ballabon) May 7, 2017, From there, the discussion moved into foreign policy, with Gorka emphasizing the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security, as well as to the peace process. He also defended the administration\u2019s tough line on radical Islam, criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for avoiding the religious inspiration of terrorists and for \u201cleading from behind\u201d  \u2014   which, he noted, was \u201cfollowing,\u201d in plain English. Asked whether he, and the administration as a whole, were Islamophobic, Gorka pointed out that many of the U. S. military personnel he had instructed in   were Muslims, and noted that America\u2019s Arab allies saw the struggle as one within Islam, not against Islam as a whole. He stressed the importance of helping Muslims win the war against radical Islamic terror, but without invading and occupying foreign countries. #Gorka: Trump understands the Islamic terror threat and he will obliterate it. #Jpost17,  \u2014   David Brinn (@davidbjpost) May 7, 2017,   He noted that many of the administration\u2019s toughest critics were people aligned with the   \u201cboycott, divestment, and sanctions\u201d (BDS) movement, as well as supporters of the Iran deal. Gorka\u2019s critics seemed mostly reduced to fuming at the Jerusalem Post on Twitter. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
