The Australian Electoral Commission has forecast that the coalition could win a combined 76 seats, which would give it an absolute majority in the   House of Representatives. Two independent members of the House have also pledged their support to the coalition, solidifying its chances of forming a government. \u201cIt is clear Mr. Turnbull and his coalition will form a government,\u201d Bill Shorten, the Labor Party leader, said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. \u201cI hope they run a good government. \u201d After an   election campaign that ended July 2, neither the Labor Party nor the conservative coalition, which defeated the Labor government in the last national election in 2013, wanted to concede defeat amid uncertainty over whether either side would win a critical number of seats. The Labor Party is forecast to take 69 seats in the House. The Greens are forecast to have won one, other parties, including independents, four. The electoral commission is expected to give the final results of the election around Friday. In government, the coalition will have to deal with a fractious upper house, the Senate. The balance of power in the Senate is likely to be held by a diverse group of   and   independents and minority parties that may block legislation passed in the House. As a result, some political analysts said they expected another national election to be called by the coalition before its latest   term ends. \u201cIt is vital this Parliament work,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.'"}, "time": 1742563864.0809495}
