But it wasn\u2019t. The Clinton campaign, who really liked the FBI during their first go-round , had the audacity to say now that the FBI has double standards. \u201cIt is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. He also called on Mr Comey to \u201cimmediately explain this incongruence and apply the same standard to Donald Trump\u2019s associates as he has applied to Hillary Clinton\u2019s.\u201d ( source ) BWHAHAHA. LOL. ROTFL. Excuse me, I can\u2019t stop laughing\u2026a nervous, manic kind of laughter that also makes one of my eyes twitch. Why? This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to pull in young voters and calling them \u201cF*&$ing dumb\u201d behind their backs. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to connect with the American people at the same time as saying she has no clue about real life due to her background. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who preaches honesty and integrity and practices neither, saying in a paid speech that sometimes you have to lie. I have never heard a more ridiculous, two-faced audacious comment in my whole life. And considering I write about politics, I\u2019ve heard a lot over the years. Speaking of double standards, did you hear the latest about the re-opened email investigation? The incestuous connection between the Clinton campaign and the Department of Justice continues. The person in charge of the new investigation is none other than Peter Kadzik. Kadzik has a long history with both the Clinton family and campaign manager John Podesta. Podesta wrote \u201c The Power of Progress\u201d in 2008, in which he outlined his plan to save the world. And by longtime connections, I mean\u2026 Kadzik represented John Podesta after he perjured himself during the Monica Lewinsky case Kadzik lobbied for Marc Rich, a fugitive that was pardoned by then-President Bill Clinton Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch as Attorney General Kadzik had a celebratory dinner with Podesta the day after the Benghazi hearings Kadzik denied a request from Republicans to appoint special counsel in the last Clinton email investigation Kadzik and Podesta appear from Wikileaks to be the best of friends, celebrating birthdays and other occasions together Those are some of the links between Kadzik and Clintonland \u2013 check out this very thorough report on Zero Hedge for all of the details. Can you imagine the hue and cry if Donald Trump\u2019s nearest and dearest ran the investigation about his alleged links with Russia? How is this possibly okay? Open letter to Peter Kadzik After stumbling across Kadzik\u2019s email address in an online group (by the way, it\u2019s [email protected] \u2013 don\u2019t they every learn about email security?) I sent this very polite email suggesting that he recuse himself from the investigation. Dear Mr. Kadzik: When I learned that you were to be the person in charge of the investigation into Huma Abedin and her emails, I was curious to learn about your connections. With just a teeny tiny bit of Googling, I was aghast to discover that you have a close friendship with John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager.I was further discomfited by the fact that you have direct connections with the Obamas and the Clintons themselves. While I\u2019m sure you take your job very seriously, it seems to me a direct conflict of interest for you to handle this investigation. I strongly urge you to do the right thing and recuse yourself from overseeing this investigation. If you find the emails without merit, there was always be a cloud over your findings due to your close connections with the Clintons, President Obama, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Please hand this over to independent investigators who can do this job without the appearance of bias. Sincerely, Daisy Luther Surprisingly, I\u2019ve had no response to my courteous request. He\u2019s probably out there busily finding a non-biased replacement. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review'"}, "time": 1742628465.7233176}
