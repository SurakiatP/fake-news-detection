The office will reportedly be staffed by former business leaders and will report directly to President Trump. Among the notable names in the business world who have already participated in meetings are Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. \u201cWe should have excellence in government,\u201d Kushner told the Post last month. \u201cThe government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens. \u201d Raffel will reportedly move to Washington, D. C. to begin his new job in the coming weeks. He will be replaced at Blumhouse by former Universal Filmed Entertainment Group spokeswoman Teri Everett.
