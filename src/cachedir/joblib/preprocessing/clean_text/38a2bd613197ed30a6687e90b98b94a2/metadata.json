[In a Facebook post, MILO said that he had been granted more time from his publisher, Simon  Schuster, to submit a manuscript of the book in order to \u201cinclude material about the craziness and rioting at UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UW Seattle. \u201d  \u201cIt would be absurd for me to publish a book without some discussion of the insanity of the last few weeks,\u201d he continued. Violent protests outside all three universities saw unprecedented   violence, attracting shock around the world. Rioters vandalized university buildings, started several fires, and beat and pepper sprayed journalists and Trump supporters. One individual was taken to hospital in critical condition from a gunshot wound. The $250, 000 book deal, which was announced in December, caused widespread outrage from   activists who argued Simon  Schuster should not publish \u201chate speech. \u201d For example, the Chicago Review of Books confirmed they would boycott reviews of any books published by Simon and Schuster in 2017, whilst women\u2019s lifestyle magazine ELLE published a column claiming it would \u201cendanger human lives. \u201d Meanwhile, \u201cBad Feminist\u201d author Roxane Gay confirmed she was canceling her own book deal with the publishers in protest at MILO\u2019s own book deal. As a result of the backlash, the book has twice reached the top of the Amazon bestseller list and is one of the most anticipated books of 2017. The book will now be released June 13th, rather than the original date of March 14th. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742628561.5602858}
