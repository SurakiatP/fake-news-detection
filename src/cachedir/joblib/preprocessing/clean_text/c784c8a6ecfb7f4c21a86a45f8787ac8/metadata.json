To me, the real issue is not that Hillary endangered national security by sending classified information in the clear. No \u2013 the real issue is that the Clintons act as if they are above the rules and laws that apply to \u201cthe little people.\u201d They are superior and smug, totally devoted to themselves and their pursuit of power and the privileges that come with it. It\u2019s a matter of character, in other words. Hillary\u2019s evasiveness, her lack of transparency, her self-righteousness, her strong sense of her own rectitude, make her a dangerous candidate for the presidency.\\nMy second point is this: The issue of classification should be turned on its head. The real issue is not that Hillary potentially revealed secrets. No \u2013 the real issue is that our government keeps far too much from us. Our government uses security classification not so much to keep us safe, but to keep the national security state safe \u2013 safe from the eyes of the American people.\\n\\nAs The Guardian reported in 2013 :\\n\u201cA committee established by Congress, the Public Interest Declassification Board, warned in December that rampant over-classification is \u2018imped[ing] informed government decisions and an informed public\u2019 and, worse, \u2018enabl[ing] corruption and malfeasance\u2019. In one instance it documented, a government agency was found to be classifying one petabyte of new data every 18 months, the equivalent of 20m filing cabinets filled with text.\u201d\\nNowadays, seemingly everything is classified. And if it\u2019s classified, if it\u2019s secret, we can\u2019t know about it. Because we can\u2019t be trusted with it. That\u2019s a fine idea for an autocracy or dictatorship, but not so fine for a democracy.\\nGovernment of the people, by the people, for the people? Impossible when nearly everything of any importance is classified.\\nToo bad Hillary didn\u2019t send everything in the clear \u2013 what a service she would have done for the American people and for democracy!\\nWilliam J.
