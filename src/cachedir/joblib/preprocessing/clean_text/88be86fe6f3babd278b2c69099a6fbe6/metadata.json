There\u2019s not a day goes by that we all don\u2019t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. \u201d  Judd was asked about his prior comments that illegal immigrants committing felonies are an \u201cepidemic. \u201d He said, \u201cIt is at that level across the United States. There\u2019s not a day goes by that we all don\u2019t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. And they\u2019re committing felonies, violent felonies, and they\u2019re trafficking in narcotics. And if that\u2019s not enough, we deport them, they come back, and pick up doing the same thing again. \u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a total[ly] different attitude by Immigration and Customs already. And what we have to do is pick them up, keep them locked up until they\u2019re deported to their home country of origin. And I can tell you this, the community will be safer, less drugs will flow on our streets, and there will be less weapons violence. Every day my detectives go out, and they seek out and arrest people for violating the drug laws. Many of those folks are illegal aliens, here, with guns, posing a specific danger to our deputies, to our law enforcement officers, and to the community. But I have a simple question for those who think there\u2019s a problem with that: Why don\u2019t you take them home with you? Why don\u2019t you rent them a home next door to you? Because you know they\u2019re living next door to somebody in our community, and they\u2019re terrorizing them. \u201d Judd also stated that he didn\u2019t think what he proposed would result in economic losses, and \u201cThe people we arrest, they\u2019re not harvesting any vegetables, or any citrus. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561706.3525136}
