Just the fact that they see the short-term loan industry as \u201cdirty\u201d supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative. \\nInstead of pointing fingers and name calling at the short-term lending industry, they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water. \\nIn \u201cUnderstanding the CFPB Proposal for Payday and Other Small Loans,\u201d a paper released by the CFPB and PEW Charitable Trusts, the Bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation. \\nThe first of its arguments is that, \u201cwith payday and vehicle title loan markets, lenders\u2019 and borrowers\u2019 interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers.\u201d But doesn\u2019t this argument stand for any industry that sells a product? \\nFor example, are the interests of iPhone sellers and buyers \u201caligned\u201d in the manner acceptable to the CFPB? Each additional iPhone 6 is said to cost $200.10 to produce and is sold for $699 dollars. That is 3 times its cost to make. To borrow a phrase from the left, that\u2019s \u201cprice-gouging\u201d to the tune of 300 percent. Yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call Apple a company that cheats its customers. \\nSo why should short-term lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than Apple? Shouldn\u2019t short-term lenders be able to charge interest rates that make-up for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to low-income borrowers? \\nStudies show these lenders charge on average 15 percent, or $15 for every $100 loaned \u2014 a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets. \\nThe second of the CFPB\u2019s arguments is that to solve for \u201cballoon payments,\u201d or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans, the CFPB would \u201crequire that most products become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.\u201d \\nThe problem with this statement is that the Bureau completely ignores the reason why short-term loans are so available to borrowers \u2014 it\u2019s because short-term loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow. \\nSimply put, the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow. Additionally, making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model, making short-term lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency. \\nThe third of the CFPB\u2019s arguments is that their proposal would solve the \u201cproblems\u201d related to \u201cprice gouge lending\u201d by requiring \u201clenders to evaluate borrowers\u2019 financial condition,\u201d by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income, housing expenses, all outstanding debt, and child support. Meanwhile, the lender is required to obtain a national credit report, and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies. \\nRemember: all of these government-imposed requirements cost the short-term lenders money. The cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates. The result would either lead short-term loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans. \\nLastly, the CFPB heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 survey research that the \u201cvast majority of borrowers want \u2026 most products [to] become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.\u201d \\nAt first glance, it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation. Although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance (due to the risk of short-term loans), many of those \u201csurveyed\u201d actually sent in raving reviews in support of short-term loans. \\nIn fact, more than 98 percent of the 12,308 submissions to the Bureau\u2019s \u201c Tell Your Story \u201d program \u2014 where people sent in their experiences regarding short-term loans \u2014 were positive and excessively thankful for these loans. \\nThese responses ranged from, \u201cthere are no other avenues out there that can lend money like [this],\u201d to a simple \u201cthank you.\u201d This study was personally conducted by the CFPB. Unsatisfied with the results, they hid it from the public\u2019s view until a Freedom of Information Act request forced them to release it. \\nThis holding back of information demonstrates that the Bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help. Rather, they have a keen eye for policy symbolism, and the flash of \u201cfighting for the underdog\u201d when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back. \\nPolicymakers continue the belief that short-term loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college, or they simply want to be perceived as \u201csomeone who cares.\u201d But we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals. We cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt. Instead, we need to look at the cold-hard facts: the numbers that the CFPB uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false. \\nThe Small Dollar Lending Rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back \u2014 it will only hurt the people it claims it will help. Let Americans make decisions for themselves \u2014 they\u2019re smarter and more risk-averse than Washington insiders give them credit for. \\nJonathan Lee is a filmmaker and freelance economics journalist.
