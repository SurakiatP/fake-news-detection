Share on Facebook \\nSusan Sarandon blew apart the entire gender card being played by a paniced Hillary Clinton, and her surrogates like President Barack Obama. \\nTrying to shame people to vote for a candidate who is completely corrupt and misguided because of her gender is sexist and insulting\u2026and Sarandon calls it out during this BBC Newsnight interview. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t vote with my vagina,\u201d Susan Sarandon answered when asked about backing Hillary Clinton simply because she is a woman. \\nSarandon did not limit her criticisms to just the BBC. \\nWhen interviewed by CNN\u2019s Carol Costello, Sarandon had this to say about the \u201ccompletely corrupt\u201d Hillary Clinton and the DNC\u2026 \\n\u201cAfter my experience in the primary, it\u2019s very clear to me the DNC is gone.\u201d \\n\u201cEvery superdelegate is a lobbyist. The way that the system is set up in terms of trying of having superdelegates \u2014 you could win a state and not get the delegates. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d \\nSarandon was a big Bernie supporter during the primary elections. She told CNN that she she still respects Bernie Sanders even though he endorsed Hillary Clinton\u2026 \\n\u201cLook, Bernie has said \u2018don\u2019t ever listen to me if I tell you how to vote,.\u2019\u201d \\n\u201cWhat [Sanders] did is show people that they counted. He brought them hope. He\u2019s supporting a lot of candidates. It\u2019s very important to go and vote down the ticket.\u201d \\nThe Hill reports that Sarandon is now clearly behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2026 \\nSarandon predicted a surge in third-party support on Election Day, calling Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump \u201cuntrustable.\u201d \\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been voting the lesser of two evils for too long. The good news is everybody\u2019s so frustrated that at least we\u2019re awake.\u201d \\nSarandon on Monday endorsed Green Party nominee Jill Stein. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear a third-party is necessary and viable at this time,\u201d she said in a letter posted on Stein\u2019s campaign website. \u201c And this is the first step in accomplishing that end.\u201d \\nStein has about 2 percent support nationally, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls.'"}, "time": 1742628543.9396768}
