Maxine Waters ( ) said the public was \u201cgetting weary\u201d that Democrats have not done enough to begin the process of impeaching President Donald Trump.  Partial transcript as follows: REID: Congresswoman,  on the subject of being more aggressive, you have openly talked about the fact that this president has put himself in a position where impeachment is on the table but your party, the Democratic party is very reluctant, The New York Times has an article out last week about how hesitant Democratic leadership, in particular, are to call for Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. In closing, why do you suppose that is? WATERS:  I don\u2019t know what the reticent is but I know this, that the American public is getting weary of all of these actions without enough being done by the elected officials who they elected to represent them.  I believe that this man has done enough for us to determine that we can connect the dots, that we can get the facts that will lead to impeachment. I believe there was collusion. I think we have enough information about the meetings, the about the lying about those meetings to help us to understand that something was going on. There was an interaction there. And certainly I believe it was collusion, but if they just do their work and do their job, they will find out it was collusion. And I believe this president should be impeached. I don\u2019t care what others say about \u2018it\u2019s too soon, we don\u2019t know, we think.\u2019 I think that they\u2019re letting the American public down by not delving deeper into what is going on with Jared Kushner and this back channeling, about the lies and his failure to disclose he had had these meetings, the same thing with sessions, failure to disclose about the meetings.
