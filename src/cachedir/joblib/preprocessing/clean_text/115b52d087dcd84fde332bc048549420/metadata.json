MUSLEH KHAN: Born in Saudi Arabia, Khan now lectures in Toronto\u2019s Muslim community on subjects like Islamic Law and marriage. On October 26th of this year, Khan was officially appointed Muslim Chaplain for The Toronto Police. Among Khan\u2019s radical beliefs: \u2022 A woman should ask her husband permission before leaving the home\u2026 she should take care to seek permission from her husband before going out of the home that he has provided her . \u2022 The Muslim prophet Mohammed\u2019s marriage to a nine-year-old is somehow instructive. Khan says puberty is the right time to get married (and, if that occurs when a girl is 9, so be it) \u2014 and, don\u2019t forget, according to Khan, married women are forbidden from withholding sex from their husbands, even if they want to play with their Barbie dolls instead.'"}, "time": 1742628545.714522}
