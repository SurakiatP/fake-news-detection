Indonesian officials, for example, warned the foundation that Pangkalan Bun Airport\u2019s landing strip was too short for the Boeing 757 and that the party would have to switch to a smaller aircraft. \\nOfficially, the Indonesian stop was to visit a Clinton Climate Initiative project where a local forest preserve was being cultivated to offset carbon emissions. But flying 41 people \u2014 donors, their families and foundation staff \u2014 aboard an aircraft designed for nearly 300 sent the trip\u2019s \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d sky high\u2026 \\n\u2026[T]he 757 and Gulfstream burned 60,000 gallons of jet fuel, worth at least $220,000 using current commercial aviation rates. \\nSixty thousands gallons of jet fuel produced 200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, enough energy to power 21 average U.S. homes for a year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It would fuel a passenger car 478,000 miles in a year. \\nThe Clinton entourage\u2019s carbon dioxide consumption exceeded a year\u2019s total emissions by countries like Guinea-Bissau, Tonga, the British Virgin Islands, Lichtenstein and the Solomon Islands, according to the World Bank . \\nThe Clinton Foundation led a workshop in what not to do \u2013a mismanagement of funds and resources for the gluttonous indulgence of donors. \\nImagine if the \u201cC\u201d in the Clinton Foundation stood for compassion as opposed to corruption\u2026'"}, "time": 1742628484.8918474}
