Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that the Justice Department would submit data to the House Intelligence Committee after it missed a Monday deadline to produce evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. The House committee is investigating Russian interference in the presidential election. Mr. Trump is \u201cextremely confident\u201d that there will be evidence to support his accusation, Mr. Spicer said on Tuesday. \u201cThere is significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election. I\u2019ll leave it to them to issue their report, but I think he feels very confident that what will ultimately come of this will vindicate him. \u201d Mr. Spicer also said that Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump who suggested in an interview that the surveillance could have included a microwave oven, made the comment as a joke. \u201cThe microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone, and I think that has been cleaned up,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cIt was made in jest, so I think we can put that to rest. \u201d Ms. Conway said on Monday that she had not been referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s surveillance against Mr. Trump when she mentioned a microwave, although she made the remark in response to a question about that topic. Mr. Spicer\u2019s comments on Tuesday were the latest in a series of shifting explanations and deflections as Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle has tried to adhere to his extraordinary Twitter posts two weekends ago about his predecessor. After Mr. Trump posted statements claiming that Mr. Obama had tapped Mr. Trump\u2019s phones at Trump Tower, White House officials said they had referred the matter to the House and Senate intelligence panels and would have no further comment until those findings were complete. But that posture has been difficult to maintain in the face of mounting questions from lawmakers and others about what Mr. Trump meant and where he got his information, with calls for him to publicly explain himself. On Monday, Mr. Spicer said that the president had not meant to imply that Mr. Obama had tapped his telephone, but that he was referring in general to surveillance that had been well documented, including articles by The New York Times, during the presidential race. But The Times did not report that Mr. Trump was the target of any surveillance, even though that notion has gained currency on   websites, including some that traffic in conspiracy theories. Mr. Spicer\u2019s assertion on Tuesday that the allegation would ultimately be proved correct suggested either that the president believes there was enough evidence for himself to be implicated in a serious crime or as an agent of a foreign power, or that the Obama administration had flouted the law to spy on him. Asked directly whether Mr. Trump believed that microwave ovens or televisions had been used to spy on him, Mr. Spicer said: \u201cI would just say that the president has tweeted about this. He\u2019s pretty clear that he believes that there was surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628552.7263334}
