{"duration": 0.1368403434753418, "input_args": {"text": "'This summer, I went on a   tour with my movie \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d type of show. At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: \u201cIf I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director] how do I get started?\u201d The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask  \u2014   I make small films, small   shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix  \u2014   but I\u2019m the person who showed up to talk to them. And now I\u2019m the person offering you unsolicited advice  \u2014   so if you don\u2019t need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, I\u2019ve boiled my answer down to six ideas. 1. DON\u2019T WAIT Write. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. There\u2019s no substitute for actually doing something. Don\u2019t talk about it anymore. Maybe don\u2019t even finish reading this essay. 2. FAIL Don\u2019t worry about failing. There\u2019s a great video where Ira Glass explains that when you start in a new field, your work won\u2019t be as good as your taste. It will take years for your taste and the quality of your work to intersect. (If ever!) Failure is essential. There\u2019s no substitute for it. It\u2019s not just encouraged but required. The bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d 14 drafts of my first movie, \u201cSleepwalk With Me,\u201d and worked on my first   show for six years. My first   set on \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d in 2002 was mined from three hours of   material that I had tried and failed with for six years. 3. LEARN FROM THE FAILURE This is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They aren\u2019t the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggie\u2019s Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians. It sucked. People didn\u2019t like my comedy there. I didn\u2019t love theirs. It wasn\u2019t a fit. But then I got a job working as a door person at the DC Improv comedy club in Washington, and that was a fit. Around the same time, I was cast in my college improv group. So all at once, I met people whom I could bounce jokes and ideas off of. They\u2019d give me candid feedback, and I tried to listen. I wasn\u2019t great at it at first. It\u2019s hard to hear criticism. But I\u2019ve learned that harsh feedback, constructive feedback, even weird, random feedback, is all helpful, if you know the essence of what you\u2019re trying to convey. I once heard an interview where Ron Howard said that he tests the rough cuts of his movies with a ton of audiences. He doesn\u2019t do it to be told what the movie\u2019s vision should be, but to understand whether his vision is coming across. If not, he makes changes. Your vision is not being conveyed a majority of the time. With \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d I workshopped the script like the way I workshop my standup: I invited friends over to read it out loud in my living room and then fed them pizza. The pizza was excellent. The script often wasn\u2019t. So I\u2019d get my friends all drunk on pizza and then ask them hard questions like: \u201cWhat do you like least about the script? Be honest. I can take it. \u201d That\u2019s where I learned the most. 4. MAYBE QUIT You might not be meant to be a writer or performer or improviser. You might be meant to teach kids math or raise money for a food bank or start a company that makes Rubik\u2019s Cubes for babies. Don\u2019t rule out quitting. There is going to be an insane amount of work ahead, and your time might be spent better elsewhere. There was a great column in The New York Times recently where Angela Duckworth writes, \u201cRather than ask, \u2018What do I want to be when I grow up?\u2019 ask, \u2018In what way do I wish the world were different? What problem can I help solve?\u2019 This puts the focus where it should be  \u2014   on how you can serve other people. \u201d 5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THAT\u2019S SMALL BUT GREAT Eight years ago, I made a network sitcom pilot based on my life. It was a dream come true. A sitcom about my life? What could be better than that for a standup comedian? Well, it didn\u2019t get picked up. I was devastated. But here\u2019s the kicker: Failing to get that sitcom was the single greatest stroke of luck that\u2019s happened in my entire career. The show wasn\u2019t truly my comedic voice. It was watered down by network and studio notes to the point of being like dozens of other bland sitcoms. After that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, I\u2019ve created a handful of pieces for \u201cThis American Life,\u201d   three Off Broadway   shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, I\u2019ve been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms. The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as I\u2019m concerned, what you create in a       improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being   by seven million people. America doesn\u2019t need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that. 6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATED Plus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, \u201cOne thing you have to offer in your work is yourself. \u201d I disagree. I think it\u2019s the only thing.'"}, "time": 1742561632.7551072}
