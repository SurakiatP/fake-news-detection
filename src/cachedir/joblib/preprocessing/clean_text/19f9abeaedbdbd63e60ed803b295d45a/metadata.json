Trump is sworn in as president and Barack Obama relinquishes the office, dozens of federal workers will swing into action at the White House to replace one commander in chief\u2019s creature comforts  \u2014   favorite snacks, clothes, toiletries, artwork and furniture  \u2014   with those of his successor. The process, months in the planning but mere hours in its militarylike execution, unfolds mostly away from public view as Americans and the world focus on the pageantry of Inauguration Day: the presidential oath and address at the Capitol, a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, the   balls. For the roughly 100 people who work in the White House and the employees on hand to help them with perhaps the world\u2019s   moving day, the official events double as useful distractions that keep the exiting president and his family and the incoming occupants   during the work. \u201cIt\u2019s very busy  \u2014   you are on your feet constantly, making sure things are going in the right place and in the right way, and there is very little time to spare,\u201d said Betty Monkman, a White House curator for more than three decades who helped supervise the changeover in 2001, when Bill Clinton was moving out and George W. Bush was coming in. \u201cThe housekeeper and maids are all getting the clothes in the closet and cosmetics and toiletries in the bathrooms, the kitchen staff is preparing the food. There is a lot going on. \u201d Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, who plan to move to a house less than two miles from the White House so they can remain in Washington while their younger daughter, Sasha, completes high school, have already begun moving personal items to their new home. Moving trucks, including one from a company specializing in storing and moving fine art, have been parked outside the house in the District\u2019s upscale Kalorama neighborhood, and workers have been photographed carrying large cartons inside. But much of the work at the White House cannot take place until the transfer of power occurs just after noon, when two moving trucks pull into the driveway that circles the South Lawn  \u2014   one to deliver the new president\u2019s possessions and the other one to cart off those belonging to the departing chief executive. Nostalgia mixes in with the frenzy. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional time,\u201d said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush, including during the 2009 handoff to the Obamas. On the morning of the inauguration, before the departing president hosts his successor for a midmorning tea, members of the White House residence staff  \u2014   butlers, maids, cooks, groundskeepers and others  \u2014   typically gather in the East Room to say goodbye to the couple they have served, often for the better part of a decade. \u201cIt can be teary,\u201d Ms. McBride said. The changes range from the mundane to the significant. Mr. Obama, whose family\u2019s obsession with healthy eating has been well documented, keeps a large bowl of apples on a table in the Oval Office and a supply of almonds for his   nibbling over briefing books. Mr. Trump, a   aficionado, is known to prefer not only Doritos but also Lays potato chips. The chief usher is in charge of briefing the kitchen staff of any such requests in advance so the pantry on the ground floor of the White House can be appropriately stocked. Mr. Trump\u2019s team declined to comment on what requests he has made for stocking the kitchen or redecorating the house for his first days there, and it is not clear how much time the incoming president  \u2014   who is most comfortable in the familiar confines of his lavish penthouse apartment at Trump Tower, with its   accents  \u2014   plans to spend there. His wife, Melania, who met Jan. 3 at the White House with the usher and curator, plans to live in New York for the first months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency so the couple\u2019s elementary   son, Barron, can finish the year at his private school in Manhattan. The White House empties of all but a skeleton crew of political appointees during the inauguration on Capitol Hill. Amy Zantzinger, a social secretary for Ms. Bush, recalls walking out the White House gate just before noon on that day in 2009 as Michael Smith, the Obamas\u2019 decorator, was coming in. \u201cMrs. Obama\u2019s priority that day was getting the girls\u2019 rooms settled in time for bedtime that night,\u201d Ms. Zantzinger said about the first daughters, then 7 and 10. A transition official close to Mrs. Trump, speaking on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to talk about the   process, said she was working closely with an interior designer to redo parts of the White House residence. (The official also would not address reports that Mrs. Trump, a former model, would install a   \u201cglam room\u2019\u2019 for makeup and hair preparations.) She has enlisted Jessica Boulanger, a senior vice president of communications at the Business Roundtable who has an interest in fashion design, on a volunteer basis to help her establish an East Wing team. Mr. Trump is planning to swap the curtains in the Oval Office  \u2014   currently a deep shade of red  \u2014   for those used by a previous president, according to a person familiar with the exchange. At the White House, aides have been plotting the move for weeks. They compiled briefing books for the incoming first family with color photographs and architectural drawings of all the rooms in the residence, including what furniture and artwork are available. Curators, who keep computerized inventories of artifacts that are in the permanent collection of the White House and those that have been brought in as gifts or personal items, police the process to ensure that exiting presidents do not leave with anything that does not belong to them. It does not always go seamlessly. Bill and Hillary Clinton had to return nearly $50, 000 worth of gifts they took with them when they left the White House in 2001. These were eventually determined to be the property of the National Park Service, which oversees the White House. \u201cThe Clintons were partying up until 3 a. m. the night before, so it was much more of a frantic turnaround for the residence staff to move in the Bushes\u2019 stuff,\u201d Ms. McBride said. When it came time for Mrs. Bush, a librarian, to transition out of the White House, she added, she made sure the process was orderly, starting in the summer of 2008 when she began gradually moving belongings to the family\u2019s ranch in Crawford, Tex. The newly   president and first lady typically return to the White House after a lunch at the Capitol and are greeted by the chief usher, who makes sure they are comfortable for a few moments before they head out again to a viewing stand on Pennsylvania Avenue to watch the inaugural parade. \u201cThey\u2019ll come and go quickly, which is just as well,\u201d Ms. Monkman said, \u201cbecause there is still so much to do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628446.2385316}
