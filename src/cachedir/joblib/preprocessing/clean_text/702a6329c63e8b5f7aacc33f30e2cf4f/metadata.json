Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is \"honoring President Obama.\" \u201cHe\u2019s the founder of ISIS. He\\'s the founder! He founded ISIS,\u201d the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. \u201cI would say the co-founder would be \u2018Crooked\u2019 Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump added. He went on to criticize Obama\u2019s decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. \u201cWe should never have gotten out the way we got out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.\" \u201cInstead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,\u201d he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the \u201cdisastrous decisions\u201d that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain Khan\u2019s father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims.'"}, "time": 1742562216.4984164}
