William J. Clinton Foundation: This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the Will\u2026 https://t.co/Y4nz3aRSmG \\n\u2014 FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) November 1, 2016 \\nThe ancient nontroversy was provided with absolutely zero context or explanation. In fact, this single cryptic tweet is the only thing the FBI Records Vault has tweeted in the past 36 hours. However, just like FBI Director James Comey\u2019s letter to Republicans, it will be used by Clinton\u2019s opponents \u2013 particularly Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 to fan the flames of \u201cscandal.\u201d \\nThe question on everyone\u2019s mind is: Why? Why tweet this? And why tweet this just one week before an election that has already been marred with too many false scandals and misleading announcements? \\nThe decision is baffling and unprecedented. As demonstrated by Washington Post \u2018s political reporter Peter Stevenson\u2019s stunned reaction. So, an FBI account is tweeting things about the Clinton foundation. Appears to be from 2001 investigation into several of Clinton's pardons https://t.co/PDIwBYueIO \\n\u2014 Peter Stevenson (@PeterWStevenson) November 1, 2016 \\nAnd Clinton campaign staffer Brian Fallows\u2019s even more stunned reaction: Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI \\n\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 \\nComey has been rightly slammed for his decision to meddle in the election contrary to FBI policy not to get involved in politics, but even his critics were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder \u2013 a staunch Democrat \u2013 called Comey an \u201chonorable man\u201d who made a massive mistake. Now that assessment seems far too kind. The FBI is dumping opposition research to the public that hurts Hillary Clinton and favors Donald Trump. \\nNot that the FBI Records Vault has been completely silent about Trump \u2013 but when it does speak about him, its tone is much more deferential. If the FBI\u2019s policy is to keep politics out of it, they are only achieving that when it comes to Trump. Two days previously, it tweeted a brief write up about Donald Trump\u2019s father. It describes him a \u201cphilanthropist\u201d and the release appears mostly harmless. Fred C. Trump: Fred C. Trump (1905-1999) was a real estate developer and philanthropist. This release consists of\u2026 https://t.co/21KgtPpmzk \\n\u2014 FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) October 30, 2016 \\nAt the same time, it\u2019s carefully withholding information regarding its investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s businesses and his connections to the Russian government . This imbalance is so clear that it stretches the imagination to the breaking point to believe it was done on accident. \\nAs the race tightens in the closing week of the election, the fact that a government agency would repeatedly throw its weight behind one candidate over another \u2013 and do so in a way that is inherently dishonest \u2013 is infuriating. The damage being done to the FBI\u2019s claim to objectivity is possibly irrevocable. \\nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742564290.5079963}
