Rand Paul cautioned President Donald Trump about making war in Syria Thursday evening shortly after it was announced that the Pentagon fired more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian air base. [\u201cWhile we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate,\u201d said Paul, who ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination against Trump.  \u201cOur prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different,\u201d he said. Earlier Thursday, the senator told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio he was skeptical about the President\u2019s ability to change Syria with new attacks. \u201cIf he decides to do something in Syria, he would come to Congress and ask for a declaration of war. Short of congress voting on it, I\u2019m opposed to illegal and unconstitutional wars,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the greatest amount of sympathy, I can\u2019t see those pictures, it\u2019s heartrending to see those pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut going to war we have to decide will it be better or worse? Will we improve our national security? Are we threatened currently by Syria, and if we go to war is Assad likely to use less chemical weapons or more?\u201d Paul argued American attacks could make the situation in Syria worse. \u201cThere\u2019s some argument for the more cornered and the more defeated in some ways more likely they are to use chemical weapons and actually for the less defeated they are that they\u2019re less likely to use them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s horrific. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564429.6150618}
