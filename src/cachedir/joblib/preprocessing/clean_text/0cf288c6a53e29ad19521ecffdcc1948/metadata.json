For some reason, the Hillary Camp does not know the difference. They just know Police are involved, and BlackLivesMatter hate police so they want to use it to push\u2026. their agenda against gun. \\nEven though\u2026it makes ZERO sense. \\nWikiLeaks has just released a batch of evidence that Eric Garner\u2019s daughter has read through\u2026and good thing she did. Her own NAME is in it! Which got her furious\u2026 \\nSo she\u2019s speaking out\u2026 \\nErica Garner has become one of the more vocal #BlackLivesMatter activists after her father died while resisting arrest. Yes, we all have opinions about BLM, but that\u2019s not this post. Okay? Okay. \\nThis post is about how shameless leftists like the Clinton Campaign used a man\u2019s death for their own means, to push their own agenda. No, of course you\u2019re not surprised an entity like the Clinton campaign would use anyone for any reason whatsoever. Par for the course. What\u2019s different is how Erica has responded. Let\u2019s just say she\u2019s none too pleased. \\nSide note reminder: Eric Garner, her father, wasn\u2019t even shot. No guns. \\nSo what got Erica justifiably peeved are some recent Wikileaks, which revealed the backdoor dealings of how the Clinton Campaign discussed Garner\u2019s case. Like how it could be used to further the anti-cop and anti-gun agendas. \\nGarner first tweeted a link to leaked emails that appear to show internal discussions from the Clinton campaign about whether to mention her father\u2019s name in op-ed piece that Clinton was writing for the New York Daily News. \\n\u201cFinally, I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don\u2019t want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece,\u201d Clinton campaign aide Nick Merrill wrote. \\nErica Garner was not, shall we say, amused. These people will co opt anything to push their agenda. Police violence is not the same as gun violence. \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 I\\'m vey interested to know exactly what @CoreyCiorciari meant when he said \" I know we have an Erica Garner problem\" in the #PodestaEmails19 \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 https://t.co/jzfUl0FbXF In this #PodestaEmails leak @CoreyCiorciari n @NickMerrill plot to use police violence victims to push gun control \\nKeep reading\u2026 \\nJust like the scandalous bunch of crooks in the Clinton camp to abuse their power and twist the truth to get what they want\u2026 more power! Greed is never satisfied, and that\u2019s going to be a HUGE problem if Hillary gets into the White House. \\nShe\u2019ll sell us for a dime. Related Items'"}, "time": 1742562055.5251932}
