Democracy has been sanctified because of its symbolic indication that the will and the voice of the people is being considered. Grand sweeping sentiments, \u201cdemocracy,\u201d the \u201cAmerican way\u201d and so forth. But perhaps it is a model that never could live up to the needs of society\u2026 if voting just means picking the personality of your dictator, then there is noting to vote for. \\nNot sure all the things asserted in this article should be implemented either, but it is worth keeping mind that the population and size of the societies that first instituted democracy in Ancient Greece, etc. have little in common with the easily divided, multi-dimensional population base in the United States \u2013 with a whopping 315,000,000+ people being represented by 1-of-2 presidential candidates, and 535 people in Congress. \\nThe most populous state in the U.S., California, is represented by 2 Senators \u2013 at a ratio of about 1 to 19 million, and each of its 53 representatives in Congress theoretically represent the views of more than 700,000 people. In Wyoming, the least populous U.S. state, 1 House member represents about a half million people, and each of their 2 senators represent about 232,00o people. Anyway you slice it, no matter what system or values you believe in, that\u2019s a lot of people being represented by a very few\u2026 and almost none of those representatives are able to resist corruption, avoid tainted lobbyist money or uphold their promises to voters. So you tell me what the solution is? \\nMathematicians Prove Society is Way Too Complex to Have A President \\nby Alice Salles\\nMathematics, a report published by Vice \u2019s Motherboard prior to Election Day suggests, proves society is so complex that democracies have been rendered irrelevant.\\nAccording to a study carried out by mathematicians at the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), it is difficult for government entities or single individuals to debate what these mathematicians call \u201csocial policy\u201d if the goal is to find something that works for everyone. Once we consider that members of any society are simply too complex, the study suggests, we are able to understand that the systems of government currently available fail to meet our expectations.\\nWhile the implications of this complexity are myriad, one of the issues more broadly discussed in the study revolves around government\u2019s own inability to address this complexity, no matter how you slice it.\\n\u201c [T]he concept of civilization as a complex organism ,\u201d mathematicians concluded , \u201c is qualitatively different than either [democracy or communism] .\u201d\\nWhy Complexity Matters \\nAccording to NECSI\u2019s director, Yaneer Bar-Yam, \u201c [t]here\u2019s a natural process of increasing complexity in the world \u201d that at some point will \u201c run into the complexity of the individual .\u201d Once we reach that point, Bar-Yam added, \u201c hierarchical organizations will fail .\u201d\\nBar-Yam\u2019s team seems to have learned that concentrating the power to organize society in the hands of a few individuals is absurd. After all, optimal decisions targeting society cannot be made by a group of individuals detached from it. This is precisely because issues are better dealt with by those who are affected by it.\\n\u201c We were raised to believe that democracy, and even the democracy that we have, is a system that has somehow inherent good to it ,\u201d Bar-Yam told Motherboard . But democracies alone are not the only problem, he added. All hierarchical organizations fail \u201c [to respond] to decision-making challenges. And this is true whether we\u2019re talking about dictatorships, or communism that had very centralized control processes, and for representative democracies today. \u201d\\nBecause representative democracies \u201c focus power in one or few individuals ,\u201d Bar-Yam concluded , \u201c those systems [are] ineffective .\u201d\\nHuman Complexity, \u2018Human Action,\u2019 and How They Relate \\nWhile this analysis may sound like common sense, it becomes increasingly interesting as researchers discuss a more nuclear element of this complexity: the individual.\\n\u201c An individual human is made up of atoms, which make up cells, which make up organs, and so on ,\u201d writes Jason Koebler of Motherboard . \u201c Describing the behavior of each individual atom is incredibly difficult ,\u201d he added. But describing \u201c collective behaviors ,\u201d Koebler added, \u201c [is] inherently more \u2018simple\u2019 than individual ones, \u2026 Describing the behavior of atoms is more complex than describing the collective behavior of the many atoms that make up a human being .\u201d With this analogy, Koebler adds that \u201c [p]redicting the specific behavior of a car factory worker in his day to day life is much harder than predicting that he and a collective of other people will produce cars at the factory .\u201d\\nBecause a \u201c control hierarchy is designed to enable a single individual to control the collective behavior ,\u201d governments are not the answer. Instead, Bar-Yam explained , \u201c coordination occurs because individuals influence each other\u2019s\u2019 behavior .\u201d\\nGovernment, then, is an \u201c attempt to organize the behavior of many individually complex humans into something simpler and more coherent ,\u201d Koebler observes \u2014 and it\u2019s incredibly bad at it.\\nDespite the incredible \u201cdiscoveries\u201d made by Bar-Yam and his team of mathematicians, the complexity of human individuality has already been deeply explored in the past.\\nPraxeology is the study of purposeful behavior , or \u201chuman action.\u201d\\nIn 1949, economist Ludwig von Mises wrote a treatise on this scientific study, simply naming it Human Action . In his book, Mises argues that the individual acts in order to achieve an end he or she subjectively values, making human action an intentional act. While not all human behavior is purposeful, praxeology\u2019s core axiom is that human beings exist and act for a reason. In other words :\\n\u201cAction is will put into operation and transformed into an agency, is aiming at ends and goals, is the ego\u2019s meaningful response to stimuli and to the conditions of its environment, is a person\u2019s conscious adjustment to the state of the universe that determines his life.\u201d \\nBecause action is speculative, Mises adds , outsiders are incapable of knowing what will happen. And while natural sciences are capable of predicting the results of specific actions, the future cannot be predicted as a whole.\\nWhether you\u2019re looking at a group of people with common traits or an event that has similar elements from other events of the past, Mises explains , decisions are always made with incomplete knowledge. Since economics deals with the action of humans attempting to satisfy their desires through the exchange of goods and services \u2014 making this social science a study in human action \u2014 we can safely say Mises understood human complexity long before Bar-Yam discussed this growing problem with Motherboard .\\nDespite what many think of nowadays when discussing liberalism , Mises explains in his book that the \u201c social philosophy of eighteenth-century [known then as] rationalism and liberalism \u2026 does not resort to any miraculous interference of superhuman powers .\u201d\\nInstead, Mises writes in another book, Epistemological Problems of Economics , classical liberalism hopes to \u201clead to lasting well-being [for all] \u201d by never resorting to government intervention of any kind.\\nAfter all, Mises writes in Human Action , government always \u201c means \u2026 coercion and compulsion and is by necessity the opposite of liberty .\u201d\\nCombining his insight with what mathematicians have now proven, it\u2019s safe to say societies rely on individuals to succeed. When governments act on behalf of society, groups of individuals in power may believe they know the answers to society\u2019s problems. But acting without firsthand knowledge means acting without the goals of every single individual in mind.\\nAs Bar-Yam concluded in his study, complexities make it difficult for centralized governments to act efficiently. And Mises agreed with that conclusion over 60 years ago. But Mises also offered a very different solution.\\nWhile Bar-Yam wants to see a \u201c more laterally-organized system of governance in which tons of small teams specialize in certain policies, and then those teams work together to ultimately make decisions ,\u201d Mises argues for the absence of government interference, leaving all decisions to society.\\nAs the majority of Americans get tired of politics, choosing not to vote in record numbers and allowing the minority to pick the commander-in-chief , it\u2019s clear that Americans understand \u2014 even if subconsciously \u2014 that picking leaders doesn\u2019t matter.\\nLiving life as an individual and being allowed to navigate its risks and successes without government interference, on the other hand, does.\\nThis article was written by Alice Salles and originally published at The Anti-Media.org .
