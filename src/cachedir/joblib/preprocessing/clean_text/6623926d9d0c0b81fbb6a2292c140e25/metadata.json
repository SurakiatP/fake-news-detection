According to sciencedaily.com , whether or not the virus can be replicated or reproduced, isn\u2019t yet known. But other studies of ancient virus DNA have shown it can affect the humans who carry it. \\nScienceDaily reports that the study offers new insight on human endogenous retroviruses. HERV\u2019s are actually antique diseases which possess eerily similar characteristics to human immunodeficiency virus, the precursor to AIDS. \\nExperts believe that this \u2018Viral DNA0 has been passed down through thousands of generations of human beings. The study\u2019s authors are still unsure whether the ancient strains of DNA could cause infections. \\n\u201cThis one looks like it is capable of making infectious virus, which would be very exciting if true, as it would allow us to study a viral epidemic that took place long ago,\u201d says senior author and virologist John Coffin, Ph.D. of the Tufts University School of Medicine. \u201cThis research provides important information necessary for understanding how retroviruses and humans have evolved together in relatively recent times.\u201d \\n\u201cMany studies have tried to link these endogenous viral elements to cancer and other diseases, but a major difficulty has been that we haven\u2019t actually found all of them yet,\u201d says co-first author Zachary H. Williams, a Ph.D. student at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University in Boston. \u201cA lot of the most interesting elements are only found in a small percentage of people, which means you have to screen a large number of people to find them.\u201d \\n\u201cThis is a thrilling discovery,\u201d says co-first author Julia Wildschutte, Ph.D., who began the work as a Ph.D. student in Coffin\u2019s lab at Tufts. \u201cIt will open up many doors to research. What\u2019s more, we have confirmed in this paper that we can use genomic data from multiple individuals compared to the reference human genome to detect new HERVs. But this has also shown us that some people carry insertions that we can\u2019t map back to the reference.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563775.8511186}
