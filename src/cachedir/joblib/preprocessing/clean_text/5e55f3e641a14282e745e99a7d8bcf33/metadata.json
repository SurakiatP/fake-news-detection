Worse, Hayden made the inflammatory and frightening claim on CNN at the time that Donald Trump was a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the country. [Given his background, those words carried weight and contributed to the climate of fear and division that burdens our democracy today, including within the intelligence agencies.  Hayden also signed a letter last August urging Americans to vote against Donald Trump. Anything Hayden says about politics today must therefore be interpreted in that context. He is hardly a disinterested observer, and clearly resents the fact that the American people ignored his unsolicited advice. Now, Hayden tells the Business Insider that Breitbart News has an \u201cillegitimate worldview. \u201d He was apparently objecting to Breitbart News\u2019 story last week documenting mainstream media reports that the Obama administration had conducted surveillance at Trump Tower and of people connected to the Trump campaign, and that it had disseminated the products of that surveillance. Hayden admitted that he had not examined those media reports themselves. Nevertheless, he attacked Breitbart, Drudge and others: The retired   Air Force general said too that \u201cthere\u2019s an amazing consistency\u201d on numerous subjects between the information disseminated by Russian media outlets and that of conservative American sources like the Drudge Report, radio and television host Sean Hannity, and Breitbart. \u201cYou have a Breitbart News story essentially launching the Starfleet of the federal government about one of the most horrible political scandals in American history, if true,\u201d Hayden said, adding that it was \u201cvery troubling\u201d the president seeming to value Breitbart reports over data compiled by intelligence agencies. \u201cBreitbart doesn\u2019t do any creative journalism  \u2014   it just moves the parts around,\u201d Hayden continued. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t done this personally, but I\u2019ve heard others say, when you dig into the Breitbart sources, the articles don\u2019t really say that. \u201d   \u2026     \u201cThey have a worldview, and they are playing with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an illegitimate worldview, and I think it\u2019s a    worldview. It\u2019s a worldview in which preexisting visions seem to be being used to distort the fact pattern that exists. \u201d The proper address for Hayden\u2019s complaints is the mainstream media, and possibly the Obama administration. Regardless, the views he considers \u201cillegitimate\u201d are enjoyed by the 45 million unique visitors who read our website every month. The fact that Hayden and other disgruntled members of the Washington establishment still refuse to acknowledge the basic validity of a different perspective outside the Beltway and the mainstream media is precisely why Trump won in November.
