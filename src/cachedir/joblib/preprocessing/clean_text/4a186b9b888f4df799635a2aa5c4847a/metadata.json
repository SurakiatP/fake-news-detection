[\u201cOh, someone says, \u2018I miss your old black hair,\u2019\u201d the \u201cFirework\u201d singer said in an Instagram video over the weekend. \u201cOh, really? Do you miss Barack Obama as well? Oh, Okay. Times change. Bye! See you guys later. \u201d  Perry has since deleted the Instagram video. The joke, however, did not go over well, with many social media users taking offense to Perry likening her old hairstyle to the first black U. S. president. I\u2019m sure we can all do without @katyperry right ? ?? #Loser pic. twitter.   \u2014   DJ SCREAM (@DJSCREAM) April 30, 2017,  Katy Perry joke was just very tasteless.

The reference to former Pres. Obama was offensive  a poor, tasteless attempt at humor. Your privilege is showing.  \u2014   Paris C. (@pariscarerra) April 30, 2017,  Katy Perry really fucking tried it with that white ass joke. What does Barack Obama have to do with your dry ass white hair?  \u2014   \u13f0ecca\ud83d\udd4a (@MJStarLover) April 30, 2017,  people are not reaching with this Katy Perry   \u201djoke\u201dit wasn\u2019t outwardly racist but it was a microagression with racial undertones,  \u2014   Kadevin.

(@pariscarerra) April 30, 2017,  What does black hair have to do with Barack Obama? You\u2019re cancelled @katyperry.  \u2014   Tonio The Divo \u2655 (@_JayAntonio) April 30, 2017,  One Twitter user pointed out that President Obama has more Grammy Awards than Perry, who has been nominated 13 times. Sometimes when I think that the world is an awful place, I remember that Barack Obama has more Grammys than Katy Perry, and I feel better.  \u2014   Steph (@stphfrndz) April 30, 2017,  Perry supported Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012. To be sure, not everyone was offended by her joke. @PerezHilton @katyperry y\u2019all twisted this up. she wants Obama back but can\u2019t have him back  \u2026    the same way people want her old hair  won\u2019t get it back   its gone,  \u2014   Jessica (@Jes00sica) May 1, 2017,  Katy Perry meant she wants Obama back and can\u2019t have him same way ppl want her black hair and won\u2019t get it back   \u2026     Christ ppl lol,  \u2014   Wally Szczerbiak (@findingwhitney) April 30, 2017,  Perry has increasingly found herself on the receiving end of online fury for what appear to be innocuous social media posts. Last month, the    star came under fire after posting an image of a Hindu goddess on her Instagram page, captioning the photo \u201ccurrent mood. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742562555.3963346}
