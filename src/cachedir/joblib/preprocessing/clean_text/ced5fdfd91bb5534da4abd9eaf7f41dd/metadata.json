Though obviously, we don\u2019t mean actual celebrities \u2013 just people who\u2019ve been in an earlier series of Gogglebox. That counts, right? \\n\u201cThen someone suggested I\u2019m a Sentient Life-Form, Get Me Out Of Here, in which we\u2019d watch people realising there\u2019s more to life than watching TV. And someone else suggested we just film ourselves struggling to squeeze ever more mileage out of what was a lame idea to begin with. \\n\u201cBut we finally settled on Gogglebox\u2019s Little Brother. To be shown immediately after Gogglebox, it will allow viewers to watch the participants of Gogglebox as they watch themselves on Gogglebox. \\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019ll encourage viewers to video themselves as they watch it and email it to us to win a prize. The winner will be whoever\u2019s bonded with their sofa at subatomic level.\u201d Share this story... \\nPosted: Oct 26th, 2016 by Guest Click for more article by Guest ..
