This is what we have been informed, and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided. If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well . But we have solid reason to believe this. We\u2019d welcome any comment you can offer. Thanks very much. \\nEric Associated Press reporter says he knows it\u2019s true, but will gladly print that it\u2019s false \\nWhat\u2019s truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons . In plain English, he explains that he has \u201csolid reason\u201d to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be: \u201cIf you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well.\u201d \\nIn other words, he\u2019s not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, he\u2019s also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! \\nThis is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, \u201cWe are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think we\u2019re a credible news organization.\u201d \\nYou gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what we\u2019ve known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP won\u2019t even fire Tucker for this admission. He\u2019ll probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? \\nIt all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? \\nJust what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.) \\nIt\u2019s not just AP, either. It\u2019s the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America: They\u2019re all liars and crooks, and they\u2019re all working for Hillary Clinton, the serial killer and rape excuser.'"}, "time": 1742561730.801987}
