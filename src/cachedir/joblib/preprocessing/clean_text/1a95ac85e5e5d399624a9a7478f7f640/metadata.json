Stewart, wrote on a form used by inmates to ask for medical help at Hampton Roads Regional Jail. \u201cI can\u2019t hold water down or food. \u201d That was Aug. 4. Two days later, Mr. Stewart was found dead in the jail in Portsmouth, Va. the second man to die in custody there within a year, the authorities said. The deaths of Mr. Stewart and the other inmate, Jamycheal Mitchell, 24, have renewed calls this month by legislators and state officials for better scrutiny and oversight of the state\u2019s regional jails. Mark R. Herring, Virginia\u2019s attorney general, has asked for a federal civil rights investigation, saying the \u201clack of clarity\u201d over what happened to the men was troubling. \u201cI write to you with urgency,\u201d Mr. Herring said in letter to United States Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. The Sept. 6 letter, provided Wednesday by his office, contained details about Mr. Stewart\u2019s death. The state \u201cis once again confronted with significant questions about the provision of medical care at this regional jail,\u201d Mr. Herring wrote. The Justice Department replied in an email that it had received Mr. Herring\u2019s letter and was \u201cin the process of reviewing the request. \u201d Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Democrat of Virginia, was asked about the men\u2019s deaths in a video published on Sept. 1 by The  . \u201cYou bet I have concerns,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe replied. \u201cI have a lot of questions,\u201d the governor added. \u201cThis is why we\u2019re going to propose legislation in the upcoming General Assembly\u201d which starts in January. \u201cNo one is taking responsibility,\u201d he said. Virginia\u2019s regional jails are operated by local, rather than state, authorities. The Hampton Roads jail is run by sheriffs, city managers and city council members from the five cities  \u2014   Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Chesapeake  \u2014   in its jurisdiction. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the governor, said on Thursday that any proposed legislation would aim to give state agencies the authority to investigate regional jails when events like the deaths of the two men occur. Currently, the state and the Portsmouth city police are investigating the jail deaths, Mr. Coy said. \u201cThe law can be more clear in terms of the process going forward,\u201d Mr. Coy said. \u201cWho, if anyone, has the authority to oversee and investigate local jails. \u201cThere is no clear authority about who investigates when there is a death in the local or regional jails,\u201d he said. Last week, an investigation by The Richmond   showed that inmates died nearly nine times more often in custody at Hampton Roads Regional Jail than at other local or regional jails in Virginia during the past three years. The newspaper analyzed statistics from two state agencies showing that 12 of the 6, 716 inmates who have been locked up at the   jail have died since June 2013. Statewide, 129 inmates died across Virginia in the same time period. Lt. Col. Eugene Taylor III, the jail\u2019s assistant superintendent, responded to the newspaper\u2019s report, saying five cities that send inmates to the jail send their sickest, and the jail cannot refuse them. \u201cIf you have cancer, if you have H. I. V. you\u2019re coming to Hampton Roads Regional Jail,\u201d he was quoted as saying. The jail\u2019s superintendent, David Simons, and the jail\u2019s lawyer, Jeff Rosen, were not available for comment or did not return calls on Wednesday and early Thursday. The attorney general\u2019s letter requesting the federal investigation after Mr. Stewart\u2019s death was first reported by local media, including The   and WAVY. com, which have also published documents online detailing the jail\u2019s response to Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death. One of the jail\u2019s documents shows a timeline of occasions when Mr. Mitchell sometimes refused food, treatment and medicine. The jail superintendent, Mr. Simons, has said the facility was cooperating with investigators in the Mitchell case, according to a letter he sent to Mr. Herring in June, a copy of which was provided in an email from Mr. Herring\u2019s office. Mark Krudys, a lawyer for Mr. Stewart\u2019s family, said Mr. Herring\u2019s request for a federal investigation shows the jail \u201chas a very significant problem on its hands in both dealing with the mentally ill and dealing with people who need medical help. \u201d He said in a telephone interview on Thursday that Mr. Stewart was being held and accused of violating probation. He said that he anticipated filing a lawsuit after receiving information, including the medical examiner\u2019s determination of the cause of death There was no immediate information on Mr. Stewart\u2019s original complaint. After Mr. Stewart died, the grievance form that he used to ask for medical help was included in the package of his belongings and returned to the family, and then it was published in media reports, Mr. Krudys said. It confirmed details about what former inmates had told the family after Mr. Stewart died, he said. The form shows that Mr. Stewart was told to wait for an appointment for medical help, a service that was the responsibility of an independent contractor for the jail, Mr. Krudys said. Mr. Mitchell was put in the Hamptons Road jail in May 2015 after being arrested and accused of stealing snacks from a  . While awaiting mental health treatment before a trial on the misdemeanor charges, he was not given enough medicine and food and was poorly treated by corrections officers, the lawsuit filed on behalf of Mr. Mitchell\u2019s family said. It quoted interviews with former inmates for some of the details. Mr. Mitchell was found dead in his cell on August 19, 2015. The cause of his death was \u201cprobable cardiac arrhythmia accompanying wasting syndrome of unknown etiology,\u201d said Donna Price, from the medical examiner\u2019s office, in a report by The  .'"}, "time": 1742561730.5977616}
