It is the premier state school today. It was in 1964. It was in 1880. \\nThis is not a threat to the social order. It is an annoyance for students who want to go to class. \\nWHERE AND WHEN THE SIXTIES BEGAN \\nOn September 10, 1964, the Free Speech Movement began at Berkeley. Almost no one remembers why. \\nThe University\u2019s Board of Regents had long imposed restrictions on what kinds of recruiting were possible on school property. Everyone involved in student government knew the rules. Every group had to be approved: fraternities, sororities, religious groups, and political activists. The underlying motivation, more than anything, was to restrict religious proselytizing: the church/state separation issue. \\nThere were almost no conservative political groups on any of the six campuses (San Diego was opening with under 200 undergraduates that semester). As an undergraduate, I was probably the hardest core right-winger in any of the student governments on the five campuses. I had been involved in student government. I had been president of the sophomore class (1960) and president of the Associated Men Students (1961). I was part of an elite group of campus leaders called the California Club. The president of the University, Clark Kerr, met with us once year. \\nIn the fall of 1964, a 26-foot strip of land close to the Berkeley campus on Telegraph Avenue had long been used by Left-wing activists for recruiting. They set up tables at the beginning of the school year. In early September, the University\u2019s administration learned that this strip of land was actually inside the boundaries of the campus. So, the rules governing recruiting applied. \\nThe Assistant Dean of Students, Katherine Towle, decided to enforce the rules. She sent out a letter on September 14. \\n\u201cProvisions of the policy of The Regents concerning `Use of University Facilities\u2019 will be strictly enforced in all areas designated as property of The Regents\u2026 including the 26-foot strip of brick walkway at the campus entrance on Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue\u2026\u201d\u201dSpecifically, Section III of the (Regents\u2019) policy\u2026prohibits the use of University facilities `for the purpose of soliciting party membership or supporting or opposing particular candidates or propositions in local, state or national elections,\u2019 except that Chief Campus Officers `shall establish rules under which candidates for public office (or their designated representatives) may be afforded like opportunity to speak upon the campuses at meetings where the audience is limited to the campus community.\u2019 Similarly, Chief Campus Officers \u201cshall establish rules under which persons supporting or opposing propositions in state or local elections may be afforded like opportunity to speak upon the campuses at meetings where the audience is limited to the campus community.\u201d \\n\u201cSection III also prohibits the use of University facilities `for the purpose of religious worship, exercise or conversion.\u2019 Section IV of the policy states further that University facilities `may not be used for the purpose of raising money to aid projects not directly connected with some authorized activity of the University\u2026\u2019 \\n\u201cNow that the so-called `speaker ban\u2019 is gone, and the open forum is a reality, student organizations have ample opportunity to present to campus audiences on a `special event\u2019 basis an unlimited number of speakers on a variety of subjects, provided the few basic rules concerning notification and sponsorship are observed\u2026 The `Hyde Park\u2019 area in the Student Union Plaza is also available for impromptu, unscheduled speeches by students and staff. \\n\u201cIt should be noted also that this area on Bancroft Way\u2026 has now been added to the list of designated areas for the distribution of handbills, circulars or pamphlets by University students and staff in accordance with Berkeley campus policy. Posters, easels and card tables will not be permitted in this area because of interference with the flow of (pedestrian) traffic. University facilities may not, of course, be used to support or advocate off-campus political or social action. \\n\u201cWe ask for the cooperation of every student and student organization in observing the full implementation of these policies. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to come to the Office of the Dean of Students, 201 Sproul Hall.\u201d \\nThis was reasonable. She was enforcing the rules.
