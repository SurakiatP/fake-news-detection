Watch Team Hillary FREAK over NYT piece on her \u2018gay marriage flip-flop\u2019, from #PodestaEmails21 Posted at 11:55 am   Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nA large part of Hillary\u2019s campaign has been pandering \u2026 er \u2026 reaching out to the LGBT community insisting she is with them, and supports their love and most of all she supports their \u201cright\u201d to get married. \\nOf course not quite 20 years ago, she felt very differently and is quoted as saying, \u201cI think a marriage is as a marriage has always been. Between a man and a woman.\u201d \\nOops. \\n\u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) October 28, 2016 \\nShockingly the New York Times did a piece on her epic flip-flop on gay marriage, which clearly freaked her team out. Best piece, \u201cCan we point those who are writing this to the 2013 video,\u201d basically trying to control what the writer would include. Of course they missed the part that the story is really the change in her policy, not that she\u2019s had an epiphany about gay people. Trending   won't   \\nDemocrats just figured out they needed this demographic, so they all magically change their minds. See Obama and his \u201cevolution\u201d on gay marriage \u2013 same deal. Obamas was categorically against gay marriage during his campaign then changed his mind. when Hillary changed her mind lol she's pandering. \\nActually that just means they are both pandering. You\u2019re welcome. \\nMakes you wonder, is Hillary privately against gay marriage? Dear LGBTQ, Did you know that Hillary is still 'privately' against Gay Marriage? #Wikileaks #PodestaEmails21 https://t.co/1XGlvpSJSO\""}, "time": 1742561916.7168756}
