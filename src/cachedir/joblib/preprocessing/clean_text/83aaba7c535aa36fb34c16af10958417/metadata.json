The barrage of criticism began with a Harvard University study, snowballed with firsthand accounts of discrimination from Airbnb guests and has prompted a lawsuit. Airbnb, the   rental website, has moved quickly to tamp down the controversy. It embarked on a    review of how discrimination might creep into the site. It hired prominent advisers, including former United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to help formulate   policies. And Brian Chesky, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, has repeatedly said that the company needed to do better in dealing with the issue. On Thursday, Airbnb took its most forceful actions yet to combat discrimination. It told its rental hosts that they needed to agree to a \u201ccommunity commitment\u201d starting on Nov. 1 and that they must hew to a new nondiscrimination policy. The company also said that it would try to reduce the prominence of user photographs, which indicate race and gender, and that it would accelerate the use of instant bookings, which lets renters book places immediately without host approval. The moves were outlined in a   report that serves as a blueprint for how Airbnb plans to fight discrimination on the site. Among the other changes is a new     team of engineers, data scientists and researchers, whose job includes discerning patterns of host behavior. \u201cBias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them,\u201d Mr. Chesky wrote in a message to Airbnb users and hosts that accompanied the report. \u201cUnfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry. \u201d Airbnb\u2019s response is designed to quiet the questions over discrimination that have threatened to cloud growth of the company, which is based in San Francisco. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has spread to more than 34, 000 cities and 191 countries, where people increasingly use the service as a replacement for hotels. The continued expansion of the privately held   which is valued at $25 billion, depends partly on the idea that Airbnb can be a global company, providing a broad range of people with places to stay when they travel. That reputation was stained in December, when Harvard University researchers released a working paper that concluded it was harder for guests with    names to rent rooms through the site. Several Airbnb users have since shared stories on social media saying they were denied a rental because of their race. In May, an   Airbnb user filed a suit against the company, seeking   status, saying he had been denied a place to stay because of his race. \u201cThere have been too many unacceptable instances of people being discriminated against on the Airbnb platform because of who they are or what they look like,\u201d wrote Laura W. Murphy, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington legislative office who was hired by Airbnb to compile its report. Diversity advocates said Airbnb\u2019s actions were a notable first step, but wondered how some of the changes could be enforced and whether the moves went far enough. The biases of hosts can be cloaked  \u2014   for example, one Airbnb listing in Washington states \u201cwe cannot accept guests arriving in D. C. by bus or motor coach,\u201d without mentioning race, class or ethnicity  \u2014   and may be difficult to eradicate. \u201cThe company isn\u2019t saying that it will consistently ban hosts for discrimination, so it\u2019s unclear whether this policy will be enough to deter bad behavior,\u201d said Jamila   an associate professor of law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. \u201cI want more information on how the technology works and how the company will act when they identify discriminatory behavior. \u201d Professor   said she was also concerned about potential unintended consequences of Airbnb\u2019s new policies. If mainly minorities feel comfortable in using instant bookings to reserve rentals on Airbnb, for instance, that could end up creating a   reservations system, she said. Airbnb was short on details about how some of the changes might work. Though the company said it planned to experiment with reducing the prominence of user photographs to fight discrimination, it does not intend to eliminate the photos. It did not provide specifics on what a user profile with a   picture might look like. \u201cPhotos are an invitation to discriminate,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization that advised Airbnb on best   practices. Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which also advised Airbnb on the report, said the company did not accept all of its recommendations on promoting diversity. But he called the report \u201can important first step that shows an openness to considering   solutions to reducing discrimination on the Airbnb platform. \u201d To help with enforcement against discrimination, Airbnb said it was developing new tools to route discrimination concerns to a group of trained specialists, who will handle the complaints. The company also plans to begin training to address unconscious biases and is pushing for more diversity within its own work force. In the report, Ms. Murphy acknowledged that there were many difficulties to eliminating discrimination from Airbnb. \u201cThere is no one product change, policy or modification that can eliminate bias and discrimination,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTackling these challenges requires a sustained and multifaceted approach. \u201d Ms. Murphy did not blame Mr. Chesky or his two   Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, for how the discrimination problems have mushroomed. When the three men, who are white, started Airbnb as a tiny enterprise eight years ago, they began \u201cwith the best of intentions,\u201d she wrote. The founders \u201cwere not fully conscious of racial bias. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564394.4038475}
