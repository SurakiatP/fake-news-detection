But that unlikely inspiration helped give the film \u201cMoonlight,\u201d whose score is nominated for an Academy Award, its otherworldly sound. The unusual idea emerged when the film\u2019s director, Barry Jenkins, was batting around musical possibilities with its composer, Nicholas Britell, and Mr. Jenkins mentioned his love of chopped and screwed tracks. (The style can give songs a woozy, psychedelic flavor.) \u201cWhen you slow the music down, the pitch goes down,\u201d Mr. Britell, 36, said in an interview in his Manhattan studio. \u201cAnd you actually get this audio texture which is deepened and enriched and you hear more things in it. It sort of opens it up and stretches it out. \u201d Here is how Mr. Britell chopped and screwed instrumental music and wove it into a film whose three chapters take its hero, Chiron, from boyhood (when the character is nicknamed Little) to manhood (when he\u2019s known as Black). When he first read the screenplay, Mr. Britell said, \u201cit felt like a piece of poetry. \u201d Mr. Jenkins knew that he wanted an orchestral score. So Mr. Britell wrote a simple, somber, plangent piece that he initially called \u201cPiano and Violin Poem,\u201d which he recorded in D major. It became \u201cLittle\u2019s Theme. \u201d For the teenage Chiron, Mr. Britell bent the pitch of \u201cLittle\u2019s Theme\u201d until it was in B major. Then, for a harrowing scene involving a schoolyard fight, he slowed the music drastically, until it was almost unrecognizable  \u2014   more than two octaves lower than the original recording. \u201cWe were trying, in the music, to have there be a correspondence between the   nature of Chiron\u2019s world at that point and what\u2019s happening musically without being too overt about it,\u201d Mr. Britell said. \u201cIn that scene you\u2019re hearing this rumbling. You almost don\u2019t know what it is. And then you hear something that almost sounds like a bell, and almost sounds like a bass  \u2014   and in fact it\u2019s the piano and the violins from the very beginning. \u201d For the theme music for Chiron\u2019s adulthood, Mr. Britell reorchestrated \u201cLittle\u2019s Theme\u201d for an ensemble of cellos and had them record it in D major  \u2014   but then bent the pitch until it was in A major. \u201cI chopped and screwed the recording,\u201d he said. \u201cCellos don\u2019t play those notes. It sounds like a weird cross between basses and cellos. \u201d Many members of the audience may not notice that some of the more fantastic effects in the score are its main themes contorted beyond recognition. But the filmmakers do wink at the audience when they include a more traditional kind of chopped and screwed track: the   mix of Jidenna\u2019s \u201cClassic Man\u201d that plays in the background in this scene. The popularity of the soundtrack led to a performance last month in Los Angeles, when the Wordless Music Orchestra performed the score live as the film was screened another outing is planned at the Barbican Center in London on March 18. But mimicking the effects of chopped and screwed with live orchestra took some serious reverse engineering. \u201cIf it\u2019s a violin that sounds like a bass, I\u2019ll have a bass play it,\u201d Mr. Britell said.'"}, "time": 1742562233.017362}
