That has to be the most idiotic investment rationale I\u2019ve ever come across. Even \u201cbuy stocks because they keep going higher\u201d is less dumb than that. \\nYou\u2019ll note the \u201csic\u201d I added after Drunkenmiller\u2019s comment about \u201cgold.\u201d \u201cSic\u201d is used after a quoted word (from someone else) that seems odd or out of place. I inserted \u201csic\u201d after Drunkenmiller\u2019s use of \u201cgold\u201d because he never owned gold. He bought GLD, which is a paper derivative of gold. The only way you own gold is if you buy physical gold and keep it outside the system. GLD is a fraud, just like every other fiat paper \u201casset.\u201d \\nI also inserted \u201csic\u201d after his use of the word \u201cmoney\u201d with respect to \u201cmoney flowing out of gold\u201d (because he thinks inflation will spike up). Gold is money. It\u2019s the second oldest form of transaction currency \u2013 silver being the oldest. \\nFinally, the idea that gold should be sold ahead of an expectation of a spike in inflation is\u2026well, for lack of a better term, retarded (apologies to safe-space and socially correct people). Gold is the ultimate inflation hedge. \\nI sincerely do not know what would motivate Druckenmiller to make those remarks about gold \u2013 maybe he was patronizing what remains of CNBC\u2019s imbecilic audience. I don\u2019t feel any need to directly address each component Drunkenmiller\u2019s assertions about gold \u2013 and about his expectations about feeling good about the prospects for the economy. The audiences of blogs like this one get it. \\nThe current trading action in gold is being fueled by the paper market manipulation. If you review overnight charts for the last 3 months, you\u2019ll see that on average and in general gold moves higher during the eastern hemisphere physical gold trading hours and gets bombed once the London and NY paper gold markets open after the Asian markets close. \\nIt\u2019s as simple as that. The paper gold market, like Drunkenmiller\u2019s comments and investment rationale, are emblematic of the fraudulent, debt-riddled Ponzi nature of the U.S. and western hemisphere economies. \\nWhile the mantle of \u201cpower\u201d in the U.S. was handed from Uncle Tom to Andrew Dice Clay, the real financial, economic and political power is being shifted from the western hemisphere to the eastern hemisphere. The massive flow of physical gold from west to east is the root of this tectonic geopolitical and economic movement. Share this:'"}, "time": 1742562036.5747538}
