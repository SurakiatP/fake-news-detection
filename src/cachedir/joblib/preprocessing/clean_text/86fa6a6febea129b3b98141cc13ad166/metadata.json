(WJHG/WECP) \u2013 At age 94, you could say Arlene Borges is one of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fans. \\n\u201cI like him, I liked him before he was even thinking about being a president,\u201d Borges said. \\nAnd thanks to a morning routine that has become a ritual, you could also call her a super fan. \\nEvery day, when most people are going to work, Arlene is going the extra mile for Donald Trump. The Santa Rosa Beach resident walks one mile around town in her Trump t-shirt, meeting and greeting passersby with her bubbly personality. \\nSo how did it all start? \\n\u201cWell little did my son know, when he bought me a Trump shirt, I started wearing it, and boom \u2013 everything happened,\u201d Borges said. \\nArlene has become something of a local celebrity now, with some fans even stopping to ask for a photo. She recalls one time in particular. \\n\u2018I was over on the church street and I was just sitting there getting some sun because it was kind of a chilly morning, and this car whizzes up and she gets out and had her camera or maybe it was her phone, and she says, \u2018Oh I\u2019ve wanted a picture of you with your Trump shirt on\u2019!\u201d \\nArlene says she wasn\u2019t always a Republican, but she doesn\u2019t remember what year she switched parties. Her husband was a Democrat and she voted the way he voted. \\nThe first vote she cast for president was for the 32nd one, back when the voting age was 21 instead of 18 years old. \\n\u201cFranklin D, you know, everybody was great for Franklin D. Roosevelt,\u201d she said. \\nAnd now, as she casts her ballot for the man she hopes becomes the 45th, this 94 year-old will continue her grassroots effort to encourage others to do the same. \\nH/T \u2013 WJHG \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.
