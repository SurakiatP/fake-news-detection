But by deciding to intervene in a local court case and essentially blocking two politicians from taking seats in Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, China signaled more clearly than ever on Monday that there was a limit to its tolerance in this former British colony, which was promised a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d in an international treaty. The two young activists who are testing that limit are advocates of independence for Hong Kong. While being sworn in, they made a statement of defiance against Chinese rule, using a crude obscenity and a term that many consider a slur against Chinese people. In acting against them, the government of President Xi Jinping has asserted new authority to set policy in Hong Kong, opening what could be a more chaotic era here, in which elected officials are held to a vague standard of political loyalty and blacklisted if they fall short. The Communist Party\u2019s intervention in Hong Kong\u2019s independent legal system could also damage the territory\u2019s reputation as an international trade and finance hub in Asia. Many multinational corporations, banks and law firms are based here because of the dependability and fairness of the city\u2019s courts. Businesses also find Hong Kong appealing because of its political stability, but thousands of people demonstrated and clashed with the police on Sunday night in anticipation of Beijing\u2019s action, which could incite more street protests. China\u2019s move came in the form of a rare interpretation of the Basic Law, the charter that governs Hong Kong and that was negotiated with Britain before the territory\u2019s return to Chinese rule in 1997. The charter gives China\u2019s Parliament the right to interpret the Basic Law, and the Communist leadership has done so four other times since the handover. Monday\u2019s ruling breaks new ground because it is the first time that Beijing has acted in a pending court case without a request by the Hong Kong government or judiciary, and because it appears to establish a mechanism for the authorities to block critics of Communist rule from taking elected office or even getting their names on ballots. Some scholars said the decision went beyond interpreting the charter and amounted to rewriting the local statute governing how officials are to be sworn in. It requires lawmakers to read their oaths \u201ccompletely and solemnly,\u201d exactly as written, and orders those who administer oaths to disqualify lawmakers who alter or deliver the words in an \u201cinsincere or undignified manner,\u201d barring them from office without another chance to be sworn in. The decision also says lawmakers will be held liable if they violate their oaths, but it provides no guidance on who has the power to determine whether a lawmaker is in breach or what the punishment should be. The fear is that this will inject a degree of arbitrariness into a system that is based on rules underpinned by centuries of precedent under British common law. \u201cWhether it would affect my seat is secondary,\u201d Nathan Law, 23, a new member of the Legislative Council who advocates greater   for Hong Kong, said of the ruling by Beijing. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is that the interpretation is vesting so much power in a person to decide whether someone is sincere and allegiant enough to take office, and there is no    against that person. \u201d The Basic Law says little about oaths, only that officials must swear allegiance \u201cin accordance with law\u201d to the \u201cHong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201d Two politicians elected to the legislature in September, Sixtus Leung, 30, known as Baggio, and Yau   25, set off the legal case by changing the wording of their oaths, replacing the word China with \u201c\u201d a term that many find offensive and that was used by Japan during World War II, when it occupied much of China, including Hong Kong. Ms. Yau also inserted an obscenity. The Chinese government condemned the pair and labeled them threats to national security for their advocacy of independence, and officials in Beijing left little doubt in announcing Monday\u2019s decision that it was intended to keep them out of office. Li Fei, the chairman of China\u2019s parliamentary committee on the Basic Law, compared Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, and their supporters, to traitors espousing a \u201cfascist\u201d line. \u201cThere is a great patriotic tradition in the Chinese nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAll traitors and those who sell out their countries will come to no good end. \u201d He added that the government\u2019s stance \u201cwill not be ambiguous or lenient. \u201d The United States, on the eve of its own presidential election, urged China not to undermine the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that has protected basic civil liberties in Hong Kong. The United States believes \u201can open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by the rule of law is essential for Hong Kong\u2019s continued stability and prosperity as a special administrative region of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said on Monday. Hong Kong\u2019s politicians reacted along predictable lines, with the   establishment endorsing the decision and the   opposition criticizing it as an infringement on   in the territory. The unpopular chief executive, Leung   vowed to fully enforce the decision, saying, \u201cThis is about the country\u2019s unity and sovereignty. \u201d Michael Tien, a   lawmaker in Hong Kong who endorsed the ruling, said it could be used to screen future candidates running for office and to challenge those who have already taken seats in the   Legislative Council, including several opposition lawmakers who have made statements in favor of   or independence for Hong Kong. \u201cThis thing is expansive,\u201d Mr. Tien said in a telephone interview, adding that Beijing\u2019s allies in Hong Kong could ask courts to rule on whether these lawmakers were sincere in swearing allegiance or had violated their oaths. Such a process is likely to be contentious, said Simon Young, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, because the language of Beijing\u2019s decision is short on specifics. It says nothing about whether advocating   or independence violates an officeholder\u2019s oath, for example, or how to handle candidates who change their position on the issue. As a result, politicians such as Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau could seek to win back their seats by renouncing support for independence and going back to court. And that could lead Beijing to intervene further and issue new decisions to stamp out people it wants to disqualify. \u201cThis will possibly be the first of a possible series of interpretations,\u201d Mr. Young said. In the meantime, he added, \u201cthe courts in Hong Kong will have to interpret the interpretation. \u201d The Chinese government\u2019s overarching goal is to crush a small but growing independence movement in Hong Kong, which gained momentum after Beijing rejected calls for free elections in the territory during the enormous   demonstrations of 2014. But by intervening in the legal case over Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, Mr. Xi has drawn more attention to their cause, and he risks provoking a backlash that could strengthen it. In a scene that resembled the 2014 demonstrations, the police used pepper spray early Monday to battle crowds of protesters who had gathered around the Chinese government\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, some of whom were shouting, \u201cHong Kong independence. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628363.2302167}
