RELATED CONTENT Hamas Warns It Won\u2019t \u2018Sit Idly By\u2019 As Israel Continues Striking Gaza \\nThe excavations are carried out by Israel in the name of science and archaeology to find evidence of Jewish history around the Temple Mount area, but could undermine the foundations of the old Mosque and pave the way for its collapse, which would then draw an anticipated Muslim backlash. \\nAlthough UNESCO recently announced that the al-Aqsa Mosque compound is a Muslim holy site, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is \u201c not paying attention to international rules. \u201c \\nSputnik reports: \\n\u201cApparently, Israel couldn\u2019t accept such (UNESCO) position, and plans to continue excavations under the al-Aqsa Mosque. This is contrary to all possible rules, regulations, agreements and international obligations because after the monument was registered as a cultural heritage, any involuntary action that can destroy it is a crime against human rights,\u201d Abshenass wrote for Sputnik Persian . \\nUNESCO\u2019s Executive Committee on Thursday voted for the resolution, which acknowledged Jerusalem to be a holy city for Muslims, Christians and Jewish people, but named the Temple Mount, where the Al-Asqa mosque is located, a Muslim holy site. Following the resolution, Israel decided to halt cooperation with the UN agency. \\n\u201cThe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to have found a way to bypass the decision of UNESCO, according to which this mosque was declared a cultural heritage site of Muslims. He will carry out excavations at the mosque, and later, when the mosque collapses, he will declare it an accident, the consequences of which will be irreversible,\u201d the expert wrote. \\nAccording to Abshenass, if the Israelis continue their policy towards Muslims and don\u2019t change their attitude, \u201cthen the level of terrorist activity in the world could increase.\u201d \\nThe expert noted that one of the causes of the Palestinian intifada were \u201cattacks\u201d on Al-Aqsa Mosque. Thus Israel\u2019s actions may again cause \u201cattempts of retaliation\u201d on the side of Muslims, he argued. \\nThe resolution, which was put forward by Palestine along with Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Sudan, was approved by 24 members of the 58-member organization, including Russia. Twenty-six countries abstained from voting, while only six countries voted against it.'"}, "time": 1742563402.4356554}
