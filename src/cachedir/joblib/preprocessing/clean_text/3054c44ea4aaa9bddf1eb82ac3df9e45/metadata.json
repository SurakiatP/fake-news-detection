It was widely mocked by many in the media, who claimed everything was fine there. President Trump hit back at the claims today at the same conference, remarking the violence in Sweden as well as other European nations confirmed his remarks.  \u201cAnd I was in Paris too, and I was in Brussels in [the municipalities of] Molenbeek too, and you guys at the back [the mainstream media] you just don\u2019t get it!\u201d blasted Mr. Kassam. \u201cYou don\u2019t go there, you don\u2019t see what\u2019s going on! Get your heads out of your rears!\u201d \u201cI was in these   zones, actually, and if you want to hear more about that  \u2026     I\u2019ve got a book coming out on it\u201d he revealed. Mr. Kassam, who is just    and has edited Breitbart London since its inception in February 2014, also told the crowd about his own background.  \u201cI was born in West London into a Muslim family. And I am now proud to say that I am a conservative I am a proud Englishman and, I am a robust Americaphile\u201d he said to cheers. Finally, he moved on to introducing \u201cMr. Brexit\u201d former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, describing him as a \u201cfather figure\u201d and comparing him favourably to president Donald J. Trump. \u201cBut I\u2019m here to introduce a man, today, who really changed my life in a very significant way who changed my country in a very significant way and I would argue, changed the world in a very significant way. \u201cYou know last year we had Brexit!\u201d Mr. Kassam declared, to more rapturous cheers, \u201cand Brexit was spearheaded by a man who loves his country, who wants an end to uncontrolled, mass migration  \u2026     who wants us to be a proud sovereign nation again. \u201cI used to work for that man. He is a member of the European Parliament. He worked tirelessly, travelled up and down the country sometimes speaking to rooms of three or four people at the beginning of his career, just to have his message heard. \u201cTwenty years ago this movement started. \u201cHe\u2019s been a mentor to me. He\u2019s been a friend to so many of us. And he\u2019s also been, really, a father figure to so many of us. He has survived cancer. He has survived a car crash. He has survived a plane crash. He has survived the BBC, CNN, the establishment [and] the European Parliament!\u201d Watch Raheem Kassam at CPAC: '"}, "time": 1742562330.8627777}
