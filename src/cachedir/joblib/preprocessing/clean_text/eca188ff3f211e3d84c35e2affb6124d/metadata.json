They even took him to court. \u201cWe have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress,\u201d Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been against executive action,\u201d said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. \u201cWe\u2019re against overreaching, illegal action. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s eager embrace of the executive order  \u2014   he signaled clearly during his campaign that he intended to follow his predecessor\u2019s lead  \u2014   allows him to claim immediate progress on his campaign promises rather than waiting for a lengthy legislative process to play out. Many of his major proposals  \u2014   building a border wall, hiring more border and immigration officers, creating a new office for victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally  \u2014   will presumably require funding by Congress, and that is no certainty in the current political environment. The question then becomes how Mr. Trump would proceed if Congress balks. House Republicans are currently suing the executive branch  \u2014   and winning  \u2014   in a case that argues the Obama administration spent more than $13 billion on health insurance subsidies without necessary congressional approval in a clear breach of the Constitution. The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials to find ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments, health care providers and others. Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it. It was the reverse of the type of action Republicans criticized President Obama for  \u2014   using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority. But there were no loud complaints from Republicans this time, a fact not lost on Democrats. \u201cCongressional Republicans\u2019 hypocritical acquiescence to President Trump\u2019s executive orders is an abdication of their responsibility to govern, especially in light of their vocal opposition to even the most restrained use of executive authority by President Obama,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. But some Republicans are wary too. Even as they welcome the opportunities opened up by having an ally in the White House, some worry that the continued emphasis on executive actions is just another step in the dilution of legislative power. \u201cWe need to go back to being the legislative branch,\u201d said Representative Ileana   a Florida Republican opposed to a potential executive order by Mr. Trump that would end a special program allowing younger illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like this when Obama was doing it, so why should we accept it now?\u201d Other Republicans were hoping the start of a new administration would allow a reset between the executive branch and a legislative branch that has seen its influence steadily erode as lawmakers surrender power and responsibility to the administrative side. Mr. Trump\u2019s broad assertion of executive power could make any rebalancing difficult to achieve, though lawmakers say they intend to keep pushing. \u201cThe imperial presidency was not created overnight and it will not be undone overnight,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who is leading an effort called the Article I Project to try to recapture some lost authority for the House and Senate. Mr. Lee and Ms. Strong of the speaker\u2019s office said a good first step in Congress\u2019s reasserting itself would be enactment of a bill passed by the House this month requiring congressional approval of major new rules being pushed by federal agencies. If it could clear the Senate, Mr. Trump has said he would sign it in what would represent a major victory for congressional Republicans trying to rein in the regulatory power of the executive branch. Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s early focus on pushing his agenda through executive actions underscores a fundamental truth of presidencies. New occupants of the White House tend not to surrender power accumulated by their predecessors. They tend to build on it.'"}, "time": 1742628468.6005108}
