Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley received a standing ovation at the General Assembly on Wednesday after pledging to defend Israel against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, saying it was a modern day incarnation of an \u201cancient hatred. \u201d[\u201cKnow that the United States has Israel\u2019s back, and know that you now have a fighter and a friend in the UN to help you,\u201d Haley told some 2, 000 people at Wednesday\u2019s \u201cAmbassadors Against BDS\u201d conference in New York City.  \u201cThe effort to delegitimize the state of Israel being waged on college campuses and the   obsession at the UN are one and the same.  They both seek to deny Israel\u2019s right to exist. They are both efforts to intimidate her friends and embolden her enemies. They are both extensions of an ancient hatred,\u201d she added. Haley slammed the boycott movement for its complete disregard for truth or history, and for ignoring the human rights violations by countries such as Syria, North Korea and Iran. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense and has no connection to any reasonable definition of justice,\u201d she said. Haley said she felt \u201cprivileged\u201d to have passed the U. S.\u2019 first   bill in 2015 when she was governor of South Carolina. \u201cIn our state we said we will not use taxpayers\u2019 funds to do business with any company that discriminates on the basis of race, color, religion, gender or national origin,\u201d said Haley. \u201cAnd make no mistake, that is exactly what the BDS movement does. \u201d \u201cWhat a tragic irony that today I am once again engaged in a fight against those who seek to harm Israel, but this time as the US ambassador to the United Nations,\u201d she said. Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon thanked Haley for her efforts in combating the movement, which he called \u201cpure antisemitism. \u201d \u201cBy associating these vile acts with legitimate political movements, we run the risk of legitimizing the illegitimate,\u201d Danon said. \u201cThose who topple Jewish tombstones in the dark of night and those who seek to delegitimize the Jewish state are not members of any political group. \u201d \u201cWe cannot rest for even a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe BDS movement is still active and still strong. The real danger of BDS is not in their numbers, it is in their ability to cower us into silence. \u201cSilence is weakness, silence is defeat,\u201d Danon said. \u201cWe are all here to say we cannot, we will not, be silent. \u201d On Monday, Haley told the annual AIPAC policy conference, \u201cThe days of   are over. For anyone who says you can\u2019t get anything done at the UN, they need to know there is a new sheriff in town. \u201d The   conference hosted by the Israeli Mission to the UN in partnership with several   groups including the World Jewish Congress, the Zionist Organization of America, Israel Bonds, StandwithUs, CAMERA, B\u2019nai B\u2019rith International, Maccabee Task Force, Hillel International, Students Supporting Israel, Hasbara Fellowships, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.'"}, "time": 1742563758.6544201}
