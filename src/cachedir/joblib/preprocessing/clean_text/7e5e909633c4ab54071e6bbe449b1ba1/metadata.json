In an interview on Friday, Mr. Rigell, a Republican, said he had settled on Mr. Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, as the best option available. \u201cI\u2019ve always said I will not vote for Donald Trump and I will not vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Rigell said. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for the Libertarian candidate. \u201d Mr. Rigell is the second Republican member of Congress this week to back a candidate other than Mr. Trump in the presidential race the other, Representative Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Both Mr. Rigell and Mr. Hanna are retiring from Congress at the end of their current terms. But Mr. Rigell\u2019s support for the Libertarian ticket may be more portentous: Mr. Johnson and his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, have been seeking to woo disaffected Republicans who view Mr. Trump as unacceptable. Should additional Republican officeholders follow Mr. Rigell in backing the   ticket, it could help Mr. Johnson gain credibility as an alternative choice. A former car dealer who represents a moderate district on the Virginia coast, Mr. Rigell said he expected more congressional Republicans and local Republican officials to break openly with the party\u2019s presidential candidate as the election draws nearer. Many Republican candidates have asked him for advice, Mr. Rigell said, about separating themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Mr. Rigell has been saying since the winter that he could not support Mr. Trump. \u201cWhen their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said,\u201d Mr. Rigell said. \u201cPeople will respect it if you have a reason and you put it out there. \u201d Mr. Rigell said he still considered himself a Republican. But that would change, he said, if the Republican Party were to become synonymous with Mr. Trump and his ideas in a lasting way. \u201cThen I\u2019m done,\u201d Mr. Rigell said, \u201cand I\u2019ll be an independent. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628557.1941814}
