He has inspired homages like Raoul Peck\u2019s documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro\u201d and   Coates\u2019s memoir \u201cBetween the World and Me. \u201d Baldwin\u2019s prophetic essays on race read like today\u2019s news. And yet a full understanding of this pioneering gay   artist remains elusive. While Baldwin\u2019s books are in print, there\u2019s one revealing work that admirers long to read but have mostly been unable to: his letters. The Baldwin estate has held tight to hundreds in its possession, letting only a few scholars see them. It has almost never allowed any of Baldwin\u2019s correspondence to be published, or given biographers permission to quote a single word. Now, Baldwin\u2019s papers have landed in one of the nation\u2019s leading archival institutions, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a division of the New York Public Library, in Harlem. But, in a striking twist, many of his personal letters will remain off limits for another generation  \u2014   a byproduct of complicated negotiations between the library and the estate, and a reminder that family members are not always comfortable with the spotlight\u2019s falling on a loved one, even decades after death. The acquisition is a   coup for the Schomburg, which announced the surprise news at a event there on Wednesday night. It\u2019s also a kind of homecoming for Baldwin, a preacher\u2019s son who grew up not far from the center\u2019s landmark building on Malcolm X Boulevard. \u201cEven though it\u2019s taken 30 years, it\u2019s the perfect time,\u201d Kevin Young, who became the director of the Schomburg in December, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like he never left. \u201d The archive  \u2014   the bulk of which is open to researchers immediately  \u2014   contains a wealth of manuscripts, drafts and notes relating to Baldwin\u2019s sprawling output, most of which have rarely been seen by scholars. There are also letters from luminaries including Lorraine Hansberry, Nina Simone, Bobby Seale, William Styron and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a testament to the sociability of a man who seemed to go everywhere, and know everyone. Still, Baldwin\u2019s correspondence with four of his closest intimates is under   seal, part of a set of restrictions that suggest that his famously protective estate is not quite ready for the world to see the private Baldwin in full. Those confidants include Baldwin\u2019s brother David and three lifelong friends, among them Lucien Happersberger, a bisexual Swiss painter Baldwin once called \u201cthe one true love story of my life. \u201d William Kelly, the New York Public Library\u2019s director of research libraries, described the restrictions, including the seal on roughly half the personal correspondence in the archive, as complicated but \u201cfairly modest. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always a balance in guaranteeing access for scholars, while at the same time being sensitive to the family,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. (Gloria   Baldwin\u2019s sister and executor, declined through the library to be interviewed for this article.) Other limitations  \u2014   like a   waiting period on any public display of all but a handful of items  \u2014   seem puzzlingly out of step with current trends at archives, which tend to make as much freely available and visible online as copyright will allow. (The library also declined to let The New York Times photograph anything beyond eight items the estate had approved for display.) But Mr. Kelly said the restrictions were outweighed by the sheer richness of the archive, which sheds light on how Baldwin navigated different aspects of his identity  \u2014   gay,   political, artistic. \u201cI was dazzled by it,\u201d he said, referring to the collection. The library declined to disclose the purchase price, which was paid with donations from the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, New York Life and three individual donors. (One donor, Mr. Kelly said, contributed the last $500, 000.) For its money, the Schomburg got some 70 boxes of material  \u2014   about 30 linear feet, in  . It spans the full range of Baldwin\u2019s career, from typescripts of his teenage poetry to handwritten drafts of \u201cThe Welcome Table,\u201d his final, unfinished play about an imaginary dinner party featuring an   Panther, a professor and a Josephine   dancer. (It was inspired by visits Baker made to Baldwin\u2019s house in the South of France, where he spent the last decades of his life.) \u201cHe went where his muse went,\u201d said Steven G. Fullwood, the Schomburg\u2019s associate curator of manuscripts, archives and rare books. \u201cHe was always questioning himself and the world. \u201d The eight preapproved items from the collection will be on view through Monday, in a small   exhibition. When I visited the Schomburg earlier this month, archivists had laid out a much larger selection that spoke to the archive\u2019s range and depth. There was a typescript of unpublished notes on Beauford Delaney, a gay   painter whom Baldwin met at the age of 15 and came to see as his \u201cspiritual father. \u201d It was from Delaney that he learned about \u201cthe light contained in every thing, in every surface, in every face,\u201d Baldwin wrote. (Correspondence with Delaney is covered by the   seal.) One folder held an unproduced play script based on \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room,\u201d Baldwin\u2019s   1956 novel about an American expatriate in France, torn between his love for a man and societal pressure to marry. (The novel was dedicated to Happersberger.) There were character notes for his novel \u201cJust Above My Head\u201d (1979) scrawled on a card for a jazz club, and a draft of an unproduced screenplay about Malcolm X, written out longhand in an orange notebook labeled \u201cHomework. \u201d There were also clarion blasts of the prophetic Baldwin, like an unpublished 1978 note recalling the day 10 years earlier when he had learned that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. \u201cTen years! The mind and the heart refuse that knowledge,\u201d Baldwin wrote. \u201cI really feel, as I write this now, the same, unbelieving wonder, the same shocked and helpless rage. \u201d That passage echoes a scene in the new documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d which was based on notes for \u201cRemember This House,\u201d a book about King, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers that Baldwin planned but never wrote. In a recent essay, Mr. Peck, who said he gained full access to Baldwin\u2019s papers, recalled the eureka moment when Ms.   handed them to him. (Those notes, now at the Schomburg, are sealed for 10 years.) But for others, the real buried treasure is the correspondence. In 2007, the critic Hilton Als wrote that there was \u201cone great Baldwin masterpiece waiting to be published, one composed in an atmosphere of focused intimacy, and that is a volume of his letters, letters his family does not want published. \u201d One person who has seen some of the most intimate letters is Ed Pavlic, a poet and professor at the University of Georgia. In 2010, Ms.   gave him access to some 120 letters from Baldwin to their brother David, written over the course of 40 years and totaling some 70, 000 words. Ms.   suggested that Mr. Pavlic try to find a book in them. But when he sent her a manuscript and asked for permission to quote, Mr. Pavlic said, he got no response and was unable to publish it. Mr. Pavlic, who has written about his experiences with the letters, said the lack of access to Baldwin\u2019s correspondence had made it difficult for scholars to make full sense of  \u2014   or even create an accurate record of  \u2014   a life spent constantly on the move. And the letters he saw, far from damaging Baldwin\u2019s reputation, would burnish it, he said. \u201cThe private record, for me, just amplifies and confirms and makes more dramatic the public messages he was out to convey,\u201d he said. In addition to David Baldwin and Happersberger and Delaney, the   seal also covers Baldwin\u2019s correspondence with Mary Painter, a longtime friend to whom he dedicated his 1962 novel, \u201cAnother Country. \u201d Oddly, some of Baldwin\u2019s letters to these intimates (who are all dead) are accessible in other archives, like the Beinecke Rare Book  Manuscript Library at Yale, which has even posted some of its Baldwin collection online. As for the restrictions at the Schomburg, Mr. Young emphasized that a vast majority of the collection was open for   research, and that the rest would be available \u201cin due time. \u201d \u201cI take the long view,\u201d he said. \u201cArchives move by decades and generations. We\u2019re here to keep it forever. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563863.7893195}
