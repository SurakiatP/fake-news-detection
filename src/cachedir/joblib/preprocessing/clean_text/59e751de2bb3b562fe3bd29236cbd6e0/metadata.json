In 2014, Representative Pete Gallego logged more than 70, 000 miles there in his white Chevy Tahoe, campaigning for   to the House  \u2014   and lost by a bare 2, 422 votes. So in his bid this year to retake the seat, Mr. Gallego, a Democrat, has made a crucial adjustment to his strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re asking people if they have a driver\u2019s license,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having those basic conversations about IDs at the front end, right at our first meeting with voters. \u201d Since their inception a decade ago, voter identification laws have been the focus of fierce political and social debate. Proponents, largely Republican, argue that the regulations are essential tools to combat election fraud, while critics contend that they are mainly intended to suppress turnout of   constituencies like minorities and students. As the general election nears  \u2014   in which new or strengthened voter ID laws will be in place in Texas and 14 other states for the first time in a presidential election  \u2014   recent academic research indicates that the requirements restrict turnout and disproportionately affect voting by minorities. The laws are also, as in the case of Mr. Gallego, reshaping how many campaigns are run  \u2014   with candidates not only spending time to secure votes, but also time to ensure those votes can be cast.   states now have ID laws, at least 17 of them  \u2014   including Texas  \u2014   requiring not just written proof of identity, but requiring or requesting a photograph as well. Most research suggests that the laws result in few people being turned away at the polls. But a study of the Texas ID requirement by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy released in August found that many more qualified voters, confused or intimidated by the new rules, have not tried to vote at all. \u201cWhat voters hear is that you need to have an ID,\u201d said Mark P. Jones of the Baker Institute, an author of the study. \u201cBut they don\u2019t get the second part that says if you have one of these types of IDs, you\u2019re O. K. \u201d A second study, by the University of California, San Diego, concluded in February that the strictest voter ID laws  \u2014   those that require an identity card with a photograph  \u2014   disproportionately affect minority voters. After Mr. Gallego\u2019s narrow loss in 2014, researchers from the Baker Institute and the University of Houston\u2019s Hobby Center for Public Policy polled 400 registered voters in the district who sat out the election. All were asked why they did not vote, rating on a scale of 1 to 5 from a list of seven explanations  \u2014   being ill, having transportation problems, being too busy, being out of town, lacking interest, disliking the candidates and lacking a required photo identification. Nearly 26 percent said the main reason was that they were too busy. At the other end, 5. 8 percent said the main reason was lacking a proper photo ID, with another 7 percent citing it as one reason. Most surprising, however, was what researchers found when they   that response: The vast majority of those who claimed not to have voted because they lacked a proper ID actually possessed one, but did not know it. Moreover, Dr. Jones of the Baker Institute said, \u201cThe confused voters said they would have voted overwhelmingly for Gallego. \u201d Whether such voters would have changed the outcome of the election is unknown. But Mr. Gallego said the issue goes far beyond how the laws affect individual races. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously undemocratic in a democratic society when you deliberately disenfranchise thousands of people,\u201d he said. \u201cTurnout is good for the system. \u201d While the numbers vary, studies consistently indicate that a modest but significant share of adult Americans  \u2014   up to 13. 6 percent  \u2014   lack   photo ID cards, like driver\u2019s licenses and university IDs. And the studies consistently show that, compared with whites, the share of minorities without photo IDs is far higher. In Texas, more than 600, 000 people are eligible to vote or are already registered but have no acceptable photo ID, according to an analysis admitted as evidence in 2014 in a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the state\u2019s law. Most of the strict photo ID laws have been enacted in the past decade by   legislatures over Democratic objections. Many are in Southern states whose election procedures had been under federal supervision for compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act until the Supreme Court invalidated key provisions of the act in 2013. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who defended the state\u2019s voter ID law against legal challenges when he served as attorney general from 2002 to 2015, says the law\u2019s ID requirements have maintained election integrity and have not disenfranchised voters. \u201cAs the Supreme Court has already held, the voter ID requirement is no more burdensome than other voting requirements, including registering to vote,\u201d Ciara Matthews, a spokeswoman for Mr. Abbott, said in a statement. \u201cThat minimal burden is far outweighed by the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting elections and voter confidence in the outcome of those elections. \u201d Texas officials say they are spending millions of dollars to help voters understand and meet the new ID requirements, including deploying mobile offices to help citizens apply for election IDs. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen any   problem,\u201d said Alicia Pierce, the communications director for the Texas secretary of state. But in Wisconsin, Todd Allbaugh resigned as chief of staff to a leading Republican state senator last year after attending a party caucus in which, he said, some legislators \u201cwere literally giddy\u201d over the effect of the state\u2019s voter ID law on minorities and college students. \u201cI remember when Republicans were the ones who helped Johnson pass the civil rights bill in the \u201960s  \u2014   not Democrats,\u201d Mr. Allbaugh said in an interview last week. \u201cI went down to the office and said, \u2018I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t support this party any more.\u2019 \u201d In North Carolina last week, a federal judge upheld sweeping changes to election rules, including a voter ID provision, that had been contested by the Justice Department and civil rights groups. Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law will get its   debut this year after first being rejected by the Supreme Court, then rewritten by Republican legislators. Texas\u2019 photo ID law, which took effect in 2013, remains in place despite being struck down three times in federal courts, and faces another court test later this year. To enter a voting booth in Texas one of the following is required: a Texas driver\u2019s license, a Texas election or personal ID card, a Texas license to carry a handgun, a military ID, a passport or a citizenship card. People without the required identification can cast a provisional ballot, but they must produce an approved ID within six days or their ballot will be nullified. The law\u2019s critics say the list is notable for what government documents it does not include  \u2014   a Texas university student ID, a tribal identity card or a state employee ID, to cite three examples that could be more likely used by Democratic voters than by Republicans. Mr. Abbott, perhaps the law\u2019s most ardent backer, has said that voter fraud \u201cabounds\u201d in Texas. A review of some 120 fraud charges in Texas between 2000 and 2015, about eight cases a year, turned up instances of buying votes and setting up fake residences to vote. Critics of the law note that no more than three or four infractions would have been prevented by the voter ID law. Nationally, fraud that could be stopped by IDs is almost nonexistent, said Lorraine C. Minnite, author of the 2010 book \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud. \u201d To sway an election, she said, it would require persuading perhaps thousands of people to commit felonies by misrepresenting themselves  \u2014   and do it undetected. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an effective way to try to corrupt an election. \u201d As attorney general, Mr. Abbott argued that the law\u2019s critics \u201cturn a blind eye to illegal voting and instead rail against voter ID as discriminatory. \u201d That is not so, he wrote in 2012: \u201cStates with voter ID laws have seen minority vote participation increase, not decrease. \u201d That is misleading, said Zoltan L. Hajnal, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an author of the study on photo ID laws and minority turnout. The relevant question, he said, is how minority turnout in states with photo ID laws compares with that in states without such laws. His study, which relied on a sample of more than 50, 000 verified voters collected annually since 2006, reached a stark conclusion. \u201cWe\u2019re finding typically that strict voter ID laws double or triple the gap in turnout between whites and nonwhites,\u201d he said. The Texas law also has a smaller, but potentially significant consequence: Many voters who cast provisional ballots  \u2014   because they either lack an ID or forgot theirs on Election Day  \u2014   never return with proper documents to make their votes count. For example, in Harris County, which includes Houston and is the state\u2019s largest county, only 27 of 389 provisional voters later produced proper IDs in three elections in 2014 and 2015. Finlay K. McCracken, 19, a history major at Trinity University in San Antonio, was among those whose vote went uncounted in November 2014. On Election Day, three months after moving there from Virginia, he presented an unexpired Virginia driver\u2019s license and a voter registration card at his polling place, and was told neither was acceptable. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid ID,\u201d he said. \u201cTexas has a lot of gall to deny me the right to vote when I have a driver\u2019s license from another state and a valid voter registration card. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562120.751393}
