The deployment will see up to 4,000 troops deployed in the Baltic countries and Poland, in addition to the more than 1,000 soldiers already stationed there on a \u201crotational basis.\u201d\\nA German-led battalion will deploy in Lithuania, the US will send troops to Poland, Canada is expected to station troops in Latvia, and the UK will deploy an 800-strong battle group in Estonia.\\nBritish Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon claimed in a bellicose op-ed appearing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday that Europe \u201cis our continent\u201d and, as such, it will be defended by a \u201cfully combat-capable\u201d force.\\nEarlier this year, NATO staged several multinational war games, the largest of which was Anaconda 2016. Those exercises saw more than 31,000 personnel from 24 NATO and \u2018partner\u2019 countries taking part, reportedly in order to develop their capacity to \u201cdeploy, mass and sustain combat power\u201d against a near-peer adversary.\\nIn June, Ukraine, a non-NATO state, hosted the Rapid Trident 2016 exercise, which featured over 1,800 soldiers from 14 countries, along with dozens of combat vehicles, aircraft, and heavy weaponry. That drill was said to be the largest multinational war games ever to be held in Ukraine.\\nMost recently, 680 troops from 32 NATO and non-NATO states, including Georgia, Albania, Israel and Ukraine, took part in war games called Crna Gora 2016 in the Balkan country of Montenegro, where they trained for \u201cdisaster relief operations\u201d in a series of joint exercises.\\nMoscow has consistently warned that the buildup does nothing to improve European security and is nothing but a \u201cprojection of force.\u201d\\nNATO members \u201care fulfilling their confrontational schemes of military planning and military preparations in the territories along our borders,\u201d Russia\u2019s envoy to NATO, Aleksandr Grushko, said on Monday.\\n\u201cSo, a question arises: What\u2019s next? A new wave of NATO speculation about a \u2018Russian threat\u2019 and a new arms race?\u201d the diplomat added. \u201cWe believe this is a road to nowhere.\u201d\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742561893.7803679}
