In this way, the financial systems of the world can be manipulated into a managed collapse, thereby causing global chaos so that the world\u2019s nations and citizens can be tricked into demanding a global currency managed by a global elite. \\nProblem, reaction, solution. Economic hit man John Perkins wrote about this strategy as it was used in the 20th century to bring developing nations under the control of the international monetary fund and transnational profiteers, and at present this scheme is being globalized. \\n\u201cIf an EHM is completely successful, the loans are so large that the debtor is forced to default on its payments after a few years. When this happens, then like the Mafia we demand our pound of flesh. This often includes one or more of the following: control over United Nations votes, the installation of military bases, or access to precious resources such as oil or the Panama Canal. Of course, the debtor still owes us the money\u2014and another country is added to our global empire.\u201d ~John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man \\nFor decades now, the dollar has been in a slow burn style of collapse, and while many journalists, primarily outside of the mainstream, have been warning the world about how and why this is happening, we\u2019re quickly approaching a turning point, where the slow burn moves into something more severe. While at first glance this seems like a frightening potentiality, the truth is that an economic collapse may very well be our best chance at freeing ourselves from the rule of the Gods of Money . A Whistleblower Warns Us and Gives Us Hope \\nSpeaking to Greg Hunter of USA Watchdog news , former Wall Street banker and former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in the first Bush Administration , Catherine Austin Fitts explains why the slow burn is about to come to an end. \\n\u201cThe system has the capacity with monetary policy in one sense to keep going forever if the force and military capacity is there to do it, but at some point, you burn through the fat, you burn through the muscle and then you have to change institutions.\u201d ~ Catherine Austin Fitts \\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008, the government was able to prevent an uncontrolled firestorm collapse of the system by colluding with the chiefs of the financial sector, giving them bailouts of extraordinary magnitude , then inflating the dollar by the Federal Reserve\u2019s introduction of quantitative easing . Eight years later, this tactic has reached its limit, however it has given the public significant reason and time to understand why our economy functions the way it does, and people are losing faith in our leadership. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to get people to continue to pay their taxes when they\u2019re highly confident the money\u2019s not being spent legally and it\u2019s going to the advantage of small parties or things that they don\u2019t understand. And so you can\u2019t move further without institutional overhaul.\u201d ~Catherine Austin Fitts \\nThe thing that frightens her most is the fact that groups within the U.S., such as ALEC , are already calling for changes in the law and even a new constitutional convention to overhaul these institutions. The financial sector has already been operating outside of the law and beyond the constitution for some twenty plus years, and if we haven\u2019t been using the constitution, she notes, then why do they wish to change it? \\n\u201cIf you want to enforce the Constitution or fix things, that\u2019s what you do. The reason you get a Constitutional Convention is you want to tear it up because you\u2019re worried, now that people realize the extent of the corruption, that they\u2019re going to try and enforce.\u201d ~Catherine Austin Fitts \\nHer warning is that as people continue to wake up to the corruption of our government and financial rulers, the entrenched elites who are fully invested in destroying the middle class will fight tooth and nail to prevent us from holding them accountable, by means of bringing more Draconian laws into place to protect themselves. \\nIn this light, the economic war that is brewing isn\u2019t completely technical, it is social as well, quickly becoming class warfare. The world\u2019s financial elite are in grave danger of being held to the fire for their crimes, and surely they know they how quickly things can change in favor of the populous, as historical events like the French Revolution have shown. Prepare Now \\nAs individuals stuck in the debt-slave matrix , there is very little we can do to challenge this sort of massive global scheme as it\u2019s happening, however, preparing now for collapse is our best chance of chucking our burden of debt to these people, if they are even human , and of creating a future without such obvious criminal financial tyranny holding us back. \\nWorking now to expose these criminals is imperative so that when the ball drops, ordinary people understand why, how and who is truly to blame, thereby making resisting to the takeover possible. Taking care of personal emergency preparations by gathering healthy storable foods , networking in your community, and having plans in place to survive are absolutely necessary at this stage, and once this is done, efforts to awaken others are critical. \\nView the full interview here : Read more articles by Isaac Davis . \\nIsaac Davis is a staff writer for WakingTimes.com and OffgridOutpost.com Survival Tips blog.
