[The announcement comes after a tumultuous process for the bill, which has seen previously scheduled votes pulled after Speaker Paul Ryan failed to accumulate enough Republican support on prior attempts to pass the bill.  House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) stepped up and helped negotiate, with Tuesday Group   Rep. Tom MacArthur ( ) a revised version of the bill \u2014  dubbed the MacArthur amendment \u2014  that revived the effort and collected presumably enough Republican votes to pass the bill. Meadows\u2019 efforts in no small part seem to have succeeded where Ryan failed, rallying his House Republican colleagues behind a   campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014  despite the fact this bill doesn\u2019t constitute a full repeal of the previous president\u2019s signature law. Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, and others have worked alongside congressional Republicans, especially Meadows \u2014  who has emerged as a force in the negotiating process so strong some have begun calling him the acting speaker of the House in the wake of Ryan\u2019s failures \u2014  to bring the new bill to the brink of passage. Vice President Mike Pence visited the Capitol building Wednesday afternoon to reassure lawmakers about the Obamacare repeal bill.

He said: Not only have we made good progress, we have to get give a good shout out to Tom MacArthur and the President and the Vice President for their efforts in the last couple of weeks. It would be a mistake to suggest that had Tom MacArthur, the President, and the Vice President have not gotten involved in this process, then we would not have the options now for everyone to consider. Tom has worked closely hard with Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden and the committee to make sure that what we do is keeping in line with repealing and replacing Obamacare and drives down premiums and keeps   conditions. Meadows told Breitbart News, \u201cI fully expect that we will repeal most aspects of Obamacare by the end of May. It may have been a deterrent in the first 100 days, but by the end of the first 120 days or so it will be seen as a significant accomplishment. It\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish, as the song used to say. We will have an excellent finish. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562975.5877326}
