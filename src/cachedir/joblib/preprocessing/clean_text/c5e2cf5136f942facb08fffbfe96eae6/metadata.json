A scant six months later, Mr. Posen was host to a somewhat less lustrous contingent, one that included Malin Akerman, Kelly Bensimon and Olivia Culpo. (Who?) Last February, Claire Danes, Laura Linney and Amy Schumer lent their aggregate star power to Narciso Rodriguez\u2019s show. By September, the designer\u2019s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by Jessica Alba and Jessica Seinfeld. So it went. And now, on the eve of another round of New York shows, it seems safe to predict a similar thinning of celebrity ranks, as top film and music personalities disappear from their gilded   perches, their dwindling presence matched only, some say, by their diminishing impact. \u201cYou can still expect to see certain celebrities in the front row,\u201d said Tommy Hilfiger, who began trumpeting his alignment with entertainment world players as far back as the 1980s. But these days, Mr. Hilfiger suggested, designers and major Seventh Avenue brands need to rethink their marketing strategies. In itself, he said, \u201ca star\u2019s presence does nothing to move the needle. \u201d That realization, somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles, accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance. \u201cIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the shows were really \u201d said Billy Farrell, who heads BFA, an events photography agency. \u201cAs a house photographer, I used to get a long list of faces. Now at any given show, one or a maximum of five celebrities are guaranteed to go backstage or sit in the front row wearing the designer clothes. \u201d That paucity of   personalities is ascribed to a string of factors: celebrity overexposure, a generalized fashion fatigue and, chief among them, shrinking fashion budgets. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have as much money as they used to, and they\u2019re scared,\u201d said Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist. Aware that the payoff may be negligible, many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of, say, a Jessica Chastain, a Julianne Moore or, for that matter, a Lady Gaga, pop culture luminaries who, once they arrive, may or may not deign to speak to the press. For designers, the topic is a touchy one. Among those who declined to comment were Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig of Marchesa, Carolina Herrera, Marc Jacobs, Mr. Rodriguez, Jeremy Scott, Diane von Furstenberg, Alexander Wang and Vera Wang. But publicists and others strategizing behind the scenes were more voluble, citing, among other causes, a certain jadedness among consumers. \u201cPeople can tell it\u2019s a paid front row,\u201d Ms. Cutrone said. \u201cDoes anyone really believe that Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger are going to Seven jeans because they like Seven jeans?\u201d More troubling, still, is the widening view that fashion itself is losing much of its vaunted cachet. \u201cThe shows are not cool anymore,\u201d said Teri Agins, the author of the 2014 book \u201cHijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers,\u201d which chronicles the evolution of the celebrity front row. European houses may still attract stars of a certain caliber, Ms. Agins noted, some drawn by Europe\u2019s cachet, others compelled by   cosmetic and marketing contracts. But in New York, she said, \u201cthe novelty is gone. \u201d Oversaturation has played a role. In recent years, invitations were issued, vetted and approved by teams of publicists, Hollywood agents,   stylists and, as often as not, the stars themselves, many of whom are snapped each season hopscotching from show to show, their influence diluted by their ubiquity. \u201cWe sort of cooked our golden goose,\u201d said James LaForce, a veteran fashion publicist. \u201cAt the end of the day, all their pictures seemed to run together. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at the end of that cycle now,\u201d he added. \u201cIt feels   something from another era. \u201d By most accounts, that era dawned in the early to   when the shows, once scattered in showrooms, galleries and ballrooms all over town, were brought together under the tents at Bryant Park. At the time designer front rows were judiciously seeded with \u201cfriends of the house,\u201d among them society figures, and the occasional television personality, Broadway ing\u00e9nue or authentic megastar. \u201cThey were people we dressed, people I often had dinner with, people whose children we knew and sometimes dressed,\u201d the designer Dennis Basso said. At Mr. Basso\u2019s fashion extravaganzas over the years, Diane Sawyer might have been seen rubbing shoulders with Ivana Trump, Martha Stewart spied sitting flank to flank alongside Mary J. Blige. \u201cThe celebrity front row was a form of preshow entertainment,\u201d Mr. Basso recalled. It generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide. In that seemingly innocent era, shows were   trade events, largely the province of store buyers, journalists and a smattering of   ladies who lunched. That picture altered in the   when Uma Thurman wore a   Prada dress to the Oscars. \u201cIt was a sort of milestone,\u201d said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York, \u201ca sign that it was groovy for a designer to dress a celebrity. \u201d So groovy, in fact, that before long the celebrity front row went from a mildly provocative attraction to fashion\u2019s main event, transforming, as Ms. Agins writes, \u201cwhat was once a clubby ritual for fashion insiders into a multiplatform extravaganza showcased in print, on TV and everywhere on the internet. \u201d In those heady days, she observed, the front row itself became part of the content of fashion show. Today, some argue, that content is debased. \u201cWhat constitutes a celebrity now has changed,\u201d said Fern Mallis, a fashion consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer necessarily that   Hollywood diva. \u201d The diva, it seems, has ceded her power to models and social media megastars like Gigi Hadid, Kylie Jenner and Irina Shayk, pop idols who bring to the table a large internet following but lack the gravitas of Ms. Chastain and her rarefied peers. \u201cThe rise of celebrity bloggers, reality stars and others who are famous simply for being famous turns a lot of people off,\u201d said Leslie Sloane, a prominent Hollywood publicist. \u201cThose girls may be lovely, but they\u2019re not fashion. \u201d Just as   is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum. Lady Gaga appeared last season at the show of Brandon Maxwell, her    posing gamely for photographers but turning away reporters. Also taking no interviews were Ms. Holmes at Zac Posen, and Zo\u00ea Kravitz and Ms. Jenner at Alexander Wang, whose show in September was one of the few that attracted marquee names like Madonna and her daughter Lourdes. That kind of drawing power does not come cheap. Hard figures are elusive, but insiders estimate that fees for attendance can range from $25, 000 to more than $100, 000. In the   practice known industrywide as    an   attraction like Angelina Jolie could command close to $1 million, Mr. Hilfiger said. Such sums, which vary according to a celebrity\u2019s clout, are expected to cover the cost of   airfare and hotel accommodations, as well as wardrobe, hair, makeup and other amenities. They are   numbers, for sure. But just two or three years ago, they were routinely factored into many designers\u2019 marketing budgets. In distributing funds, Mr. LaForce said, \u201cwe would game the situation. \u201d It was a little like a commodities market, sums parceled out \u201cbased on who was available and who would take what,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cStill, in the end we would say it was absolutely worth it. \u201d For some designers, it still is. \u201cTo have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense of heightened reality,\u201d said Michael Kors, whose celebrity turnout last season included Emily Blunt Cynthia Erivo, the   winning Broadway star and Sienna Miller. \u201cYou see the clothes on the runway, then you see our clothes from the last show on the celebrities in the front row, and you get it. The message has come full circle. \u201d No one would argue that the fame game is entirely played out. But for some designers, attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars. \u201cA handful of supermodels out there have enormous social media followings, Gigi Hadid being the leader,\u201d Mr. Hilfiger said. \u201cShe\u2019s the girl next door with an exotic twist. \u201d (Ms. Hadid\u2019s mother is Dutch her father is Palestinian.) Mr. Hilfiger was prompt to exploit Ms. Hadid\u2019s growing global appeal, enlisting her to walk his runway, appear in his advertising campaigns and design a capsule collection of her own. The success of those moves was measurable, he said, in 2. 2 million social media impressions, a 900 percent increase in total   over the previous year, and tens of millions in sales of the Hadid line. Plenty of people were impressed, among them designers of an altogether different ilk. \u201cWe understand the power involved in that alignment we won\u2019t pretend that we don\u2019t,\u201d said Ryan Lobo, who, with Ramon Martin, designs Tome, a collection aimed largely at a haute bohemian clientele. Mr. Lobo and Mr. Martin, however, prefer a nuanced approach that takes celebrity marketing back to its roots. At their shows they tend to seat loyalists, prominent clients like the artists Shirin Neshat and Kara Walker, alongside such    personalities as Sandra Bernhard. \u201cWe aim to make the mix intriguing,\u201d Mr. Lobo said, \u201clike a dinner party with people who don\u2019t normally have access to each other. \u201d Picking up the analogy, Mr. Martin added: \u201cThese people are our personal icons, and there will be others. You know we\u2019re always going to add a chair to the end of the table. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562013.2977116}
