Trump publicly retreated from his \u201cbirther\u201d campaign on Friday, tersely acknowledging that President Obama was born in the United States  \u2014   and effectively conceding that the conspiracy theory he had promoted for years was baseless. Mr. Trump made no apology for and took no questions about what had amounted to a    smear of the nation\u2019s first black president. Instead, he claimed, falsely, that questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s citizenship were initially stirred by the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, in her unsuccessful primary contest against Mr. Obama in 2008. Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s brief remarks, tacked on to the end of a campaign appearance with military veterans at his new hotel in downtown Washington, represented a sharp reversal from a position he had publicly maintained, over howls of outrage from all but the   extreme of the political spectrum, since 2011. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNow, we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. \u201d Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump sought to stoke interest in his eventual statement on his birther views, telling Fox Business that he would save his views for the   event at his hotel because \u201cwe have to keep the suspense going. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of and refusal to disavow the birther issue helped drive his standing among black voters to historically low levels, with some public opinion polls showing him supported by zero percent of  . Given his other racially incendiary statements, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides privately say they fear he will be unable to shake free of charges that he is racist, a label that has stuck to him with deleterious effect, polls show. Mindful that the birther issue could also haunt Mr. Trump in his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, on Sept. 26, his aides tried for several days to put it to rest. But Mr. Trump himself revived the issue late Thursday, declining in an interview with The Washington Post to acknowledge that Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii. In his brief remarks, Mr. Trump leveled the accusation  \u2014   which his supporters have been pressing for weeks  \u2014   that Mrs. Clinton first raised doubts eight years ago about Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace. \u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI finished it. \u201d During the 2008 Democratic contest, a senior strategist for Mrs. Clinton at one point pondered, in an internal memo that was later leaked, the ways in which Mr. Obama\u2019s personal background differed from those of many Americans. But contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion, neither Mrs. Clinton nor her campaign ever publicly questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s citizenship or birthplace. The topic was such a fringe issue within the Republican Party that in 2011, conservatives, including Ann Coulter, now a vocal Trump supporter, called on Mr. Trump to stop pursuing it. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, in a statement late Thursday, tried to argue that he had actually \u201cended\u201d the birther issue. Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman, Jason Miller, asserted  \u2014   also falsely  \u2014   that Mr. Trump had \u201cobtained\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate the president actually released the   version in 2011. \u201cMr. Trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on Friday came after Mr. Obama, in a brief exchange with reporters at the White House, again expressed scorn for the subject. \u201cI was pretty confident about where I was born,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most people were as well. My hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that. \u201d Two of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers  \u2014   his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York  \u2014   said in recent days that Mr. Trump had come to believe that Mr. Obama was born in the United States. But Mr. Trump refused to say so. \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Washington Post interview. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to answer it yet. \u201d The Clinton campaign made clear that it would not let Mr. Trump slide on the subject. In a speech to the  Black Women\u2019s Agenda symposium in Washington on Friday  \u2014   before Mr. Trump made his statement  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump owed Mr. Obama and the country an apology. \u201cFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cHis campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. \u201d She added, \u201cThere is no erasing it in history. \u201d Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Mr. Trump was making such pronounced racial attacks that critics had struggled to adjust. \u201cOne of things that we are all used to in this business is dog whistles,\u201d Mr. Clyburn said. \u201cBut the thing that we are not used to, and I\u2019m finding it very difficult to get used to, are the howls of wolves. These are howls. These are not whistles. \u201d Mr. Trump must improve his standing with suburban moderates who shrink from backing someone accused of racism. But his remarks on Friday seemed unlikely to make much of a dent. Connie Keys, 54, a    mother in Montclair, N. J. said Mr. Trump still seemed not to accept Mr. Obama as presidential. \u201cHe makes it sounds like, \u2018I should be thanked, I should be applauded, because I\u2019m the one who finally told the country that the president was born here,\u2019 when in fact the voters decided that for themselves when we elected President Obama twice,\u201d said Ms. Keys, who is white. The birther issue brought Mr. Trump attention and vaulted him to the front of Republican primary polls in 2011 as he considered a White House bid. He claimed, without ever offering evidence, that he had hired investigators, and said they \u201ccannot believe what they\u2019re finding. \u201d Mr. Obama, frustrated by the degree to which questions about his citizenship were spreading and attention was being diverted from federal budget discussions, released his   birth certificate that April. \u201cWe do not have time for this kind of silliness,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump, who was en route to New Hampshire for a political trip at the time, took a victory lap. \u201cI am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,\u201d he told reporters. But he still refused to accept that Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate was authentic. \u201cWe have to look at it to see if it\u2019s real,\u201d he said. On Friday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said he was glad that Mr. Trump \u201cnow rejects the crazy idea President Obama wasn\u2019t born in America. \u201d But he warned that this would not end the discussion. \u201cThe problem he\u2019ll have is that he was a leader of this movement,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he did the country a service, himself a service or the party a service by pushing this so hard and so long. \u201d Democrats seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks as a litmus test for Republican candidates. \u201cHe continues to disqualify himself, and yet Republican Senate candidates continue to stand by his side,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She said Republican candidates needed to say \u201cif they think Donald Trump should apologize to the American people for the absurd lies he has spread about President Obama and why they continue to support a campaign that provides a safe harbor for this type of disgusting race baiting. \u201d Mr. Trump took no questions after his remarks about Mr. Obama. As reporters shouted questions, he smiled and left the room. Not long after, the structure holding up the curtain that had provided a backdrop for his remarks collapsed, sending American flags toppling to the ground. No one was hurt.'"}, "time": 1742562145.8644931}
