[The video shows a group of cartel members on their hands and knees wearing bras and other lingerie crawling on the floor while other kick them and shout various insults. The   inmates are forced to clean one of the common areas inside the Apodaca state prison.   Some of the insults shouted by the inmates point to the humiliated cartel members being members of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of the Zetas cartel. Breitbart Texas has reported in the past that the CDN has been fighting a territorial war with a rival faction of the Zetas called \u201cVieja Escuela Z\u201d or Old School Z. It remains unclear if the inmates humiliating the CDN are rivals or members of the same faction who have switched sides.  One of the men on the floor has been identified as Daniel Gustavo \u201cEl Muletas\u201d Valencia Trevi\u00f1o. A regional leader within the CDN, he was named Muletas or \u201cCrutches\u201d due to the loss of his leg. Valencia Trevi\u00f1o was arrested in late February by Mexican authorities.  It remains unclear when the video was taken, however Nuevo Leon authorities confirmed to Breitbart Texas that  as soon as the video surfaced, they carried out a series of raids at the prisons in Apodaca and Topo Chico where they seized a cell phone, various shanks, and some small remnants of marijuana.

The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
