In fact, it isn\u2019t even the first time this month. \\nFrom an October 14 report by Arab News : \\n\u201c Saudi and Chinese armed forces began the \u2018Exploration 2016\u2019 joint military exercise on Wednesday. \\n\u201cSpecial Forces of the Royal Saudi Land Forces and their counterparts in the Red Army were involved in the war games in the Chinese city of Chengdu. \u201d \\nIn a speech given during the drill\u2019s launching ceremony, Lieutenant Colonel Walid Ettalhi \u201c stressed that the two countries\u2019 relationship is based on ties of brotherhood, friendship and the great history, \u201d according to Arab News . \\n\u201c The exercises aim to exchange experiences between the two sides in specialized areas. This comes within the framework of military cooperation between the two countries, and is an extension of the strong relationship between the Kingdom and the People\u2019s Republic of China, \u201d the Lt. Col. said. \\nOctober\u2019s joint military drills come after China and Saudi Arabia inked 17 cooperative agreements at the tail end of August. According to China\u2019s Xinhua news agency, deals covered a wide range of areas, including \u201c politics, energy, finance, investment, housing, water resources, quality inspection, science, technology and culture. \u201d \\nThe news of China buddying up with Saudi Arabia in such ways may be jarring to some, as it doesn\u2019t conform to the mainstream narrative of Saudi Arabia as an unwavering U.S. outpost in the Middle East \u2014 one that could never work with the likes of China, the principle ally of the big bad Russians. \\nBut then, neither does the idea that the Russians would be willing to work with U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. And yet, it appears this is precisely what\u2019s about to happen. \\nOn Sunday, it was reported that Saudi Arabia is now ready to cooperate with Russia in an effort to stabilize global oil prices. Russia, it seems, is receptive to the idea, with its energy minister viewing the invitation as a \u201c clear indication of a sincere desire to continue cooperation and coordination with the oil producing and exporting countries for more stability in the market. \u201d \\nEarlier this week, Anti-Media put forth the idea that the Russian fleet now steaming toward the Mediterranean Sea may have designs far beyond the fighting in Syria. It may, in fact, be Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s first military step toward securing the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline. \\nThat report was followed up by an article on Underground Reporter that explored the notion further. Citing recent deals with India, Pakistan, and Vietnam \u2014 not to mention those with formerly staunch U.S. allies such as Turkey, Egypt and the Philippines \u2014 that piece concluded that Putin, in coordination with China, may be making a play for the coastline of the entire northern Indian Ocean. \\nWhether or not this is true, certain things are becoming clear. Most apparent, though, is that the mainstream narratives are breaking down. If this weren\u2019t the case, Saudi Arabia wouldn\u2019t be extending an olive branch to Russia \u2014 and Chinese special forces wouldn\u2019t now training with those of the Saudis in an atmosphere of \u201c brotherhood, friendship and the great history. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563256.3942378}
