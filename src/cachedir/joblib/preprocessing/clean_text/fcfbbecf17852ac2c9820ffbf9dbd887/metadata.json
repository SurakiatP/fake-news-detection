[Botha, better known for his prowess as a leopard and lion hunter, led hunting excursions with his company Game and Hounds Safaris. The    father of five paid the ultimate price by choosing to lead a safari to hunt wild elephants, when he mistakenly steered his party into a herd of breeding pachyderms.   One elephant charged the hunters and surprised Botha by picking him up with his trunk, reported the Daily Wire. A fellow hunter shot the   creature to save Botha, but it crashed to the ground and crushed Botha to death. Many who knew Botha described him as a \u201cpassionate and professional hunting pioneer,\u201d and paid tribute to him on his company\u2019s website: \u201cRIP Theunis Botha. Our heartfelt condolences to Carike and family. He was a great man! So sad!\u201d \u201cA legend has fallen but will never be forgotten  \u2026     It\u2019s with a sad heart that we say goodbye to you Oom Theunis Botha. \u201d \u201cOur deepest condolences to the family. May God be with you all in this difficult time. \u201d Botha\u2019s daughter posted pictures of her father, including one of them together after shooting a gazelle a few years back.  The hunter had his detractors as well. Commenters posting on his 2012 YouTube safari video (below) demonstrated their glee that Botha was killed. \u201dKarma took care of you! ,\u201d \u201cHey a**hole. I hope you rot in hell,\u201d and \u201cI am super glad he got what was coming to him,\u201d commenters wrote. '"}, "time": 1742564414.8753672}
