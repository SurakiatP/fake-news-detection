Hadi was \u201celected\u201d to a two-year term in office in early 2012, and resigned in 2015, but insists he remains the rightful ruler of the nation. \\nThe Shi\u2019ite Houthis, who had previously ruled out any deal in which Hadi was returned to power, expressed support for the UN plan as a \u201c basis for discussion .\u201d The deal would force Hadi\u2019s main deputy to resign, and give Hadi little to no real power. \\nHadi\u2019s rejection, assuming it is upheld by his Saudi backers, means a continuation of the war, and greatly increases the likelihood that Yemen as a unified nation is over. The nation is already in a state of de facto split, and roughly on the same borders as before the 1990 unification. \\nThis may ultimately make more sense for Yemen at any rate, resolving long-standing secessionist ambitions in the south, and leaving Hadi with control of South Yemen, where he is from, and where his limited political support is centered. \\nThe Saudis are unlikely to accept such a solution, however, as it would leave a North Yemen dominated by the Houthis and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s political allies with a substantial border with Saudi Arabia after a bloody Saudi-instigated war against them. \\nWhile a unity deal in which Hadi gets only token power would allow the Saudis to claim some measure of \u201cvictory\u201d in their war, a formal separation would be much harder to spin, and would leave them with a very resentful neighbor on their southern border.
