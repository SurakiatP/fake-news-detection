The remarks were made during a conference call between Clinton\u2019s shell-shocked campaign team and several backers of Clinton\u2019s campaign, such as donor J.B. Pritzker, Ready PAC co-founder Allida Black, and political strategist Maria Cardona. The contents of the private call were reported by The Hill , which spoke to one of the Clinton backers on the call. Clinton campaign spokesman Jennifer Palmieri didn\u2019t mince words in describing how brutal Clinton\u2019s upset defeat was, according to The Hill. \u201cThirty-six hours after the most devastating loss in the history of American politics, we\u2019re looking at a white board right now with lots of ideas,\u201d said Palmieri said. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of figuring out what we need to do this week, and what we need Democrats to do in the next two months ahead of the inaugural.\u201d Other aides, meanwhile, tried to shift blame for the shocking defeat away from the campaign and onto the media. \u201cThe media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election, but covered Trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass,\u201d said Podesta. \u201cWe need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward.\u201d Podesta also pointed a finger at FBI Director James Comey, who resurrected the matter of Clinton\u2019s private email server in the final weekend. Podesta said the \u201cdominance of the way [the media] covered the emails\u201d caused them to drown out issues like Trump\u2019s income taxes or his alleged links to Russia. The campaign\u2019s explanations apparently didn\u2019t do much to remedy the agony of defeat. Black began crying during the call, according to The Hill. \\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment... '"}, "time": 1742564270.40249}
