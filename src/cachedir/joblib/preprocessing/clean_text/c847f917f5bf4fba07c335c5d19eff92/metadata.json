C. Just as she arrived through the squall to meet her groom at the altar, a gust blew her veil into the sky. \u201cIt went flying, right off my head,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m over six feet tall, so people thought it looked very glamorous. \u201d During a very wet April and May on the East Coast, many couples learned the hard way that a perfect (or at least nearly perfect) wedding does not require perfect weather. \u201cDid my guests get wet? Yes, kind of,\u201d said Minoo Fadaifard Wade, who married John Wade in a drizzle on May 21 at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in front of a crowd of 82. \u201cIt was chilly, too. But nobody complained. Everybody made the best of it. We were all lighthearted. \u201d Should rain clouds threaten your wedding, here are some tips on how to salvage that perfect day, provided by couples who have managed to do just that. Rain was expected on May 22, the day Jill Jacinto, 30, was to marry Sander van den Bergh, 31, on the outdoor terrace of Battery Gardens, a New York restaurant. But she held out hope that the day would clear by the ceremony\u2019s 4:30 p. m. start time. \u201cI gave up on checking weather. com the night before and assumed an indoor ceremony was in our future and out of our hands,\u201d said Ms. Jacinto, an associate director at an investment firm. \u201cBut then 30 minutes before the start time, the sun came out. \u201d The couple was able to swiftly switch from their Plan B  \u2014   an   sheltered space  \u2014   to the patio, their Plan A. \u201cWe ended up with a gorgeous ceremony,\u201d Ms. Jacinto said. \u201cBut we were ready for whatever happened. \u201d At Mariana Rodrigues and David Rothschild\u2019s May 21 wedding at Cherry Hill in Central Park, rain began falling as guests boarded   buses bound for a reception at the NoMad Hotel. \u201cThe bus driver was really kind and offered everyone on the upper deck ponchos, but I was pretty upset,\u201d said Mrs. Rothschild, 32, a former financial executive. \u201cThen I was upset with myself for being upset, and David reminded me that that was absolutely warranted, that I was allowed to have that moment. \u201d She did not let the moment last, though. \u201cI realized it wasn\u2019t perfect but it was a great celebration,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to remember that the weather is out of your control, and just enjoy yourself. \u201d Erin McGrail and Elliot Fleming invited 150 guests to their June 2014 wedding under a stately oak tree at the Destrehan Plantation, just outside New Orleans. Thirty minutes before the ceremony, the sky turned black. \u201cThen it just started pouring torrentially in that typical New Orleans way,\u201d Mrs. Fleming, 28, said. Instead of panicking as she watched friends and family run for shelter at a gift shop, she played it cool. \u201cAt first I took it badly,\u201d Mrs. Fleming said. \u201cThen I saw how upset my mom was. So I said to myself, \u2018Stay calm, we can figure this out. \u2019\u201d The wedding was moved to the reception site nearby, where guests were seated at decorated tables. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter: At that point I had just accepted it for what it was,\u201d said Mrs. Fleming, who works in purchasing at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans. Looking back, she added, she wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \u201cYour state of mind is going to determine your guests\u2019 state of mind,\u201d said Constantino Khalaf. Mr. Khalaf, 36, married David Khalaf, 38, on May 14 in Cathedral Park in Portland, Ore. the couple\u2019s hometown, under drizzly skies with the occasional hard rain. There was no shelter for their 65 guests. \u201cWe warned people far in advance to bring their umbrellas and raincoats, because we knew getting married in May in Portland was like playing Russian roulette with the weather,\u201d said David Khalaf, who runs the Christian website Modern Kinship with his husband. Then they made the best of it. During the reception, held at the wedding site, \u201cWe all huddled together to stay warm, and we danced in the rain,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just like, \u2018Hey, this is a beautiful occasion, let\u2019s dance in the rain,\u2019 everybody is going to pick up on that,\u201d \u201cThe first advice I would give is: Ask all your vendors what their rain policies are, and read the contracts closely,\u201d said Mrs. Mallory Moore, the bride whose veil wouldn\u2019t stay put and who is also an assistant United States attorney with the Western District of North Carolina. That includes contracts with musicians. \u201cSome live musicians who play string instruments won\u2019t play in dampness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a trio of horn players, so it worked out for us. But it might not have if we had a violinist. \u201d She also was not sure how her florist would handle broken vases several were smashed in the storm. The couple was not charged. \u201cBut you really have to pay attention to that stuff,\u201d Mrs. Mallory Moore said. Rachel Bowie felt personally responsible when the rain started coming down on May 13 at Jane\u2019s Carousel in Brooklyn, where 99 guests had gathered to watch her and Matthew Dorville get married. \u201cIt was Friday the 13th. We sort of asked for it,\u201d she said. But she was glad she remembered a tip from her photographer: buy a lot of clear umbrellas. \u201cThey don\u2019t cast a shadow on your face,\u201d said Mrs. Bowie, 33, an editor who lives in Brooklyn. If she had to do it over again, she would have asked a friend to pack galoshes for her, too. \u201cRight before I walked down the aisle my shoes were so wet I was slipping in them. I had been jumping through those gross, deceptively deep New York City puddles. \u201d Hurricane Irene was an uninvited guest at the August 2011 wedding of Jacqueline Shea and Matthew Bailey of Eatontown, N. J. When the bride was getting her nails done in preparation for the rehearsal dinner, an evacuation was ordered for an area that included the wedding site on the beach near Asbury Park.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI was in denial, like, this is not happening,\u201d said Mrs. Bailey, 35, a teacher of the deaf. The couple married that night at a local restaurant. Flowers were assembled from Trader Joe\u2019s, and the bride\u2019s mother bought a sheet cake from ShopRite.\u201d \u2019Then, vendors refused to refund deposits for the wedding. A year later, the couple appeared on Anderson Cooper\u2019s   talk show, \u201cAnderson,\u201d ostensibly to warn other couples about the need to buy wedding insurance. Instead, Mr. Cooper announced that the show was giving them a wedding redo, including a reception at the Wilshire Grand Hotel in West Orange, N. J. and a trip to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, to renew their vows on the beach. The Baileys now have two children, ages 1 and 2\u00bd, and more perspective on   disasters. \u201cI think what happened to us is sort of like a precursor to what everybody finds out once they\u2019re married,\u201d Mrs. Bailey said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s that there are ups and there are downs in married life, sometimes big ones. What you do is you make the most of it, no matter what. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561848.3214278}
