Perry, who started identifying as transgender earlier this year, was using the female facilities to change for gym classes, which upset many other girls at the school. \\nThey objected that Perry, who has not had any gender reassignment therapy, is still biologically male , Fox News reported. \\nPerry, who wears a wig, makeup and skirts to school, used to use a unisex facilities meant for staff \u2013 but decided for this academic year she wanted to be allowed in the girls\u2019 bathrooms . \\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019m not going to expose myself. I\u2019m not a pervert. I\u2019m a transgender woman. I\u2019m a girl. I\u2019m just in there to change, do my business, and\u2026 if they have any questions about being transgender, they are more than welcome to talk to me, and I\u2019ll be happy to explain it.\u2019 \\nOne student, Sophie Beel, told local station Fox 2 St Louis : \u2018I find it offensive because Lila has not went through any procedure to become female, putting on a dress and putting on a wig is not transgender to me\u2019. \\nThe unrest comes as transgender issues are taking a higher profile on the national stage, partly thanks to the highly public transition of Caitlyn Jenner from her former identity as Bruce. \\nAccording to the St Louis Post-Dispatch , the protest lasted for two hours before school officials told students to go back inside. \\nDuring the demonstration, Perry was locked in a staff member\u2019s office because there were fears for her safety. \\nThe paper reported that some of the students protesting supported Perry\u2019s right to use the bathroom she wants to, though most were in opposition. Tammy Sorden, a mother of a Hillsboro High student, said: \u2018The girls have rights, and they shouldn\u2019t have to share a bathroom with a boy.\u2019 She said she objected to Perry being given what she asks for \u2018while the girls just have to suck it up\u2019. \\nThe School Board also organized a meeting to deal with the situation, which attracted a large crowd of parents last Thursday, where school officials pointed out that denying fair access to a transgender student could bring reprisals from the federal government. \\nPerry has since dropped gym class due to the outcry, but still intends to use female bathrooms. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742563502.8375087}
