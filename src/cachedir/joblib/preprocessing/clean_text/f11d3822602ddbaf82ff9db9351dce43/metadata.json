[Madrid authorities on Monday started putting up signs banning the practice of \u2018manspreading\u2019  \u2014   opening one\u2019s legs so wide you invade other\u2019s seating space  \u2014  on city buses as part of their new etiquette guidelines.  EMT municipal transportation company says the sign is designed to discourage physical postures that bother people. The sign features an illustration of a man with splayed legs with a red \u2018X\u2019 above. The text beneath urges passengers to \u201crespect the space of others. \u201d There are no sanctions or fines for those indulging in the practice. The bus company incorporated the ban following an internet signature campaign by a woman\u2019s group, Mujeres en Lucha (Fighting Women). In their campaign petition, the women said it was a \u201cvery common practice. \u201d La @EMTmadrid a\u00f1ade una nueva se\u00f1al a bordo del bus para evitar el #manspreading: \u201dRespeta el espacio de los dem\u00e1s\u201d. https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Ayuntamiento Madrid (@MADRID) June 6, 2017,  \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to see women with their legs closed and very uncomfortable because there\u2019s a man beside them who\u2019s invading their space with their legs,\u201d it added. The group said women were taught to sit with their legs together whereas men are ingrained with \u201cthe idea of territorial hierarchy, as if the space belongs to them. \u201d EMT said it felt its initiative, which also includes asking passengers not to eat or drink on buses, to keep their backpacks on or put their feet up on seats, was being well received. Again, there are no sanctions for any of these other requests. \u201cWhen a person opens their legs so wide it disturbs others, this is rude,\u201d said Alvaro Gomez Jordana Moya, 60, as he waited for a bus in Madrid. \u201cIt\u2019s also uncomfortable having to ask someone, \u2018Please, can you close your legs\u2019. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a problem because people don\u2019t respect seating,\u201d said another bus passenger Maria Carmen Ventosa, 46. \u201cIt should change things, if only out of respect for others. \u201d Madrid\u2019s underground train company said it had no plans to follow suit.'"}, "time": 1742562812.3223593}
