Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/obama-pushes-fake-news-talking-point.html This piece can be seen as a continuation of \" Red Alert: The War on Alternative Media Has Begun .\" As Democrats and Hillary Clinton supporters come to terms with a Donald Trump administration, the \u2018fake news won him the election\u2019 talking point was pushed to new heights as the outgoing president suggested \u2018fake\u2019 media websites are undermining the political process. \u201cIf we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not\u2026 if we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,\u201d Obama said during a news conference in Germany. Obama suggested that \u2018fake news\u2019 affects voter opinions of candidates \u201cin an age where there is so much active misinformation, and it\u2019s packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or turn on your television.\u201dYes folks, the alternative or \u2018fake\u2019 media is now able to look the same as CNN, which interviews its own camera people and tells viewers that they are protesters. \u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to fight for.\u201d In other words, Obama is saying that the rigged playing field has now been leveled, and that\u2019s a problem for the establishment. \u201cPart of what\u2019s changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information,\u201d he went on to say, adding \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Yeah, because the mainstream media certainly doesn\u2019t engage in negative attacks or simplistic slogans. As we have documented, the \u2018fake news\u2019 talking point originated with a far left SJW writer , who spread around a list of websites to avoid if you want \u2018real news\u2019. The list included Infowars and Breitbart News. The idea is to attempt to force Google & Facebook to censor conservative websites. The talking point also dovetails with Twitter promising to purge numerous accounts belonging to members of the \u2018Alt-Right\u2019, egged on by partisan groups like The Southern Poverty Law Center. Other web tools, such as Quantcast jumped on the bandwagon and introduced tools to identify the so called \u2018fake news\u2019 sites. However, the move has rapidly backfired , as people quickly realized the whole talking point is part of a bitter backlash tantamount to censorship . Meanwhile, the Mainstream Media has been caught faking news countless times, which had serious consequences worldwide:'"}, "time": 1742628535.4752378}
