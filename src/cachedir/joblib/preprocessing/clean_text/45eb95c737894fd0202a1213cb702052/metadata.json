Prominent writers and bloggers on the far right attacked Mr. Trump. They accused him of turning against his voters by waging an attack that he had for years said would be a terrible idea. They also criticized him for launching the strike without first seeking congressional approval  \u2014   something he said on Twitter in 2013 would be a \u201cbig mistake. \u201d The most vocal in their outrage were leaders from the small but influential white nationalist movement. Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the conspiracy theorist site Infowars, said on Twitter that Trump \u201cwas just another deep   puppet. \u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m officially OFF the Trump train. \u201d Richard Spencer, a   activist and white nationalist who coined the term \u201c\u201d said he condemned the attack and hinted at supporting another presidential candidate in 2020: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democrat. Ms. Gabbard met with President Bashar   of Syria in January and on Thursday criticized the missile strike as shortsighted and reckless. For some on the far right, particularly those who are   Mr. Trump\u2019s strike crossed a line. But others praised the president for his quick military decision, which came three days after the Syrian government\u2019s deadly chemical weapons attack on its own people, including children. The radio host Hugh Hewitt said the missile launch was \u201cjustice for these children. \u201d Mark Levin, another conservative host, agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of you,\u201d he said of the president. Laura Ingraham, a conservative commentator, noted that the strike brought together three frequent critics of the president  \u2014   the Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona, as well as his Democratic opponent last fall, Hillary Clinton. The schism among the president\u2019s   supporters had been building since Mr. Trump said his attitude toward Syria had \u201cchanged very much\u201d after the chemical weapons attack. His comments signaled a discernible shift in White House policy, and from his stance during the presidential campaign. Some of those supporters claimed, without evidence, that the chemical weapons attack was a hoax carried out by the \u201cdeep state\u201d  \u2014   what they believe to be a nebulous network of military officials working behind the scenes  \u2014   to drag the United States into war. Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created Dilbert, wrote on his website on Thursday before the missile strike that the chemical weapons attack appeared to be a \u201cmanufactured event. \u201d A few hours before the missile strike, the   blogger Mike Cernovich warned his followers in a live video that the United States was going to attack Syria. \u201cRemind Trump who supported him,\u201d he told his viewers. \u201cWe got to stop him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628601.9651177}
