With the exception of a telephone call from President Obama, the show, which was recorded Friday at the Hollywood Bowl in front of 18, 000 people, ambled along the way it always has. There were pretty   songs an ad for Powdermilk Biscuits a   \u201cLives of the Cowboys\u201d skit a heartfelt version of \u201cEvery Time We Say Goodbye. \u201d The phone call was telling. The   Mr. Keillor refused to allow the conversation to be about himself. He praised Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cdignity and wit and humor\u201d and the fact he\u2019d \u201cnever had an awkward moment in all these years. \u201d When the president was finally allowed to speak about Mr. Keillor, he said, \u201cOne of the reasons I miss driving is that you kept me company. \u201d \u201cA Prairie Home Companion,\u201d he said, \u201cmade me feel better and more human. \u201d Mr. Keillor responded with awkward silence. The segment of the show that promised a bit of stronger emotional drama was Mr. Keillor\u2019s final monologue, his concluding \u201cNews from Lake Wobegon. \u201d And it delivered, in its way, by not trying too hard to deliver. It was, to borrow words the former New York Times critic Anatole Broyard once used to describe a middling Philip Roth novel, \u201creasonably funny, reasonably sad, reasonably interesting. \u201d If that sounds dismissive, it\u2019s not meant to be. Mr. Keillor has always worn his storytelling gifts casually. Here, he seemed to take a page from \u201cPontoon\u201d (2007) one of his Lake Wobegon novels, in which he wrote, \u201cYou get old and you realize there are no answers, just stories. \u201d Mr. Keillor liked to say that his fictional town\u2019s name, Wobegon, comes from an also fictional Indian word that means \u201cthe place where we waited all day in the rain [for you]. \u201d His final monologue was 17 minutes long and opened with a hymn to rain. About sunny days, he asked, \u201cHow many do we deserve?\u201d As a boy, he said, sunny days meant ruined days. He\u2019d have to go dig potatoes or play softball, for which he had no talent. How much more blissful to be indoors with an adventure novel. Mr. Keillor described a   day, even as the talk moved into the shadows. This monologue was a ghost tour, a rumination on impermanence. The narrator walked through his hometown and commented: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lived in one place for so long, you go back and you are in a museum. Everywhere you go, there are the dead. \u201d Mr. Keillor\u2019s fictional universe, in his radio shows and books, has often been compared to Sherwood Anderson\u2019s \u201cWinesburg, Ohio. \u201d The comparisons are apt. Like Anderson, Mr. Keillor has a feel for loneliness and isolation. In the final \u201cNews From Lake Wobegon,\u201d Mr. Keillor\u2019s narrator walks by the town\u2019s Chatterbox Cafe (\u201cthe place to go that\u2019s just like home\u201d) and recalls where various locals, now dead, used to sit. One of these is Jack, from Jack\u2019s Auto Repair, who made appearances in these monologues. In this monologue, Jack stood in for the listeners who dislike Mr. Keillor\u2019s show, who\u2019ve found it to be more Mayberry than Winesburg, an overly sugared Midwestern hot dish. (I sometimes felt this way, and have dialed the show out for years at time. On many other Saturday evenings over the decades, I\u2019ve been overjoyed to find it during a long drive. The show could indeed be good company.) \u201cJack never cared for my radio show and he told me every time he saw me,\u201d Mr. Keillor said. \u201cHe was a jazz guy. He did not care for sentimental songs about home. Though I did point out to him that half the sentimental songs about home are about wanting to leave home. \u201d Mr. Keillor reported talking to Larry, the owner of the town\u2019s graveyard, who tells him he\u2019ll be buried next to Jack. There\u2019s no escaping one\u2019s critics. As the monologue began to come to its close, Mr. Keillor, 73, spoke about how he might be remembered, if at all. \u201cI am at that age now where people start to use the word \u2018legacy,\u2019 although there is no such thing and we all know that,\u201d he said. \u201cRadio has the permanence of a sand castle. Even books that are printed on   paper, they tend to migrate toward recycling rather quickly. \u201d It\u2019s an interesting question, Mr. Keillor\u2019s legacy. He left a lot of uncomplicated pleasure in his wake, and some complicated pleasure, too. For his show\u2019s fans there are always reruns and downloads. For those of us who\u2019ve gravitated more to his prose, which can be savvy and   the best news is that he\u2019s said to be working on a memoir. It\u2019s a book that, if he bears down, I\u2019d wait in the rain for.'"}, "time": 1742562205.6981037}
