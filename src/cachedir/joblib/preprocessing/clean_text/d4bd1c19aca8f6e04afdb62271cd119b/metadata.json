These comments come just days after Barkley said he was \u201cdisappointed in the Muslim ban. \u201d \u201cNo. 1, I really admire and respect coach Krzyzewski because he doesn\u2019t have to do anything. He\u2019s already a living legend. He\u2019s got more money than he\u2019s ever gonna spend, but I really appreciate him standing up for my gay friends,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cNow, my point, as a black man,\u201d he continued, \u201cI am against any form of discrimination whether you\u2019re gay, Muslim, Hispanic, Jewish, whatever, and, if people in position of power don\u2019t support these people, they\u2019re gonna be left in a lurch by themselves. \u201d Barkley later added, \u201cAll these other groups are getting to feel what black people feel like now. With the Muslim ban, they\u2019re deporting these immigrants, white folks are actually getting an opportunity to feel what black people have always felt. Discrimination is wrong in any shape whatsoever. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742564073.201429}
