Moving out of the fall for the first time, the show has a story line pegged to its new winter slot and to the recent election: The season is set during a presidential transition, with a   whose relationship to intelligence agencies is dicey. Not even the most prescient of shows can see the future perfectly, though. The fictional incipient president is a woman (played by Elizabeth Marvel) and her politics appear to be dovish: She floats the idea of the United States\u2019 pulling all its troops out of the Middle East. Those details put quite a distance between \u201cHomeland\u201d and the reality of the real   Donald J. Trump. But it\u2019s not gender or   views that make the show feel out of tune with the times. It\u2019s the courtesy the characters exhibit as they argue and negotiate, their automatic respect for the traditional processes of government. Life, at the moment, is scarier than fiction, and compared with the wholesale disintegration of civility taking place in Washington, \u201cHomeland\u201d looks quaint. It\u2019s as if it were happening in another century. And that\u2019s not a bad thing. There\u2019s something comforting about the normalcy of plot and counterplot, action and intrigue. Those have always been the series\u2019s strong points, not ideas, and it may be easier to focus on them without worrying about how closely the story is mimicking events. This peripatetic show is set for the first time in New York, where the former C. I. A. officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is working for an outpost of the German foundation that employed her in Season 5. Otto D\u00fcring (Sebastian Koch) her boss and (as far as we know) unrequited admirer, asks why she\u2019s wasting her time doing   work, helping Muslim Americans negotiate the legal system. The answer is that it\u2019s where she can keep an eye on her soul mate, Quinn (Rupert Friend) who\u2019s living in a veterans\u2019 hospital after being   last season. The show\u2019s usual roles have been reversed: Quinn is a   mess, and Carrie, who appears to be safely on her meds, is the caretaker. By the end of the season premiere, Quinn has moved into her basement.   episodes of \u201cHomeland\u201d tend to be a bit labored, as the elaborate machinery of the plot is put into place, and having only two episodes to review (presumably a defense against spoilers) makes it impossible to tell how   the machinery will be. Sunday\u2019s premiere introduces two plot strands that we know will eventually, somehow, converge: A young Muslim video blogger (J. Mallory McCree) is arrested on what seem to be shaky grounds, and Dar (F. Murray Abraham) worries about a C. I. A. mission that needs to be completed quickly. Who\u2019s the mole? When will Saul (Mandy Patinkin) stop doubting Carrie? In \u201cHomeland\u201d (as in \u201c24,\u201d also from the executive producer Howard Gordon) we look forward to the questions almost as much as to the answers. In the meantime, there\u2019s more than enough pleasure to be had from the cast to keep us interested. Mr. Abraham and Mr. Patinkin, as his   C. I. A. colleague Saul, have perfected their partnership: Their scenes together are little masterpieces of gamesmanship and exasperation. Mr. Friend\u2019s performance of   addiction may not convince every viewer, but it is, counterintuitively, fun to watch  \u2014   he brings the same edge of sardonic humor to Quinn the junkie that he brought to Quinn the killing machine in past seasons. And Ms. Danes continues to deliver an interesting and sympathetic portrayal of a character whose trademark is her lack of humor. That\u2019s a far more impressive trick than telling the future.'"}, "time": 1742562553.5095828}
