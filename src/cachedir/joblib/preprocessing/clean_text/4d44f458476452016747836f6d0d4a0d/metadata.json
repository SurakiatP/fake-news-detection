Saturday at The People\u2019s Summit in Chicago, former Obama green jobs czar and CNN contributor Van Jones ripped Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.  Jones took aim at the amount of money spent in the losing effort and how that money was spent. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t mean to be rude  \u2014   and I don\u2019t mean to offend anybody,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut the people who ran the Hillary Clinton campaign did not spend their money on white workers, and they did not spend it on people of color. They spent it on themselves. They spent it on themselves, let\u2019s be honest. They took a billion dollars, a billion dollars, a billion dollars, and set it on fire, and called it a campaign! That wasn\u2019t a campaign. That\u2019s not a campaign. \u201d \u201cA billion dollars for consultants,\u201d he added. \u201cA billion dollars for pollsters. A billion dollars for a data operation, that was run by data dummies who couldn\u2019t figure out that maybe people in Michigan needed to be organized. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563023.3720126}
