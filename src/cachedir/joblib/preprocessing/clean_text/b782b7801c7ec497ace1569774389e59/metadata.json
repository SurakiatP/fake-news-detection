The rates and options constantly change, and it feels impossible to make simple comparisons between carriers. Case in point: The best phone plans we recommended a year and a half ago are now obsolete because the wireless carriers have completely changed their offerings. The biggest change involves the   unlimited data plan. About five years ago, all the major carriers killed     data plans that let you browse the web, download music and post photos as much as you want in favor of plans that charge you by the gigabyte. But now   Sprint, ATT and, most recently, Verizon Wireless have resurrected unlimited data. As enticing as that may sound, unlimited is ideal for a small set of people. For everyone else, you may be paying for more than you need, and the plans come with major limitations on how you can use them. \u201cThe unlimited plan will confuse consumers even more because it\u2019s not really unlimited,\u201d said Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a research firm that analyzes wireless bills. \u201cThey think \u2018O. K. it\u2019s a great deal,\u2019 but actually it\u2019s not so. \u201d Still, it is a good time to consider a new phone plan. Phone manufacturers like Samsung Electronics, LG and Sony are expected to show new smartphones next week at Mobile World Congress, the annual trade show centered on mobile devices. To help narrow your options, The Wirecutter, the product recommendation site owned by The New York Times, named Verizon Wireless the best carrier, largely because it has the broadest network coverage and   service quality, along with generous data packages that are easy to understand, said Rob Pegoraro, who writes about phone carriers for The Wirecutter. The Wirecutter\u2019s pick comes down to a simple fact: A smartphone is no good if it lacks a connection, so good coverage should be the top consideration when you select a plan. But choosing the best plan for you is not as simple as heading straight for a Verizon plan, Mr. Toikka said. Prices can fluctuate, and in some cases, ATT, the   carrier, offers a better deal on a network that is generally as good as Verizon\u2019s. Here are recommendations we made with the help of Mr. Toikka for the best phone plans for individuals, couples, families and travelers. ATT\u2019S   PLAN PRICE $60 a month WHY IT WINS On average, smartphone owners with tiered data plans used 2. 9 gigabytes of data per month last year, according to Cisco. At $60 a month, ATT\u2019s   offering is large enough to suit the average smartphone owner\u2019s needs. Verizon offers a   bucket for $60 a month, which may be too small for $75 a month it offers a   plan, which is a bit more than you probably need. VERIZON\u2019S UNLIMITED DATA PLAN PRICE $80 a month WHY IT WINS If you use at least 10 gigabytes a month, consider yourself a power user. For a single phone line, Verizon\u2019s $   unlimited data offering beats ATT\u2019s $   unlimited plan. Verizon customers can also get a discount by enrolling in automatic payments, reducing the price of the unlimited plan to $80 a month. Only Verizon\u2019s unlimited data plan includes the ability to tether, or share a smartphone\u2019s cellular data with another device like a computer. Both plans share a limitation: After 22 gigabytes of use in a month, data speeds may be slowed. ATT\u2019S SHARED   PLAN PRICE $100 a month WHY IT WINS ATT\u2019s   shared data plan should have most couples covered since the average data consumption per person is three gigabytes a month. Priced at $100 a month, the plan is also more generous than Verizon\u2019s   plan at $100 a month. VERIZON\u2019S OR ATT\u2019S UNLIMITED DATA PLAN PRICE $140 a month WHY THEY TIE A couple that uses at least 20 gigabytes a month would benefit from either ATT\u2019s or Verizon\u2019s unlimited plan, and both cost the same each month. Which to choose? Mr. Toikka recommends checking coverage maps for ATT and Verizon to see which carrier is better in your hometown. VERIZON\u2019S UNLIMITED DATA PLAN PRICE $180 a month WHY IT WINS On average, a family of four will probably consume about 12 gigabytes a month. Verizon\u2019s largest tiered data plan includes eight gigabytes a month, which can easily be surpassed. Verizon\u2019s unlimited data plan costs $200 a month for four people, which can be reduced to $180 a month for families that enroll in automatic payments. Mr. Toikka warned that automatic payments might lead parents to overlook unexpected charges on their phone bills, so just make sure to closely monitor your bills. VERIZON\u2019S AND ATT\u2019S TRAVEL PLANS OR A FOREIGN SIM CARD PRICE $10 a day WHY THEY WIN Verizon and ATT customers can use a smartphone abroad in over 100 countries for an extra $10 a day on top of the rates for their normal phone plan. The main difference is that Verizon\u2019s smartphones come unlocked, offering the flexibility of inserting a foreign SIM card and potentially paying even lower rates. By contrast, ATT\u2019s smartphones come locked by default, meaning you will have to go through some hassle to unlock a device to use a foreign SIM card. Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman, said, \u201cVerizon\u2019s coverage is second to none, and we have very competitively priced plans loaded with features, providing customers with incredible value. \u201d ATT said it \u201cprovides value to customers that our competitors can\u2019t match. \u201d Switching to a new phone plan can be tedious and frustrating, and chances are you are happy with the one you have. But Mr. Pegoraro of The Wirecutter warned that sticking with a dated plan could make you miss out on options that offer better value or neat features like tethering. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that the plan you\u2019ve been on is the one you should stay on,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628491.8152921}
