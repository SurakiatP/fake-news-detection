It stands to reason that the presidential spokesman in the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, one of Putin\u2019s closest aides, travelled to New York last week ostensibly to attend a world chess event, but principally to prepare the ground for the phone conversation on Monday. The agenda of such Russian-American conversations is usually agreed upon beforehand. The Kremlin readout (and the brief statement by Trump\u2019s transition team in New York) gave a positive account of the phone conversation. From available details, it was a substantive conversation, which focused on reviving the Russian-American relationship, and, most important, also took up the Syrian conflict in some detail, including \u201cissues related to solving the crisis\u201d. So, what emerges is that Putin and Trump have begun discussing Syria in their very first conversation as statesmen, hardly 6 days after the latter got elected, even before his key cabinet posts have been filled, and with 8 weeks still to go to before the new presidency commences. Clearly, Syria is right on top of Trump\u2019s mind \u2013 and the need to engage with Russia. Again, Trump had touched on Syria during his weekend interview with Wall Street Journal (when he made it clear that the US should dump Syrian rebels.) Quite obviously, Monday\u2019s phone conversation underscored that Trump was not at all fanciful or a maverick when he repeatedly stuck out his neck on the campaign trail and took much flak, including wild allegations of him being a Russian poodle, when he kept insisting on the imperative need of constructively dealing with Putin, as a collaborator rather than as adversary. As could have been expected, Putin said to Trump that Moscow is ready \u201cto develop a dialogue of partnership\u201d with the US based on the \u201cprinciples of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other\u2019s domestic affairs\u201d \u2013 in short, a principled relationship that could be the core of a US-Russia reset . From the Kremlin point of view, what Putin articulated is a minimalist agenda. Putin has not spoken of any balancing of interests or the desirability of the two countries showing sensitivity to each other\u2019s interests \u2013 although they discussed the fight against the \u201ccommon enemy\u201d \u2013 international terrorism and extremism. Trump\u2019s transition headquarters quoted the president-elect as saying to Putin that \u201che is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.\u201d With Monday\u2019s conversation, one controversial part of Trump\u2019s foreign-policy plank is gaining transparency. Both Trump and Putin \u201cexpressed support for active joint efforts to normalise relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues. They emphasised the importance of establishing a reliable foundation for bilateral ties by developing the trade and economic component,\u201d which in turn \u201cwould help \u201cstimulate a return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation.\u201d The twitter from New York said Trump and Putin discussed \u201cstrategic economic issues.\u201d Energy issues? Western sanctions against Russia? We should know in a near future. Something seems to be brewing here. At any rate, it is a terrific forward- looking signal. For, how can the \u201ctrade and economic component\u201d be developed so long as the sanctions continue, or when New Cold War clouds are hanging so low? Yet, the Kremlin readout omitted any reference to Ukraine. However, both Putin and Trump noted that at the leadership level, they \u201cshould encourage a return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation in the interests of both countries, as well as global stability and security.\u201d By the way, on Monday, Trump also spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Xinhua news agency reported that Trump paid fulsome compliments to China as \u201ca great and important country with eye-catching development prospects\u201d. Trump added that Sino-American relations \u201cwill witness even greater development\u201d during his presidency. Trump and Xi agreed to meet \u201cat an early date\u201d. Interestingly, Putin and Trump also agreed to not only keep in touch by telephone but also begin planning for an in-person meeting. Would such a meeting take place before or after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January? Conceivably, these could be the first signs of a new type of big-power relationship. Trump may seek a US-Russia-China entente cordiale to carry forward the US\u2019 global leadership while America attends to the repair and reconstruction of its economy and society. Such an approach dovetails with Trump\u2019s agenda of \u2018America First\u2019. No doubt, Trump has started running no sooner than he hit the ground. This seems to confirm the general impression of him as a man in a hurry. And Putin seemed to expect it. The Kremlin aide Peskov\u2019s prognosis has been that Putin and Trump are two men \u201cvery much alike\u2026 in their basic approach towards international relations\u201d, and there\u2019s good reason \u201cto believe that they will manage to establish good relations.\u201d However, this sort of extraordinary \u2018pro-active\u2019 diplomacy by the president-elect, as he has shown on Monday, may not go down well with the American foreign policy and security establishment. Some of the irritation may even have welled up to the surface when the Obama administration chose Monday itself to announce even more sanctions against Russia \u2013 against six Russian parliamentarians representing Crimea and Sevastopol in the Duma. At any rate, Moscow too bid farewell on Monday to the Obama administration. Reacting to the reported advice by US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter to Trump not to cooperate with Russia over Syria, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in Moscow on Monday that Moscow is no more interested than the United States (read Obama administration) in such cooperation and will proceed on that basis. Ryabkov said derisively that in any case, Moscow does not intend to \u201cpersuade the Pentagon leadership to change something in this regard.\u201d To be sure, things have touched a nadir in Russian-American relations, and from this point things can only get better. Having said that, a genuine Russian-American reset depends on the balancing of mutual interests on a number of fronts where progress will be slow and needs to be hard-won. It is the Eurasian theatre that poses formidable challenges. Issues such a NATO expansion, Crimea, US missile defence, forward deployments of NATO along Russia\u2019s borders, \u2018colour revolutions\u2019 \u2014 these are difficult topics. Maybe, the experience in working together on Syria \u2014 and an easing of western sanctions against Russia, which is entirely conceivable sometime through 2017 \u2014 would have a positive effect on the overall climate of trust and mutual confidence. What Monday\u2019s phone conversation testifies is that Russia definitely sees a window of opportunity in the incoming Trump presidency; a reset in the troubled relationship is possible; and, that Putin and Trump could strike personal chemistry of a kind that was never found possible for the Russian leader with Obama.
