All the others were taken. It was a busy Friday night. \u201cI have this long wood table here,\u201d she said. \u201cOr,\u201d she continued, extending one arm toward the foot of the staircase leading to a   dining room, \u201cI have this beautiful little marble table right there. \u201d She sounded as if it were a prize she had been saving for the first people she thought would appreciate it. Now, this table sits in a tight corner. Its edges are deeply scalloped, so once our samosas and smoked eggplant arrived, it became clear that the marble surface was even smaller than it looked. But by that point, it didn\u2019t matter. The owner, who is also the chef, the decorator and the occupant of the house\u2019s upper stories, had proudly seated us at a piece of furniture she had bought and placed there because she liked the way it looked. What were we going to do but settle in and see what else she wanted to share with us? This must be one reason large, diverse crowds have descended on Chaiwali since it opened last year despite its fairly low profile outside the neighborhood. So many restaurants that draw more publicity seem interchangeable: Nobody would notice if they traded menu items, light fixtures or any employees short of the chef. Chaiwali does not always have their caliber of professionalism servers are genial but may forget dishes, and when it\u2019s time to clear the table, they may disappear into the vapor. But it does have its own way of looking at the world. Ms. Trehan seems to have built the restaurant on the belief that the things she likes will make the rest of us happy, too. You see this in eccentric bits of decoration, like the stuffed peacock that perches on the upstairs bar. The whole second floor is a bit of a peacock there\u2019s also a taxidermied antelope head and a flamboyant mural of a tigress and butterflies. A wall of glass looks out over Lenox Avenue, but the real scenery is inside. The downstairs dining room is calmer, with an intricate pattern traced on the exposed brick walls and a row of windows facing the garden, where a big communal table sits inside what looks like a giant birdcage. Maybe the peacock used to live there. The menu feels personal, too. It reminds me of the relaxed,   modern food that Americans with roots in India, like Ms. Trehan, may cook at home. Her recipes probably aren\u2019t her grandmother\u2019s, but she pays attention to the quality and balance of saffron, fenugreek, ginger and coriander. What comes out of her kitchen looks attractive, but it hasn\u2019t been whipped into stiff peaks of   artiness. I could imagine being invited to a dinner party where Chaiwali\u2019s smoked eggplant dip, full of garlic and juicy black olives, was put out with hot sheets of flatbread while everybody limbered up over cocktails. \u201cJust Samosas,\u201d as the menu calls them, might appear next. They have a   filling with a decidedly peppery bite. It\u2019s a treat to find samosa wrappers as thin and greaseless as these in a restaurant. In the winter, the first course could be Chaiwali\u2019s silky carrot soup, intensely flavored with saffron and a few fried curry leaves that float on the surface. In summer, maybe the appetizer would be the Goa shrimp ceviche, sweetened with little cubes of mango the host would tell everybody to dump the little saucer of puffed rice and fried threads of chickpea flour over the top for crunch. Then, if you were in luck, she might carry vindaloo lamb chops to the table, having marinated the meat with vinegar for tenderness and ginger for flavor. Chaiwali makes vindaloo with complexity and nuance, nothing like the   the color of a rusted tailpipe served in generic Indian restaurants. It comes with potatoes softly roasted with whole mustard seeds, a recipe that I am going to steal. Other main courses can expose the kitchen\u2019s vulnerabilities. The small pieces of black pepper chicken were dry both times I tried the dish. The pool of lightly curried tomato gravy helped, though, and I enjoyed the nutty and firm red quinoa served in place of the traditional rice. The okra fries served with the excellent saut\u00e9ed fish, seasoned with mustard seeds and herbs, then dredged in a delicate   batter, sounded great in theory. In practice, their crust was going soggy one night, and while it was quite crisp and hot on another, some of the long green pods, cut lengthwise, were a little stringy. Still, I\u2019d order either dish again, which I wouldn\u2019t say about the Desi pasta, which changes night to night but which, when I met up with it, was tossed with a   sauce. I remember nothing about it except the color, which I\u2019d call  . The clever veggie burger, a tall fritter of kale pakora with avocado, lettuce and tomato on a bun, made a more appealing meatless dinner. Desserts find a happy medium between too basic and too complicated. The one called Alice\u2019s Jamaican rum and biscuit pudding tastes something like a tiramis\u00f9 spiked with booze. Mango whipped with yogurt and goat cheese is like a lassi turned into a mousse. (There\u2019s an actual mango lassi on the drinks menu, and it\u2019s good, too.) The one dessert that scared me was the one I liked best: the curry cumin cookies. These little   bites, crumbly like shortbreads, are refreshing and bright, with a black pepper finish that took me by surprise in the best way. The cookies worked a small miracle that nothing else has ever accomplished: They actually made me want a cup of chai. But the chai at Chaiwali is not the lukewarm broth of dirty milk in a paper cup that you get in coffee shops. It is a potent   drink, like a cortado made with strong black tea and spices. It was Ms. Trehan\u2019s desire for a cup of chai made the Indian way, the way she used to enjoy it in Delhi, that drove her to open Chaiwali. Of the many reasons people have for starting a restaurant, the desire to serve something they themselves want to eat and drink is one of the best.'"}, "time": 1742563155.5979297}
