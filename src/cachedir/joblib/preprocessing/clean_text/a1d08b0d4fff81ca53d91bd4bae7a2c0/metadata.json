Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d network weekend host Michael Smerconish reacted to remarks made by Hollywood actress Meryl Streep aimed at   Donald Trump a night earlier at the Golden Globes awards ceremony.  According to Smerconish, Streep\u2019s effort won\u2019t damage Trump and will instead \u201cenergize his base. \u201d \u201cIf she wanted to hurt him, the best thing she could do is praise him,\u201d Smerconish said. \u201cBecause all this does is energize his base. Chris, I think he loves things like this with a   Hollywood celebrity. And frankly, there will be more water cooler conversation today at the workplace as whether Meryl Streep really is an overrated actor than there will be on the Affordable Care Act replacement, Russian hack or the hearings that someone was just talking about, which have such great importance.
