In field experiments, they can detect targets the size of sand grains from nearly two feet away  \u2014   100 times the fly\u2019s body length  \u2014   and intercept them in under half a second. What\u2019s more, they never miss their mark. A team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge has started to unveil the secrets to the robber fly\u2019s prowess. In a study published Thursday in Current Biology, the team outlined the mechanics of the fly\u2019s pursuit, from its impressive eye anatomy to how it makes a successful catch every time. Notably, the researchers observed a behavior never before described in a flying animal: About 30 centimeters from its prey, the insect slows, turns slightly and brings itself in for a close catch. \u201cThis \u2018 \u2019 phase and change in behavior during a flight is quite remarkable,\u201d said Sam Fabian, a graduate student at Cambridge and an author of the study. \u201cWe would actually expect them to do something very simple  \u2014   just accelerate and hit the target. \u201d The scientists surveyed robber flies in the field using a \u201cfly teaser,\u201d which consisted of beads on a rapidly moving fishing line controlled by a motor. As the flies charged at the bait, the researchers captured their movements using   cameras. At the start of the robber fly\u2019s conquest, it sits on a perch and scans the sky for passing prey. When it glimpses a potential meal, it takes flight, maintaining a steady angle between itself and its target. This proactive strategy, using a \u201cconstant bearing angle,\u201d is also employed by fish, bats and sailors, Mr. Fabian said. Maintaining a constant bearing angle gets the robber fly in the ballpark of its prey. Then, at the   mark (how the fly judges this distance is still unclear) it subtly changes course so as to approach its target from behind. \u201cWe think this second proactive phase allows the animal a higher probability of catching its prey,\u201d said Paloma   a lecturer at Cambridge and another author of the study. In the same way that it\u2019s easier to pass a baton by running to someone from behind versus   looping around makes it easier for the fly to align itself with its kill. Next, the scientists wanted to understand the robber fly\u2019s startling visual capabilities. Whereas we have a single lens in each eye, the robber fly has several thousand lenses per eye, which range in size. In the center of each eye, the researchers found, is a concentration of large,   lenses. This central area, called the fovea, is extremely high resolution and is what allows the flies to see their prey from a distance equivalent to more than one and a half soccer fields for humans. \u201cThey basically have permanent binoculars,\u201d said Trevor Wardill, a research fellow at Cambridge and an author of the paper. Rob de Ruyter, a professor of biophysics at Indiana University, who was not involved in the study, said, \u201cThe extent to which this fovea is specialized is unusual. \u201d Other flies, like the house fly, have localized areas of high resolution in their eyes called love spots, but these are not nearly as exaggerated as the robber fly\u2019s fovea. Dragonflies also have impressive foveae, but their bodies are 10 times larger and can more easily accommodate many large lenses in their eyes. These adaptations that make the tiny robber fly a   hunting machine are an example of how insects must develop highly specialized strategies to survive in this world, Dr. de Ruyter said. \u201cInsects die at such high rates, and have such short generation times,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, they try out new evolutionary solutions much faster than we can. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628589.571508}
