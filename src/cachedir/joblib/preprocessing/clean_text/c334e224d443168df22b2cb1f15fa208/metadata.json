The officials met in Monaco on Monday and voted unanimously to maintain the ban on Russian athletes, outlining a timetable under which the nation would not be cleared to compete until November. Until then, individual Russian athletes with robust histories of drug testing may petition to compete as neutral athletes, unassociated with any country, in the world championships, which will take place in August in London, as well as other global events. Officials agreed to exempt Russia\u2019s youngest athletes from the blanket ban, allowing for those under 15 to compete as neutral individuals without filing a special application. Citing a number of issues  \u2014   including \u201dunhelpful comments\u201d by Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko limited and problematic drug testing within the country and evidence that an implicated coach had continued to train athletes in spite of having been suspended  \u2014   Rune Andersen, the chairman of a global task force overseeing Russia\u2019s reform, said the nation had not yet met the conditions for reinstatement. Among those conditions is that Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency be fully recertified by the World   Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports. That agency has suggested it may grant Russia partial certification in May, track officials said Monday, and full certification in November. Only after that point, Mr. Andersen said, would track and field authorities consider restoring Russia to good standing. \u201cThe criteria were very clear,\u201d said Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field\u2019s global governing body. \u201cThey were unambiguous. They were not suffused in politics. \u201d Mr. Coe and Mr. Andersen said there had been some progress in Russia in recent months, including the election of a new president of Russian track and field, Dmitry Shlyakhtin. They said they had been reassured that Russia would cooperate with France\u2019s continuing criminal investigation, which focuses on bribery and corruption in global track and field, and that the Russian government would provide financial support to national antidoping operations without interfering in them. Mr. Mutko, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, has acknowledged broad problems with doping but denied a   system of cheating. Since his promotion by President Vladimir V. Putin last fall, Mr. Mutko has grown increasingly defiant in responding to the mountain of evidence that Russia has systematically doped with government assistance, most notably at the 2014 Sochi Olympics  \u2014   where Russia\u2019s longtime national antidoping lab chief, Grigory Rodchenkov, said he substituted   urine with clean urine. In December, after WADA laid bare the results of a   investigation, Mr. Mutko went so far as to say that female Russian hockey players who competed at the Sochi Games had been found to have male D. N. A. in their urine samples because they had had sex. Scientific experts dismissed that explanation as impossible, calling it clear evidence of sample tampering. Another condition of Russia\u2019s reinstatement highlighted on Monday in Monaco was that the nation\u2019s leadership accept, or credibly rebut, the extensive evidence of   cheating, including the involvement of the sports ministry and Russia\u2019s federal security service, or F. S. B. \u201cThe question of apologies is one that we have raised every time we have been to Moscow,\u201d Mr. Andersen said Monday. \u201cIn general, I wouldn\u2019t pinpoint any specific person that needs to say apologies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we expect that the Russian community is acknowledging that they have a problem, because only when you acknowledge you have a problem can you do something about it. \u201d In December, several Russian sports officials told The New York Times they were no longer disputing the cheating schemes that had been uncovered, though they insisted top government officials had no part in them. \u201cOf course it was an institutional conspiracy, but not \u201d said Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency. While Russia remains barred, 35 Russian athletes have so far petitioned to participate in global competitions in 2017, track officials said Monday. They include Yuliya Stepanova, a   runner and   who helped ignite the Russian doping scandal and who is living in hiding in the United States. Ms. Stepanova ran as a neutral athlete in a global indoor competition in Boston late last month. \u201cThere have been some subtle shifts, and I think there is a recognition that this clearly has been a very disfiguring episode in Russian sport,\u201d Mr. Coe said. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged, but I\u2019m not cavalier about the amount of work that there still remains to be done. \u201d Also on Monday, Mr. Coe announced a freeze on nationality transfers, seeking to protect athletes  \u2014   especially those from Africa, he said  \u2014   from changes in allegiance before a new set of rules was in place. \u201cWhat we have is a wholesale market for African talent open to the highest bidder,\u201d Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, a track and field official representing Africa, said Monday. \u201cOur present rules are being manipulated to the detriment of athletics\u2019 credibility. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564030.559646}
