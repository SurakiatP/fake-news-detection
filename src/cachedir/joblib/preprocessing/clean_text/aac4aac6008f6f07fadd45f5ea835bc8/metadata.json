[Addressing her final news conference, Power told reporters that \u201ccountries like Russia and China\u201d would benefit from Washington\u2019s reduced standing at the United Nations if funding were withdrawn.  \u201cWe lead the world, in part, by leading at the UN,\u201d said Power, who is stepping down next week after four years as President Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cIf we were to tie our hands behind our back or strip this organization of programming\u201d to support peace mediation or humanitarian work, \u201cthis would be extremely detrimental to US interests,\u201d she said. Power spoke after a bill was introduced in the US Senate that would slash all US funding to the United Nations until a Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements is repealed. The United States refrained from using its veto to block the resolution and instead abstained, allowing the measure to pass by a vote of   in the council, triggering a furious response from Israel. Power said Israel would not benefit if there is \u201cless US leadership\u201d at the UN as a result of a funding cut, citing a string of   changes the Obama administration has supported. Much of Power\u2019s parting words were in defense of US engagement at the United Nations, saying that while the \u201cUN system is flawed\u201d with a bloated bureaucracy, there is a need for a global body to pool common efforts. \u201cThe United States needs the UN,\u201d Power said. \u201cThe UN goes to places that the US will not go,\u201d she added, pointing to peace missions in Mali and South Sudan, where African troops are taking the lead. \u201cIf there\u2019s less US leadership at the UN, it will be other countries that step in to fill the void,\u201d many of which do not share the US view on fighting terrorism or advancing human rights, she noted. Power also warned the incoming Trump administration that it would be \u201cvery wise\u201d to preserve the Iran nuclear deal that the   has vowed to scrap. The United States is by far the UN\u2019s biggest financial contributor, providing 22 percent of its operating budget and funding 28% of peacekeeping missions, which currently cost $8 billion annually. Trump, who will take office on January 20, has dismissed the United Nations as \u201cjust a club for people to get together and have a good time. \u201d After the council voted to demand an end to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Trump warned on Twitter: \u201cAs to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u201d Congressional Democrats and Republicans alike fumed over the UN\u2019s reprimand of Israel. The   US House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly last week to condemn the resolution, noting that the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to use its veto power \u201cundermined\u201d Washington\u2019s   position of shielding its closest Middle East ally at the United Nations. The Safeguard Israel Act of 2017  \u2014   introduced by Senate Republicans Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham  \u2014   aims to push back against the UN by threatening to pull billions of dollars in funding. It was not immediately clear whether the bill would garner major support.'"}, "time": 1742563246.5092106}
