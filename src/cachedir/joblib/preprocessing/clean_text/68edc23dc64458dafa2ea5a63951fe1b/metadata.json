[The BBC released the trailer earlier this week and were immediately slammed by those on the left and Muslims who thought that making fun of the brides of members of the terror group was out of the bounds of conventional humour. The sketch is part of a new programme called \u201cRevolting\u201d written by Jolyon Rubinstein and Heydon Prowse which, according to the BBC, is \u201csatirising the state of the nation. \u201d  LOLOLOL pic. twitter.   \u2014   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) January 4, 2017,  The BBC2 Facebook page was inundated with criticism. One user wrote, \u201cI\u2019m mortified that the BBC had produced such a programme. This is simply bad taste. The fact it is a comedy makes it even more worrying that humour should be associated with the actions of ISIS. Is this really what TV licenses are funding! ?\u201d Others took a different point of view including a Muslim saying, \u201cAs a Muslim I find this HILARIOUS! Brilliant! The satire is on point highlighting the pathetic ideals of a pathetic group like ISIS. \u201d Not all Muslims agreed with the sentiment and users on Twitter expressed just as much outrage for the sketch. One man, a Bangladeshi, said \u201cThe BBC really made a satirical show called \u2018The Real Housewives of ISIS\u2019 while the real housewives of ISIS are being raped and abused daily. \u201d   The BBC really made a satirical show called \u201dThe Real Housewives of ISIS\u201d while the real housewives of ISIS are being raped and abused daily,  \u2014   Meraj.

Thanks @BBC for adding to the negative stereotype. \u201d \u2019Real Housewives of ISIS\u2019 will make Hijabis feel more isolated n targeted by Islamophobes.

Some questioned whether the use of taxpayer money via the TV license fee should go toward the funding of the programme. As if people\u2019s TV license in this country is going towards funding the production of a programme called \u201dthe real housewives of ISIS\u201d. Wow,  \u2014   Cameron Edgar (@CammyyyEdgar) January 4, 2017,    The video itself has already been viewed millions of times on Facebook and other social media platforms.  The clip shows several women in hijabs talking to each other in a    house taking selfies and showing off their suicide belts to each other. One woman even mentions that she hadn\u2019t come from Birmingham \u201cto do this\u201d as she scrubbed the floor of the home. Women joining Islamic State and travelling to Syria to become brides has become a real problem in European countries as the terror group promises young girls a more glamorous lifestyle. In 2014, eight schoolgirls from Bethnal Green travelled to Syria to become brides of Islamic State fighters, all of them under the age of 18.'"}, "time": 1742561615.4239612}
