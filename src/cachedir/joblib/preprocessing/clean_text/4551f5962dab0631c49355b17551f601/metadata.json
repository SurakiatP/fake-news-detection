Done. And with 46 days to go. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why people who live chaotic lives make such a meal of it when you can get everything you need from the three-for-two at Boots. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve beaten the crowds, dodged all the Christmas music, and finished an onerous task with minimum exposure to trace amounts of seasonal goodwill. \\n\u201cBy Sunday evening everything will be wrapped and labelled, and by midday on December 27th the tree and decorations will be back in their stackable storage crates in the loft for another year.\u201d \\nShe added: \u201cTechnically these are the gifts for Christmas 2017. We\u2019re a year ahead to be safe. \\n\u201cFriends give me presents they say they\u2019ve really thought hard about. I smile for the allotted amount of time, thank them and then put whatever it is away.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742628463.6032848}
