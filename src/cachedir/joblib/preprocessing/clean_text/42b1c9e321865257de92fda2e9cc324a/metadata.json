The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law, a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence, who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law, has created online insurance marketplaces, offered new protections to people seeking health insurance, and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. \u201cThe American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cand we are determined to give them that. \u201d He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law, but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance, however, and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, playing off Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, said repealing the law would \u201cmake America sick again. \u201d Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats\u2019 being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday, the Senate took the first step, agreeing to take up a budget resolution, or blueprint, that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law, it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days, and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead, both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law, which has become deeply enmeshed with America\u2019s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to \u201cbe careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster,\u201d and added, \u201cDon\u2019t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. \u201d Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would \u201cfall of its own weight. \u201d Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team, said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. \u201cWe have to make sure we keep reminding America, we are repealing it because it failed, we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cAnd that was a key piece of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201d But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law, they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. \u201cThere will naturally be a reasonable transition period,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. \u201cYou can\u2019t adopt new reforms all at once. \u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, noted that it had taken six years to get into \u201cthe ditch we find ourselves in now. \u201d \u201cWhen your truck or car is in a ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cAnd sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. \u201d To that, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, parried that when a car goes into a ditch, \u201cthe first thing I don\u2019t do is dismantle the car. \u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation,\u201d she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year, Republicans would \u201cregret that they came out so fast out of the box. \u201d He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. \u201cIf you are repealing, show us what you\u2019ll replace it with first,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll look at what you have and see what we can do. \u201d Later, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump, \u201cIt\u2019s his and their responsibility, plain and simple  \u2014   name calling isn\u2019t going to get anything done. \u201d He added, \u201cThey really need to calm things down a little. \u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. \u201cThe point is, in 2017, we don\u2019t want people to be caught with nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure that there\u2019s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. \u201d Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicans\u2019 rollback effort. In reality, the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a \u201cpep rally\u201d for Affordable Care Act defenders, in the words of an attendee, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. The gathering, which could be Mr. Obama\u2019s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat, had a     air, with numerous Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Johnson, sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president\u2019s words. Mr. Obama, for his part, did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law, but warned Democrats against \u201crescuing\u201d Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said, \u201cHe acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561766.4593697}
