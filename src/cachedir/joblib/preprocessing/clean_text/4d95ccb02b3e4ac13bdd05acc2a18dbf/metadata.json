[\u201cWhat has changed is that now the circumstances have changed and the impossible has now become possible,\u201d said Rep John Ratcliffe, who serves on both his chamber\u2019s Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.  The Texas congressman refiled two bills  \u2014   the All Economic Regulations are Transparent or ALERT Act, and the Separation of Powers Restoration Act or SOPRA  \u2014   from last session, the 114th Congress. The bills passed the House on its first day in this new session and are now awaiting consideration by the Senate as part of a larger bill, sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Robert Goodlatte (R. .)  \u2014   H. R. 5, Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, which passed the House Jan. 11,    with five Democrats joining the majority. \u201cThe historic election of Donald Trump this November sent a clear message to Washington that the American people don\u2019t want eight more years of the same and Congress owes it to them to deliver on this mandate,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cThat\u2019s why  \u2014   right off the bat  \u2014   I reintroduced two key pieces of legislation that will help heal our nation from the damage done by the immense regulatory overreach imposed under President Obama\u2019s watch. \u201d The ALERT Act blocks bureaucrats from implementing federal regulations without first providing the public with detailed information for at least six months before they go into effect. Under current law, federal agencies are required to release an update twice a year on the regulations being developed by federal agencies \u2014  but, in the Obama administration, many of the updates were late, if ever issued at all. SOPRA takes on one of the most important Supreme Court decisions to buttress the regulatory state, the Chevron decision, the 1984 ruling that created \u201cChevron Deference,\u201d a   standard by which federal courts are compelled to defer to how a federal agency chooses to interpret a federal regulation. What began in 1984 as a win for President Ronald Reagan, who successfully defended his administration\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Air Act  \u2014   which allowed Chevron to expand a refinery without having to apply for new permits, as if it was a new plant  \u2014   grew into a ch\u00e8que en blanc for federal regulators throughout the government. The congressman said SOPRA seeks to restore three   branches of government by abolishing the doctrine that has often enabled administrative agencies to interpret laws to mean whatever they want. \u201cRegardless of what my tenure is in Congress, I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be here, but I am confident that the Separation of Powers Restoration Act will be the most important bill that I ever file. \u201d Ratcliffe said he discussed SOPRA and Chevron Deference with Trump during the campaign, when the two men had a private conversation at an Oct 11 North Dallas fundraiser. \u201cI said: \u2018Mr. Trump, when you get elected, I\u2019ve got one bill in particular that I\u2019m anxious to get to your desk, I think you\u2019re really going to like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, we talked about it for five minutes. \u201d In their short conversation before Trump spoke to his supporters at the Lincoln Center Hilton hotel, the congressman said he spelled out how SOPRA would rebalance the relationship between regulators, the courts, and Congress. \u201cHe certainly understood the concept and the impact  \u2014   and was not just receptive to it, but said, \u2018I\u2019m excited by the opportunity for something like that become law.\u2019 He actually sort of extended the conversation  \u2014   he was very engaged about the the specifics, once mentioned to him  \u2014   he was like, \u2018Tell me more,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t take that as a promise or anything\u201d On the campaign trail, the president often spoke about the way American individuals and businesses are being strangled by an expanding federal government, Ratcliffe said. A few days after the election, Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) reached out to Ratcliffe about SOPRA and getting it to a vote early in the new session.  SOPRA was already a central plank of the speaker\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d agenda, and GOP congressmen and candidates campaigned on the issue in their own states. Ratcliffe said a great example of how Trump in the White House changes the dynamics on Capitol Hill is that the same week in the last session that the House passed SOPRA, President Barack Obama issued a veto statement that was enough to wave off the Senate from taking up a bill. The congressman said that with Obama in the White House, so many bills brought up and passed in the House, like the ALERT Act and SOPRA, became what are known on Capitol Hill as \u201cmessaging bills. \u201d These bills are useful for forcing people to go on the record for or against an issue, but everyone knows they will never actually become law. Before the bills sent the message to the voters, \u201cThis is what Republicans stand for and what we would do if we had a Republican president  \u2014   well, now, that\u2019s the opportunity at hand,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton promised very much the same as President Obama delivered  \u2014    essentially, a third term, so bills like these would very likely has been    in the 115th Congress if she won. \u201d \u201cTrump winning?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what I mean by the \u2018impossible now becomes possible. \u2019\u201d Now House conservatives have an ally in the White House, he said. \u201cI am so excited about what can be done,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact that there is a willing partner at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. will allow essentially the same bills to have a different trajectory. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563965.6063673}
