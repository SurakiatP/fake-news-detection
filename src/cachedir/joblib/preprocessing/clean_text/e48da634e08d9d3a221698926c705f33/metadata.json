According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Obama administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register. At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record.   17, 2016 President Obama has just set a new record for rules and regulations, his administration spitting out 527 pages worth in just one day, as he races to put his fingerprint on virtually every corner of American life and business. \\nAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register . At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record. The rules, politics of federal regulations under Obama: \\nAs shocking as this video is , it was made 5 months ago and does not reflect the current race-to-regulate happening right now. What\u2019s more, there are still about 26 working days left in the year. \\n\u201cNo one knows what the future holds, but at a pace of well over 1,000 pages weekly, the Federal Register could easily top 90,000 pages this year. The simple algebra says that at the current pace we\u2019ll add 11,190 pages over the next 44 days, to end 2016 at around 92,830 pages,\u201d said CEI\u2019s Clyde Wayne Crews. \\n\u201cThis is astonishing and should be of great concern, and intolerable, to policymakers. It is remarkable enough that the all-time record has been passed before Thanksgiving,\u201d he added. Obama has promised to regulate by executive authority, but the sheer number of pages of regulations being rushed through is astonishing. \\nStill, it\u2019s not a big surprise to CEI and other regulation watchdogs. \\nThe reason, said Crews, Obama owns seven of the 10 highest-ever Federal Register counts. \\nHe called on President-elect Trump to make good on campaign promises and cut regulations. \\n\u201cPresident-elect Donald Trump could take a page from President Reagan, who brought page counts down from Carter\u2019s 73,258 to as low as 44,812. We don\u2019t need a pen and phone, we need a meat axe,\u201d said Crews. source \\n '"}, "time": 1742564403.070979}
