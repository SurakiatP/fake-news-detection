In 2013, besieged by the increasingly assertive   Union wing of his own Conservative Party, Mr. Cameron made a promise intended to keep a   peace among the Tories before the 2015 general election: If   he would hold an    referendum on continued British membership in the bloc. But what seemed then like a relatively   ploy to deal with a   political problem has metastasized into an issue that could badly damage Britain\u2019s economy, influence the country\u2019s direction for generations  \u2014   and determine Mr. Cameron\u2019s political fate. As the nation prepares to vote on Thursday, the betting markets are signaling that Britain will choose to remain in Europe, but polls suggest that the outcome is still too close to call. On Tuesday, speaking in front of No. 10 Downing Street, Mr. Cameron warned that a decision to leave would be an \u201cirreversible\u201d choice. Appealing to older voters, many of whom tend to favor leaving Europe, Mr. Cameron urged them to think about what they would bequeath to the next generation. \u201cAbove all it is about our economy,\u201d he said. The bluff, ruddy Mr. Cameron is famously lucky, having pulled out   victories in numerous other scrapes. But in this case, many analysts say, he will be damaged goods even if he wins, with rivals circling to succeed him and Conservatives more divided than ever. If he loses, he will come under pressure to resign, and even if he hangs on for some portion of the four years left in his government\u2019s term, whatever substantive legacy he might have built will be lost to what many consider to be a wholly unnecessary roll of the dice. Martin Wolf, the economic columnist of The Financial Times, wrote that \u201cthis referendum is, arguably, the most irresponsible act by a British government in my lifetime. \u201d Summarizing the nearly unanimous opinion of economists that a British exit  \u2014   \u201cBrexit\u201d  \u2014   would be followed by a major shock and permanent loss of growth, he concluded: \u201cThe outcome might well prove devastating. \u201d Mr. Cameron argues that the referendum had to be called to resolve the festering debate over Britain and the European Union. As in the Scottish referendum on independence in 2014, he says, this vote represents a \u201cgreat festival of democracy\u201d on a very difficult and divisive topic. But if the Scottish referendum turned nasty, and kept the United Kingdom together, this one has become poisonous, with Mr. Cameron\u2019s own cabinet colleagues and supposed friends saying that he has eroded trust in politics, portraying him as a liar and acting like a government in waiting. It has been a campaign punctuated by numerous claims that have little relationship to the facts, with sharp tones of xenophobia, racism, nativism and Islamophobia. And it was marked tragically last Thursday by the assassination of a young Labour member of Parliament, Jo Cox, who fiercely supported remaining in the union. On Tuesday evening, some of that bitterness surfaced in a fiery television debate in which London\u2019s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, who wants Britain to remain in the bloc, said that the campaign of his opponents \u201chasn\u2019t been project fear, it\u2019s been project hate as far as immigration is concerned. \u201d Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said that Mr. Cameron \u201chas made the case against himself, and he\u2019s damaged either way. \u201d The prime minister presumably thought it would be an easy win for the \u201cRemain\u201d forces, Mr. Fielding added. \u201cBut it\u2019s far tighter than anyone thought,\u201d he said, \u201cand rather than a salve on the Tory party, it\u2019s made the fever worse. \u201d Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, is slightly less harsh. \u201cIt\u2019s really a binary legacy\u201d for Mr. Cameron, he said. \u201cIt is either one that ends in almost complete failure or one that seems pretty respectable in electoral and policy terms. I can\u2019t think of another prime minister who had so much riding on one decision. \u201d If the Remain campaign loses, \u201cthe chances of him staying on are pretty remote,\u201d Professor Bale said. \u201cHe will go down as the person who miscalculated, taking us out of Europe almost by mistake, and then shuffled off the stage\u201d in \u201ca pretty ignominious exit. \u201d Even if Britain votes to stay in the bloc, Mr. Bale said, given Mr. Cameron\u2019s small parliamentary majority, \u201cthe number of   euroskeptics and   he\u2019ll be subject to defeats and blackmail until he steps down. \u201d There are those who support the contention that Mr. Cameron had to call this referendum in the face of Tory division and the rise of the U. K. Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage. UKIP was cutting into the Conservative vote by arguing, as the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign does now, that Britain could limit immigration and control its own borders only by leaving the European Union. Mr. Cameron, who had repeatedly pledged to get immigration down to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d  \u2014   even though last year net migration was some 330, 000 people  \u2014   never had a persuasive answer to the immigration question. To pacify the growing number of   Union Tories, keep his leadership position and undermine UKIP, he promised this referendum if he won the 2015 election, which he did by a larger margin than expected. Even before the election, some, like Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House and a supporter of the Remain movement, argued that a referendum would come at some point, and that it would be more easily won under Mr. Cameron and the Tories. Charles Lewington, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, said there had to be a referendum. By 2013, he said, \u201cthere was tremendous pressure for an   referendum and not just from the old guard. \u201d Mr. Lewington cited growing concern from Conservative members of Parliament that they were at risk of losing their seats in districts where UKIP was strong. Given the panic in the party, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he could have avoided making an   manifesto commitment. \u201d But Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, is less sure. \u201cCameron didn\u2019t need to do it,\u201d Professor Travers said. Like Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister who organized a referendum on Europe in 1975, Mr. Cameron began the referendum as an exercise in \u201cinternal party discipline,\u201d he said. It was called \u201cfor party reasons more than national ones,\u201d he added. Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, a friend of Mr. Cameron\u2019s and a Tory legislator, was more scathing about the failure of several Conservative leaders to confront, rather than appease, the   Tory euroskeptics. \u201cIf you have an Alsatian sitting in front of you, and it growls at you and bares its teeth, there are two ways of dealing with it,\u201d Mr. Soames said in an interview with the British website Conservativehome. \u201cYou can pat it on the head, in which case it\u2019ll bite you, or you can kick it really hard. \u201d \u201cSuccessive prime ministers, and it\u2019s not the present prime minister alone, have never understood that they have to take these people on,\u201d Mr. Soames said. If the Remain side loses, both Mr. Cameron and his deputy, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, are likely to be gone within months, Mr. Lewington said. While all denying any ambition to replace Mr. Cameron, the sharks are in the water, led by Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a prominent campaigner for leaving the European Union. But the winner of such contests in the Tory party is rarely the one who wields the knife, and while Mr. Johnson would seem to lead the race, his success is far from assured.'"}, "time": 1742564322.9165955}
