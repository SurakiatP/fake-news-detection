[One article, \u201cHow to Destroy the Business Model of Breitbart and Fake News,\u201d written by someone actually called \u201cPagan Kennedy\u201d (was \u201cAntichrist Roosevelt\u201d not available?) celebrates the flagging effort of anonymous Twitter trolls who have tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News articles, via third party platforms.  These   censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on the merits, they would prefer to eliminate them. The Times, which prides itself as a guardian of free speech and press freedom, gives its backing to this (unsuccessful) campaign with nearly 2, 000 words of space. The article includes instructions on how to join the   effort, copied verbatim  \u2014   \u201cStep 1  \u2026     Step 2  \u2026    \u201d  \u2014   from the anonymous activists\u2019 Twitter page. And Breitbart News, the \u201cbiggest fish,\u201d is not the last intended target: the group declares that it \u201cwould like to broaden its campaign to take on a menagerie of bad actors. \u201d Evidently it is very important to the Times that this failing, and   effort to censor Breitbart News be shored up, because it has allowed several embarrassing factual errors and omissions into the article which undermine both the credibility of the \u201cPagan\u201d author and the   \u201cpaper of record\u201d itself: Speaking of \u201cfake news,\u201d the New York Times is a prime exemplar of the genre, having manufactured several stories with the clear intent of attacking and undermining conservatives, including but not limited to Breitbart News. A few recent examples: As far as \u201chate\u201d is concerned, the Times has published   by avowed terrorists like Ahmed Yousef of Hamas, the   organization that is determined to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible to achieve its genocidal aims. It has also published the work of Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is the left\u2019s bogeyman today, but who in 2013 the Times wished to help reach a wider audience, the better to stop U. S. intervention in Syria and to attack American exceptionalism. In a second Sunday   \u201cThe Tea Party and the Art of the Mean Joke,\u201d British travel writer Jonathan Raban concocts a twisted recollection of the Tea Party convention in Nashville in 2010 to explain, so he claims, the origins of Trump\u2019s rhetorical style. Raban claims, erroneously, that Tea Party activists were dreaming of a politically incorrect \u201cstrongman\u201d  \u2014   a ridiculous and false claim, given the ambivalence of the Tea Party movement about political leaders in general (even their own). He goes on to claim that Trump \u201cinherited the mantle of speaking in public like a   barfly from the man who turned out to be the star of the Nashville show: Andrew Breitbart, founder of the eponymous   media outlet. \u201d Evidently Trump\u2019s long public record has eluded Raban, who argues that Trump learned his craft from Breitbart: \u201cThe   has the blunt pugnacity of the Breitbartian style. Like his tweets, his policy statements have the brutal concision of jokes. \u201d Raban goes on to compare Trump  \u2014   and, by implication, Breitbart  \u2014   to a Latin American dictator: \u201cI once heard Jorge Luis Borges talk about how dictators relished cruel jokes as demonstrations of their power,\u201d he says, relishing this bit of recalled armchair political philosophy as some kind of proof. In fact, in his lifetime  \u2014   as Trump\u2019s many detractors were wont to point out during the election  \u2014   Andrew Breitbart had criticized Trump at times. (One area where Trump earned Andrew Breitbart\u2019s praise: his ability to see through the media\u2019s pretenses.) But again, never mind the facts. Raban describes Breitbart as a \u201c  bully,\u201d exactly inverting Breitbart\u2019s character. Andrew stood up to bullies, and relished nothing more than confronting the bullies in the mainstream media  \u2014   such as propagandists like Raban, who descend from upon high to pour scorn on the little people of Nashville,   their na\u00efve effort at   democracy as a kind of nascent fascism, making up fake historical \u201cfacts\u201d they expect no one will dare to challenge. Six years later, the little people of Nashville have finally won something, and the New York Times cannot stomach its loss. So it has attacked Breitbart News in an attempt to \u201cdestroy\u201d it. There is no greater accolade than to be considered the Times\u2018 greatest enemy. But one expects something more effective  \u2014   and more principled  \u2014   from such a formerly august institution. Sadly, the Times has decided to go the fascist route, urging the destruction of its most effective conservative competitor, using \u201cfake news\u201d to make the case for censorship to its credulous   readership. It is an effort as illiberal as it is futile. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d people in news media in 2016.
