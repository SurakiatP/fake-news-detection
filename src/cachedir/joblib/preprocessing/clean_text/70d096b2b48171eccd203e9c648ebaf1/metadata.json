RT Russian talked to residents and volunteers at migrant centers in Germany. \\nMiriam D\u00fcsterh\u00f6ft, 27, studies social science at university and believes that working at one of the refugee centers in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, will be a good experience. \\nD\u00fcsterh\u00f6ft told RT Russian that she wants to help refugees to integrate into Europe.

There was a lack of essentials, it was hard to communicate with refugees. Many didn\u2019t make any effort to learn German,\u201d she said. \\nOne of the issues at the center was a lack of interpreters of Persian or Kurdish. There was a man who translated from Arabic for men, and a woman translating for female residents. \\n\u201c[Kurdish and Persian] women do not communicate with men, they are afraid to speak about certain things. Even we [volunteers] don\u2019t know what they feel or need.\u201d \\nAsylum seekers have to spend at least six months at the center before authorities can grant them refugee status and provide them with accommodation. Sometimes they have to wait longer before receiving the status, or because the condition of the accommodation provided is much worse than that of the center, D\u00fcsterh\u00f6ft said. \\nD\u00fcsterh\u00f6ft\u2019s style of clothing at the center differs greatly from what she wears in her everyday life. Here at the migrant center she wears long skirts and trousers, and covers her hands with sleeves. \\n\u201cThis is my decision \u2013 I have a lot of tattoos all over my body, and I don\u2019t want to confuse people who aren\u2019t accustoed to this. I don\u2019t think that it infringes on my rights.\u201d \\n\u201cNo one has ever tried to rape me,\u201d she added. This isn\u2019t a random comment \u2013 asylum seekers have been accused of numerous sexual harassment incidents towards women and children in Europe since the start of 2016. \\nEarlier in October, a female interpreter for a French journalist was raped near the notorious Calais \u2018Jungle\u2019 migrant camp. Reports also emerged that the woman\u2019s attackers were three Pashto-speaking male asylum seekers. Read more \\nD\u00fcsterh\u00f6ft said she hasn\u2019t had any major conflicts with refugees. The most serious incident was when the father of one child asked not to draw animals or humans during classes because Islam forbids the depiction of people. \\n\u201cWe solved this issue and removed the controversial exercise,\u201d she said. \u2018There are bad people both among Europeans and migrants\u2019 \\nThe mother of 18-year-old student Fiona Braun, who is giving German lessons to refugees, says that her life hasn\u2019t changed with the arrival of asylum seekers. \\n\u201cMy daughter works with refugee children from Syria and Afghanistan in camps in Vienna and in Bratislava,\u201d Jana Olearnikova told RT Russian. \\n\u201cShe [Fiona] now has a lot of female friends among migrants. Fiona comes home with new recipes that she learned from the Arab girls,\u201d she said, adding that she welcomes \u201cthe opportunity to dive into Arab life\u201d and likes \u201cthe diversity of cultures in Europe.\u201d \\nOlearnikova said she\u2019s not afraid to walk alone in the evenings, despite the stories that have emerged since the refugee crisis started. \\n\u201cOf course, there may be criminals and bad people among migrants, but they may be among the Europeans, too,\u201d she said.

He understands that when he receives refugee status, he won\u2019t be able to find the same job in Germany. \\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t mind. The most important thing for me is to find myself in a new reality. I\\'m learning German, it\u2019s very difficult, but I\u2019m trying,\u201d he told RT Russian.Kasem says it will be difficult for him to settle into his new home. \\n\u201cI know that in Germany there are common swimming pools and common saunas for men and women. They bathe together naked, although completely unfamiliar with each other. I can\u2019t understand it. I guess I just won\u2019t attend such places.\" \\nHe said that the center in the town of Zirndorf, Bavaria, where he is currently living, was set on fire twice. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant. I didn\u2019t do evil to anyone and shouldn\u2019t suffer for the fact that these people hate anyone who runs away from war.\" \\n\u201cISIS [Islamic State/IS] killed my entire family, I have nowhere to go, so I decided to start a new life,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742563092.588289}
