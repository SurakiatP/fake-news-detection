Levin called it \u201cactually outstanding\u201d and likened that leadership style to former President Dwight Eisenhower. \u201cI thought the president\u2019s comments today were actually outstanding,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd he showed enormous humility. And this guy doesn\u2019t give up. I mean, he said OK, we\u2019ll fight another day. In essence, he said that events will reach a point where this is going to have to be resolved.
