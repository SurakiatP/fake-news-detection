Recipient Name Recipient Email => \\nThe American electorate\u2019s preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the \u201cprogressives\u201d and \u201cliberals\u201d who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. \\nTrump\u2019s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. \\nFrom these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugerated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously. \\nTruthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares \u201cThe David Dukes of the World Prevail.\u201d \\nKelly Hayes declares \u201cWhite Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.\u201d \\nWilliam Rivers Pitt declares \u201cWe have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.\u201d \\nHillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent\u2019s stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump. \\nEarth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. \\nThe ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put \u201con notice\u201d the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership. \\nFeminists tell us that we are \u201cgrieving, scared, and in shock,\u201d and that \u201cit is critical that we stand together and support each other.\u201d \\nJeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is \u201can incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.\u201d \\nVan Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump\u2019s election is a nightmare, \u201ca deeply painful moment,\u201d a \u201cwhitelash\u201d against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn\u2019t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. \\nAnd so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel\u2019s targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power. \\nThe progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. \\nThese are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. \\nIf only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org by permission of author or representative)\""}, "time": 1742564383.3314965}
