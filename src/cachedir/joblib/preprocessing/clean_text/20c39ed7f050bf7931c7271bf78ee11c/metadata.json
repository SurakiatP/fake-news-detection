It\u2019s not just whitewater, it\u2019s several investigations where documents have turned up missing, exonerating the Clintons and clearing them of guilt, despite huge violations of obstruction of justice.\\nHISTORY OF LOSING DOCUMENTS DURING INVESTIGATIONS: \\nIn 1999, investigators looked into then First Lady Hillary and President Bill Clinton\u2019s scandals, which included Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and other scandals. It was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed emails were mysteriously \u201clost\u201d due to a \u201cglitch\u201d in a West Wing computer server . \\nDuring the Project X email scandal, career White House staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the White House\u2019s automated email archiving system. \\nWHITEWATER: \\nThe first notable case is the whitewater land scandal fiasco, which started in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor. The allegation is that the Clintons used the Rose Law Firm and the Arkansas Financial Department Authority, as well as Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan owned by Susan and Jim McDougal , to scam Arkansas residents. An investigation was started when the Clintons invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation.\\nAn entire article could be dedicated to the Whitewater scandal, but what is important here is that documents for the whitewater investigation turned up missing were later discovered at the Clintons\u2019 home .\\nBen Shapiro of Breitbart noted in his own article on Hillary\u2019s long history of hiding documents :\\nIn 1996, a special Senate Whitewater committee released a report from the FBI demonstrating that documents sought in the Whitewater investigation had been found in the personal Clinton quarters of the White House. The First Lady\u2019s fingerprints were on them. The documents had gone mysteriously missing for two years. \\nMark Fabiani, special White House counsel, immediately stated that there was no problem, according to the Times: \u201cHe added that she had testified under oath that she had nothing to do with the documents during the two years they were missing and did not know how they ended up in the family quarters.\u201d Hillary remains the only First Lady in American history to be fingerprinted by the FBI. Those weren\u2019t the only missing Whitewater documents later found in the Clinton White House. \\nVINCE FOSTER: \\nThe next notable case, which is also connected to Whitewater is Vince Foster. Foster worked alongside the Clintons as a top Rose Law firm attorney who had worked intimately with then First Lady Hillary Clinton throughout their career together. After Foster\u2019s \u201csuicide,\u201d documents went missing from his office . Secret Service officer Henry O\u2019Neill testified that he witnessed aides removing documents.\\nSeveral years later, more documents pertaining to Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster again vanished, this time from the National Library including a document from Ken Star\u2019s investigation that proves that the \u201csuicide\u201d of Vince Foster was actually a murder . In those documents is the smoking gun that shows that Vince Foster sustained not one but two bullet wounds. One to the neck and one to the head an impossible suicide scenario.\\nIn addition to that, experts have called Foster\u2019s suicide note \u201ca forgery.\u201d One of my rules is once, twice, okay, but three times is not a coincidence\u2014it\u2019s a criminal conspiracy. Conspiracy, as in the legal definition not a theory none of this is a theory when it\u2019s well sourced.\\nTRAVEL GATE: \\nIn 1996, the day before the Whitewater documents were found at the White House, a two-year-old memo emerged written by a former Presidential aide. According to the New York Times it proved that Hillary Clinton \u201chad played a far greater role in the dismissal of employees of the White House travel office than the Administration has acknowledged.\u201d \\nPROJECT X EMAIL GATE: \\nAccording to Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, Hillary\u2019s top lawyer and top aide, Cheryl Mills \u201chelped orchestrate the cover-up of another major scandal, often referred to as \u2018Project X Email-gate.\u2019\u201d Over the course of years, the Clinton Administration allegedly withheld 1.8 million email communications from Judicial Watch\u2019s attorneys, as well as federal investigators and Congress. In addition, Judicial Watch says that when a White House computer contractor attempted to reveal the emails, White House officials \u201cinstructed her to keep her mouth shut about the hidden e-mail or face dismissal and jail time.\u201d \\n2015-2016 EMAIL GATE: \\nWhere do I start about the botched investigation of Hillary\u2019s private email server? The obstruction of justice is so broad, it\u2019s insane. She used \u201cbleach bit\u201d software the day after being subpoenaed, smashed several BlackBerrys and iPads with hammers, was tipped off by the DoJ and DoS into the investigation, according to Wikileaks, etc.\\nClinton\u2019s close ally Terry McAulife gave a donation to the wife of the Deputy Director Of The FBI. Bill Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch towards the end of the investigation. The list goes on\u2026\\n2 TERABYTES OF DATA MISSING: \\nTwo terrabyte drive with Clinton White House emails missing, presumed stolen from National Archives https://t.co/p3eZqxKxke pic.twitter.com/792rxje642 \\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 3, 2016 \\n\\nYet even with all of the evidence, the current FBI director\u2014who has been revealed to be connected to the Clintons\u2014has once again refused to acknowledge the corrupt career nature of the Clintons.\\nDirector James Comey told Congress Sunday that the FBI does not recommend charges against Clinton, even after an additional 650,000 emails were discovered on the laptop of her aide\u2019s estranged husband, Anthony Weiner.\\nWhether it\u2019s deleting emails or covering up documents to prevent prosecution, it has always been the Clinton way. Why is it that journalists can uncover this past historic information, but the FBI investigators can\u2019t? \\nSomething isn\u2019t right. Drain the swamp and nominate AK for FBI Director 2017, and stay tuned to We Are Change. This case is closed. The Clintons are corrupt. That, or documents have somehow developed an artificial intelligence to stay away from the Clintons. It must be a right wing conspiracy. I would be willing to put my deplorable eggs into one basket and say it\u2019s the latter.\\nThe post OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE: The Clintons\u2019 Long History Of Losing Documents appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742563714.9991403}
