Trump, said on Sunday that it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d to remove Mr. Trump\u2019s children from their roles in running his business empire and place the assets into a strict blind trust like the ones used by previous presidents. \u201cI think he\u2019s in a very unusual situation,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201d \u201cHe would basically put his children out of work,\u201d he added, \u201cand they\u2019d have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up new problems. \u201d As president, Mr. Trump will not be required to sell his assets, which he has valued in billions of dollars. But the vast scope of Mr. Trump\u2019s assets and business dealings is likely to lead to questions about how his actions as president would affect the financial fortunes of him and his family. Most modern presidents have elected to use a blind trust, which puts their assets under the control of an independent trustee. Ethics experts said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s remarks were misguided on ethical and political grounds. Kenneth A. Gross, a lawyer who advises corporations and members of Congress on ethics issues, said it was important for Mr. Trump \u201cto separate his vast business interests from his official decision making. \u201d \u201cIf not, it is going to be a constant thorn in his side,\u201d Mr. Gross added. \u201cIt might even be unfair criticism he will get, as he might be acting in the public interest and still be accused of promoting his business interests because he has not separated them as much as possible. \u201d Turning his business operations over to his children would not insulate him from ethical questions, Mr. Gross said, and may even exacerbate them. Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics officer during the George W. Bush administration, said it would be problematic if Mr. Trump used such an arrangement, given that he would ultimately retain ownership of the assets. \u201cIt is extremely inappropriate,\u201d said Mr. Painter, who has been a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIn the past 200 years, we have never had a president with such egregious conflicts of interest with family business holdings. \u201d Mr. Giuliani, a vice chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team who is believed to be under consideration for various posts in the Trump administration, including attorney general, said fears of a conflict of interest were groundless. Mr. Trump\u2019s three eldest children, who hold leadership positions in his businesses, said in an interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that was broadcast Sunday that they would not work in the administration in any formal capacity. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in New York, and we\u2019ll take care of the business,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have lots of fun doing it. And we\u2019re going to make him very proud. \u201d The three children, including Ivanka and Donald Jr. as well as Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, are members of the executive council of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition committee. Once Mr. Trump takes office, Mr. Giuliani said, the president will erect \u201ca wall between them with regard to government matters. \u201d \u201cYou have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThe man is an enormously wealthy man. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real fear or suspicion that he\u2019s seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn\u2019t have run for president. \u201d The financial arrangement was one of a number of questions surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s transition efforts, as his team moved toward announcing staff positions, tried to clarify the  \u2019s agenda and sought to reassure those still questioning his fitness for office. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, batted down questions on several television news programs about who would fill critical positions in the coming administration, and she argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory had already demonstrated that he could bring together Democrats and Republicans. Ms. Conway went further on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d saying that it was incumbent upon Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, President Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, to calm the passions of their supporters who are objecting to Mr. Trump. She said that many of them were \u201cmasquerading as protesters,\u201d and that Democratic leaders should ask those critical of Mr. Trump \u201cto give this man a chance so that this country can flourish. \u201d She said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that she disagreed with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks to donors on Saturday in which the candidate blamed the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, for her election defeat. The Clinton campaign \u201cmisread America,\u201d Ms. Conway said, and should take ownership of its loss. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s always somebody else\u2019s fault,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you just have to take a look in the mirror and reflect on what went wrong. \u201d The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, seeking to outline a prospective Republican legislative agenda for Mr. Trump\u2019s first days in office, said on Sunday that Mr. Trump\u2019s border security efforts included no plans to create a deportation force  \u2014   a specter raised during the campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on \u201cState of the Union. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re focused on securing the border. We think that\u2019s first and foremost before we get into any other immigration issue. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563762.8333898}
