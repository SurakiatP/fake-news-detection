She tried her hand at short stories and poems in the style of Dylan Thomas before finding work writing advertising copy. \u201cShe was always very, very interested in writing as an art form,\u201d said an   Stephen Palitz. He said Ms. McIver brought a dancer\u2019s discipline, precision and rigor to her work. \u201cShe\u2019s adept at crystallizing phrases and saying things in an elegant straightforward way. \u201d This week, Ms. McIver returned to center stage for her writing, but not in the manner she might have hoped. \u201cMy name is Meredith McIver and I\u2019m an   staff writer at the Trump Organization,\u201d began an extraordinary statement she released Wednesday morning in which she took the blame for the disastrous plagiarism of Michelle Obama in Melania Trump\u2019s   speech Monday at the Republican National Convention. In the statement, Ms. McIver, a      of several books with Donald J. Trump, said that as she and Ms. Trump were preparing her speech, Ms. Trump mentioned that she admired Mrs. Obama and read to Ms. McIver parts of the first lady\u2019s 2008 speech at the Democratic convention. Ms. McIver said she had inadvertently left portions of the Obama speech in the final draft. \u201cThis was my mistake,\u201d she wrote. She wrote that she had offered her resignation, but that the Trumps had rejected it. \u201cMr. Trump told me that people make innocent mistakes and that we learn and grow from these experiences. \u201d \u201cI feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama,\u201d Ms. McIver wrote. \u201cNo harm was meant. \u201d But harm was of course done. After a Twitter user discovered the plagiarism, the story of the cribbed lines hung over the convention and eclipsed the otherwise positive response to Ms. Trump\u2019s speech. Her husband\u2019s warring advisers pointed fingers at one another. His family was furious. The campaign chairman said that he believed Ms. Trump wrote the speech herself, as she asserted, and that it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d to think she would crib lines when all of America was watching. As it turned out, Ms. Trump had torn up an early version of her address done by two professional Republican speechwriters. Instead, in a campaign that blurs the lines between family, business and politics, Ms. Trump reached out to one of the most trusted people inside Trump Tower for help. Now Ms. McIver, a registered Democrat with no known political experience, is suddenly at the center of one of the biggest political stories in the country. Mr. Palitz, a lawyer who has remained friends with Ms. McIver for decades, said that knowing her generally meticulous attention to detail, \u201cit sounds like she sort of stepped up and fell on her sword. \u201d It was not the first time Ms. McIver was faulted for lines she wrote for the Trumps. In a 2007 deposition, Mr. Trump was grilled over whether he had overstated his debt by billions of dollars in a couple of his   books to make his comeback seem more significant. He acknowledged the exaggeration, but the mistake, he said, was not his. \u201cThis is somebody that wrote it, probably Meredith McIver,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The daughter of ballroom dancers, Ms. McIver, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, grew up in Northern California, before coming to New York at age 14 on a Ford Foundation scholarship for dance. She studied at the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet, from 1965 through 1970. She then went to dance out west, Mr. Palitz said, and enrolled at the University of Utah. An English major, she graduated magna cum laude in 1976. She returned to New York and in 1981 danced in the company of the revival of \u201cCan Can\u201d at the Minskoff Theater in New York. It closed after five performances. ( \u201cMediocre material, no matter how it\u2019s sliced, is still mediocre material,\u201d The New York Times wrote in its review.) She settled on the Upper West Side, and her fashionable dress, dancer\u2019s figure and green eyes turned heads at the grocery. She traveled to the Netherlands and France. In \u201cHow to Get Rich,\u201d which she   with Mr. Trump, she thanked Alain Bernardin, the owner of a famed Paris striptease saloon, the Crazy Horse. But dancing eventually took its toll, and after writing lyrics with Mr. Palitz, a classical guitarist, she joined her sister Karen, the art director at the advertising firm Lotas Minard Patton McIver. Around the time Karen left the firm more than a decade later, her sister entered Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. In 2004\u2019s \u201cHow to Get Rich,\u201d Mr. Trump paid tribute to his   who worked from a desk outside his office. \u201cAs you know, my door is always open, so Meredith has heard everything, and she\u2019s taken good notes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe\u2019s done a remarkable job of helping me put my thoughts and experiences on paper. I am tremendously grateful to her. \u201d And Ms. McIver seemed grateful to Mr. Trump, as well as his future wife. In 2005\u2019s \u201cTrump: Think Like a Billionaire,\u201d Ms. McIver, again a   took the opportunity to acknowledge \u201cMelania Knauss for her kind assistance. \u201d As she had once dreamed, her name appeared on the covers of books, and she sent copies of them signed by Mr. Trump and inscribed with her own notes to friends, including Mr. Palitz. \u201cMeredith was a   person for a lot of projects  \u2014   I often heard her name,\u201d said Adam Eisenstat, who wrote for a blog and online newsletter under Mr. Trump\u2019s name for Trump University in 2005 and 2006. \u201cLike, \u2018Meredith will take care of it.\u2019 \u201d Georgina Levitt, an associate publisher at Vanguard Press, which published a collection of Mr. Trump\u2019s essays called \u201cThink Like a Champion: An Informal Education In Business and Life\u201d in 2010, recalled Ms. McIver  \u2014   a voracious reader often seen with a bob haircut, tailored blazers and red lipstick  \u2014   as a helpful liaison to Mr. Trump. \u201cIt seemed like there was a history, an element of trust between them,\u201d Ms. Levitt said. Today, Ms. McIver is considered part of the extended Trump family. \u201cShe is terrific, she\u2019s a terrific woman,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cShe\u2019s been with us a long time and she just made a mistake. \u201d \u201cShe came in and she said, \u2018Mr. Trump, I\u2019d like to say what happened.\u2019 I thought it was such a nice thing. Who knew this was going to be a big story?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628550.7915447}
