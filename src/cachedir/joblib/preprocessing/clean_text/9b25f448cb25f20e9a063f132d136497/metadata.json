Originally appeared at Medium.com \\nOn March 22, 2016 William \u201cBilly\u201d Rhinehart, a regional field director at the Democratic National Committee, received an email from Google warning him that someone tried to access his account and that he should immediately change his password. He complied. \\nUnfortunately for Mr. Rhinehart, it wasn\u2019t Google who sent him that email. He, along with many others, were a victim of Threat Group 4127\\u200a\u2014\\u200athe SecureWorks designation for Fancy Bear (CrowdStrike), APT28 (FireEye), and Sofacy (Kaspersky Lab). Secureworks assesses that TG 4127 \u201cis operating from the Russian Federation and is gathering intelligence on behalf of the Russian government.\u201d \\nThanks to a bizarre twist involving Guccifer 2.0\u2019s solicitation of a journalist at The Smoking Gun (TSG) to write about the DCLeaks emails in exchange for giving TSG an early look at some of the stolen documents, TSG was able to obtain the original spear phishing email directly from Billy Rhinehart and shared it with ThreatConnect, who posted this screenshot of the email\u2019s headers and identified the actual sender of the email:hi.mymail@yandex.com. 1-ibuqqojl1spagetqb9oumq.png \\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With This Picture? \\nYandex is the Google of Russia. Like Google, Yandex is a search engine, and, like Gmail, Yandex\u2018s users can open a free email account. \\nWhen you visit Yandex.ru and create a new email account, the email assigned to you has the .ru domain. However, hi.mymail@yandex.com has a .com domain. There\u2019s only one reason why something like that would happen, but first, here\u2019s what a Russian user would see when he creates a Yandex email account on RUNET (the Russian Internet). \\nStep One: Pretend that you\u2018re in Russia \\nSecureworks says that you work on behalf of the Russian government. CrowdStrike says that you\u2019re an employee of the Russian government. And everyone else believes that you\u2019re Russian so for this little experiment to work, you need to be on the Russian Internet. \\nAssuming that you aren\u2019t already in Russia, you\u2019ll need to connect to a Russian proxy server. I have an account with PrivateVPN and used vpn-ru1.privatevpn.com for my test. \\nOnce you\u2019re connected, run a test to make sure that you\u2019re on RUNET by visiting http://www.ip2location.com/ . It will show you your IP address and geolocation. \\nStep Two: Go to Yandex.ru \\nType Yandex.ru into your browser\u2019s address bar. You should see it resolve to https://yandex.ru/ .'"}, "time": 1742562455.7733848}
