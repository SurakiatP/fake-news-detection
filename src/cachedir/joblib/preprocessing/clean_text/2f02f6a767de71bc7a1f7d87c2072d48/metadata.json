One is a very good idea, and one is a terrible idea. The idea of being physically safe on campus, not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse, or something like that. Being targeted specifically  \u2026    Hey, I\u2019m perfectly fine with that,\u201d Jones claimed. \u201cBut there is another view that is now, I think, ascendent  \u2026     It\u2019s a horrible view, which is that \u2018I need to be safe ideologically, I need to be safe emotionally, I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone else says something that I don\u2019t like that is a problem for everyone else including the administration,\u201d he continued. Jones suggested that safe spaces from ideas contradict the purpose of a university education: \u201cI think that\u2019s a terrible idea for the following reason: I don\u2019t want you to be safe ideologically. I don\u2019t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That\u2019s different. I\u2019m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots and learn how to deal with adversity. I\u2019m not going to take the weights out of the gym. That\u2019s the whole point of the gym. You can\u2019t live on a campus where people say stuff that you don\u2019t like?\u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.
