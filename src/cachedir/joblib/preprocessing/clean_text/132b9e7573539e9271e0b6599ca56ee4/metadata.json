A posthuman one. \\ntranscript with references and additional a/v material: \\nUndoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears \u201cbecause: racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobia\u201d; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, to be a paper tiger. \\nHowever, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly \u2013 and just as unreal \u2013 as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct \u201c shitlib \u201d. \\nIn the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the \u201calternative right\u201d movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of \u201cchildren of the sun\u201d. \\nThis is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent \u2013 a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me \u2013 pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal \u2013 and quite unidirectional \u2013 circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting \u00fcbermenschen \u2013 from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. \\nHowever, there\u2019s a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The \u201cpure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy\u201d (Nietzsche) in it\u2019s virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika \u2013 as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. \\nThe symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos. \\nIn the lines to follow, we\u2019ll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle \u2013 and adjacent chaos logic \u2013 through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer\u2019s speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . \\n\\nTriumph of the will or hipster Babylon working \\n\\nIn introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: \\n\u201cBut even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality \u2013 or perhaps too painfully intense reality \u2013 when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly important\u2013the victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality. \u201d \\nIt is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is \u201cKek\u201d and what exactly is \u201cmeme magic\u201d. \\nWe\u2019ll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. \\n\u201cMeme\u201d is an expression denoting \u201cinexistent existent\u201d, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to \u201cinfect\u201d the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because there\u2019s no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. \\nWell, it works because it is magical. \\n\\nChaos Magick \\n\\nHere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern \u2013 in fact posthumanist \u2013 vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can \u2013 and should \u2013 be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with \u201cprinciple of evolution\u201d it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . \\nTherefore \u201cmeme magick\u201d works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with \u201cmemes\u201d as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. \\nThe goal of practitioner of such magic \u2013 a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic \u2013 is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural \u201cdomain\u201d of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that it\u2019s practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. \\nThe idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . \\nThere are many interesting implications to this. \\nThe first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, you\u2019ll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that there\u2019s no hierarchy of higher and lower \u2013 there\u2019s only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As there\u2019s nothing higher, there\u2019s nothing to be revered and everything can \u2013 and indeed: should \u2013 be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called \u201cdream logic\u201d but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . \\nIn this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump\u2019s victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. \\nTrump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality \u2013 virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives \u2013 from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks \u2013 is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective \u201creality tunnel\u201d, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. \\nIn this sense we can observe new \u201cGod Emperor of USA\u201d as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet \u2013 today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencer\u2019s remark to it\u2019s logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world\u2019s first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. \\nSo that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. \\n\\n\\nWe owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek? \\nWell, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal \u201chalf-joke\u201d: Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar \u2013 Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. \\nNamely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. \\nThe expression \u201ckek\u201d was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation \u201cLOL\u201d (\u201claughing out loud\u201d). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity \u2013 ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. \\nIt is important to point out that in view of the most \u201cesoteric Kekists\u201d, that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities \u2013 causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to \u2018cuck\u2019(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not \u201cred pilled\u201d (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. \\nA good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification \\nHowever, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: \\n\u201eOne last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. \\nEvery post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. This number represents that post\u2019s entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. \\nWith the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called \u201cdubs\u201d, \u201ctrips\u201d, \u201cquads\u201d, and so on. \\nSince a poster can\u2019t know their post number until after they\u2019ve submitted the post, its common for people to \u201cbet\u201d the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits (\u2026) When that endeavor proves a successful, a \u201cGET\u201d has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. \\nOut of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasn\u2019t long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: Pepe the Frog (now /pol/\u2019s unofficial mascot) Donald Trump (/pol/\u2019s overwhelming candidate of choice) Repeating digit post numbers (\u201cGETS\u201d) \u201cKEK\u201d (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trump\u2019s \u201ctrolling\u201d of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general) \\n\u2026and a god was born.\u201c ( source ) \\n\\nSynchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. \\nNamely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its \u201cpractitioner\u201d to impose his own will and change the world \u2013 as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. \\nI would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism \u2013 in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles \u2013 above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being \u2013 into nothingness of primordial Chaos. \\n\\nPosthuman traditionalism \\n\\nI already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing \u2013 with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what it\u2019s leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition \u2013 something Richard Spencer likes to call \u201cpolitical theology\u201d \u2013 founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with \u201cdo your own thing\u201d mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer \u2013 half jokingly of course \u2013 that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right \u201ctraditionalists\u201d is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . \\nIn the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with \u201cidentity\u201d in general and \u201cwhite identity\u201d in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in it\u2019s vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic \u2013 and to a large extent made up \u2013 pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among \u201cgame\u201d bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind \u2013 actually the only one there is \u2013 while at the same time musing about \u201calpha and beta males\u201d, \u201csexual market\u201d, \u201csignaling and counter-signaling\u201d, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. \\nThe allure of alt right lies in it\u2019s dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark \u2013 with irony of the man who knows he\u2019s a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. \\nWe\u2019ll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. There\u2019s only one Chaos and there\u2019s only one bringer of light from Chaos \u2013 as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog\u2019s main job . And it\u2019s not the One to be defined as \u201cGod from God, Light from Light\u201d, but \u201cGod from Gutter, Light from Darkness\u201d. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. \\nSo, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your \u201chail\u201d. \\n*** \\nAuthor Branko Mali\u0107 is a Croatian author and owner of Kali Tribune , with the background in classical philosophy.
