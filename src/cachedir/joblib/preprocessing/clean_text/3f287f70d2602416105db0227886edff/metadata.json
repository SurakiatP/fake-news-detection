We have taken the stream down after shots were reported in the area. The safety of everybody participating in our project is paramount.  \u2014   Shia LaBeouf (@thecampaignbook) February 23, 2017,  LaBeouf initially launched his    live stream at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York, hours before Trump was sworn in as America\u2019s 45th President. The concept of the project was to have museum patrons stand in front of a camera placed on a wall, which had the phrase \u201cHe Will Not Divide Us\u201d written on it. The camera was initially intended to record participants  \u2014   and the Transformers star  \u2014   shouting the   phrase into the camera 24 hours a day for the remainder of Trump\u2019s term in office. But less than a month after it was established, LaBeouf\u2019s live stream was over as he was taken away in handcuffs by police following an alleged physical altercation between him and a Trump supporter. The museum promptly shut down the project and LaBeouf and collaborators Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner blasted the decision in a blog post. Earlier this month, the    actor moved the   art exhibit to the El Rey Theatre in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. \u201cWe are anti the normalization of division. That\u2019s it,\u201d LaBeouf told the Albuquerque Journal on Saturday, the first day at its new location. \u201cThe rest of the info is right there, chief, I got nothing else to say to you. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563547.9945188}
