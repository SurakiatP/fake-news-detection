This is a supercharged vessel capable of hitting top speeds of 56 kilometers per hour. The ferry can accommodate around 75 people, plus 15 bicycles. Engineers say its speed, range and low environmental impact will convince commuters to trade their daily drive for a waterborne journey. \\nInstead of a chugging motor down in its hull, there's a humming 200 kilowatt hour lithium-ion battery bank. \\nThose involved with the project believe the rapidly recharging batteries make it a competitive choice for a number of routes and commuter journeys. \\nKey to the ferry's high speed is its unique air supported vessel technology that reduces water resistance by around 40 percent. Using an electric fan system and its unique hull shape, approximately 80 percent of the vessel's weight is supported on a cushion of air. Loading ...\""}, "time": 1742628435.7993734}
