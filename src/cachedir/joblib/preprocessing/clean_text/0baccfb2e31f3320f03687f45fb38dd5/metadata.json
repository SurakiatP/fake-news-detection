[French newspaper L\u2019Obs reports that Small Heath, a neighbourhood of Birmingham where 95 per cent of residents practise Islam, is one of the most popular spots for French Muslims seeking a new home where women can wear the full face veil. The garment has been banned since 2010 in France.  \u201cDaesh [ISIS] isn\u2019t here, and no one is looking at you,\u201d explained Dounia, a woman of Moroccan origin who moved to Small Heath from France with her husband Karim and his four children a year ago. Life in the area is \u201ccool\u201d for Muslims, she said, telling L\u2019Obs how there are single sex gymnasiums and pool schedules with segregated swimming, that shops contain prayer rooms and how, in hospitals, women can ask to be seen by a female doctor. Another reason the pair settled in Small Heath was to \u201cblend in with the masses\u201d Dounia said. A big draw of the UK for Muslims seeking to leave France, L\u2019Obs reports, is the lack of scrutiny in comparison to France and other countries in Europe, where security services often closely monitor Salafists. Earlier in May, Karim, a    Muslim convert, spoke at his    daughter\u2019s school to explain that the family moved to Britain seeking \u201cfreedom\u201d. \u201cThe children were not aware that [in France] girls are not allowed to wear the veil at school, or that there are no halal dishes in the canteen. They were shocked,\u201d he told L\u2019Obs. And the threat of Brexit accelerated the Salafist exodus to Britain, according to Hussein, who stated that there are around 100 families living in Small Heath who have moved from France, \u201cat least 300 in Birmingham\u201d. The migrant, described by L\u2019Obs as a \u201cpillar of the community\u201d in Birmingham, said other UK \u201chotspots\u201d prized by Salafists such as Luton, Leicester, and a number of suburbs in London have seen similar movements. Britain has received an influx of Salafists from across Europe, reports L\u2019Obs, noting Salafists from across Europe, especially from \u201cParis, Roubaix, Marseilles, Bordeaux   \u2026     Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain\u201d have migrated to the UK. The magazine tells readers that for Muslims in the UK: \u201cLife is cheap, unemployment is low and mosques and madrasas are plentiful. \u201d Young Muslims who have made the move from France to Britain find themselves missing family members, their neighbourhood, and aspects of France such as \u201cthe climate and the cheese\u201d. But, as Hassan explained to L\u2019Obs, each migrant has his own anecdote as to why Britain\u2019s   environment means \u2018they have no regrets\u2019. \u201cWhen a Muslim friend has suffered a racist insult, he has complained about it and the manager has been fired,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have no chance of that happening in France. \u201d \u201cIn France it is impossible to tell your boss that you have to pray, but here, you can do it everywhere. \u201cAt Ikea, at the factory   \u2026     It is the manager who comes to propose it to you,\u201d Hassan added. Not everything in Small Heath is rosy according to Selma, an English convert to Islam, complaining that far right groups have held protests in the area before. \u201cBut it\u2019s a minority,\u201d she said, and highlighted how even state schools \u201cencourage the practice of rigorous Islam\u201d. \u201cIt is the teacher who calls up to make sure the little girls don\u2019t forget to wear their headscarves,\u201d she told L\u2019Obs. And schools played a large part in Hussein\u2019s decision to move to Britain with his family, too, reporting they fled \u201cthe homosexual propaganda\u201d in French state schools. \u201cWe were rejected in France, and it was reciprocal, we built ourselves in religion, and we find ourselves here because we are accepted. \u201d \u201cI wanted my wife to be able to wear the veil, and for the children to get an education in keeping with our values,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gay marriage. How can we accept that?\u201d Asked why   Salafists in France move to Britain rather than a Muslim country, Paris emigrant Hassan told L\u2019Obs that whilst a move to Saudi Arabia would be \u201cideal\u201d the country makes it difficult for families to get work or visas. \u201cWe are caught in the crossfire, Europe does not like us, but we are not really welcome [in the Gulf states] either,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say to you, \u2018Go home, brother. You have nothing to do here. \u2019\u201d But for Salafists wanting to live in accordance with strict Islamic teachings, \u201cthere is nothing easier for [Muslims with European passports] than to settle in Britain\u201d where there is \u201ca generous welfare package, public services delivered free, plenty of available work, and all with no visa or residence permit required\u201d. according to L\u2019Obs. \u201cHijra is the call to emigrate to a land that\u2019s welcoming to Muslims,\u201d Hussein told the French weekly. \u201cFor us, it is. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563278.8014705}
