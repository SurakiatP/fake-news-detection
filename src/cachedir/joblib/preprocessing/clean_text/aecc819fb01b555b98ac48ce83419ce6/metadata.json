[\u201cEconomist Luis de la Calle   \u2026     predicted that, in the short term, average wages [in Mexico] will drop as more qualified people enter the country to compete for scarce jobs [and] the overall economy is likely to expand in the long run when those people start to succeed,\u201d said the March 3 Washington Post article, which noted that roughly 500 Mexicans are being sent home each day by Trump\u2019s popular emphasis on enforcement of the immigration laws.  \u201cWe suffered a cost as a nation by sending those hard workers to the U. S. in the sense that we lost a lot of talent [so] when they come back to Mexico and they are properly trained, they will make more than a proportional contribution to Mexico,\u201d La Calle told the Post. The labor stimulus from the United States back into Mexico will drive down labor costs, said the Post, mirroring Trump\u2019s argument that the reduction of legal and illegal immigrant labor in the United States will drive up wages for Americans. \u201cMore returnees [to Mexico] means lower wages for everybody in   industries such as construction and automobile manufacturing, where competition for jobs is likely to increase, economists say. \u201d the Post said. But the Mexicans who are returning to Mexico\u2019s   economy bring their skills, including a knowledge of what is possible in a     civic society, says experts cited by the Washington Post. \u201cA lot of these people ran businesses in the U. S. and did well,\u201d said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cIn the same way that in the United States we saw a wave of Mexicans who became part of the American culture and changed it, we\u2019re now seeing a wave of Mexicans moving back who are integrating American culture into Mexico. \u201d   \u2026     Jill Anderson, director of Otros Dreams en Acci\u00f3n (Other Dreams in Action) an advocacy group for former undocumented immigrants who grew up in the United States   \u2026     [said] \u201cIt really interrupts the economic and social norms of Mexico   \u2026     They speak English, and they\u2019re asking for access to higher education and to employment in ways that their parents were not able to. \u201d Read the entire article here.   percent of Trump supporters have a positive view of Mexican immigrants in the United States  \u2014   but 75 percent of his supporters also have a positive view of \u201cMexicans living in Mexico,\u201d according to a survey of 2, 061 adult Americans, published Oct. 6 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. That positive view of    is shared by 80 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of all Americans, and 82 percent of Democrats, leaving Trump\u2019s supporters with similar generous attitudes as other Americans towards foreigners living in their countries. In his Feb. 28 speech to the joint session of Congress, Trump declared: Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others  \u2014    have a   immigration system.  It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\u2019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of   immigration, and instead adopting a   system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages, and help struggling families  \u2014    including immigrant families  \u2014    enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security, and to restore respect for our laws. Trump\u2019s proposed shift to \u201ca   immigration system\u201d would reduce the inflow of unskilled migrants, but perhaps also raise the inflow of skilled migrants.  '"}, "time": 1742628518.870725}
