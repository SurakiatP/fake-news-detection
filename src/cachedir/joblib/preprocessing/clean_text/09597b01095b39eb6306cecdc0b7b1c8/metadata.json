Pennies are like the \u2018extras\u2019 of our society; nobody really wants them. In fact, the US government has even discussed getting rid of pennies for good, but it has yet to happen. One Reddit user thought he had just another normal penny, until he took a closer look at it. There are scores of stories of people finding old coinage, but few of somebody finding a blank penny! That\u2019s right, this Reddit user came across a penny with no face on it. I guess Abe Lincoln had to go for a walk. Turns out that \u201cblankface pennies\u201d are not super rare, but they are a cool find. When a minting press misses a coin to be stamped, it is left without an imprint on it, and thus looks like the penny below. Minting presses typically end up giving these coins away on tours because they are not up to par with the rest of their production. Here is a side by side comparison of an old and new penny, in case you forgot what the face is supposed to look like: Other Reddit users responded with much vibrancy, saying things like, \u201cI never wanted a penny more!\u201d or \u201cThat looks super cool! Nice find there.\u201d As it turns out, blank face or \u201cblank planchet\u201d pennies sell for between $1 and $2, thus making them a 10,000% return on investment! According to About.com, \u201cA blank coin, technically called a blank planchet if it has an upraised rim on it, is worth a few dollars, perhaps $2 to $4 if it\u2019s clad, more if it\u2019s silver. The Sacajawea, Presidential, and Native American Dollar coins all use the same type of planchet. These coins are worth anywhere from twelve dollars to fifteen dollars.\u201d The value of blank face coins will also vary depending on if the coin has a rim or edge on it. About.com says, \u201cIf your blank coin doesn\u2019t even have the upraised rim yet, it\u2019s technically a coin blank. If it is made of silver, it is almost impossible to authenticate, but if it\u2019s clad, an expert in error coins could probably authenticate it, in which case (if authentic) it\u2019s worth maybe $50 or more.\u201d If you would like to see more \u201cerror coins\u201d and learn more about blank planchet pennies, check out the video below and let us know your thoughts on this unnaturally smooth coin! \\nSource:'"}, "time": 1742628509.8887467}
