He was looking into the crowd, his hand over his eyes to block the glare from the stage lights, when Secret Service agents grabbed him and escorted him off the stage. Trump ducked his head as he left the stage. The crowd panicked with frightened looks on their faces, as the Secret Service and police tactical units rushed in to quickly arrest the man. Early unconfirmed reports suggest a man was armed in the crowd according to some witnesses. The man was then detained by police officers, Secret Service agents and SWAT armed with assault rifles and taken to a side room for questioning. Trump returned to the stage minutes later and proceeded to continue his speech before thanking the Secret Service and police. \u201cNobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped. We will never be stopped. I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic.\u201d \\n~Donald Trump, said.\\n(THIS IS A DEVELOPING STORY AND WILL BE UPDATED AS NEW DETAILS BECOME AVAILABLE.)
