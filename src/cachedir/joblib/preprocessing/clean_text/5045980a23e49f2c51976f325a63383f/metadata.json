Every top Democrat from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama has argued that. \\nThey have been saying this ever since the first hacks on the Democratic National Committee happened back in July. And they have continued that claim with every hack that has happened since. Most recently they have been saying that the hacks on Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were part of yet another Russian hack. \\nThey have claimed that the hacks were done in order to influence the election in favor of Trump. Not everyone believes that lie. In fact there are people out there that think that the source of the hack has come from the United States government. \\nOne person that believes that is former British ambassador Craig Murray. He says that the source of the Podesta leaks was a Washington insider rather than someone from Russia. That would mean that Clinton\u2019s campaign is continuing to make a false claim on a foreign country! \\nMurray told Sputnik, \u201cThe source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all. I discovered what the source was when I attended the Sam Adam\u2019s whistleblower award in Washington. The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow.\u201d \\nThat means that there is someone in Washington that is doing what he or she can to end the corruption of the Clintons. And yet her camp continues to claim that someone within Russia did it. Because that is a phenomenal way to create peace between two nations that have nuclear weapons. Someone In Washington Is Trying To Make Sure Hillary Doesn\u2019t Win \\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only thing that Murray went on to destroy. He went on to blast the Democrats other narrative that WikiLeaks is a source for Russia. He has said that such claims are \u201cdesigned to divert attention from the content of the material.\u201d That means that they are hiding something if they are spending this much time trying to change the story. \\nWikiLeaks also decided to mock the Clinton campaign\u2019s literal obsession with conspiracy theories with a tweet. They said, \u201cNo link between Trump & Russia. No link between Assange & Russia. But Podesta & Clinton involved in selling 20% of US uranium to Russia.\u201d \\nThis tweet was in reference to the fact that the FBI found nothing of substance that connected Donald Trump to Russia. They literally said that he had \u201cno clear link to Russia.\u201d So once again, the Democrats attempt to say something like that is proven false. \\nThat also means that if the Democrats continue to blame Trump for this supposed Russian hack on their servers, then they are definitely hiding something. Because the FBI has cleared Trump of any connection to Russia and now there is a former British ambassador that has said that the hacks were coming from someone located in Washington. \\nAnd there are other claims to back that up. There was a YouTube video that was released and has gone viral. In it, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Steve Pieczenik is talking about how there are people in the United States government are doing what they can to prevent Clinton from becoming president of the United States. \\nHe has said that members of the United States government, including the FBI and the CIA, have \u201cinitiated a counter-coup through Julian Assange and WikiLeaks in order to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president of the United States.\u201d Pieczenik has also said that Assange has released \u201cemails that we gave to him in order to undermine Hillary and Bill Clinton.\u201d \\nThat is two former high ranking members of their respective governments saying that the leak has come from Washington and not Russia like the Democrats want you to believe. But it goes even further than that. What Murray has said is true. They are doing whatever they can to have the people of the United States not look at those emails that were released. The Democrats Continue To Blame Russia For The Hacks. Because That Is A Great Foreign Policy Tactic \\nThat is because those emails have shown that the Democrats are engaging in some highly illegal activity. From all the leaks that we have seen, the Democrats have engaged in election rigging, pay-to-play operations, and cheating in several different debates. But of course when you try and confront them on this, they will attempt to say that Russia was behind it or that Trump was behind it. \\nOne of the excuses that they have also given has come from interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile. During the second hack of the DNC back in July she attempted to scare people from reading the hacked emails by saying that they could possibly be infected with malware . Really? If you are making this big an attempt to stop people from reading them, then you are obviously hiding something! \\nOf course Brazile was mentioned in those WikiLeaks emails as well. She was guilty of giving Clinton a question that was going to appear in a town hall. And when someone called her out on it, Brazile attempted to say that she was being \u201c persecuted .\u201d It\u2019s not persecution if the answer is right in front of you! You were literally doing what you could to help out Clinton as much as possible. \\nShare this article to show that there are people out there that believe that the hacks on the Democratic Party are coming from Washington itself rather than Russia. And considering that the Democrats continue to blame Russia for the hacks means that they are just damaging the foreign relationships even more. \\nThat is not something that the United States can afford anymore. We need people that are going to work on making our relationships with foreign governments better not worse. We also need people that are going to lead the people and not have to answer to more corruption charges. This is why we need Donald Trump. '"}, "time": 1742562115.3998725}
