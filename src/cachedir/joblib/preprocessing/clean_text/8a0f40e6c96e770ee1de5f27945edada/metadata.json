President Barack Obama and high-ranking officials in his administration also blamed Russia for the breaches. \\nUnder immense pressure from Clinton\u2019s supporters, who were mad at Trump for calling Putin a great leader, the FBI started its investigation into the claims. \\nThe Clinton campaign has called on the FBI to publicly discuss their findings about the case, as they did with their new investigation into Clinton\u2019s new emails. \\nFBI chief James Comey told Congress on Friday that he was reopening investigations into Clinton\u2019s emails after finding a trove of new emails on a laptop belonging to former representative Anthony Weiner, who was once married to Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin. \\nAt some point during its investigation, the FBI questioned Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign boss, who has reportedly had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, the Times noted. \\nThe bureau\u2019s agents also investigated an email channel between Trump and the Alfa Bank, one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks. \\nAfter weeks of detailed investigation, the FBI concluded that the connection was nothing more than marketing emails or spam \\nTrump has rejected Clinton\u2019s allegations against Russia, and has pledged to work with Moscow and earn Putin\u2019s respect.'"}, "time": 1742628572.6893313}
