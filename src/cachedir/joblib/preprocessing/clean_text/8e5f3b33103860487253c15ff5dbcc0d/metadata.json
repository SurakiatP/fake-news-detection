Their family challenged    convention, but also fit right in. Two moms, three children, a grandma and two dogs. A basketball hoop in the driveway. Purple wheelchairs scattered throughout the garage. Sports equipment, and prosthetic legs, stuffed in cramped closets. \u201cIt\u2019s been just such an amazing year,\u201d Debbie McFadden said, standing alongside her daughters on the backyard patio. Dozens of camera phones clicked. The buttercream on the sheet cake told the rest of the story: \u201cTatyana  Hannah Go for the Gold!\u201d was written in red script across the icing, and two tiny wheelchairs raced on a fondant track. The daughters were raised to believe they could do anything, no matter what the physical impairment, and this is what their uncommon determination has wrought: At the Paralympic Games, which begin Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, Tatyana McFadden could become the first athlete to sweep every distance in wheelchair racing. She will compete in the 100 meters and the marathon  \u2014   and everything in between. She could leave Rio with seven gold medals. Her sister Hannah is racing in three of the same events, including the 4x100 relay. If the McFaddens finish    on the podium, they will be the first sisters to do so in a Paralympics. The odds of this? Longer than a marathon, especially given their start. \u201cYou know, when Tatyana and Hannah came here, Tatyana was told by doctors at Johns Hopkins she probably wouldn\u2019t live long, and they said Hannah would never be active,\u201d Debbie McFadden told the gathering at their Rio   party. One of the best athletes most Americans have never heard of, Tatyana McFadden may be hard to miss in the coming months. Her Phelpsian medal quest will be a focal point for NBC\u2019s Paralympics coverage  \u2014   more than 70 hours across NBC\u2019s networks and sports app, compared with six hours of coverage for the London Paralympics four years ago. \u201cIn the U. S. you don\u2019t know about the Paralympics,\u201d said Philip Craven, the president of the International Paralympic Committee. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get to know. Give your people a chance to get to know Tatyana. It will take their minds off the presidential election. \u201d McFadden\u2019s image appears on more than a million Coke cans. Her    life story will be told, and retold, in commercials. In the time leading up to Rio, BP became the first United States Olympic Committee corporate partner to sponsor more Paralympians than Olympians. Now that Michael Phelps has packed up his Speedo and gone home and Simone Biles has clapped her last cloud of chalk into the rafters, will the American public stay for the Paralympics  ? \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of breaking the barriers for Paralympic sport,\u201d Tatyana McFadden said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of hard work and dedication, trying to teach society what it means to be a Paralympian, that we\u2019re not any different, that we\u2019re just like the Olympians, with the same training sites, sponsorships, medals and venues. \u201d If not the same rewards. The United States Olympic Committee awards $25, 000 to every American who wins an Olympic gold versus $5, 000 for every Paralympic gold $15, 000 for Olympic silver versus $3, 500 for Paralympic silver and $10, 000 for Olympic bronze versus $2, 500 for Paralympic bronze. There is also a significant difference between prize purses in major marathons. The New York City Marathon, for example, awards   winners $100, 000 its wheelchair division winners receive $15, 000. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d Tatyana McFadden said. \u201cThat bar needs to be raised. \u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak out, it\u2019s going to stay the same,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the sport for a bit, I can be an educator. I want to give back for the next generations to come, however long I\u2019ll be racing. I think it\u2019s really, really important to have that voice. \u201d Born with spina bifida and adopted from a Russian orphanage, Tatyana McFadden, 27, is paralyzed from the waist down. Hannah McFadden, 20, adopted from Albania, born without a femur in her left leg, is an    amputee. She uses a prosthesis to walk and a wheelchair to race. Ruthi McFadden, 17, also adopted from Albania, is the outlier  \u2014   no wheelchair, no prosthetic leg to pop off at airport security and hand to a T. S. A. agent, as Hannah does for kicks. She has no desire to run the length of a basketball court, let alone a marathon. \u201cI don\u2019t like to sweat,\u201d she tells her sisters. \u201cOur family is a very unique household,\u201d said Hannah McFadden, legs slung over an ottoman in the living room. \u201cIf you took a family photo right now, you got Grandma with an oxygen tank, probably sassing the photographer. \u201d (The oxygen tank comes courtesy of decades of smoking the sassing comes naturally.) She continued: \u201cRuthi talking about all the boyfriends she has. Tatyana wishing she had all the boyfriends. And me saying, \u2018Where\u2019s the food?\u2019 You\u2019d have all those different things going on and oh, yeah, and then parents, Deb and Bridget. We have two moms. \u201cThat was just the way it was. Having two moms wasn\u2019t what really stood out about this family,\u201d she said, in the deadpan of a mockumentary. Earlier this year, after People magazine published a feature article with the headline, \u201cMeet My Two Moms: Wheelchair Racing Sensation Tatyana McFadden Reveals How She Was Saved From a Bleak Russian Orphanage,\u201d the family collectively chuckled. It was not exactly breaking news. Debbie McFadden and Bridget O\u2019Shaughnessey have been partners for 32 years. They kept their relationship and their shared parenting role   because they did not want headlines to read, \u201cRaised by Two Moms, McFadden Wins Gold. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been public about it,\u201d Tatyana McFadden said, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t been always, \u2018Oh, these are my two moms, these are my two moms, these are my two moms.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s something I grew up with, and it\u2019s not any different to me. Our parents have been together, what, more than 30 years? They\u2019re a great example of what love and relationships look like. \u201d They met when Debbie McFadden was still recovering from the effects of   syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease. While she was in graduate school, the condition left her paralyzed from the neck down. As a result, she relied on an electric wheelchair for four years and then crutches for eight. The obstacles Debbie McFadden faced while disabled  \u2014   limited job and educational opportunities, snap judgments based on physical appearance  \u2014   came to define her life\u2019s work, as an advocate and a mother. \u201cThis can never be,\u201d she told herself. She became the United States commissioner of disabilities in 1989, appointed by President George H. W. Bush. \u201cWhy, sir, this job?\u201d she recalled asking the president. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a pain in the ass,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather have you working for me than against me. \u201d (Bush, 92, did not recall the specific interaction, but spoke highly of McFadden, a spokesman, Jim McGrath, said.) McFadden helped write the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the milestone legislation that prohibits discrimination based on disability. \u201cShe makes the impossible happen,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cThat woman does not know the word \u2018no. \u2019\u201d Debbie McFadden now serves as her daughters\u2019 manager, or \u201cmomager,\u201d as they call it. O\u2019Shaughnessey, who works in information technology for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, is the    parent, the one fixing wheelchairs and wearing a headlamp for   wheelchair workouts on the track. She is the steady pace runner, the quiet complement to her    partner. On a stage in Times Square this summer, surrounded by Olympians and Paralympians, Tatyana McFadden described her early years in St. Petersburg, Russia. \u201cFor the first six years in the orphanage, I received no medical treatment, so no wheelchair available,\u201d she said, addressing the crowd at a news media event. \u201cAnd I taught myself how to walk on my arms, using my arms as my legs to get around the orphanage. \u201d The next speaker, Michelle Obama, waited in the wings. \u201cThe sixth year changed my life for the better, when a woman happened to walk through the door, and that\u2019s my mom Deborah McFadden. She\u2019s here today. \u201d She paused for applause and then continued. Tatyana McFadden said sports had changed her life, and had perhaps saved it. Given her weak physical state at the time of her adoption, her parents signed her up for every sport they could find to build her strength. \u201cSee that wooden fence?\u201d Debbie McFadden said as she pulled into the parking lot outside the home of the Bennett Blazers, an adaptive sports program. \u201cThat\u2019s where she was when we first put her in the racing chair and said, \u2018Go. \u2019\u201d Inside the gym, Tatyana\u2019s legacy is everywhere  \u2014   in her trademark candy purple racing chairs, still used by the current Blazers, and the imprint she has made on the children there today. She is their Stephen Curry, their Serena Williams, their autographed poster on a bedroom wall. \u201cTatyana brings pride and recognition,\u201d said David Elbert, whose daughter, Ruby, is part of the Blazers program. \u201cShe makes these kids stand up taller sometimes. Last Paralympics, Tatyana was on the gas pump. You pulled into BP, and Ruby was like, \u2018Whoa. \u2019\u201d In seventh grade, Ruby broke down Tatyana McFadden\u2019s lawsuit against the Howard County school district for a social studies assignment. When McFadden was 15, Ruby\u2019s age now, she was the youngest member of the 2004 United States Paralympics team. After winning her first two Paralympic medals in Athens, she started her freshman year at Atholton High School in Columbia, Md. She had never imagined that earning a varsity letter would be the greater challenge. Competing against   runners, McFadden did not expect her results to count she just wanted to experience competitive sports. Citing safety concerns, school officials prohibited McFadden, a freshman, from racing alongside her high school track team. In 2005, the McFaddens filed suit, claiming no damages, against the Howard County Public School System. Until the case could be heard in federal court, the school allowed Tatyana to race separately, to circle an otherwise empty track after everyone else had run. The highly publicized legal battle took a toll on the teenager. At times, she was booed on the track, ostracized by teammates and ripped on message boards. A teammate, the coach\u2019s daughter, sent a scathing letter to local newspapers. \u201cI will no longer sit back and watch runners be treated unfairly because they are NOT disabled,\u201d the 2007 letter said, according to The Washington Post. \u201cPolitically correct or not, I have been waiting several months to get all this off my chest. \u201d During the years of the lawsuit, McFadden turned to her grandmother Jo for support. \u201cI\u2019d be coming home being emotional and Grandma Jo would help me through it,\u201d Tatyana said. \u201cShe reminds me that it\u2019s about the long run. \u201d \u201cIt was a tough time for her,\u201d Grandma Jo said. \u201cA lot of tears. \u201d Grandma Jo, O\u2019Shaughnessey\u2019s mother, moved in with the family when the children were young. She was the one home when Mom (Debbie McFadden) traveled abroad, running an international adoption agency after her term as commissioner of disabilities. And Grandma Jo was the one home when Mama (Bridget O\u2019Shaughnessey) was still at work in Washington. McFadden eventually won the right to race with her classmates  \u2014   and the suit paved the way for the passage of a state law that guaranteed all students with disabilities the right to participate in sports. Then it became a national mandate. Three years ago, the United States Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights issued a letter of guidance clarifying school districts\u2019 legal obligation to provide equal access to extracurricular activities to all students. The long run  \u2014   the marathon view, if you will  \u2014   made the struggle worth it. It made life easier for those who followed, including Hannah, who did not have to deal with the obstacles or animosity her sister had faced. In Tatyana McFadden\u2019s book for young readers, \u201cYa Sama! Moments From My Life,\u201d published this year, there is a chapter about the case, with the ugly moments softened or omitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it so dark or so tragic,\u201d she said. The Russian phrase \u201cYa sama!\u201d can be translated as \u201cI can do it\u201d or \u201cI can do it myself. \u201d It is a phrase she learned as a young child in her St. Petersburg orphanage and one she uses now when faced with a challenge. \u201cAny race that Tatyana is on the starting line is a race she can win,\u201d said Adam Bleakney, her coach for the Paralympics and at the University of Illinois, where she is a graduate student. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she wins seven golds. One of her strengths is her ability to have a very singular focus, whatever the task at hand. There is never a reservation or doubt when she has a goal in her mind. Most of us will get a sliver of doubt, but I don\u2019t think that ever happens to Tatyana. \u201d After returning with three golds from the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London, Tatyana tried skiing for the first time. She made the 2014 Winter Paralympics team and left Sochi with a silver medal, her 11th over all. In Rio, McFadden is likely to win gold several times over, as she is the   holder in the 100, 400, 800, 1, 500 and 5, 000 meters. The United States relay team  \u2014   nicknamed the McRelay, with a lineup of the McFadden sisters, Amanda McGrory and Chelsea McClammer  \u2014   is a gold medal contender. And Tatyana McFadden is favored to win the marathon, after having swept the Boston, London, Chicago and New York marathons for the last three years. In April, at the London Marathon, McFadden raced wheel to wheel and shoulder to shoulder with her Swiss rival Manuela Sch\u00e4r. McFadden\u2019s arms throbbed as she pushed past Buckingham Palace, unable to shake Sch\u00e4r, who had saved energy for the final push by riding in McFadden\u2019s draft. The duo headed for the finish at the Mall. As Sch\u00e4r tried to outkick her rival, McFadden floored it to the finish, winning by a second. As her parents watched, even they were astounded. Where did that sprint come from? they asked her. \u201cWell, she was going to beat me,\u201d she said,   .'"}, "time": 1742628590.680511}
