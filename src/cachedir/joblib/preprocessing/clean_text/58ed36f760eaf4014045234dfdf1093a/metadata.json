Similar to post-FOMC action thru 2:30, it merely allows stops to be run so that machines can enter pre-planned directional trades for greater profit, in this case a powerful Russell short was the main goal (the index lacks a big oil presence).  So, we\u2019ll agree to disagree on this one, but I always enjoy your comments.'"}, "time": 1742562681.8327057}
