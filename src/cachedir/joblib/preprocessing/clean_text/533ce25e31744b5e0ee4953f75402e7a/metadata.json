As she developed her part, Ms. Wu heard the same dismal fact repeated over and over again: It had been 20 years since a show featuring a predominantly   cast had aired on television. ABC\u2019s previous offering, the 1994 Margaret Cho vehicle \u201c  Girl,\u201d was canceled after one season. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really conscious of it until I booked the role,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cI was focused on the task at hand, which was paying my rent. \u201d The show, which was just renewed for a third season, has granted Ms. Wu a steady job and a new perspective. \u201cIt changed me,\u201d Ms. Wu said. After doing a lot of research, she shifted her focus \u201cfrom   to   interests. \u201d In the past year, Ms. Wu and a number of other   actors have emerged as fierce advocates for their own visibility  \u2014   and frank critics of their industry. The issue has crystallized in a word  \u2014   \u201cwhitewashing\u201d  \u2014   that calls out Hollywood for taking Asian roles and stories and filling them with white actors. On Facebook, Ms. Wu ticked off a list of recent films guilty of the practice and said, \u201cI could go on, and that\u2019s a crying shame, y\u2019all. \u201d On Twitter, she bit back against Hollywood producers who believe their \u201clead must be white\u201d and advised the creators of   content to \u201cCARE MORE. \u201d Another tip: \u201cAn easy way to avoid tokenism? Have more than one\u201d character of color, she tweeted in March. \u201cNot so hard. \u201d [ Read reader responses to this article ] It\u2019s never been easy for an   actor to get work in Hollywood, let alone take a stand against the people who run the place. But the recent expansion of   roles on television has paradoxically ushered in a new generation of actors with just enough star power and job security to speak more freely about Hollywood\u2019s larger failures. And their heightened profile, along with an imaginative,    social media army, has managed to push the issue of   representation  \u2014   long relegated to the back burner  \u2014   into the current heated debate about Hollywood\u2019s monotone vision of the world. \u201cThe harsh reality of being an actor is that it\u2019s hard to make a living, and that puts actors of color in a very difficult position,\u201d said Daniel Dae Kim, who stars in \u201cHawaii  \u201d on CBS and is currently appearing in \u201cThe King and I\u201d on Broadway. Mr. Kim has wielded his Twitter account to point to dire statistics and boost   creators. Last year, he posted a cheeky tribute to \u201cthe only Asian face\u201d he could find in the entire \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series, a woman who \u201cappears for a glorious three seconds. \u201d Other actors lending their voices include Kumail Nanjiani of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d   Wen of \u201cAgents of S. H. I. E. L. D. \u201d and Aziz Ansari, who in his show, \u201cMaster of None,\u201d plays an   actor trying to make his mark. They join longtime actors and activists like BD Wong of \u201cGotham\u201d Margaret Cho, who has taken her tart comedic commentary to Twitter and George Takei, who has leveraged his \u201cStar Trek\u201d fame into a social media juggernaut. \u201cThere\u2019s an   stereotypical notion that   people don\u2019t speak up,\u201d Mr. Wong said. But \u201cwe\u2019re really getting into people\u2019s faces about it. \u201d This past year has proved to be a particularly fraught period for   representation in movies. Last May, Sony released \u201cAloha,\u201d a film set in Hawaii that was packed with white actors, including the     Emma Stone as a     Hawaiian fighter pilot named Allison Ng. In September, it was revealed that in the planned adaptation of the Japanese manga series Death Note, the hero, a boy with dark powers named Light Yagami, would be renamed simply Light and played by the white actor Nat Wolff. In \u201cThe Martian,\u201d released in October, the white actress Mackenzie Davis stepped into the role of the NASA employee Mindy Park, who was conceived in the novel as  . The list goes on. In December, set photographs from the coming \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d film showed the Scottish actress Janette Tough dressed as an    Asian character. Last month, Marvel Studios released a trailer for \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d in which a character that had originated in comic books as a Tibetan monk was reimagined as a Celtic mystic played by Tilda Swinton. And in the   American film adaptation of the manga series Ghost in the Shell, scheduled for next year, the lead character, Major Motoko Kusanagi, will be called Major and played by Scarlett Johansson in a black bob. Studios say that their films are diverse. \u201cLike other Marvel films, several characters in \u2018Doctor Strange\u2019 are significant departures from the source material, not limited by race, gender or ethnicity,\u201d the Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in a statement. Ms. Swinton will play a character that was originally male, and Chiwetel Ejiofor a character that was originally white. Paramount and DreamWorks, the studios behind \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d said that the film reflects \u201ca diverse array of cultures and countries. \u201d But many   actors aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s all so plainly outlandish,\u201d Mr. Takei said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s almost laughable. \u201d The Academy Awards telecast in February added insult to injury. The show dwelled on the diversity complaints aired through #OscarsSoWhite, yet blithely mocked   with punch lines that banked on Asian stereotypes. The host, Chris Rock, brought three   children onstage to serve as a sight gag in a joke made at their expense. \u201cI have never seen the   community get so organized so quickly,\u201d said Janet Yang, a producer who serves as a liaison between Hollywood and Chinese studios. She added, \u201cIt was the final straw. \u201d Within days, Ms. Yang and 24 other Academy members, including the actress Sandra Oh, the director Ang Lee and Mr. Takei, signed a letter to the academy taking it to task for the telecast\u2019s offensive jokes. The academy\u2019s terse reply only stoked the flames. Mr. Takei called it \u201ca bland, corporate response. \u201d Online, even more   actors and activists have spoken out with raw, unapologetic anger. Ms. Wen castigated \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d tweeting about \u201cwhitewashing\u201d and throwing in a dismissive emoji. Mr. Takei went off on \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d on his Facebook page: \u201cHollywood has been casting white actors in Asian roles for decades now, and we can\u2019t keep pretending there isn\u2019t something deeper at work here. \u201d Mr. Nanjiani jumped on Twitter to call out the red carpet photographer who told him, \u201cSmile, you\u2019re in America now. \u201d (\u201cI know when someone is racist, the fault is theirs and not yours,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut, in the moment, it makes you feel flattened, reduced and bullied. \u201d) And Ms. Cho helped start a hashtag campaign, #whitewashedOUT. \u201cIt\u2019s intense,\u201d Ms. Cho posted at the height of the action. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have been invisible for so long we don\u2019t even know what we can do. \u201d Meanwhile, television shows  \u2014   competing for fresh content and audiences as the number of scripted series has increased dramatically in recent years  \u2014   have helped expand the boundaries of what was once thought possible.   increasingly play leads and love interests and star in multiple family sitcoms. Following \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d ABC debuted the sitcom \u201cDr. Ken,\u201d featuring an   family led by the show\u2019s creator, Ken Jeong, plus the drama \u201cQuantico\u201d starring the Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra. On CW\u2019s \u201cCrazy \u201d Rachel Bloom, as the title character, pines after the hunky Vincent Rodriguez III, who is  . They join such   as Mindy Kaling, creator and star of \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d and Lucy Liu, who plays a reimagined Dr. Watson in \u201cElementary. \u201d These shows help, but the issue is pervasive, including on TV. \u201cThe mainstream Hollywood thinking still seems to be that movies and stories about straight white people are universal, and that anyone else is more niche,\u201d Mr. Ansari wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true. I\u2019ve been watching characters with     problems since I was a small Indian boy. \u201d In films, a few roles have transcended stereotypes: Mr. Takei in the first \u201cStar Trek\u201d installments, Ms. Liu in the \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d features, and John Cho and Kal Penn in the stoner hit \u201cHarold  Kumar Go to White Castle\u201d and its sequels. And more are in development: a film adaptation of Kevin Kwan\u2019s novel \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d is underway, and the   actress Kelly Marie Tran will play a major role in the next \u201cStar Wars\u201d installment. But mostly,   are invisible. Though they make up 5. 4 percent of the United States population, more than half of film, television and streaming properties feature zero named or speaking Asian characters, a February report from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California found. Only 1. 4 percent of lead characters in a sample of studio films released in 2014 were Asian. For   actors, the dearth of opportunities compounds itself. \u201cAn Asian person who is competing against white people, for an audience of white people, has to train for that opportunity like it\u2019s the Olympics,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cAn incredibly talented Asian actor might be considered for a leading role maybe once or twice in a lifetime. That\u2019s a highly pressured situation. \u201d So some are stepping behind the camera. In addition to actors creating their own shows, like Ms. Kaling, Mr. Jeong and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Kim of \u201cHawaii  \u201d has started his own production company, 3AD, \u201cto help tell the stories of the underrepresented,\u201d he said.   and other minority actors, he added, are \u201ctired of waiting to be hired for the roles Hollywood creates for us. \u201d Audiences, too, are catching up. \u201cThere was a time when this conversation was completely foreign to people,\u201d Mr. Wong said. Now young participants \u201care already fully versed in the issues and able to discuss them with great passion. \u201d Ellen Oh, a writer for young adults who devised the #whitewashedOUT hashtag, credited a generational shift. \u201cFor a long time, Asians have been defined by the immigrant experience, but now   and     are finding their own voices,\u201d Ms. Oh said. They\u2019re also employing a new vocabulary. \u201cThe term \u2018whitewashing\u2019 is new, and it\u2019s extremely useful,\u201d Mr. Wong said. In contrast to \u201cyellowface,\u201d which protested the practice of white actors using makeup and prosthetics to play Asians, \u201cwhitewashing\u201d gives voice to the   of prominent roles. And the Internet has allowed people to imagine a parallel universe where   dominate the screen. Earlier this month, disappointed fans of the \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d franchise took a publicity still of Ms. Johansson in the lead role and Photoshopped in the face of Rinko Kikuchi, the Japanese star of \u201cPacific Rim. \u201d Recently the hashtag #StarringJohnCho went viral, reimagining the   star as the lead of   and action flicks. Though Mr. Cho has followed up the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d films with a role in the \u201cStar Trek\u201d franchise, he hasn\u2019t been afforded the luminous leads offered to white actors with similar starts, like Seth Rogen after \u201cKnocked Up\u201d or Chris Pratt  \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy. \u201d \u201cAs I was Photoshopping John Cho\u2019s face on top of Tom Cruise\u2019s in the \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 poster, my friends and I started chuckling a little bit, like, \u2018How crazy would that be? \u2019\u201d said William Yu, the    who created the hashtag. \u201cThen I caught myself. Why should it be crazy?\u201d The campaign was followed by #StarringConstanceWu, which Photoshopped the actress into posters for films starring Emily Blunt, Drew Barrymore and, ahem, Emma Stone. The activist outpouring is \u201ca tidal wave,\u201d said Keith Chow, the founder of The Nerds of Color, a website of geek culture criticism that has served as home base for several online campaigns. It has swept up some members of white Hollywood in its wake. Ms. Stone has acknowledged that her \u201cAloha\u201d role made her the \u201cbutt of many jokes. \u201d And this month, the director of \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d Scott Derrickson, tweeted, \u201cRaw   from   over Hollywood whitewashing, stereotyping  erasure of Asians in cinema. I am listening and learning. \u201d Whether that translates into change onscreen is an open question. \u201cEveryone seems to be becoming slowly aware of how overwhelmingly white everything is,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the whole system is slowly being shamed into diversity, but it\u2019s moving at a snail\u2019s pace. \u201d He added: \u201cJust look at the movie posters you see. It\u2019s all white people. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561738.8084705}
