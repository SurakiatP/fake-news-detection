{"duration": 0.03033137321472168, "input_args": {"text": "'Starting Saturday, about two million Muslims will participate in the hajj, an annual pilgrimage to holy sites in Saudi Arabia. I\u2019ll be participating for the first time, and to prepare, I assembled an eclectic reading list including Islamic history, firsthand accounts of the hajj and spiritual meditations. I am rereading \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X,\u201d which culminates with one of the most meaningful passages I have ever encountered on the pilgrimage. Also, I revisited \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d by Ernest Hemingway, for his sharp prose and as a reminder that a journey can always be an adventure. I bought \u201cGetting the Best Out of  \u201d by Abu Muneer Ismail Davids, a droll manual that includes invaluable advice, including where to camp at the plains of Mina, why you should bring an inflatable mattress, and what direction to walk to avoid being crushed by the crowds of pilgrims. I have already flagged many pages with   note reminders. Also on the list: \u2022 \u201cHajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam,\u201d edited by Venetia Porter, to help me understand the spiritual importance of the hajj. \u2022 \u201cThe Siege of Mecca: The 1979 Uprising at Islam\u2019s Holiest Shrine,\u201d by Yaroslav Trofimov, about the great rupture almost 40 years ago between Saudi Arabia and Iran that played out at the hajj. \u2022 Finally, \u201cSea Without Shore: A Manual of the Sufi Path\u201d by Nuh Ha Mim Keller, to immerse myself in some spirituality before I head to Mecca.'"}, "time": 1742564153.17479}
