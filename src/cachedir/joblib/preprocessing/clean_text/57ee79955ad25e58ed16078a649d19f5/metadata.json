The image is placed under a headline reading: \u201cCouncils resist pressure to take children from Calais.\u201d \\n\\nThis crying \u201cchild\u201d is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow \u201cchildren\u201d like him into their nation. \\nThe image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically. It comes from the Associated Press\u2019 Emilio Morenatti , you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website . \\nThe \u201cchild migrant\u201d is clearly in his 40\u2019s, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they\u2019ll actually believe they\u2019re looking at a 16-year-old boy. \\nA look at Emilio\u2019s twitter shows one person appears to have actually bought the lie: @morenatti2004 Imposible no hacernos mirar y luego, un nudo en la garganta. pic.twitter.com/A7zvz5440q \\n\u2014 Luj\u00e1n Artola Paulos (@rowley_bel) October 25, 2016 \\n\u201cImpossible not make us look, then, a lump in the throat,\u201d the tweet reads. \\nIncidentally, Ethiopia is not even a war zone, so I\u2019m not sure how this 45-year-old man can even be considered a \u201crefugee.\u201d  42  '"}, "time": 1742561997.9381783}
