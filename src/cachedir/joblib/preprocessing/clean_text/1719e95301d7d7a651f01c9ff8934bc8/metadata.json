[Now McIlroy is saying that the juice may not have been worth the squeeze. \u201cWould I do it again?\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cAfter the sort of backlash I received, I\u2019d think twice about it. \u201d  Fans tweeted the    Irish golfer, ranked #2 in the world, and accused him of \u201cnormalizing this lying, racist scumbag. \u201d Lefties from across the globe expressed that they lost all respect for McIlroy.  USA Today writer Christine Brennan can\u2019t understand why Rory, who says \u201che won\u2019t be having many cups of tea\u201d with the members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers because they took so long to admit women members to Muirfield golf club, agreed to play with someone as horrible as Trump in the first place.   Brennan wrote, \u201cBut wasn\u2019t it natural to wonder why he said he wouldn\u2019t be having tea with the sexist members of that stodgy club, yet still felt comfortable playing a round of golf with a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women, mocked a disabled person and carried on a   battle with a Gold Star family, among other things?\u201d  McIlroy said about his golf outing with Trump, \u201cthere was not one bit of politics discussed in that round of golf. He was more interested talking about the grass that he just put on the greens. \u201cBut, yeah, look, it\u2019s a difficult one. I felt I would have been making more of a statement if I had turned it down. It\u2019s not a tough place to be put in, but it was a round of golf and nothing more. \u201d McIlroy has already expressed on his twitter feed that, \u201dThis wasn\u2019t an endorsement nor a political statement of any kind, It was, quite simply, a round of golf. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562174.6960351}
