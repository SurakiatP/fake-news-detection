It doesn\u2019t . It should. And if it did, we Americans wouldn\u2019t have to deal with all the Central Americans coming to our own border. It would be better for both our nations . \\nSome outlets are reporting Mexico is going to build a wall against migrants. [ Mexico builds its own wall against migrants , by James Fredrick and Jude Webber, Financial Times, September 14, 2016]. (The article is paywalled, but you can access it here ). \\nBut the title is misleading. It\u2019s not a literal wall, but a metaphorical \u201cwall,\u201d and not even an effective one. \\nThe piece takes the view of a Central American planning to come to the United States and claims \u201cMexico already acts as a formidable barrier.\u201d It also quotes a nun who runs a shelter for illegals in Mexico City . She moans: \u201cMexico has become a wall for migrants. The current [Mexican] policy is to arrest migrants to stop them from getting to the US border.\u201d \\nThus, the term \u201cwall\u201d is a metaphor for \u201csome Central Americans get caught in Mexico and deported back to Central America.\u201d Not very impressive. \\nThe Mexican policy for dealing with its own illegals is a hodgepodge. Though Mexico doesn\u2019t have walls on its borders with Guatemala and Belize, Mexican authorities do detain and deport illegal aliens . And the American government has reportedly put pressure on Mexico to do more. Nonetheless, plenty are still getting through. According to the article, Mexico deported a record 175,000 Central Americans last year, but the United Nations estimates 400,000 enter Mexico annually. \\nThere is a pre-election \u201csurge\u201d of illegals on the U.S.-Mexican border, as migrants want to get in now regardless of who wins. If Hillary wins, they expect amnesty. If Trump wins, they expect The Wall .

Illegals coming across the southern border are coming from Mexico. As Mexico can\u2019t or won\u2019t stop them, we need a barrier on our border with Mexico. \\nWhich brings us to another question. If Trump wins the election and builds The Wall, the Mexican government may be stuck with Central Americans who can\u2019t continue north to the U.S. And they really don\u2019t want that. \\nIn 2012, after the election of current Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto but before his inauguration, his coordinator Arnulfo Valdivia discussed the new administration\u2019s goal in this area. The new Mexican president wanted \u201cto create the necessary filters so that those who cross by the southern border [of Mexico] do not stay stranded in their attempt to cross to the United States. \u201cValdivia also said a goal was to \u201cdiminish the number of indocumentados [illegal aliens] who are concentrated on the northern border [of Mexico] without possibilities of crossing it, forming belts of poverty [in Mexico].\u201d[ Pe\u00f1a quiere `patrulla fronteriza` mexicana , by Miriam Castillo, Milenio , October 9th, 2012] \\nIn other words, if they cross Mexico and get to the United States, we don\u2019t care, as long as they don\u2019t stay in Mexico. And Mexico admits these illegals bring poverty. Indeed, Mexican authorities are quite cynical about this. A new report indicates the Mexican government is granting Haitians 20-day transit documents to reach the U.S. border, resulting in a 1,800% in illegal Haitians c rossing the border in 2016. As Duncan Hunter\u2019s chief of staff Joe Kasper said, \u201cMexico doesn\u2019t want them, but it\u2019s entirely content with putting migrants\u2014in this case Haitians\u2014right on America\u2019s doorstep.\u201d [ DHS Documents Reveal How Mexico Is Helping Haitians Reach the U.S. Illegally , Numbers USA, October 11, 2016]. Remember this the next time somebody claims Mexico is our partner in securing the border. \\nBut a President Trump who, like the Israelis, shuts down illegal immigration would force Mexico to build a border barrier if they don\u2019t want to be flooded by Central Americans. This is no easy task, given the geographical situation. Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala alone is 541 miles long\u2014about a quarter the length of the U.S.-Mexican border. It\u2019s sparsely populated and crosses forested regions, rivers, lakes, farmland, pasture, valleys and mountains, some of which are in the 13,000 feet above sea level range. \\nBut where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way. Some form of effective fencing could be done depending on the particular ecosystem, by utilizing natural barriers (such as mountains, rivers and valleys) as part of an overall border security plan. \\nAnd it\u2019s already being suggested in the Mexican press. A bold editorial in Ma\u00f1ana , a newspaper from the Mexican border city of Reynosa, openly calls for a border wall with Central America S\u00ed al muro fronterizo\u2026Pero en el sur de M\u00e9xico [\u201cYes to the Border Wall\u2026But in the South of Mexico,\u201d July 24, 2016]. It argues Mexico\u2019s borders with Guatemala and Belize \u201conly give us problems because these crossings are utilized for a new invasion, that of Central Americans who utilize our country to cross to the United States\u201d. That\u2019s very provocative language, using the term invasion ( invasi\u00f3n in Spanish). \\nThe editorial also claims Central Americans are deported from the U.S. back to Mexico, even if they\u2019re Central Americans and not Mexicans. The greatest number are supposedly deported to Reynosa, where they wait to try to enter America again. But while they wait, \u201cMany of these migrants, not finding an honest way of earning a living, dedicate themselves to crime, resorting to assault, kidnapping and extortion, and in the worst of cases joining organized crime gangs.\u201d \\nThis Mexican editorial says deported Central American illegals commit crimes in Mexico! What intolerance! It might as well have been written by Trump! \\nIndeed, the editorial blames Central American illegals for much of the lawlessness of the border region: \u201cPeace and tranquility have ended on the Mexican border and much of that has been due to the Central Americans who are deported from the U.S., backed up with false documents, who stay in Mexican territory.\u201d \\nThe editorial proposes a solution. \u201cTrump\u2019s idea [of a wall] is good [!], but more necessary than constructing a wall on the northern border of Mexico is to make one on the south/southeast border to stop the passage of Central Americans to both countries.\u201d Furthermore, the Mexican government should also demand \u201cmigratory documents for the foreigners who enter our country.\u201d \\nThough this editorial advocates a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border, not the American southern border, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t do both. And it\u2019s unlikely the first will happen unless preceded by the second. \\nThe editors of this paper have guts and are true Mexican patriots. But in order to help Mexican patriots, we need an American patriot in charge of our own country. \\nAmerican citizen Allan Wall ( him) moved back to the U.S.A. in 2008 after many years residing in Mexico.
