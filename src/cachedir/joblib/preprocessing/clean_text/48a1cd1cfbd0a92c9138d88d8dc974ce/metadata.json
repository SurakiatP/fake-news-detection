Coincidentally, the Trump campaign has just set up it\u2019s online Facebook live feed, where his aides have been broadcasting Trump events and counter news programming. \\nVanity Fair was the first to report in June that Trump was thinking about starting his own media network. \\nIn September, the Financial Times reported that Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner started making inquiries into launching a new media company after the election to capitalize on his father-in-law\u2019s political movement. \\nHowever, Trump has openly dismissed the idea, and told the Washington Post last month: \\n\u201cI want to win the presidency, and I want to make America great again. It\u2019s very simple. I have no interest in a media company.\u201d \\nWouldn\u2019t it be funny if one of his kids just so happened to start a media company after the election? \\nOr perhaps Donald Trump just does it under his name, after all, it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s ever had a problem with lying, especially when it comes to business. \\nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562687.121757}
