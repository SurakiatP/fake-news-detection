Nunes said, \u201cSo first I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U. S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U. S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked.
