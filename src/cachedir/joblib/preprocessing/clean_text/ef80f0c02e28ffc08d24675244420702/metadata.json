There was a period of time today when I felt I was walking around in another dimension\u2026 definitely not here , fully, at least, and more like in a \u201cdream\u201d or \u201ctransparent\u201d type of shape. It actually felt very pleasant, and very much more \u201cat home\u201d than living upon/in this 3D-4D-whatever type physical \u201cworld\u201d thing. \\nI have \u201cstuff\u201d to do, as I walk and move and BE upon this planet\u2026 even though I know I AM a BE ing of Light, yet I am here in the physical body, and I (apparently) have accepted that and know I have \u201cphysical type\u201d areas in which to \u201cwork\u201d (lots of quote marks in there). \\nThis blog will very likely always be a secondary part of my expression here, however, as my DOing and BEing primarily centers on the \u201cEnergy work\u201d I feel is mine to do. It is particularly significant that I am in Hawai\u2019i, formerly known as Lemuria, and performing most of the \u201cEnergy missions\u201d over here. Somehow the islands feel like fingers of my own hand\u2026 and that has been true ever since I first arrived. \\nI\u2019m not trying to \u201cteach\u201d anything here. Just share the \u201csense\u201d I have about all this stuff\u2026 from my viewpoint\u2026 no one else\u2019s. \\nSo why am I writing this particular post? Well, as always, I felt an urgent movement to do so. And I presume I\u2019ll be following or listening to that \u201cmovement\u201d for my entire experience here on this planet. \\nThat is all for now. \\nAloha, Kp'"}, "time": 1742562147.9103107}
