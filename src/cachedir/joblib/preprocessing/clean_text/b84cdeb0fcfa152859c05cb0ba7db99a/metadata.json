City Ballet was presented by Les Et\u00e9s de la Danse, an annual summer festival that brings dance companies  \u2014   often American ones  \u2014   to the French capital. \u201cI spent a lot of time here with Balanchine, listening to him talk about his experiences in Paris,\u201d said Peter Martins, the company\u2019s ballet master in chief, referring to George Balanchine, the   of City Ballet, whose groundbreaking choreography forms the backbone of the company\u2019s repertory. \u201cBalanchine didn\u2019t get good reviews here they liked Jerry Robbins, and Balanchine knew that,\u201d Mr. Martins added. \u201cSo our first week was all Balanchine because I wanted to say, this choreographer is not only arguably the greatest choreographer in history, but our choreographer. \u201d The logistics are impressive: 150 people came from New York, including 94 dancers an additional 60 board members and patrons came for the opening and a gala dinner. Four sea freight containers were sent, containing costumes, scenery, props, lighting booms, physical therapy equipment, orchestra music and stage management supplies. (These include floor tape, tissues, ammonia, mops, Sharpies, bandages and Altoids.) Houses have been full, critics have been fulsome, and audiences rapturously appreciative. Meanwhile, the dancers have been enjoying Parisian life, sightseeing on their days off, hanging out in cafes and occasionally proposing marriage. Here are some snapshots of City Ballet in Paris, and edited excerpts from conversations with the dancers. Justin Peck, a soloist with City Ballet as well as its resident choreographer, came to Paris a month earlier than his colleagues to work with the Paris Opera Ballet. His \u201cEntre Chien et Loup\u201d for Paris Opera has been running at the same time as the City Ballet season. \u201cIt\u2019s my first experience working in Europe, and it has been so nice to be living here and not feel so much like a tourist,\u201d Mr. Peck said over a coffee on Monday. \u201cI stayed in the Marais, which was great because I could walk to work every day. Sometimes I did class with the Paris Opera Ballet, other times I\u2019d warm up by myself and listen to my music to get into the right head space. \u201cBasically in any off time, I\u2019ve tried to eat my way through Paris. I\u2019d go with [the choreographer] Bill Forsythe, who was also working at the Opera, to this great French place near the Palais Garnier, and I have a favorite   new wave place. \u201d He added: \u201cThe Picasso and Rodin museums are my favorites, but it\u2019s crazy, because I\u2019ve been here for so long, and I keep thinking I\u2019m going to get to things. Now it\u2019s the last week, and there is so much I still haven\u2019t done. \u201d Dancing at Ch\u00e2telet was a homecoming for Robert Fairchild, a City Ballet principal who starred in Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s production of \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d which appeared at the Ch\u00e2telet in 2014 before opening on Broadway in April 2015. \u201cThe first day, after class, we ran over to the stage, and I got the chills seeing that house again,\u201d said Mr. Fairchild, who left the show in March. \u201cBut I\u2019ve tried not to compare the experiences. One was making a Broadway show here we were in the theater all day long, and you only went out to get a sandwich. This time has been more about living here and doing things in Paris. It\u2019s nice to be here with Tiler [Peck, Mr. Fairchild\u2019s wife, also a City Ballet principal]. We also went back to a lovely restaurant at the top of the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, because after I proposed we had gone there for dinner, but we were so tired that we were falling asleep at the table. It was good to go back there and be awake this time!\u201d \u201cI feel almost Parisian by now!\u201d Ms Hyltin said after company class on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m on the Metro, I know where I\u2019m going, I\u2019m practically a local. I go for lunch every day to one place, because I love their  . This one is so big that I keep a third of it to eat just before the show. \u201d Ms. Hyltin said that the rehearsal schedule was as intensive as it is in New York, partly because the company is preparing for its annual summer season in Saratoga Springs, immediately after the Paris tour. She has performed almost every night, but has made the most of company days off. \u201cI\u2019ve been up the Eiffel Tower to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay the Rodin museum a great architectural museum, Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019Architecture et du Patrimoine and to   twice,\u201d she said, adding that she loved the Rodin especially, \u201clooking at the musculature and elegance of those sculptures. It really hit me how rich the culture is here everywhere you look there is history. \u201d Mr. Martins doesn\u2019t teach company class every day, but when he does, there is always a   turnout of dancers, and on Tuesday morning, almost 90 bodies were crammed into the studio space at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville, where the dancers do their daily class and rehearse. (It\u2019s across the plaza from Ch\u00e2telet.) Mr. Martins gives   instructions, indicating steps by motioning silently with his hands the dancers seem to pick it up by osmosis or telepathy. Unusual rhythmic accents and quick differences in dynamics (from fast to slow, sharp to soft) give some clues about why the City Ballet style is so specific to this company. The dancers worked with concentration, finishing with a partnering sequence. \u201cI notice how hard you work,\u201d Mr. Martins told a corps de ballet dancer after the class. \u201cI always notice. \u201d Silas Farley, a corps de ballet dancer, proposed to Cassia Wilson, a dancer with Ballet Austin, on Sunday. (She accepted.) On Monday, Mr. Farley recounted the story. \u201cCassia\u2019s favorite movie is \u2018Funny Face,\u2019 and her sister suggested that I propose at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Reine Blanche, which is in it. I didn\u2019t tell her where we were going, and we took the train out there. It was picture perfect, sunny, blue sky, blue lake, swans. We had lunch there, and at one point I told our waiter, I\u2019m going to propose, please take my phone and video it. Then I got down on one knee in front of the chateau and asked Cassia to marry me. The waiter got it perfectly he turned out to be a wedding photographer in his spare time!\u201d Indiana Woodward, a corps dancer, is half French and came to Paris to stay with her father during every school break while growing up. She said she had always dreamed of performing with City Ballet for her French family. \u201cMy face hurt from smiling after the first show I danced here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying at home, in my room!\u201d Ms. Woodward said she had taken her City Ballet friends to all her top Paris spots  \u2014   the Jardin du Luxembourg, a small park at the top of Montmartre, the banks of Seine  \u2014   and handed out \u201ca giant list of vintage shops. \u201d Paris, she added, feels more relaxed than New York. \u201cPeople sit around having a coffee. You take that for granted when you are here. \u201d Craig Hall, a soloist, is retiring this season and performing some of his last shows in Paris, although he will remain with the company as a ballet master. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great way to end off,\u201d he said, as he, Lauren Lovette and Brittany Pollack set off for the \u00cele   in search of the famed Berthillon ice cream. Ms. Lovette, a principal, said that she had visited the Normandy war memorial on an off day, and had been very moved at the sight of thousands of graves. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our history too,\u201d she added. She had a more upbeat excursion to the Champagne region to visit Ruinart, which supplies the bubbly stuff to City Ballet. \u201cThey gave us an amazing vintage Champagne to try, then more over lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably not so wise of us, but we figured, we\u2019re in France!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563144.8068895}
