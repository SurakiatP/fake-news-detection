Mr. Obama\u2019s plea for a reasoned debate came on the last day of a trip to Spain and Poland. His visit was overshadowed, and abbreviated, by the wave of grief and anger convulsing the United States after the police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, and the killing of five police officers by a black gunman in Dallas. On Sunday, hours before he was to fly home a day earlier than planned, Mr. Obama found himself once again addressing this national tragedy, this time while sitting next to a European leader who was eager to talk about Spain\u2019s close ties to the United States. One of the United States\u2019 great virtues, Mr. Obama said, is its openness to protest and efforts to speak truth to power. While that process is often messy, he warned that harsh language would drive people on opposing sides to their corners, hardening positions and stalling a difficult but necessary debate over racial bias in the criminal justice system. Mr. Obama said the Black Lives Matter movement had grown out of a tradition that dated to the abolitionist movement, the women\u2019s suffrage campaign and the protests against the war in Vietnam. In protest movements, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid or imprudent or   or are harsh. \u201d While Mr. Obama said it was unfair to characterize an entire movement by a few dissonant voices, he said inflammatory words could hinder legitimate efforts to reform the justice system. \u201cEven rhetorically,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cif we paint police officers with a broad brush  \u2014   without recognizing that the vast majority of police officers are doing a really good job and are trying to protect people, and do so fairly and without racial bias  \u2014   if the rhetoric does not recognize that, then we\u2019re going to lose allies in the reform process. \u201d Likewise, he urged police organizations to treat protesters respectfully and to treat their grievances seriously. He repeated an observation he made after arriving in Poland on Friday: that reliable statistics prove there is bias in the criminal justice system. A respectful debate, Mr. Obama said, is \u201cwhat\u2019s going to ultimately help make the job of being a cop a lot safer. \u201d Mr. Obama also pledged again to bring together political leaders, civil rights advocates and law enforcement officials to try to devise solutions to this problem. He plans to travel on Tuesday to Dallas, where he will take part in an interfaith memorial service. \u201cI\u2019d like all sides to listen to each other,\u201d he said. Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, echoed that message on Sunday as he appeared in a series of joint television interviews alongside New York City Police Commissioner William J. Bratton. Addressing the anxieties of Americans shaken by the shootings last week, Mr. Johnson said that it was \u201ca time for healing,\u201d but also a time to redouble efforts to build bridges between law enforcement and the communities they serve. \u201cIt\u2019s a time to come together, to heal, to mourn, but to remember that the shooter is not reflective of the larger movement to bring about change that was out in Dallas to peaceably demonstrate,\u201d Mr. Johnson said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d \u201cAnd those who engage in excessive force in the law enforcement community are not reflective of the larger law enforcement community. \u201d Mr. Johnson strongly rejected the suggestion made by some critics that Mr. Obama and his administration had helped incite violence against the police by supporting Black Lives Matter activists. He reiterated in personal terms the legitimacy of the activists\u2019 concerns while pledging continued federal support for local law enforcement. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve obviously got some experience with this as a parent and as somebody who\u2019s been around,\u201d Mr. Johnson said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m 59 years old now,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve had my share of unpleasant encounters with law enforcement when I was much younger. \u201d Pressed for more details of those experiences, Mr. Johnson largely demurred, saying, \u201cWell, you know, the type of road encounters that others have talked about. \u201d \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthey do not reflect the actions of law enforcement in general. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563517.318344}
