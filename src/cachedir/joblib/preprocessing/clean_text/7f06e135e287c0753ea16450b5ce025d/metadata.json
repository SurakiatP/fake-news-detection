Somehow, two of the most reviled people in the United States have become the frontrunners for the most powerful job in the country \u2014 and the world.\\nOn one hand, there is Donald Trump , the compulsively lying demagogic womanizing egomaniacal billionaire. On the other hand, there is Hillary Clinton, the infinitely corrupt influence peddling war-starter who allegedly cheated her way to the top of the Democratic Party while leaving a number of victims in her wake.\\nA significant portion of young people would actually prefer that a giant, apocalyptic meteor hit the earth rather than see Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump elected president.\\nIt\u2019s not all bad, though \u2014 at least when it comes to the creative art that has been inspired by this nightmare of an election. One such example is \u201cDillary Trumplon,\u201d a recently released rap song written and performed by Blaise Guerra that\u2019s starting to go viral on social media. From Trump\u2019s demagoguery to Hillary\u2019s war mongering, Guerra leaves no stone unturned.\\nListen to the song for yourself, then check out our interview with Blaise below (his responses have been slightly edited and condensed for clarity).\\nAM: What inspired you to make this song? Blaise: I was inspired to make the song because I felt very disenfranchised by the way Bernie Sanders sparked such an incredible movement but was completely ignored by the media and given no shot. Yet according to Election Justice USA , without the primaries being fixed, Sanders could have won by a landslide. I felt so cheated when he lost. I knew the Democratic establishment had completely undermined the meaning of democracy and stolen the nomination from him.'"}, "time": 1742562590.3210034}
