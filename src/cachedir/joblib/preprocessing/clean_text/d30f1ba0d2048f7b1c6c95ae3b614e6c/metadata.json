Between Putin and Trump, Soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter. \\nWe will see if MoveOn.org\u2019s call to protest has legs, or if it will gradually fizzle and fade, in much the same way we can only hope Soros will eventually do. \\nNBC\u2019s Katy Tur said\u2026 \\n\u201cIt\u2019s surreal in NYC. People are walking around like zombies with thousand yard stares.\u201d \\nZerohedge reports \u2026 \\nSeemingly unwilling to accept the results of the democratic selection of the nation\u2019s leader for the next four years, hundreds of grieving Hillary Clinton supporters \u2013 egged on by George Soros\u2019 MoveOn.org \u2013 are laying siege to Trump Tower in New York City. Screaming \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d, yelling \u201cNot My President\u201d, chanting \u201cPussy Grabs Back\u201d, and burning the American flag, it appears these young millennials are just the kind of deplorables this country should be proud of\u2026 \\nMoveOn.org released this press release on Wednesday, calling on people to take to the streets: \\nAmericans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results \\nHundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. \\nTonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. \\nThe gatherings \u2013 organized by MoveOn.org and allies \u2013 will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump\u2019s bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. \\nWithin two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon. \\nWHAT: Hundreds of peaceful gatherings of solidarity, resistance, and resolve nationwide \\nWHEN / WHERE: Find local gatherings here .

We fought our hearts out to avert this reality. But now it\u2019s here,\u201d MoveOn.org staff wrote to members on Wednesday. \u201cThe new president-elect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted, demeaned, and threatened millions of us\u2014and millions of our friends, family, and loved ones. Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country. In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friends\u2014especially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others. And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563262.9764163}
