The evidence, at two opposing corners of his office in Beverly Hills skeletal remnants that long gave up hope of ever being watered. He\u2019s been away for 10 months, he says. An explanation, if not exactly an excuse. Regardless, I vow to expose his   ways because the American public deserves to know, and besides, at 52 one should take whatever notoriety one can get. I\u2019m at Plan B, the film production company Pitt   in 2001 and now owns, and I\u2019ve decided to impress him with my knowledge of architecture, something he learned about while helping to rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I figured I\u2019d introduce him to Shigeru Ban, famous for his Cardboard Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand, and other   projects around the world. But there, sitting on Pitt\u2019s bookshelf, is an entire monograph of his work. Near his record player are Joe Strummer\u2019s albums with the Mescaleros, not a surprise, but also rare books on fringe culture, including Danny Lyon\u2019s \u201cThe Bikeriders,\u201d which are. This is a revelation not because Pitt is a megastar, which can lead to a certain    but because he\u2019s a father, and the first thing that goes after having kids is coolness. The first thing that comes are jorts. So when he gets up to shake my hand  \u2014   dressed in a white   white jeans and a white fedora  \u2014   he seems more like the Dude than a dad. \u201cWar Machine,\u201d one of his two new films out this fall, is based on \u201cThe Operators,\u201d Michael Hastings\u2019s blistering account of U. S. military command, their occasionally reckless maneuvers and the political blowback that happened when a certain decorated general  \u2014   played by Pitt  \u2014   let his guard way, way down. (The other movie is Robert Zemeckis\u2019s romantic assassination thriller \u201cAllied,\u201d also based on actual events.) \u201cIt\u2019s a satire on the decision makers who end up sending our young men and women to war,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the absurdity of the process, the machinery itself, the   involved  \u2014   and it\u2019s insanely funny, until it\u2019s not. \u201d Discussing the thin line between tragedy and comedy leads us to talking about sadness and happiness in general, which then leads Pitt to an observation: During his frequent travels around the world he has encountered many people who seem to have no cause for happiness  \u2014   and yet it\u2019s those very people, those in the most dire circumstances, who somehow manage to appear the most content. It is why, he says, people like him  \u2014   people with money and time  \u2014   feel so compelled to change those circumstances. Which isn\u2019t always a good thing, and he knows it. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into areas of   countries where people have suffered the most, but those people always seem to have the biggest laugh,\u201d he says. As a Jamaican native who has witnessed quite a few   missions, I tell him that sometimes our biggest laugh is directed at foreign   who really have no idea how to fix our problems. \u201cI\u2019ve been one of those at times,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to start somewhere. You start with your best intentions, understanding the world as you do. And then you get in and you see that it\u2019s much more complicated than you could possibly imagine. Our failings in foreign policy have always been to think that we can place our ideas on another culture, while not really understanding the other culture. \u201d But one of the reasons I agreed to this interview was to do more than remind the world that, aw shucks, he\u2019s just a regular guy. Such a thing would be ridiculous, anyway: A Google search of his name yields roughly 45 million results nearly 10 million pop up for \u201cBrad Pit\u201d alone. This is, after all, the guy who as a seductive thief in \u201cThelma  Louise\u201d proved there\u2019s no such thing as a small part. Someone once famously said that he is a character actor trapped in a leading man\u2019s body, which is true, but he\u2019s also the last real movie star to come out of Hollywood. I don\u2019t ask him if he likes to puzzle over his kids\u2019 homework. Instead I ask him about Brexit. \u201cMan, I never thought that would happen. Same way I can\u2019t bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge. In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad. We have this great line in \u2018The Big Short,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he says, referring to the   film about the global financial crisis of 2008, which he produced. \u201cWhen things are going wrong and we can\u2019t find the reason for it, we just start creating enemies. \u201d I mention that when creating those enemies, we often look no further than what\u2019s right in front of us. Gays, for example. \u201cOr illegal immigrants,\u201d he says. He keeps wondering aloud about this, not because he\u2019s all that interested in extremism, bigotry, religiosity and fear as part of an actual pathology  \u2014   or Trump supporters and the religious right, for that matter  \u2014   but because in another version of this story, where the movie star thing hadn\u2019t clicked and he remained stuck in his home state, that could have been his fate. \u201cComing from Oklahoma, southern Missouri, which leans more toward a Trump voice, I try to understand it. \u201d \u201cIt seems that the people who suffer the most end up betting for the party that would hurt them,\u201d he goes on. \u201cAnd so I try to understand where they\u2019re coming from. \u201d When I suggest that money has a lot to do with it  \u2014   Belgium supporting Tutsi control over the Hutus, and building resentment, prompted genocide  \u2014   he agrees. But a recent conversation he had with a scholar from the Brookings Institution, the Washington, D. C. think tank, sparked a different view, one where the cause of strife can\u2019t be explained by simple economics. \u201cYou gotta understand,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it\u2019s also in our DNA. Most Americans don\u2019t have time to watch CNN and Fox and Al Jazeera. They\u2019re trying to make the rent, get the kids fed, they\u2019re tired when they get home and they want to forget about everything. And so suddenly when this voice comes in  \u2014   and it doesn\u2019t have to be a voice of substance  \u2014   saying he\u2019s fed up with all of this, that\u2019s the part that hooks into the DNA. \u201d A fair point to consider, that our social behaviors, prejudices and even the mental process of who we choose to love or hate is rooted in biology, but how does this convince people to actually buy what Trump is selling? \u201cWhat I\u2019m most hopeful about is that we\u2019re a global neighborhood now, and we start to understand each other more and more  \u2014   and yet, you see this reactionary push for isolation and separation again. \u201d Pitt shrugs, and says that he thinks a lot of people feel alone, and on a certain level, again because of his background, he knows what that\u2019s like. \u201cA Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does he even mean, take our country back? Would someone please explain that to me?\u201d Pitt looks at me, impish and totally serious at the same time. \u201cWhere\u2019d it go?\u201d Like his friend and \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d director Quentin Tarantino, Pitt\u2019s scholarship in the craft of the medium has mostly been the medium itself. More than that, film was for him a window into the world. \u201cMovies were a way out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you live in a vacuum and suddenly you\u2019re exposed to the world, you\u2019re exposed to other cultures. And remember, this was  . This was the only lens that could show me how a kid in Brooklyn lived, a kid in Ireland, a kid in Africa. \u201d On the topic of exotic worlds, he mentions a film he\u2019d like to make about Pontius Pilate, mostly because the script, which focuses on a mediocre Roman official stuck in the middle of nowhere with difficult people he doesn\u2019t like, makes him smile. Jesus doesn\u2019t get much screen time. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be for the \u2018Passion\u2019 crowd,\u201d he says, which reminds me that Mel Gibson\u2019s   epic is one of the things that drove me out of the church. Pitt bursts into laughter. \u201cI felt like I was just watching an L. Ron Hubbard propaganda film. \u201d Xenu aside, Gibson movies typically do one thing really well: violence. \u201cOh, extremely well,\u201d Pitt says. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Apocalypto\u2019 is a great film. \u201d It\u2019s easy to forget that the man is 52  \u2014   if anything he\u2019s too skinny  \u2014   but his children\u2019s interest in relics from the past regularly drives home the point. One of his daughters, for example, loves cassette tapes the way someone Pitt\u2019s age might have a fondness for the gramophone, or making his own daguerreotype. He\u2019s also reminded of his age on set. \u201cWhen I was making a World War II movie called \u2018Fury,\u2019 we did this boot camp for a week, and Logan Lerman, who was the youngest actor of the bunch  \u2014   I think he was 21  \u2014   was given grunt detail. We gave him a watch and he had to keep track of how long it took us to eat and get in and out of our gear. One day he came to me and said the watch has stopped, and I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just got to wind it.\u2019 He came back literally 15 minutes later and said, \u2018Wait, how do you wind it? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d The good thing about playing an interview slow and loose, especially when you\u2019ve caught your subject on a free day, is that you can slide into the type of     conversation only possible with truly friendly people. Not to say that Pitt isn\u2019t sometimes on his guard when it comes to discussing touchy subjects like income inequality and whitewashing in Hollywood. But there\u2019s a casual intimacy to the few hours we\u2019ve spent together, shooting the breeze with a rapport so easy that I keep turning the recorder back on after I assume the interview is over him talking about falling under the spell of New Orleans, or being a \u201csucker for an underdog story,\u201d or how \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild\u201d is an amazing film that broke his heart. The bad thing about playing an interview slow and loose is that you\u2019re never sure how to end it. So I keep hanging out at his office, touring the compound and overhearing him on the phone dealing with daddy business, when I realize I\u2019m about to miss my flight. He orders me a car and walks me outside to the gate. It\u2019s not until this moment, under the glare of the California sun, that I\u2019m confronted with the absurdity of standing next to Brad Pitt, on the side of the road, waiting for an Uber.'"}, "time": 1742628547.213482}
