And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : \u201cRepublicans, it is time to come home\u201d https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn\u2019t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan\u2019s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan\u2019s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a \u201cprincipled\u201d conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan \u2013 like many of his colleagues \u2013 turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat\u2019s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn\u2019t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016\u2019s very ugly election has done any good it\u2019s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter'"}, "time": 1742563217.3653452}
