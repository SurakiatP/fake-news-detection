[\u201cWhat if I told you I actually agree with Black Lives Matter? What if I told you institutionalized racism is real in America?\u201d Johnson said, describing how progressive president Woodrow Wilson believed America would be better \u201cif the races were segregated. \u201d She continued:  What if I told you institutionalized racism was real in America and came through a president named FDR? What if I told you that minimum wage [laws] was to protect white jobs from black workers, through unionization? That actually happened in this country. What if I told you that price controls put out by FDR actually bankrupted black farms? People who worked for themselves their entire lives were now forced to go to government and beg for welfare? What if I told you excessive taxation and regulation took these people that were   slaves already  \u2026     and crushed those businesses? \u201cWhat if I told you that white supremacy is real in America, and it came with the very first gun law? That black people had no right to protect themselves from the KKK?\u201d Johnson said to applause and appreciative \u201camens\u201d from the audience. \u201cWhat if I told you white supremacy was real in the form of Planned Parenthood?\u201d Johnson continued to growing applause. Progressives put \u201cPlanned Parenthood centers right in black neighborhoods. \u201d \u201cWhat if I told you white supremacism was real in the criminal justice system, because you have people that think they can change human nature by passing a law, and they realized that they could [bypass] the Thirteenth Amendment and still restrict you to slavery by convicting you of a crime?\u201d All of these factors \u201cculminated in a campaign of a   Woodrow   progressive,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWho wants to push an FDR jobs program. Who loves Planned Parenthood. And who hasn\u2019t met a gun law she didn\u2019t like. And who ran on the Democrats\u2019 side: Hillary Clinton. \u201d (\u201c\u201d the audience replied in unison.) \u201cEvery single aspect of systemic racism and white supremacy they have pushed remains on the Democratic side,\u201d she said, later adding: \u201cThey came from the Democrat side and they remain on the Democrat side. \u201d Johnson concluded that she had a message to deliver to \u201cthose black families out there that are listening. \u201d \u201cYou have an option. You have a choice. I am not telling you this administration. I am not telling you this president. I am telling you this conservative ideology is your choice. I\u2019m not telling you it\u2019s fun. I am not telling you it is easy. I\u2019m telling you in the end, it is worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single drop is worth it. \u201d \u201cSo, before I go, it\u2019s a battle with Black Lives Matter. Can we build our own damn army, please?\u201d she said to wild applause.'"}, "time": 1742561878.6848724}
