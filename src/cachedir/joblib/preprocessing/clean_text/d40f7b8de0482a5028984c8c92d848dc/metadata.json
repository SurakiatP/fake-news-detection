For decades he continued to confound expectations, selling millions of records with dense, enigmatic songwriting. Now, Mr. Dylan, the poet laureate of the rock era, has been rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature, an honor that elevates him into the company of T. S. Eliot, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Toni Morrison and Samuel Beckett. Mr. Dylan, 75, is the first musician to win the award, and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901. In choosing a popular musician for the literary world\u2019s highest honor, the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, dramatically redefined the boundaries of literature, setting off a debate about whether song lyrics have the same artistic value as poetry or novels. [ Our pop critic on Bob Dylan, the musician | Our book critic on Dylan, the writer ] Some prominent writers celebrated Mr. Dylan\u2019s literary achievements, including Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates and Salman Rushdie, who called Mr. Dylan \u201cthe brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition,\u201d adding, \u201cGreat choice. \u201d But others called the academy\u2019s decision misguided and questioned whether songwriting, however brilliant, rises to the level of literature. \u201cBob Dylan winning a Nobel in Literature is like Mrs Fields being awarded 3 Michelin stars,\u201d the novelist Rabih Alameddine wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is almost as silly as Winston Churchill. \u201d Jodi Picoult, a   novelist, snarkily asked, \u201cI\u2019m happy for Bob Dylan, #ButDoesThisMeanICanWinAGrammy?\u201d Many musicians praised the choice with a kind of awe. On Twitter, Rosanne Cash, the songwriter and daughter of Johnny Cash, wrote simply: \u201cHoly mother of god. Bob Dylan wins the Nobel Prize. \u201d But some commentators bristled. Two   websites, Pitchfork and Vice, both ran columns questioning whether Mr. Dylan was an appropriate choice for the Nobel. As the writer of classic folk and protest songs like \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d and \u201cThe Times They Are  \u2019,\u201d as well as Top 10 hits including \u201cLike a Rolling Stone,\u201d Mr. Dylan is an unusual Nobel winner. The first American to win the prize since Ms. Morrison in 1993, he is studied by Oxford dons and beloved by presidents. Yet instead of appearing at the standard staid news conference arranged by a publisher, Mr. Dylan was in Las Vegas on Thursday for a performance at a theater there. By late afternoon, Mr. Dylan had not commented on the honor. Mr. Dylan has often sprinkled literary allusions into his music and cited the influence of poetry on his lyrics, and has referenced Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine and Ezra Pound. He has also published poetry and prose, including his 1971 collection, \u201cTarantula,\u201d and \u201cChronicles: Volume One,\u201d a memoir published in 2004. His collected lyrics from   are due out on Nov. 1 from Simon  Schuster. Literary scholars have long debated whether Mr. Dylan\u2019s lyrics can stand on their own as poetry, and an astonishing volume of academic work has been devoted to parsing his music. The Oxford Book of American Poetry included his song \u201cDesolation Row,\u201d in its 2006 edition, and Cambridge University Press released \u201cThe Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan\u201d in 2009, further cementing his reputation as a brilliant literary stylist. Billy Collins, the former United States poet laureate, argued that Mr. Dylan deserved to be recognized not merely as a songwriter, but as a poet. \u201cMost song lyrics don\u2019t really hold up without the music, and they aren\u2019t supposed to,\u201d Mr. Collins said in an interview. \u201cBob Dylan is in the 2 percent club of songwriters whose lyrics are interesting on the page even without the harmonica and the guitar and his very distinctive voice. I think he does qualify as poetry. \u201d In giving the literature prize to Mr. Dylan, the academy may also be recognizing that the gap has closed between high art and more commercial creative forms. \u201cIt\u2019s literature, but it\u2019s music, it\u2019s performance, it\u2019s art, it\u2019s also highly commercial,\u201d said David Hajdu, a music critic for The Nation who has written extensively about Mr. Dylan and his contemporaries. \u201cThe old categories of high and low art, they\u2019ve been collapsing for a long time, but this is it being made official. \u201d In previous years, writers and publishers have grumbled that the prize often goes to obscure writers with clear political messages over more popular figures. But in choosing someone so well known, and so far outside of established literary traditions, the academy seems to have swung far into the other direction, bestowing prestige on a popular artist who already had plenty of it. It\u2019s not the first time it has stretched the definition of literature. In 1953, Winston Churchill received the prize, in part as recognition of the literary qualities of his soaring political speeches and \u201cbrilliant oratory in defending exalted human values,\u201d according to the academy. And many were surprised last year, when the prize went to the Belarussian journalist Svetlana Alexievich, whose deeply reported narratives draw on oral history. In its citation, the Swedish Academy credited Mr. Dylan with \u201chaving created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition. \u201d Sara Danius, a literary scholar and the permanent secretary of the   academy, which called Mr. Dylan \u201ca great poet in the   tradition\u201d and compared him to Homer and Sappho, whose work was delivered orally. Asked if the decision to award the prize to a musician signaled a broadening in the definition of literature, Ms. Danius responded, \u201cThe times they are   perhaps. \u201d Mr. Dylan, whose original name is Robert Allen Zimmerman, was born on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minn. He emerged on the New York music scene in 1961 as an artist in the tradition of Woody Guthrie, singing protest songs and strumming an acoustic guitar in clubs and cafes in Greenwich Village. But from the start, Mr. Dylan stood out for dazzling lyrics and an oblique songwriting style that made him a source of fascination for artists and critics. In 1963, the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop chart with a version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind,\u201d whose ambiguous refrains evoked Ecclesiastes. Within a few years, Mr. Dylan was confounding the very notion of folk music, with ever more complex songs and moves toward a more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sound. In 1965, he played with an electric rock band at the Newport Folk Festival, provoking a backlash from fans who accused him of selling out. After reports of a motorcycle accident in 1966 near his home in Woodstock, N. Y. Mr. Dylan withdrew further from public life but remained intensely fertile as a songwriter. His voluminous archives, showing his working process through thousands of pages of songwriting drafts, were acquired this year by institutions in Tulsa, Okla. His 1975 album \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d was interpreted as a supremely powerful account of the breakdown of a relationship, but just four years later the Christian themes of \u201cSlow Train Coming\u201d divided critics. His most recent two albums were chestnuts of traditional pop that had been associated with Frank Sinatra. Since 1988, Mr. Dylan has toured almost constantly, inspiring an unofficial name for his itinerary, the Never Ending Tour. Last weekend, he played the first of two performances at Desert Trip, a festival in Indio, Calif. that also featured the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and other stars of the 1960s. He is scheduled to return on Friday for the festival\u2019s second weekend. \u201cAs the \u201960s wore on,\u201d Giles Harvey wrote in The New York Review of Books in 2010, \u201cDylan grew increasingly frustrated with what he came to regard as the pious sloganeering and doctrinaire leftist politics of the folk milieu. \u201d He \u201cbegan writing a kind of visionary nonsense verse, in which the rough, ribald, lawless America of the country\u2019s traditional folk music collided with a surreal ensemble of characters from history, literature, legend, the Bible, and many other places besides. \u201d Mr. Dylan\u2019s many albums, which the Swedish Academy described as having \u201ca tremendous impact on popular music,\u201d include \u201cBringing It All Back Home\u201d and \u201cHighway 61 Revisited\u201d (1965) \u201cBlonde on Blonde\u201d (1966) \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d (1975) \u201cOh Mercy\u201d (1989) \u201cTime Out Of Mind\u201d (1997) \u201c\u2018Love and Theft\u2019\u201d (2001) and \u201cModern Times\u201d (2006). His 38 studio albums have sold 125 million copies around the world. The academy added: \u201cDylan has the status of an icon. His influence on contemporary music is profound, and he is the object of a steady stream of secondary literature. \u201d Mr. Dylan\u2019s many honors include Grammy, Academy and Golden Globe awards. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, won a special Pulitzer Prize in 2008 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. The Nobel comes with a prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or just over $900, 000. The literature prize is given for a lifetime of writing rather than for a single work. \u201cToday, everybody from Bruce Springsteen to U2 owes Bob a debt of gratitude,\u201d President Obama said at the medal ceremony. \u201cThere is not a bigger giant in the history of American music. All these years later, he\u2019s still chasing that sound, still searching for a little bit of truth. And I have to say that I am a really big fan. \u201d \u25a0 Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct. 3 for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for \u201c . \u201d \u25a0 David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics on Oct. 4 for their research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states. \u25a0   Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Oct. 5 for development of molecular machines, the world\u2019s smallest mechanical devices. \u25a0 President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for pursuing a deal to end 52 years of conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the   war in the Americas. \u25a0 Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Monday for their work on improving the design of contracts, the deals that bind together employers and their workers, or companies and their customers.'"}, "time": 1742564542.0836685}
