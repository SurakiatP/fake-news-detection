We are now fighting against Daesh. The US periodically provides air support but, unfortunately, we see weapons of Western manufacturing in Daesh hands. Of course, the Americans don\u2019t say that they are supporting Daesh, but we see that half of the weapons dropped from their aircraft go to Syrian Kurds, and the other half to Daesh,\u201d the Turkish head of state said in an interview to Second Israeli TV channel. \\n\\nAnkara remains opposed to the US\u2019 support for Syrian kurds.  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742561837.9007819}
