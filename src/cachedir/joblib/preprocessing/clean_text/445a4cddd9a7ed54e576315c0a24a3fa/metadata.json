Even before he was elected he had to deal with questions about his origin of birth. He\u2019s also secretly a Muslim masquerading as a Christian. One of the best is that he is going to unarm Americans by taking our guns. I\u2019m still waiting on that one. But in a recent GQ interview , President Obama revealed his favorite conspiracy theory \u2013 Jade Helm.

In July of this year, roughly 1,200 U.S. military troops participated in exercises that spanned seven states. Jade Helm included New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. As we all know though, this exercise proved itself to be a great opportunity for the bitter right-wing to start up the conspiracy machine. \\nWhile this resulted in great ratings for the likes of Alex Jones , Jade Helm turned out to be a \u2014 military exercise \u2014 not a military led plot for Obama to take over the country and stay in power as a dictator. No wonder Jade Helm entertained Obama. Only a right-wing nut-job would believe something like that. \\nBut why is that Obama\u2019s favorite conspiracy theory? He explained after GQ asked : \u201cWhat\u2019s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?\u201d \\nObama then answered : \u201cThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I\u2019m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.\u201d \\nYou see, even the leader of the free world answers to somebody.
