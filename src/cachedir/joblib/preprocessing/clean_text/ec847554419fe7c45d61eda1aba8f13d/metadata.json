A trucker in Ohio shocked hospital staff after coming back to life nearly an hour after he lost his pulse following a massive heart attack \u2014 but it's what he claims to have seen during those tense moments that has him sure there's an afterlife. Brian Miller, 41, was opening the lid of a container when he knew something felt wrong \u2014 he immediately called 911 and told the operator, \u201cI'm a truck driver and I think I'm having a heart attack.\u201d Sure enough, his main artery was completely blocked \u2014 causing what's known as a \u201cwidow-maker\u201d heart attack, Fox 8 Cleveland reported . He was rushed to a local hospital where doctors managed to revive him and clear the blockage, but after regaining consciousness and feeling the pain dissipate, he developed ventricular fibrillation, when the heart starts quivering wildly and is unable to pump blood. \u201cHe had no heart rate, he had no blood pressure, he had no pulse,\u201d said ICU nurse Emily Bishop. \u201cI mean think about that.\u201d Doctor's performed \u201cstrong, hard, fast CPR\u201d and shocked Miller four times to try to revive him, but had no luck. It was during that time that Miller said he slipped away into a celestial world, \u201cThe only thing I remember I started seeing the light, and started walking toward the light.\u201d He described walking down a flower-lined path into white light \u2014 until he came upon his step mother, who had died recently, \u201cShe was the most beautiful thing when I seen her, it was like the first day I met her, (she) looked so happy.\u201d Miller remembered, \u201cShe grabbed ahold of my arm and told me, \u2018It's not your time, you don't need to be here, we've got to take you back you've got things to go and do.\u2019\u201d After 45 minutes, his pulse returned \u201cout of nowhere,\u201d Bishop said. \u201dHis brain had no oxygen for 45 minutes, the fact that he's up walking, talking, laughing, everything is amazing.\u201d Glad to be back amongst the living, Miller now says there is one thing he is sure of, \u201cThere is an afterlife and people need to believe in it, big time.\u201d Related:\""}, "time": 1742561819.5625553}
