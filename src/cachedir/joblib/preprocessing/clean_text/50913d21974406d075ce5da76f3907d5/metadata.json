His parents\u2019 names are emblazoned across a hospital campus, a tribute to generous donors. But to many Israelis and Palestinians, Jared Kushner is a mystery. Suddenly, Mr. Kushner, 35, the    of   Donald J. Trump and a business mogul in his own right, has emerged as a potentially important figure in the future of this troubled region. Mr. Trump said this week that Mr. Kushner could play a key, if undefined, role in efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. Few of the Israelis and Palestinians who have been immersed for years in the fitful and frustrating peace process, such as it is, could recall ever meeting Mr. Kushner, and many were hurrying to learn more. But then again, time spent at the peace table has not exactly yielded peace, and some of those who do know Mr. Kushner said his freshness and close ties to the incoming president could make him a valuable new player. Israeli officials, especially those close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were most optimistic, seeing Mr. Kushner as an ally. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that he feels a strong commitment to Israel\u2019s security and Israel\u2019s future,\u201d said Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, who has forged a close relationship with Mr. Kushner. Palestinian leaders were more wary. \u201cI don\u2019t personally know Jared Kushner and have never met him, but welcome the idea of having him assist in breaking the deadlock in the negotiations of the conflict,\u201d said Amin Maqboul, secretary general of the revolutionary council of Fatah, the party that controls the Palestinian Authority. The extent of Mr. Kushner\u2019s relationship with Israel is unclear. He is not a frequent visitor in the corridors of Jerusalem\u2019s fancy hotels or the trendy restaurants of Tel Aviv, nor has he established deep ties with Israel\u2019s booming business sector. He has known Mr. Netanyahu casually since childhood through his father, Charles Kushner, a real estate tycoon who has been active in business and philanthropy in Israel. And he is friends with Nir Barkat, the mayor of Jerusalem. But they get together mainly in New York, not here. In an interview with The New York Times this week, Mr. Trump pointed to Mr. Kushner as an influential player in future Middle East peace efforts. \u201cI mean, he knows it so well,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe knows the region, knows the people, knows the players. \u201d But that seems to be a bit of fatherly exaggeration. Certainly, Mr. Kushner knows the region and players better than Mr. Trump, who has little experience here. But phone calls and emails to dozens of politicians, diplomats and journalists in Israel and the Palestinian territories yielded few who had actually encountered him. \u201cI\u2019ve never met Jared Kushner,\u201d said Dore Gold, a longtime adviser to Mr. Netanyahu who recently stepped down as director general of the Foreign Ministry. Neither had Sallai Meridor, a former ambassador to the United States Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Mr. Netanyahu or Avinoam   president of the Jewish People Policy Institute, a   group that researches   relations. Nor had the main opposition leaders Isaac Herzog and Yair Lapid. Still, Mr. Kushner has been Mr. Trump\u2019s intermediary with a variety of important Israeli and Jewish American players, including Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Dermer and wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson, the Nevada casino magnate. He brokered a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu in September and sat in on it. \u201cHe follows the issue. He\u2019s a strategic thinker,\u201d said Martin Peretz, the former owner and editor in chief of The New Republic, who met Mr. Kushner at Harvard University and now splits his time between Israel and the United States. \u201cDoes he know enough? Does he know more than Aaron David Miller? Probably not. Does he know more than Dennis Ross? Probably not,\u201d Mr. Peretz said, naming two longtime American negotiators. But \u201che certainly knows more about the area than Barack Obama, and more than John Kerry. \u201d The grandson of Holocaust survivors, Mr. Kushner was raised in an Orthodox Jewish household in New Jersey and graduated from a Jewish day school before attending Harvard. He observes the Sabbath, and his wife  \u2014   Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka  \u2014   converted to Judaism before their marriage. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team would not say how often Mr. Kushner visited Israel or whether he had any Palestinian connections. But an aide to the   emphasized that Mr. Kushner would be just one of many advisers on the Middle East. Mr. Kushner, who took over his family\u2019s real estate empire in his 20s and bought The New York Observer, visited Israel in 2014 when he was trying to acquire a controlling stake in Phoenix Holdings, an insurer. He signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to buy 47 percent of the firm from the Delek Group, an Israeli conglomerate, for about $434 million. But the deal fell apart, partly because of regulatory requirements. Mr. Kushner was in Israel during the war with Gaza that summer, which seemed to unnerve his wife. \u201cWe have small children, and Ivanka didn\u2019t like the idea of me being here,\u201d he told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. \u201cAs an American who listens to the news every hour, and hearing about 90 missiles hitting Israel on a daily basis, she asked me, \u2018What the hell are you doing? \u2019\u201d Later that year, as the Phoenix deal was unraveling, his parents traveled to Jerusalem to dedicate a new 11.  campus for the Shaare Zedek Medical Center opposite Mount Herzl, named the Seryl and Charles Kushner Campus. The Kushners committed $20 million to the hospital and Seryl Kushner served on the national board of an American committee supporting Shaare Zedek. Charles Kushner has been a participant in the Faire Fund, an   real estate investment fund, for more than a decade. \u201cThe family has been involved very much in all sorts of activities with regard to Israel,\u201d said Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the United States and one of the founders of the fund. His partner, Shlomo Grofman, a real estate developer and friend of the elder Mr. Kushner\u2019s, said he had tried to involve Jared in Israel as well. \u201cI brought Jared and Ivanka to Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cI invited them and they came. \u201d Now, it seems possible that Mr. Kushner will be a more regular visitor, gathering information and perhaps more for his   . To those who have talked with Mr. Trump, there is little doubt that Mr. Kushner is a powerful voice on issues involving Israel. Boaz Bismuth, the foreign editor for Israel Hayom, a newspaper owned by Mr. Adelson, recalled interviewing Mr. Trump in December. \u201cThe first thing he mentioned was Jared  \u2014   he spoke of him as someone he counts on,\u201d Mr. Bismuth said. \u201cHe told me then that Jared knows Israel, follows what\u2019s going on here. \u201d Now, instead of just following it, Mr. Kushner may have a chance to lead.'"}, "time": 1742562156.838732}
