If he sells out the people, he won\u2019t be reelected. If he is defeated by the oligarchy, the people will become more radical. \\nWe do not know how Washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a Trump presidency. Unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests, insiders survive by going along with the current. If the current changes under Trump, so will the insiders. \\nTrump got elected because flyover America has had all it can take from the self-dealing oligarchy. The vast bullk of America has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century. The states Hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchy\u2019s stomping grounds on the NE and West coasts and in Colorado and New Mexico, where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary. If you look at the red/blue electoral map, geographically speaking Hillary\u2019s support is very limited.\\nWe know that Hillary is an agent for the One Percent. The Clintons $120 million personal wealth and $1.6 billion personal foundation are proof that the Clintons are bought-and-paid-for. We know that Hillary is responsible for the destruction of Libya and of much of Syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Ukraine. We know that the Clinton regime\u2019s sanctions on Iraq resulted in the deaths of 500,000 children. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity. We know Hillary used government office for private gain. We know she violated national security laws without being held accountable. What we don\u2019t know is why groups that allegedly are liberal-progressive-leftwing are such fervent supporters of Hillary.\\nOne possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motives.\\nAnother possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for Americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers, but transgender, homosexual and illegal alien rights.\\nAnother possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupid.\\nWhat these protesters see as a threat in Trump\u2019s strong and willful personality is actually a virtue. A cipher like Obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged George W. Bush so easily stage-managed by Dick Cheney. Nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the well-entrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives. If Trump were a shrinking violet, the electorate would have ignored him.\\nTrump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks, the poor generally, teachers unions, farmers, abortion rights for women, etc. Trump was elected because he said: \u201cThose who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don\u2019t have your good in mind. It\u2019s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.\u201d\\nIt has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office. Trump\u2019s words are what Americans were waiting to hear.\\nAs willful as Trump is, he is only one person. The oligarchy are many.\\nAs impressive as Trump\u2019s billion dollars is, the oligarchs have trillions.\\nCongress being in Republican hands will spare Trump partisan obstruction, but Congress remains in the hands of interest groups. \\nAs powerful as the office of the president can be, without unity in government changes from the top don\u2019t occur, especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by Russia and China. Trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers. The military/security complex needs an enemy for its budget.\\nIt is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the American people. Trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring. The only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fire.\\nAs for the immigration issue, the Obama Justice (sic) Department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that American police departments cannot discriminate against non-citizens by only hiring citizens as officers. Now that US citizens face arrest in their own country by non-citizens, the resentment of immigrants will increase. Clearly it is nonsensical to devalue American citizenship in this way. Clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the US economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence. \\nIf Trump can defeat the oligarchy and save America, he can go down in history as Trump the Great. I think that this prospect appeals to Trump more than more wealth. Instead of trying to tear him down in advance, he should be supported. With Trump\u2019s determination and the people\u2019s support, change from the top down is possible. Otherwise, change has to come from the bottom up, and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets. \\nThe post Trump the Great \u2014 Paul Craig Roberts appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .'"}, "time": 1742561698.4171853}
