Now she\u2019s a labor leader, the president of Actors\u2019 Equity. And this week she began playing the nation\u2019s most famous lesbian cartoonist, Alison Bechdel, in the touring production of the   \u201cFun Home. \u201d Over the next year, Ms. Shindle will be traveling from city to city, introducing the country to one of the more unlikely recent musical successes, while simultaneously leading her union as it works to improve pay and benefits for more than 50, 000 actors and stage managers across the United States. It\u2019s a complicated juggling act, and one that Ms. Shindle has decided to turn into a yearlong adventure. A Queens resident accustomed to traveling by subway and bicycle, she bought a used green Nissan Rogue, loaded in some clothing and a computer, and hit the road, heading first to Cleveland, where the tour\u2019s performances began on Sunday. She also cut off the long brown hair she has worn since adolescence, the hair that was once crowned by a tiara. After failing to persuade the show to let her wear a wig, she chopped most of it off the day before the first rehearsal, and has had multiple trims since, each one bringing her nearer to the   style favored by Ms. Bechdel. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty funny about Kate,\u201d Ms. Bechdel said in a wry email about the casting. \u201cShe\u2019s a former Miss America, I\u2019m a former Miss America  \u2014   what are the chances? !\u201d (That\u2019s a joke  \u2014   Ms. Bechdel, for any of you who might be confused, was never Miss America.) \u201cBut seriously, being portrayed by her in the musical feels like a lovely, twisting kind of cultural progress, like a M\u00f6bius strip  \u2014   suddenly there\u2019s this inexplicable but undeniable continuity between the marginal lesbian and the beauty queen,\u201d Ms. Bechdel added. \u201cI find it delightful. \u201d Ms. Shindle, who is 39, straight and single, is delighted as well. She saw the show for the first time in January  \u2014   six months after it won the Tony Award for best new musical  \u2014   and said, \u201cBy the time I left the theater, I just thought: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s mine. I\u2019m going to go get that. \u2019\u201d \u201cThere was a lot that resonated with me, in terms of the family dynamics,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s exciting to take this show, with the topics that it addresses, across the country right now, so the activist part of my brain flipped on, too. \u201d For Ms. Shindle, the journey is not as odd as it might seem. As Miss America, in 1998, her cause was AIDS activism, and she used the visibility that came with her stature to champion disease prevention through safe sex and needle exchange programs. Now, by leading the cast of \u201cFun Home,\u201d she is helping to introduce a musical about the sexual awakening of a lesbian, and the simultaneous unraveling of her gay father, to the nation. The juggling is not without precedent  \u2014   Actors\u2019 Equity is administered, on a    basis, by a paid staff the elected officials, like Ms. Shindle, are not paid, so, as she said, \u201ca girl\u2019s got to make a living. \u201d Ms. Shindle, who was elected last year to a   term as president, and who this year led the union as it endorsed a presidential candidate (Hillary Clinton) for the first time, said she would participate in meetings by phone, fly back to New York as needed and continue to focus on priorities like gender parity and racial and ethnic diversity. Among the most pressing issues facing the union: Off Broadway actors are agitating for better pay, Broadway actors are looking to share in profits from shows they help develop, and Los Angeles actors are battling new union rules that affect the thriving   scene there. Ms. Shindle grew up in Moorestown, N. J. and found herself drawn to the stage in seventh grade, when she wrote a paper about theater. (\u201cIt was a terrible paper,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a bad grade on it. \u201d) Undaunted, at her tiny Roman Catholic high school she took on multiple roles  \u2014   in one production of \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d she played the violin in the pit while also performing as  . She enrolled at Northwestern University to study theater, but was also competing in pageants, which were familiar to her because, when she was a child, her family had volunteered with the Miss America pageant. During her junior year, she was chosen as Miss Illinois and then as Miss America, and she took a year off for her reign, during which she traveled the country talking about AIDS, a subject that had piqued her interest after a family friend, and two theater professors at Northwestern, died of the disease. \u201cI was really angry  \u2014   it seemed to me that we knew how to stop transmission, and we weren\u2019t doing it because of politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because of what Miss America is, and was, to the country, people invited me places that no AIDS activist could get into. \u201d As for the gender politics of the Miss America pageant, Ms. Shindle said they didn\u2019t bother her at the time. \u201cNow I look at how the presence and existence of that organization makes other women feel like they have to participate in those kinds of judgments, but at the time I just thought, \u2018You know, nobody\u2019s forcing me to get up on stage in a swimsuit,\u2019 and it actually felt pretty good to get to the point where I was O. K. doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, to me, the end justified the means, because I was a    college student who suddenly had a national forum to speak about an issue that I thought was really important. \u201d She returned to Northwestern to finish her degree, and then moved to New York, working at times as a waitress and selling real estate, but also as an actor, making her Broadway debut as an understudy in \u201cJekyll  Hyde,\u201d and then landing the role of Sally Bowles in \u201cCabaret,\u201d first in the touring production and then, briefly, on Broadway. Later, she was in the original Broadway cast of \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d where she met the producers who now oversee \u201cFun Home. \u201d Her roles have been limited by her height  \u2014   she is 5 feet 11 inches tall. As a result, she said, \u201cI never had ing\u00e9nue years  \u2014   it\u2019s just really hard to pair me with somebody who is going to aesthetically give the look that most directors want. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve played my share of strippers and hookers and other tall people  \u2014   women on their own negotiating the world  \u2014   and I did a show where I played the personification of time, and I played a   hybrid,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I get to play this character for whom whether she can stand on a stage with a man and be more petite than he is is nowhere in the equation. \u201d The show\u2019s director, Sam Gold, who has been restaging it for the road, said that Ms. Shindle\u2019s history and her union activism help her with the role. \u201cI\u2019m not used to having someone in the room who has a whole life other than actor,\u201d he said, \u201cand it grounds Kate. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562017.4209294}
