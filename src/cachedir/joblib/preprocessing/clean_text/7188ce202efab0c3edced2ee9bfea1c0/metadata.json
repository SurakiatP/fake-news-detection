Swaybacked and paunchy, with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram\u2019s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey, Kenny doesn\u2019t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey\u2019s other recent characters. But like them  \u2014   like Mick Haller in \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer,\u201d Ron Woodroof in \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d and that guy in those car commercials  \u2014   he is fun to watch and hard not to root for. \u201cGold,\u201d which chronicles a few of Kenny\u2019s rises and falls in the 1980s, describes itself as \u201cinspired by actual events,\u201d but inspiration is precisely what the film, directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman, seems to lack. Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane, entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms, and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings, phone calls, stock tickers. But the movie isn\u2019t really doing any work. It\u2019s just looking busy. Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak) Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia, and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend, Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications, of course, including the corruptions of wealth, the treachery of rivals and Kenny\u2019s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly. But enough goes wrong along the way  \u2014   with the movie, I mean, not with Mike and Kenny\u2019s scheme  \u2014   to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can\u2019t really go wrong with Bill Camp, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It\u2019s beautifully shot (you can\u2019t go wrong with Robert Elswit, either). There is a pleasingly sleazy, swaggering,   \u201980s vibe. And there are flickering reminders of other ambitious,   mock epics, as if the filmmakers were hoping an algorithm would deposit \u201cGold\u201d in the queues of viewers who liked \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d \u201cThe Big Short\u201d and Mr. Gaghan\u2019s own \u201cSyriana. \u201d With this material, he could have gone in any number of interesting directions, which may have been part of the problem. \u201cGold\u201d could have been a biting satire of greed and folly, a   tale of Western misadventure in Asia, a rousing fable of underdog triumph or a caper comedy. It tries, in its frantic, clumsy fashion, to be all of those things, and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure. What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite  \u2014   a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy, but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we\u2019re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there\u2019s really a difference. His wild, abrasive and improbably delicate performance is what makes \u201cGold\u201d watchable, even if the rest of the movie doesn\u2019t supply sufficient reason to keep watching.'"}, "time": 1742563408.536487}
