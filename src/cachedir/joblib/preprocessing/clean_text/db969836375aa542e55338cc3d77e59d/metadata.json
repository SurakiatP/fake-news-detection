[\u201cOngoing security checks show that the country can no longer accept anyone else\u201d said Milan Chovanec, noting that the Czech Republic has so far received 12 of the 1, 600 migrants it has been ordered to take in under the terms of the EU quota deal.  Vetting   refugees is \u201ccomplicated\u201d the minister explained, adding that migrants \u201chave not even been willing to remain in place [in Greek and Italian camps, while security checks take place\u201d. \u201cWe check thoroughly and in detail during the process, which takes between several weeks and more than two months. \u201cBut these people [that the Czech Republic have been told to take in as refugees] were not prepared to remain in place while being vetted. Because of that, we haven\u2019t given them security clearance. \u201d Confirming that the country \u201chas no further plans to adopt more migrants\u201d Mr Chovanec raised the issue of repeated threats from Brussels to punish states which are refusing to go along with the EU\u2019s agenda to push migrants from the third world on unwilling countries. \u201cThe Czech Republic does not plan to adopt more migrants\u201d he said, acknowledging that this stance is likely to result in Brussels imposing sanctions against the country, \u201cperhaps in the range of several million Euros\u201d. \u201cIt is then up to the government to assess if it\u2019s worth paying the penalty or not. In my opinion  \u2014   yes. You cannot let people here without running all the checks. \u201d The Czech minister\u2019s position is likely to come as a blow to Brussels, as last week the EU told Hungary and Poland they face legal action if their populist governments continue to resist orders to take in migrants from the third world. Warsaw and Budapest have strongly opposed the scheme, which seeks to move 160, 000 people from Italy and Greece into other EU nations. Fewer than 20, 000 people have been resettled so far even though the programme is due to end in September this year. \u201cIf Member States do not increase their relocations soon, the Commission will not hesitate to make use of its powers   \u2026     for those which have not complied,\u201d the bloc\u2019s executive arm said in a statement. Italy, along with Germany, Sweden, Austria, and France have been vocal in demanding the EU cut subsidies to Hungary and Poland for their refusal to welcome migrants. But Reuters reported that, worried about rising Euroskepticism, officials in Brussels are split on whether to open legal proceedings against Hungary and Poland.'"}, "time": 1742562879.39503}
