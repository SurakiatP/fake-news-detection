It was 1998, and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena,   (4)   in a   match that  \u2014   as intrusive as it felt to watch  \u2014   surely drew more attention than any   match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes. The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park, known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three. A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times. Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a   moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament, it seems best to resist the temptation. The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years. And so, even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36, it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions. \u201cI watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a    girl, and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her,\u201d said Marion Bartoli, a former Wimbledon champion. \u201cSuch a powerful image, and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting: \u2018When are you retiring? Have you thought about retiring? How much longer?\u2019 \u201cYou must let the champions decide when the right moment comes. \u201d The Williamses are both great champions, even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1, a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday. Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history, and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016. She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December. It worked. She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw, nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker. Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who has watched her matches from the players box, and seemingly refreshed, Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era. In this tournament, Serena has beaten two former members of the top 10  \u2014   Belinda Bencic and Lucie Safarova  \u2014   and one current member, the   No. 9 seed Johanna Konta. Venus\u2019s draw has been soft by comparison, devoid of top 10 players  \u2014   past or present  \u2014   and including only one seeded player: No. 24 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. On Thursday, she had to scrap and come back to win,   (3)     against the powerful unseeded American CoCo Vandeweghe, while Serena cruised past the unseeded Croat Mirjana      . Serena, who already holds a   edge over her sister, could be the fresher player, too, on Saturday. But the psychology remains complex and the fallout unpredictable, even after all these years. \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing on the court with her, I think I\u2019m playing the best competitor in the game,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m chump change either, you know. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I can get out there, and I compete. \u201d They have not played since the 2015 United States Open, when Serena won,       in a quarterfinal in which Venus attacked, often successfully, from the start but had no answer in the end for Serena\u2019s ultimate weapon: her first serve. It was an intense match in which the big crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed more reflective than fully engaged one in which Serena\u2019s celebration was understandably subdued with her sister across the net, even if their matches are no longer the awkward, constricted affairs of their early years. Saturday\u2019s final in Melbourne could be intriguing on multiple levels, in part because of the Australian public. Venus is viewed here, as elsewhere, as a sympathetic figure: the older sister who has handled the younger\u2019s greater tennis success unselfishly and with dignity. And though both sisters have had to cope with major health problems and family tragedy, with the murder of their half sister Yetunde Price in 2003, Venus is the one whose tennis fortunes dipped more dramatically. A   Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1, she did not advance past the third round in any major event in singles from late 2011 to the end of the 2014 season. She was a major star reduced to a minor role, largely because of an autoimmune disorder  \u2014   Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, diagnosed in 2011  \u2014   that sapped her strength and endurance. When Russian hackers breached the World   Agency\u2019s databases last fall, it was revealed that Venus had needed 13   exemptions for drugs in recent years. The retirement questions to which Bartoli referred started during that period. But Venus\u2019s ability to cope with her condition has improved, and after rejoining the top 10 in 2015, she reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year and then the final here. \u201cShe never even thought of the word retire,\u201d said David Witt, her coach and hitting partner of 10 years. \u201cI just think when she got diagnosed, it was a step back, a shock. She\u2019s learned a lot about how to deal with it and her body, how to eat, how to manage it. \u201cThere are days she can\u2019t work as hard as she wants to work. Some days it\u2019s maybe not smart to do it because it will then hurt you for two or three more days. Where she is now in her career, she has to listen to her body, and I don\u2019t think she really needs to go out and hit balls for two hours. \u201d Witt said there were no more    sessions in the   or in time off tour: just one session in the morning and then gym work, primarily sprints, core strengthening and flexibility. \u201cIt took her years and years to realize that stretching is important and can keep you healthier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more flexible you are, you\u2019re not going to strain or pull anything. I\u2019ve been with her 10 years, and I think it took seven years to get her to stretch. She likes to do a lot of dancing, and that consists of a lot of stretching and being flexible, so I think that\u2019s helped. \u201d Her dance skills were in evidence Thursday as she pirouetted after beating Vandeweghe, but what will linger longest in memory were her screams of delight at having conquered an inspired young opponent in a semifinal. It was a moment she described as \u201cjust joy. \u201d \u201cYou could really see the happiness on her face,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there when she was down and out of it, and back and in it. I\u2019ve been there for all those moments, so I just really was oh so happy. \u201d As visceral as her reaction on court was, she was nothing but considered in the interview room. \u201cI think why people love sport so much is because you see everything in a line,\u201d Venus said. \u201cIn that moment, there is no  . There\u2019s no retake. There is no  . It\u2019s triumph and disaster witnessed in real time. \u201cThis is why people live and die for sport, because you can\u2019t fake it. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s either you do it or you don\u2019t. People relate to the champion. They also relate to the person who didn\u2019t win, because we all have those moments in our life. \u201d This will be Venus\u2019s first major singles final since she lost to Serena in straight sets in the 2009 Wimbledon final, and her first match against Serena in Melbourne since the 2003 final when Serena won her fourth Grand Slam title in a row, having defeated Venus in all four finals. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing,\u201d said Rennae Stubbs, the Australian star who first met the sisters before they joined the tour. \u201cThey came onto the scene at age 15 and 16 with the beads and the hair and the exuberance, and here they are: mature, remarkable young women at 35 and 36. No matter what anyone says to me, their story from start to finish is the greatest sports story ever. \u201d And if the Williamses have taught us anything along the way, it is that the story is not finished until they say it is.'"}, "time": 1742561944.2230978}
