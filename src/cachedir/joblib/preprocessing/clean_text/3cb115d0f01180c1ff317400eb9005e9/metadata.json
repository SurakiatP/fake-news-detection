[Hunter\u2019s school \u2014  A Place to Grow \u2014  is located in Troy, Illinois.  According to Fox 2 Now, Hunter\u2019s mother, Kristy Jackson, said her son was excited because he had just spent time with his grandpa \u2014  a Caseyville, Illinois, police officer \u2014  who was teaching him about hunting and gun safety. Jackson said: [Hunter] just was wandering around in a field and picked up and put it in his pocket and didn\u2019t tell his parents  \u2026    it\u2019s paranoia.  It\u2019s something that\u2019s become quite an epidemic where guns are automatically assumed that they\u2019re bad  \u2026    and I\u2019m not sure how a   suspension teaches my son anything about tolerance or anything about why he was wrong.  It just means his school doesn\u2019t want him there because of things he enjoys. In a Facebook post, Jackson she went to the school to pick her son up like any other day, only to met by \u201ca stone faced teacher\u201d who said her son had brought a \u201cshotgun bullet\u201d to school. Jackson said her immediate thought was, \u201cMy kid? Who just spent the weekend learning gun safety?\u201d She said the teacher then handed her a letter saying \u201c[Hunter\u2019s] behavior warranted a seven school day suspension. Which [Kristy] still was expected to pay tuition for, of course. And a threat that if his enthusiasm for guns continued, he\u2019d be permanently expelled. \u201d Fox 2 Now reports that the letter also said the school had \u201crepeatedly\u201d told Hunter to quit \u201cusing other toys as make believe guns\u201d The school\u2019s   also emailed Jackson to inform her that he was \u201cnotifying the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)\u201d about the suspension.
