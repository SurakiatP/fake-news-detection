Dr. Rodchenkov, who said he had fled Russia out of fear for his life, controlled the laboratory that tested thousands of Olympians. He said he had created a special cocktail for Russian athletes and described an elaborate scheme by Russia\u2019s intelligence agency, the F. S. B. to tamper with urine samples in the dead of night in Sochi to avoid detection. Dmitry S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters that the account was not supported by any evidence. \u201cThese allegations look absolutely groundless,\u201d Mr. Peskov told Russian news agencies in a conference call. \u201cThey are not substantiated by any trustworthy data, they are not backed by any sort of documents. All this simply looks like slander by a turncoat. \u201d Dr. Rodchenkov said the doping involved some of Russia\u2019s most famous winter Olympians and medal winners, including 14 members of its   ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won gold medals. Two of the athletes named, Alexander Zubkov, a bobsledder who at age 39 was one of the oldest Olympians ever to win gold, and Alexander Legkov, a   skier who won gold and silver, held a hastily convened news conference on Friday to deny the allegations. \u201cI have always been absolutely clean,\u201d Mr. Zubkov said at the hourlong session, broadcast live on state television. \u201cI consider these allegations absolutely groundless. \u201d Mr. Legkov suggested that the charges were politically motivated. Based on previous allegations of doping in track and field, there have already been calls to bar Russian athletes from the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer. Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims also promise to further complicate Russia\u2019s efforts to refute other accusations of   doping made by a commission of the independent World   Agency. Mr. Legkov, one of the most famous athletes in Russia, said Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s allegation that the drugs were served up in alcohol to mask their presence was especially incredible, since Olympic athletes swore off drinking during their training. \u201cThat just sounds ridiculous,\u201d he said, adding that perhaps Dr. Rodchenkov had been drinking too many of his own cocktails. Yuri Nagornykh, the deputy sports minister, who also appeared at the news conference, denied that Russia had ever had a   doping program. All state resources were concentrated on getting the Olympic athletes the best trainers and equipment possible, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doping program in Russian sport, in the Russian Federation there was none and will be none,\u201d he said. Mr. Nagornykh said that if there was any evidence to base an investigation on, Russia would certainly conduct one. But he said that Russia and the athletes named were weighing filing a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Rodchenkov and The Times. Since the report by the World   Agency, two colleagues of Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s, both former   officials of the state antidoping agency, have died under mysterious circumstances.'"}, "time": 1742563968.8394587}
