As Dale told Stelter, \u201cThere is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty.\u201d Trump, says Dale, \u201cis not a normal political liar.\u201d \\nFor example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. \\nDale\u2019s judgment is that \u201cthere is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent.\u201d \\nTrump also lies \u201cpointlessly,\u201d argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, \\n\u201cHe gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether he\u2019s lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts.\u201d \\nThis was Mark Cuban\u2019s complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. \\nIn the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trump\u2019s supporters. You can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. \\nThe lie has taken hold \u2013 one of many \u2013 many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, \\n\u201cIf Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education.\u201d \\nGiven the GOP\u2019s history with facts, good luck with that. \\nImage: Screen capture Twitter'"}, "time": 1742564065.5054145}
