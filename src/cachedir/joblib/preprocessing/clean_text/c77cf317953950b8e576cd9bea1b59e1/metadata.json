[CNN broke the story, reporting:  The dossier has also been cited by FBI Director James Comey in some of his briefings to members of Congress in recent weeks, as one of the sources of information the bureau has used to bolster its investigation, according to US officials briefed on the probe. This includes approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page, two of the officials said. Last year, Page was identified by the Trump campaign as an adviser on national security. This is not the FBI\u2019s only use of the dossier.  Last month, the BBC reported the document served as a \u201croadmap\u201d for the FBI\u2019s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The dossier, which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the   claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed, was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. Instead of questioning the FBI\u2019s motivations for its reported use of the suspect dossier, some news media organizations actually brandished the FBI\u2019s reported use of it to bolster the dossier\u2019s credibility. \u201cReport: FBI\u2019s use of Trump dossier in court order request boosts its credibility,\u201d is the title of an AOL. com article. \u201cTrump\u2019s Russia dossier corroborated: FBI used document to obtain wiretap on Carter Page,\u201d reported Salon. com. Coverage of the matter by other major news media outlets reviewed by this reporter failed to provide reasonable context regarding the many questions surrounding the dossier or criticism of the document from current and former U. S. officials. Last month, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley sent a letter to Fusion GPS, the firm that hired Steele to compile the Trump opposition research dossier, raising questions about the document, including whether Steele was ever paid by the FBI at the same time he was paid by Fusion GPS. The Washington Post reported that after being paid to compile opposition research on Trump by the billionaire\u2019s opponents during the election, Steele \u201creached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work, according to several people familiar with the arrangement. \u201d Ultimately, the FBI did not pay Steele, the Post reported. In light of the Post report, Grassley last month also sent a letter to the FBI requesting information on whether the agency utilized Steele. In the letter, Grassley questioned the FBI\u2019s intentions over the Steele report: The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for President in the   to the election raises further questions about the FBI\u2019s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration\u2019s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends. Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism in the intelligence community, with the publication quoting one member as saying it was a \u201cnutty\u201d piece of evidence to submit to a U. S. president. Steele\u2019s work has been questioned by former acting CIA director Morell, who currently works at the Hillary   Beacon Global Strategies LLC. Beacon was founded by Phillippe Reines, who served as communications adviser to Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. From   Reines also served in Clinton\u2019s State Department as the deputy assistant secretary of state for strategic communications. Reines is the managing director of Beacon. NBC News reported on Morell\u2019s questions about Steele\u2019s credibility: Morell, who was in line to become CIA director if Clinton won, said he had seen no evidence that Trump associates cooperated with Russians. He also raised questions about the dossier written by a former British intelligence officer, which alleged a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.   \u2026     Morell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strong statement by General Clapper,\u201d Morell said. Regarding Steele\u2019s dossier, Morell stated, \u201cUnless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can\u2019t judge the information  \u2014   you just can\u2019t. \u201d Morell charged the dossier \u201cdoesn\u2019t take you anywhere, I don\u2019t think. \u201d \u201cI had two questions when I first read it. One was, How did Chris talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used intermediaries. \u201d Morell continued: And then I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you\u2019re paying somebody, particularly former FSB officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they\u2019re going to call you up and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s have another meeting, I have more information for you,\u201d because they want to get paid some more. I think you\u2019ve got to take all that into consideration when you consider the dossier. Meanwhile, the FBI became interested in Page after he \u201cgave a   speech at a prestigious Moscow institute,\u201d according to a report in the New York Times citing U. S. officials. However, the Times does not specify exactly what the FBI suspected Page was doing, or even why his speech drew FBI attention. The Times reported: That trip last July was a catalyst for the F. B. I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump\u2019s campaign, according to current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials. It is unclear exactly what about Mr. Page\u2019s visit drew the F. B. I. \u2019s interest: meetings he had during his three days in Moscow, intercepted communications of Russian officials speaking about him, or something else. The Times report reveals that Page was only monitored after he had already left the campaign: After Mr. Page, 45  \u2014   a Navy veteran and businessman who had lived in Moscow for three years  \u2014   stepped down from the Trump campaign in September, the F. B. I. obtained a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing the authorities to monitor his communications on the suspicion that he was a Russian agent.
