In past years, the entertainment world has ranked her as one of the \u201cWorst Dressed\u201d at Grammys for skimpy and outlandish outfits. In a recent vlog, Villa shares how she overcomes much of the criticism she has received. She encourages aspiring performing artists to \u201ctell the haters to eff off, because they have no say over your life  \u2014   and as a performing artist, people are going to criticize you \u2019til you\u2019re black and blue. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742563725.1133823}
