Nice work if you can get it. Easy if you\u2019re Bill or Hillary Clinton, money from Morocco\u2019s king one of many examples of their corrupt practices. Reporting on email content revealed by WikiLeaks, Fox News Ed Henry, said the following: \u201cJust hours after Hillary Clinton dodged a question at the final presidential debate about charges of \u2018pay to play\u2019 at the Clinton Foundation, a new batch of WikiLeaks emails surfaced with stunning charges that the candidate herself was at the center of negotiating a $12 million commitment from King Mohammed VI of Morocco.\u201d In an email to Hillary\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook, close Hillary aide Huma Abedin said \u201cthis was HRC\u2019s idea.\u201d \u201cShe created this mess and she knows it\u201d \u2013 referring to scheduling a pay-to-play deal one month after launching her presidential bid, certain to raise red flags if revealed. Her advisors were concerned. Abedin emailed \u201c(j)ust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting (of the Clinton Global Initiative) was her participation. If hrc was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.\u201d \u201cThis was HRC\u2019s idea. Our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.\u201d A compromise was reached. Bill and Chelsea participated, representing Hillary. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace pressed Robby Mook for an explanation. Wallace: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t that classic pay-to-play,\u201d he asked? Mook: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new here\u201d \u2013 only in terms of it being commonplace Bill and Hillary practice. Wallace: \u201cBut, Robby, there is some new stuff. Emails show, and I\u2019m going to go through some of them, you were not happy at all (about) the idea of this meeting and her going there.\u201d Mook: Calling it a scheduling issue, he claimed \u201c(w)e didn\u2019t want her going overseas\u2026before the campaign was kicking off.\u201d Journalist Bob Woodward called Clinton Foundation practices \u201ccorrupt\u2026a scandal. The mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation, and actions by the State Department which she ran are all intertwined\u2026You can\u2019t just say it\u2019s unsavory.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of stuff landing ordinary people in prison. Bill and Hillary remain unaccountable for years of illegal practices. Instead of long overdue prosecution, they\u2019re returning to the White House in January for a third co-presidential term as things now stand \u2013 apparently rigged to assure it.
