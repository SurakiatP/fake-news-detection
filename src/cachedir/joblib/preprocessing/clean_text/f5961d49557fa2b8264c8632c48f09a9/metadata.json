April 2nd, 2015 \\nThe drought in California is getting a lot worse. As you read this, snowpack levels in the Sierra Nevada mountains are the lowest that have ever been recorded . That means that there won\u2019t be much water for California farmers and California cities once again this year. To make up the difference in recent years, water has been pumped out of the ground like crazy. In fact, California has been losing more than 12 million acre-feet of groundwater a year since 2011, and wells all over the state are going dry. Once the groundwater is all gone, what are people going to do? 100 years ago, the population of the state of California was 3 million, and during the 20th century we built lots of beautiful new cities in an area that was previously a desert. Scientists tell us that the 20th century was the wettest century in 1000 years for that area of the country, but now weather patterns are reverting back to normal. Today, the state of California is turning back into a desert but it now has a population of 38 million people. This is not sustainable in the long-term. So when the water runs out, where are they going to go? \\nI have written quite a few articles about the horrific drought in California, but conditions just continue to get even worse. According to NPR, snowpack levels in the Sierra Nevada mountains are \u201cjust 6 percent of the long-term average\u201d \u2026 \\nThe water outlook in drought-racked California just got a lot worse: Snowpack levels across the entire Sierra Nevada are now the lowest in recorded history \u2014 just 6 percent of the long-term average. That shatters the previous low record on this date of 25 percent, set in 1977 and again last year. \\nCalifornia farmers rely on that water. Last year, farmers had to let hundreds of thousands of acres lie fallow because of the scarcity of water, and it is being projected that this year will be even worse \u2026 \\nMore than 400,000 acres of farmland were fallowed last year because of scarce water. Credible sources have estimated that figure could double this year. \\nFortunately, many farmers have been able to rely on groundwater in recent years, but now wells are running dry all over the state. Here is more from NPR \u2026 \\nLast year was already a tough year at La Jolla Farming in Delano, Calif. Or as farm manager Jerry Schlitz puts it, \u201cLast year was damn near a disaster.\u201d \\nLa Jolla is a vineyard, a thousand-or-so acres of neat lines of grapevines in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. It depends on water from two sources: the federal Central Valley Project and wells. \\nUntil last year, Schlitz says, wells were used to supplement the federal water. \\n\u201cNow, we have nothing but wells. Nothing. There\u2019s no water other than what\u2019s coming out of the ground,\u201d he says. \\nLast year, one of those wells at La Jolla dried up. The farm lost 160 acres \u2014 about a million dollars\u2019 worth of produce, plus the wasted labor and other resources. \\nAre you starting to understand the scope of the problem? \\nDespite all of the wonderful technology that we have developed, we are still at the mercy of the weather. \\nAnd if this drought continues to drag on, it is absolutely going to cripple a state that contains more than 10 percent of the total U.S. population. \\nIn an attempt to fight the water shortage, Governor Jerry Brown has instituted statewide water restrictions for the first time ever \u2026 \\nCalifornia announced sweeping statewide water restrictions for the first time in history Wednesday in order to combat the region\u2019s devastating drought, the worst since records began. \\nGovernor Jerry Brown issued the declaration at a press conference in a parched, brown slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains that would normally be covered by deep snow. \\n\u201cToday, we are standing on dry grass where there should be five feet (1.5 meters) of snow,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis historic drought demands unprecedented action.\u201d \\nSo what will these restrictions include? \\nThe following is a summary from Natural News \u2026 \\n\u2022 A ban on non-drip irrigation systems for all new homes. \\n\u2022 A requirement for golf courses and cemeteries to \u201creduce water consumption.\u201d (And yet, the very idea of green golf courses in the middle of a California desert is insane to begin with\u2026) \\n\u2022 Force farmers to report more details on their water usage so that the state government can figure out where all the water is going (and where to restrict it even further). \\n\u2022 Outlawing the watering of grass on public street medians. \\n\u2022 Discussions are also under way to throw \u201cwater wasters\u201d in jail for up to 30 days, according to another LA Times article . The most likely source of intel for incarcerating water wasters will be neighborhood snitches who monitor water usage of nearby homes and call the authorities if they see too much water being used. \\nIf the drought does not go on for much longer, these restrictions may be enough. \\nBut what if it continues to intensify? \\nThe following graphic shows the U.S. Drought Monitor map for the state of California for each of the last five years in late March\u2026 \\nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to see the trend. \\nAnd scientists tell us that this might just be the beginning. There have been megadroughts in that area of the country that have lasted more than 100 years in the past, and there are fears that another megadrought may have begun. The following comes from National Geographic \u2026 \\nCalifornia is experiencing its worst drought since record-keeping began in the mid 19th century, and scientists say this may be just the beginning. B. Lynn Ingram , a paleoclimatologist at the University of California at Berkeley, thinks that California needs to brace itself for a megadrought\u2014one that could last for 200 years or more. \\nAs a paleoclimatologist, Ingram takes the long view, examining tree rings and microorganisms in ocean sediment to identify temperatures and dry periods of the past millennium. Her work suggests that droughts are nothing new to California. \\n\u201cDuring the medieval period, there was over a century of drought in the Southwest and California. The past repeats itself,\u201d says Ingram, who is co-author of The West Without Water: What Past Floods, Droughts, and Other Climate Clues Tell Us About Tomorrow . Indeed, Ingram believes the 20th century may have been a wet anomaly. \\nIf this is a megadrought, it is just a matter of time until massive migration will become necessary. \\nIn fact, one UN official is already talking about it \u2026 \\nIf the state continues on this path, there may have to be thoughts about moving people out, said Lynn Wilson, academic chair at Kaplan University and who serves on the climate change delegation in the United Nations. \\n\u201cCivilizations in the past have had to migrate out of areas of drought,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe may have to migrate people out of California.\u201d \\nWilson added that before that would happen, every option such as importing water to the state would likely occur\u2014 but \u201cmigration can\u2019t be taken off the table.\u201d \\nSo how many people will ultimately have to leave if this drought continues for many years? \\n5 million? \\nAnd where will they go? \\nPlease feel free to share what you think by posting a comment below\u2026 If Anyone Doubts That We Are In A Stock Market Bubble, Show Them This Article \u00bb Eric Rasbold \\nIt is as bad as they say. I am lucky enough to live in the forested Eden of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, just a bit south west of Tahoe. We have water. We are one of four purveyors of water in El Dorado County. We are okay as far as water goes, but the rest of the state is in great danger. We are mostly worried about fire. Last year, we had two major fires: The Sand Fire almost took my home from the south, the King Fire (the largest ever) almost burnt us down from the north. I think dead center is next. Rough winds and crappy seas doth follow. \\nGood Luck and May Your Dow Never Jones. David Almanza \\nAll I see day after day and night after night here in Kansas is a sky full of toxic spray that resemble cobwebs . I guess the thing has to eat itself and lay waste to nature in the process . No one can own the Earth and Sky ,,,have faith in Nature within Us and Nature outside of Us and protect it as much as we can. It is all We have . Erik Bergum \\nThe state of California desperately needs the rain of course MIchael in Chicago \\nThe entire state needs rain just about everyday for several years to start to catch up. Needs an insane amount of snow too. GSOB \\nPerhaps the Lord is telling Californians to get out before His earthquake swallows them up? He is a merciful God. alan \\nHum, doesn\u2019t sound very nice to me. H8Religion \\nHe is a merciful God Like he has mercy on his Child Raping Priests!!!! JI \\nYes, homosexuals/pedophiles infiltrated the church and the church failed to excommunicate them. For that, the church is indeed being punishes. If you are a victim, and you sound like one, seek counseling and help. MIchael in Chicago \\nMuch like the US economy everyone seems to have this false hope things will eventually get better. Water restrictions and importing more water are not all that different from QE. Seems like everything is an illusion these days. Bill \\nIn the old days if you wanted to seek your fortune you would hear,\u201dgo West young man, go West.\u201d Now days those who live in the West are told \u201d go East if you want to survive.\u201d \\nNo matter where Californians go it will put tremendous pressure on the infrastructure of other areas. Then add the demand on a decreasing food supply. The hand that fed us may not be so welcome when it looks to be fed. John \\nNot to mention that many of those Californians are going to demand government assistance like they\u2019ve had in CA wherever they settle. John \\nInteresting. The Sooners migrated there in mass from Oklahoma in the 1930\u2019s. Now their great grandchildren may migrate the other way. Also, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a civilization collapsed in that area of the country. Take the Anasazi Indian civilization for example. XSANDIEGOCA \\nExcellent point. SunnyFlaSnotress \\nYou\u2019re comparing a rustic civilization to a far more progressive civilization. Migration is the probability. Only massive destruction in the form of land upheaval would cause collapse. John \\nThe Anasazi also likely moved elsewhere when their society could no longer be supported by the local environment/climate. Anyway, they apparently abandoned their dwellings in northern AZ for unknown reasons. Severe drought is one possibility. The Clovis people were an even earlier people group in the SW USA whose society appeared to vanish too.

Jessy S. \\nBut this isn\u2019t Agenda 21 doing this. If we are in for another 100 year mega drought, this will be the work of nature instead of man. Tatiana Covington \\nDesalination and fusion power. Graphene sieves and waterchips. Use science and engineering. Those are all we have. T. \\nNo. That\u2019s what Got them in the mess they are in.

Right. We\u2019d be better off trying to harness the power of politicians hot air. JB \\nI agree\u2026. cold fusion is the future and it can be done. Rufus T Firefly \\nScientists estimate we are 40-50 years away from cold fusion. And you can be sure the enviro-whackos will oppose it when it happens. They fear mankind having energy and want to eliminate people, except themselves Priszilla \\nThen let\u2019s just wait 50 years and everything will be fine. John Higson \\nNot cold fusion,hot fusion.And it would be a nightmare,because with free energy the planet is flocked.100 degrees at the surface in 200 years,that\u2019s the way economic growth takes us.Luckily Fusion will never happen,too many technical impossibilities. tone \\nDan Zazlavsy\u2019s Energy Towers was proven to be the answer by a team of international scientist at least a decade ago and yet have not been brought to fruition!

T. \\nIf this drought continues for many years \u2013 Then perhaps 20 to 25 million people or more would eventually have to leave California.

Who is going to get stuck in homes that can never be sold. Priszilla \\nGo North. Global Warming will melt the Arctic. Philip Botwinick \\nAh Priszilla and I had such high hopes for you. \\nGo north and do what. It is clear you\u2019ve not been practicing gardening, or permaculture the last decade. The soil up north can\u2019t and will never have the time to evolve to the point you could plant the crops and food necessary to live as we have over the last 10,000 years. \\nPeople think they are going to plant Banana trees in the Arctic. Ain\u2019t gonna happen. Priszilla \\nYou need compost. My dad used manure in the garden. We didn\u2019t grow bananas. But peaches tomatoes, apples, pears, beans, cucumber and other veggies. Priszilla \\nThat go north was more sarcasm to those who think global warming is good. I prefer planting trees. For shade, wind break, fruits, flowers. Deciduous trees that shed their leaves and give those nutrients to the soil. GSOB \\nMany people would have no choice but to endure and ration to the max.

Sad thing, only a certain amount, if any, of the rain God sends to the just and the unjust is \u2018authorized\u2019 by the usurper for you collect of the rain God sends. \\nSuch a display of impudent audacity, but they report of no other way. In subtle rebellion, our news casters and meteorologists have the platform to conform our thinking to suggest without a doubt, that \u2018Mother Nature\u2019 needs to send us more moisture. \\nOn the other hand, TBTB increase cost no one really wants but because of getting boxed in they have to, so they say. Someone here suggested that the usurper will tax the air next. Someone else suggested that it will get so bad that the great usurper will usurp everything with such attractive and wonderful propositions, you\u2019d wouldn\u2019t want to resist, so add your name to the measures provided by our bureaucrat workers that use the MSM to appeal to the collective that together \u201cWe are the World\u201d.

Most of them are one paycheck from bankruptcy. They are underwater in their loans. Their $800,000 houses will be worthless and abandoned, and they have no savings. There are no jobs for them outside California. They have no manual labor skills and they have kids to feed. They would not last a week outside California before they start stealing food and property of those in other states. Philip Botwinick \\nYou get it. T. \\nI agree. In all honesty there will be No \u201cGo East\u201d. Most will go to their Grave. Jordan Helwig \\nWe need to spend our money domestic problems like these.

In the movie \u201cSoylent Green\u201d, everyone remembers that it turns out the wafers were made from corpses, but that movie had several other-almost prophetic now- things that were creepy. One was the euthanasia centers where people who reached older age, even though healthy, would be asked to go to termination centers and be euthanized for the greater good and population control\u2026. Another one, was that things like strawberries, wine, real food and HOT SHOWERS WITH WATER\u2013were still available, but only for the wealthy. Apartments could be rented with all of the amenities ( including house girls who catered to all needs of the wealthy businessmen.) All of those old, apocalypse movies are a little creepy now\u2013Omega Man with the global virus\u2026.Planet of The Apes with the transhumanism we are seeing experimented with\u2026\u2026.Terminator with all of the advances in robotics and AI thinking machines\u2026..very interesting times we live in.

You\u2019d be in jail before breakfast\u2026 Philip Botwinick \\nYeah, because you think, \u2018Oh those poor people in CA.\u201d that\u2019s not going to happen to me. \\nReminds me of the saying \u201cthey came for the Jews, they came for the Communists, etc., etc.\u201d and then they came for me and there was no one there to stand with me. \\nOh, wait.

Oh, yeah your are a friend of Richard Branson and have your ticket for that colony on Mars. \\nLOL> Illegal \\nThe water restrictions are almost laughable.It would seem if there is a true emergency then all non essential uses of water would be banned.Throw someone in jail is the police state answer to every problem, How is every other country that is mostly desert surviving?

Communist utopia, lots of taxes, State telling you how to breath, they\u2019ll be in heaven. libsarescum \\nAnd NK is a gun free zone. Liberals should be in heaven there. Priszilla \\nThey sing the hymn there too every morning, and they have to swear allegiance in every free minute. Philip Botwinick \\nSorry Sean, but those FEMA camps (if they actually come into existence) will be all over the country. \\nIt appears, that most, but especially those still with Internet connections seem unable to fathom that Climate Change is all over the planet. It knows no boundaries. \\nWhere ever those people leaving CA go will not be far behind in looking like Sao Paulo and Detroit in the next few years. \\nDo not. I repeat do not even feed into the illusion that we\u2019ll find free energy, or solar and wind will come along. That\u2019s a Hollywood delusion. If energy were really free than no corporation would be able to lock up the rights to it in a vault. Read \u201cGreen Illusions\u201d by Ozzie Zehner. sean carter \\nAgree with everything you said. I live in Alberta and the common mythology is we\u2019ll dig up tarsands forever. Not gonna happen. Once once the cheap energy run out our society will be sliding back towards something resembling the mid-1800\u2019s ranging/farming dominated lifestyles. \\nAnd I\u2019m fine with that. Ray \\n\u201cLook, Israel was a bona fide desert,\u201d argues Hazard, who has been pushing for desalination. \u201cNow they run the whole country on four desal plants.\u201d egore \\nThe really bad part is all those liberals gushing out of the state into the rest of the US like diarrhea. Buckle Up! Ted Kennedy \\nHopefully they\u2019ll migrate into Mexico. Will Mexico accept our liberal refugees? Richard O. Mann \\nMexico does not want them. They are too busy trying to export their population to the US. Mexifornia Taxpayer \\nHow about they learn some birth control! SunnyFlaSnotress \\nYou\u2019re right. If we keep a strong dollar and water prices are elevated, more companies will migrate south and many of California\u2019s immigrants, which number somewhere around 10 million, will likely follow Mexico\u2019s new prosperity. Priszilla \\nIt\u2019s not just California where there is a problem with water usage. \\nSince 1950, agricultural irrigation has reduced the saturated volume of the Ogallala aquifer by an estimated 9%. Depletion is accelerating, with 2% lost between 2001 and 2009 alone. Once depleted, the aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through rainfall. \\nIn the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction. \\nThe United States Geological Survey determined the water level in the aquifer has dropped more in Texas than in any other state in the basin. \\nWasting natural resources is an American problem. Ken Swan \\nyeah those inland cities with millions of people using the ground water has nothing to do with it does it? California created this problem (NOT nature) by demanding that 90% of the states water be pumped to LA for use there, so what did they think was going to happen? Priszilla Liberty First \\nJust do not come to Texas. PLEASE! \\nI do not feel very sorry for California, in truth. They have fought desalinization projects like bats out of hell. And converted sea water could make a massive difference in stemming this drought. Environmental concerns, they say. Oh well. Irresponsible people tend to reap negative results. Mike \\nI already applied to three jobs in Texas, haha! Maybe I\u2019ll be your neighbor. Liberty First \\nWell unlike in CA we are friendly to almost anyone down here. Mike \\nDesalinization won\u2019t work anyway. It doesn\u2019t remove 100% of the salt and in a desert region like cal it would evaporate too quickly depositing the trace amounts of salt in the soil rendering it unsuitable. Liberty First \\nOrange County has desal. It works just fine. Don\u2019t Want \u2019em here \\nI feel sorry for you if you get an influx of those lunatics! Kurt \\nThey can just give the State back to Mexico, let them worry about it. Lol VegasBob \\nTo be fair, about 3/4 of California water usage is for agriculture. Without adequate water, I would look for steep increases in the price of fruits and vegetables and depopulation of agricultural areas. Maybe persistent drought will finally stem some of the mass migration from South of the Border into the US. \\nAs for the leftists, they can stay in the Bay Area. They\u2019re probably not going to be forced out. AntonioOssa \\nCALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PUT A STOP TO AGRICULTURE IMMIDIATELY! Mike \\nPeople and animals need to eat drama queen. nobody \\nIf only we could import food from other places\u2026 mar1950 \\nDoes anyone know what % of the economy (GDP) comes from California? I seem to recall that if Cal. were a nation it would be the 6th largest economy in the world. If it did dry up and no one could live there, what would it do to the nation as a whole? \\nI would like to see the governor call the state to pray for rain (and snow in the mountains) but then the Bible declares: \u201cHe (man, state, or nation) that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.\u201d (Proverbs 28:9) \\nCalling on God to intervene while the abortion mills are still doing business, we are busy passing gay \u201cmarriage\u201d laws, and have a brutal militaristic foreign policy that spreads death and destruction around the world we would only be mocking God and adding abomination on top of abomination.

Who knew your rights super ceded the right of someone refusing to participate in your immoral activities? You demanding that people serve you goes back to slavery. Do you think slaves really wanted to serve a master that made them do things against their will? Way to put people back under the thumb of totalitarian rule all so you can have a happy gay wedding. Your immoral behavior does not even begin to compare with blacks being enslaved, one who makes victims of everyone. Gay Veteran \\n\u201cLOL! Who knew your rights super ceded the right of someone refusing to participate in your immoral activities?\u2026.\u201d \\nnot that long ago, 1967 in fact, many states had laws banning interracial marriage and your religious bakers could refuse service to those interracial couples. \\n\u201c\u2026You demanding that people serve you goes back to slavery. Do you think slaves really wanted to serve a master that made them do things against their will?\u2026.\u201d \\nwho knew bakers worked for free! \\n\u201c\u2026Your immoral behavior does not even begin to compare with blacks being enslaved, one who makes victims of everyone.\u201d \\nyou\u2019re partly right about comparing slavery with the treatment of Gays, although in the past Gays have been beaten and murdered in this country with impunity (just like your good old Jim Crow days). And let\u2019s not forget the slaughter of Gays in the concentration camps by those who also thought they were \u201cexceptional\u201d Ron Gilbert \\nSorry pal\u2026 cannot claim the race card here. Not even close to the same thing. Homosexuality is not a race nor is there a gay gene. You are a group of people, and a very small percentage at that, who engage in an immoral activity and spew nothing but hatred and revenge to those that stand against this unGodly activity. Sorry that your \u201cpeople\u201d were slaughtered by whomever did this to them (not me, did not have anything to do with it so stop blaming everyone for it), but that changes nothing as to what you are doing. \\nGod was quite clear when he said he hates the workers of iniquity. Do you know who those are? They include those that would pervert his words and then push a belief that something he says is wrong is not wrong and that he never said it. \\nAnd one more thing, you should really invest in some history reading. Your attributing of Jim Crow laws to my beliefs is completely uneducated (retarded comes to mind but with your sensitivities to PC, I didn\u2019t say that\u2026). As soon as you can, please look up who endorsed, promoted and pushed for Jim Crow laws and fought against their repeal.

That was a revisionism from your buddies in the DNC years ago, so that they could point their crooked little fingers at Conservatives and claim that we are the racists, much like you are doing\u2026.\u201d yeah, the democratic party in the south just mysteriously declined after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. btw junior, I detest the democrats as much as the republicans, if fact more so because so many liberals are hypocrites (whereas the republicans actually believe their BS)\u201c\u2026According to every single bit of research done, only a handful of Dixie Crats switched over to the Republican Party while the VAST majority of them stayed in the DNC.

You have to ask that after stating that Christians have no right to push their morals on you? Have you ever taken into account that when you tell someone that they have no right to tell you what to do, you are doing exactly what you are protesting? It\u2019s just like saying \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d. You are telling the other person what to do. Really? And you see nothing hypocritical about that? Of course you don\u2019t. Why would you? You see things through a clouded vision of love right? Gay Veteran \\noh I see, we gays must shut up while smug self-righteous Pharisees like you give us a lecture on \u201cmorality\u201d. that\u2019s what wannabe theocrats like you want \\nsorry junior, but we ALL have freedom of speech. You can lecture me all you want and I can tell you to stuff it Ron Gilbert \\nOh I see\u2026 we Christians must shut up while the immoral acts of gays are being force upon the population.

You cannot claim that you are within the definition of minorities. Take a hike you justifier of hate. Gay Veteran \\nhey Einstein, Mormons aren\u2019t a race either but anti-discrimination laws protect them Ron Gilbert \\nThen stop using examples of racial discrimination to support you being discriminated against. Gay Veteran \\noh, so you agree that Mormons aren\u2019t a race but anti-discrimination laws protect them Ron Gilbert \\nOf course, that is a religion and as do the laws protect sexual orientation in the area of employment, housing, and being served in a restaurant. But being forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding, or cater a gay wedding, is not the same as you people perpetuate it to be. You are telling people to PARTICIPATE in that activity. It does not mean you won\u2019t be served by them in their establishment, as you tried to tie in discrimination against blacks for not being served by whites in the South. Again, and for the last time, if you don\u2019t support traditional marriage values from Christian business owners, go somewhere else. Freedom of choice is what you Libs want, isn\u2019t it? But no\u2026 instead of wanting equality in laws (such as the pursuit of happiness for your opposition) you believe your rights super cede the rights of others to tell you no. Totalitarianism comes to mind with the logic that you push\u2026. but you keep up that line of reasoning as you continue to believe that I am the stupid one\u2026 round and round we go\u2026 Ron Gilbert \\nRound and round we go Gay Veteran \\n\u201cRound and round we go\u201d \\ntranslation from trollspeak: I just got whipped again Ron Gilbert \\nRound and round we go..

The population of California alone is roughly the same as the entire country of Canada. We have the same problems as California as our snowpack is also dwindling rapidly. This is a continental crisis, and we are going to have to get very creative generating potable water locally, as there really is nowhere to escape to. Yawn Hugh \\nJunior Canuck; Come to northern Ontario. We have had lots and lots of snow the last few years and this year I have about 3\u2032 still remaining in our yard as I write this on Easter.

Mike Smithy \\nKim, the U.S. Government spent millions of dollars constructing the Yucca Mountain containment facility.

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s a massive, yet empty man made cave. nobody \\nActually no, it has already wasted all the easily available uranium ore and what we still have costs a fortune to refine.

They had already screwed things up with their LA smog drifting to our valley. Once transplanted they planted so much CA-style vegetation our average humidity rate raised from 6% to 26% and our realty prices skyrocketed. Then even more illegals filtered into the valley\u2026in other words, I know where they\u2019ll head and they\u2019ll try to screw up AZ [they are even trying to overturn our gun laws to resemble CA style communism]. Priszilla \\nThe greens will create a forest garden or permaculture. They will grow trees and bushes and herbacious plants and root plants.

Since carbon is way less than 0.05% of greenhouse gases and is NOT a poison or pollutant but is necessary for life (human, animal and plant) how is it that climate changers somehow conclude human activity is bad for the earth and life? Water vapor constitutes 95% of greenhouse gases. There is no historical evidence indicating warming periods followed increases in co2 emissions or in the atmosphere.

And why target catholics? obviously the liberals are the ones with all the money in this country. They own the media,hollywood,government,corporations and even the main internet sites like youtube/google. But following Jesus Christ and waking people up is what matters not ousting people. And stop tearing Christians apart by attacking Catholics who are Christians. Catholic church atleast has teachings that never change unlike unfortunately many protestant churches who are siding with liberalism and evil. Christians need to stick together to make the world a more peaceful and loving place with Jesus Christ! Ron Gilbert \\n\u201cCatholic church atleast has teachings that never change\u201d \\nThe Catholic Church has adopted many teachings from other religions through out history in order to make their religion more palatable. Take for example purgatory. You won\u2019t find it in the Bible but you will find it in other religions. How about when they taught that the Earth was both flat as well as the center of the universe (Galileo was excommunicated for teaching the opposite and then was \u201callowed\u201d into Heaven when the Catholic Church finally admitted their mistake \u2013 wouldn\u2019t God know his own creation?)? I could go on with this but it would only be rubbing salt into a wound. Needless to say, the Catholic Church does not represent God, never has. Their method of salvation is one of works while God says salvation is by grace through Jesus Christ alone. We work BECAUSE of our salvation not for it. True Catholic \\n\u201cThere are not a hundred people in America who hate the Catholic Church. There are millions of people who hate what they wrongly believe to be the Catholic Church.\u201d\u2013 Bishop Fulton Sheen.

BabylonUSA \\nThe Pilgrims, they came to America seeking religious freedom rather than \u201cobeying the queen of England\u201d\u2026 VigilanteCaregiver \\nWell yeah. I was being a little sarcastic\u2026 \\nAt the same time, if you look at English legal tradition there\u2019s always been a sense of the people having an established basis of liberty. Before the Roman invasion many communities elected their Chieftain for a set period of time. Before feudalism came in 1066, the English monarchy was more of an elected office with elected officers and magistrates. The Scottish Clan system was the same way. Whenever the monarch became a tyrant, the citizens usually ran him out or died trying. The idea of the Round Table came through this tradition. \\nThe Pilgrims (or Saints as they called themselves) were part of the Brownist Reformation movement. The King assumed Church and State powers during Henry VIII\u2019s bloody, psychotic reign and was continuing this non-traditional practice; throughout almost all of English history the King was subject to God, not able to pretend he was the spokesman for God and could force the people to his beliefs. In this view, the King was in violation of English legal tradition. user z \\nYou are comparing leaving a country to entering it illegally? Have trouble with common sense much?

How about starting with Andrew Jackson who infamously proclaimed the only good Indian was a dead one? How about getting Barry Hussein to take Jackson off the $20 instead of Hamilton, who opposed slavery, off the $10? That would be more productive. Or, try to address James Polk who pushed \u2018manifest destiny\u2019. Stay specific and you can have a meaningful conversation. Get caught in generalities and you will only sow the seeds of insults.

From the Wampanoag? user z \\nCommon sense would indicate that there was no established law or government when the pilgrims got here.

In Hampton Roags Virginia we put about 180 million gallons of water back into the ocean every day. We have a population of about 1.8 million. To supplement its recycled water, California should establish desalinization water plants. Also, California might find it advantageous to change its life style and to repent.

DJohn1 \\nCalifornia needs to follow the example of Israel. Using the water you got which is the Pacific Ocean. Use toilets that use little water. Up and down the entire Pacific Coast, figure out why rain is not coming. Then change the conditions causing the drought. Conservation might help in the planting of as many trees as is practical. Leaves from trees tend to preserve what water there is. Disney put together a project in which they drip feed water to plants. It needs to be put into place in California to preserve vegetation where possible. Everything done is accumulative and eventually it might even solve the problem. I look at it that it didn\u2019t just start suddenly. It has gone on for years. Now it is getting critical. The problem of drought will not go away suddenly either. It will take years to solve the problem. When natural things reverse then the state could end up flooded. Remember, who is really in charge. God can do miracles. California and surrounding areas needs to change. The change is going to be somewhat painful but necessary. There is some hidden cause that is preventing the rain from falling. That is what California has to discover before anything will work. jakartaman \\nAn angry GOD on the sodimites Gay Veteran \\nThe road of the Godly leads upward, leaving hell behind.

Gay Veteran \\nbilge from a tired old bigot Mark Odenbach \\nHigh End Solar drought solution for The Golden State. \\nThere is a technological solution to this problem. I don\u2019t even need credit for it, but it is my idea. \\nThe three, one mile square solar concentrating steam generating, electric power stations that are operating along Interstate 15 south of the state line between CA and NV are the way out of this mess. The boilers need to be modified to use ocean/salt water and to continually wash the concentrated brine with fresh salt water so as not to clog the boiler with salt. An area of perhaps 50 square miles should be set aside in the low area of the southwestern central valley, where there used to be a lake and the farmland is not as good as elsewhere. The brine handling solar power generating plants should be built in this area with the already existing piping and canals from the delta used to supply them with salt water from further out into the ocean. The solar plants boil the salt water and use the steam to make power from the sun, which makes the \u201cGreenies\u201d happy; the steam from the turbines is then condensed into pure water with the cold salt water coming into the plant which is warmed up a bit; the continuous flow of highly concentrated brine flushed out of the boilers is placed into evaporation ponds for salt and other mineral mining operations. A small fraction of the power generated by the plants is dedicated to run the delta pumps, the remainder is injected into the grid. The fresh condensed water is piped throughout the central valley to eliminate the water shortages CA will be experiencing. This is basically, solar desalinization with many additional benefits. This system is scalable and even more value can be derived with new technologies and innovations. \\nMark Odenbach \\nI have a house in phoenix i can let someone buy for 700k frank1569 \\nThere is only one solution: 1/2 the population needs to voluntarily move to another state ASAP.

When California runs dry, it will cause a large designed population shift out of the State. Many farmers will quit due to lack of crop water. (Actually this is a ready happening to my own family). My Granddaughter just moved out of California with her husband and family. Her husband has lived in Cal. all his life. Now they live in Washington State (great for us). \\nThis move out of California by the masses will allow big GMO food corporations to come in and buy up huge rich farming lands for pennies on the dollar, and that will eventually result in huge increase in food prices. Once done, the Government powers controlling the weather patterns will attempt to restore the ground water tables and weather in the state. The end result, more for the Corporations, and control by Government of the people. Control the water and you control the food, control the food and you control the people\u2026\u2026That\u2019s the end result, and a very simple plan. Done gradually so as to fool the masses, although it doesn\u2019t look very gradual to me if you look at the results of moving the weather toward the Eastern half of America. why bother \\nThe problem is \u201cwe the people,\u201d reproducing to create much more of us. Add to that the hideous large stucco boxes. And the fallacious idea that our houses and quality of life either will keep improving or at least stay the same, forever. Then I say: Detroit. The number one reason against planning on staying in any one community for a generation is the Detroit example. It can happen anywhere. I like the song \u201cTom Sawyer,\u201d by Rush for many reasons. But one of my favorite lines is appropriate here. \u201cHe knows changes aren\u2019t permanent but change is.\u201d So if you cannot expect living conditions to remain idyllic for more than twenty years then why should someone buy California real estate? A Dodgy Bloke \\nOnly an American would think of putting a water fountain in a desert. As I said several times the South West of the US was never designed to support this number of people. I was only a matter of time before the water ran out. Even if the wet period had continued it was only a matter of time before reality reared it\u2019s ugly head. Now it California next it will Las Vegas, Phoenix, Reno so on. Walter Ruggieri \\nAs long as jobs are here, people will stay and they will import water or finally build a desalinization plant. But\u2026 once the jobs dry up and real estate prices drop, they will begin to move in mass. Maybe other states need to begin to develop California migration contingencies? David Wilson \\nTime to get serious, California. First thing I\u2019d do right now is make lawns illegal, unless they\u2019re made of plastic. And that includes parks, golf clubs and all those road side verges in suburbia. People should replace them with something more appropriate to a Mediterranean/semi-desert climate. If you don\u2019t get radical now the economy could implode in a few years time if the drought continues and water supplies run out. Philip Botwinick \\nThe Israelis are also good at behaving towards the Palestinians much like the Germans/Nazis did towards the Jews prior to the implementation of the Final Solution in 1941. \\nCan Israel function without the funds from the USA, the Christian Right and many of the fearful Jews?

When you write those kinds of question, it just looks like fea-rmongering to me. The emotive, overwrought silly questions just assume we\u2019re fools. We ALL know how serious this is.

Your comments are, as usual, out of context of the topic\u2026 you just want to show to all of us how great you are at using English\u2026 get over yourself. why bother \\nI work and rent in Orange County, California. I notice Irvine is all green still. Is the Irvine Company immune from the water rules? I am a legal resident in Arizona and I cannot imagine where Californians could afford to go. They need jobs. Their employers would have to move first before the Californians can move. For instance, the national HQ of Toyota moved from California to Texas. Some other big corporation (I am not at liberty to say) employing at least 10,000 people in California has been talking about consolidating in Texas out of California in five years. I am thinking the plans might move quicker than five years, because of the severe drought. I have a place to stay in Arizona, but no job there. I do have a lot of savings because I prepared for crises, and am 12 years from retirement. So I can sit out a few years and find some way to make money again after the drought finishes off what the socialists destroyed in California. Philip Botwinick \\nNot only is Irvine exempt, for the time being (I\u2019m being sarcastic), but big ag and big oil are completely exempt (this I\u2019m being serious about). \\nGot to keep those walnuts growing.

Call it the Interstate Drought System, similar to the Interstate Highway System. Is everybody in California just stupid? All that water in the Great Lakes, and golf courses in California will soon be brown. And the amount of fresh water in Canada is staggering. Somebody out there should try and business develop a solution. Philip Botwinick \\nYeah, that\u2019s right. The Great Lakes where fertilizer run off have created an algae situation. \\nMy god where are the critical thinkers? Elmo Fudginputz \\nCritical thinkers? Well you aren\u2019t one of them, notwithstanding your fantasy and personal problems. Algae situation? Almost all fresh waterer lakes have algae. Did you know most municipalities actually treat their water pathogens and impurities before sending it on to the public? They let folks like you over at Oaklawn sanitarium actually have access to computers? Briarpatch \\nCritical thinkers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026THAT\u2019S rich coming from you! Dave Wilbur \\nThe solution for water in California. ALL accurate economic, gastronomic, medical, political and military thinking has to be based on government having unlimited funds while no money goes to Washington as taxes. How can this be? Nobel Laureate, Paul Samuelson said the Federal Reserve is an \u201comnipotent counterfeiter\u201d and the Federal Reserve in 1977 and 1979 said their system \u201cworks only with credit.\u201d They also said: \u201cThe Federal Reserve in cooperation with the federal government has the inherent power to create money. This power makes technical bankruptcy out of the question.\u201d They should just create whatever amount of credit needed to build sufficient desalinization plants to convert sea water to drinking water without use of taxes. The facts stated here make continuous wars possible. Let\u2019s stop the destructive wars and construct all of the pure water plants needed. Philip Botwinick \\nLike that\u2019s really going to happen. \\nGet real. nobody \\nNice, you can\u2019t even paste a working link. Nevermind, i found your source by myself. But unlike you i checked who they are and surprise surprise, they are one of the mouthpieces of the industry. So yea, about that source, time for a new one unless you still want to be seen as a gullible moron. May i suggest the official government statistics? BTW, i thought that the picture on my account would be enough to clarify its origin, apparently you aren\u2019t smart enough for that. Oh well, nothing new here.

How nice not to have to care about what California thinks, and I use the term loosely. Hart Shepherd \\nPhilip, followed the link and read the article. Seems like a valid reductionist point of view. However any dichotomy between free will and determinism is a false dichotomy at best as is all of existence. You just have to learn to take the good with the bad. As they say, every dying dog has it\u2019s day. John Blythe \\nLet me tell you Michael about the situation in my home town of Lake Isabella which is just about 30 miles due northeast of Bakersfield, the most southern city in the central valley. Lake Isabella, once the largest lake in the southern California region with 40 miles of shoreline has become nothing but a puddle of water now. There are a few factors including the drought situation as well as the fact that the lake\u2019s main dam has to be retrofitted for state earthquake seismic requirements, however the lake levels have had a huge damaging affect on the local economy. Lake Isabella (sometimes referred to as Kern Valley if you count all eight towns that surround the lake) was a nice rural area and a getaway destination for city folks in L.A., Orange County and the Inland Empire. People used to love to come up to the lake every summer to wind surf, boating, jet ski, fish, camp etc.. We\u2019re also a popular tourist destination for European travelers because the lake is a gateway to the Giant Sequoia Tree Monument and Death Valley National Park which foreigners love to visit. \\nBut now all that has drastically changed. The valley recently had its annual Lake Isabella Fishing Derby (one of the largest trout derbies in the U.S.) and admissions were down substantially which they anticipated anyway and last summer was some of the worst on record for local businesses and it is no doubt going to be an even worse summer season come June. Because the rapid decline in tourism and recreation that feeds the local economy every year, we now have a bigger problem: drug addicts and criminals are moving into the area. Even worse, because of Kern County\u2019s budget problems, Lake Isabella\u2019s police force has been drastically cut. In the last year, people have had their property vandalized, homes that have been broken into, property stolen. \\nPeople who see the decline in tourism due to the lake level going down are now moving out of the area and their vacant homes they put up for sale are now being \u201cmoved in\u201d by squatters and meth addicts, as Kern County has a major meth epidemic. As a result, real estate companies in Lake Isabella are loosing money on homes that were originally valued for the market. I can\u2019t tell you how awful this has impacted a once quiet rural area and popular summer destination in Southern California. Its like Lake Isabella has become a \u2018mini version\u2019 of Detroit. Vacant homes are now decaying and crumbling, drug users are now out on the streets, we\u2019ve had a larger influx of transients and obvious criminals from Bakersfield and Delano that were released due to State budget problems with the penal system recently; and businesses that have been here for decades are now closing and moving out. The local police and even media in Kern County are reluctant to admit this stuff, in fact the police department I think is so ashamed of what has been happening lately, they seldom even report some of the most obvious drug busts or arrests that should be reported in the local papers, but they don\u2019t report, in fear of what the public would think. But the truth is, the public already knows what is really going on. Hart Shepherd \\nYou think California is on the Atlantic ocean and we\u2019re stupid? Hart Shepherd \\nAl Gore is a douchebag. AGW is a myth. Yes, the climate changes but the primary driver is the sun\u2019s movement around the periphery of the galaxy, and it looks more like we are heading for much colder temps than any of us have seen in our lifetimes. piccadillybabe \\nToo bad they did not get on the desalinization band wagon a long time ago. If they had, they would have developed technology that produced beautiful pure water, was energy efficient and affordable by now. In America, we are real good at wasting our resources without thinking about the future. Chuck \\nEveryone will eventually move out of california since they will will run out of all water. Hot Rain \\nI\u2019ve been hearing this for 30 years. In Vegas we\u2019re always \u201cgonna run out of water\u201d. It was just political BS. There has to be a clever way to raise food prices. And water prices. Unfortunately, food commodities are now traded and investors want returns. That, coupled with weather anomalies around the globe will make basic food unaffordable. The Feds know all of this, that is why they hold off on raising interest rates. When interest rates start going up, food will shoot the moon. As will everything else. Scared Economist \\nHave you taken a drive out to Lake Mead lately? Have you seen how low the water level is? And it\u2019s dropping further by the day.

LA ran out of water in the early 1900\u2019s but they kept building acquaducts and importing from the Colorado River as does Nevada and Arizona. This is the arid West and much inhabitable. In the end the earth always wins over mans folly. Rebel in Idaho \\nthey could go back to mexico and take the liberals with them. quercus454 \\nIt\u2019s the numbers. Something that the politicians can\u2019t seem to grasp. Immigration both legal and illegal is the driving force behind US population growth. Immigrants and their children are near 80% of California\u2019s increase of people. For every new added person it takes during their lifetime the development of 25 acres of undeveloped land. Those acres include expansion of waste facilities, infrastructure /roads/schools, consumer outlets, food production and increased government facilities. As one does the math, the amount of land needed to support the additional people becomes staggering. Increased numbers also drive up the cost of other dwindling resources. Energy, water, food, taxes also increase. Services like healthcare become stretched beyond their capacity. The ability of the US to increase it\u2019s population and sustain current levels of quality of life is impossible. California is the canary in the mine. If we do not stop the current rate of population growth, the US will see horrific conditions unheard of in this country before. Like a life boat, once filled to capacity, the addition of more people make conditions for everyone worse. Fat Hubie \\nSeal the border of California and force them to move to Mexico\u2026!

WE ALSO have a really bad drought, NO SNOW PACKS, NO SNOW this year, and not enough rain to grow our crops.Our farmers are desperate, BUT I recommend that drought states start to regularly SEED OVER CAST CLOUDS to get rain! START to use science on the weather! WE HAVE THE SCIENCE. They seeded over cast clouds in the past to get rain; do it again. Science is far enough ahead, we can fiddle with the weather; California needs to use it\u2019s technology, and start getting rain, clouds, atmospheric changes and we KNOW the chemistry.Oregon in the Willamette Valley has much over cast clouds; make them rain! And CA, get your science companies to conjur up chemically made weather. It CAN be done. Tom \\nWhy doesn\u2019t our government invest in plants that remove salt from ocean waters.

DixieAngel_76 \\nI\u2019ve got a few questions for Governor Moonbeam, Lynn Wilson and the UN; first off, why are we allowing in new immigrants when there\u2019s not enough water for those of us who were here first? Second, will those people be the first to be made to leave, and will it be back over the border? Third, and most important is who gets to decide who leaves and who stays, and what happens to people who do not wish to leave their property behind? Fran \\nSend them to Mexico!

Mary \\nMy concern is what happens to desperate people who will be forced to migrate east- no jobs, no money. What happens to the communities and infrastructure of peaceful and relatively crime-free towns as these people descend upon them? Let\u2019s say only 10% leave Cali- that\u2019s still almost 4 million people looking for a new place to live. Who will leave- the richest or the poorest? What happens when a half million dollar home is now worth nothing? \\nI imagine the poor have the least to lose, will hop on the California Zephyr et al, and start being deposited across the rest of the US. drleonus \\nWhere are the savvy investors who will create the jobs needed to build three massive pipelines stretching across the country- this is a national problem after all \u2013 bringing snowmelt from the eastern seabboard, rain runoff from the midwest, and water from the Great lakes to dump all of it into the Lake Mead Sistern. The Pipelines will have giant logos on them, built from private investments funders: Koch Brothers, Google, Bill gates, Chevron,Netflix. Every state gets a chunk of the profits as the water passes through their states. Think of the billion of dollars invested and reaped from a massive project like this. Seems like a crazy proposition, no more crazy than a Las Vegas sucking up all the water to be an artificial city in the desert built on 1930\u2019s hubris? O, and powering our homes with water? That\u2019s go to stop immediately. Another 1930\u2019s infrastructural by gone way of doing things. Thankyou.

MeJane \\nThe so called mega drought is being advanced by the very same people as the climate alarmism community, which we know is more of a hoax and political movement of taxation and control than science. I\u2019d like to see the science used and I am sure it is \u201cclimate models\u201d, which are predictions and not reliable \u201cscience\u201d given the poor performance of climate models to date, we should be very skeptical of any climate modeling projections \u2014 and we certainly should not be basing any policy on the models. Plus a rainy winter \\nI say this because I live in So. Cal and we had not even heard of this drought until two years ago and when we did it hear about it was touted \u201csuddenly\u201d by our very liberal Governor as \u201cthe worst drought in history\u201d. There is no doubt that the last four years had been dry but we\u2019ve had other periods that had been just as dry and for much longer without the hysterical doom saying. If the drought was so severe was the why didn\u2019t he insist on conservation when drought first began? Why is he NOT appropriating and supporting dam building that is already voted on as a priority over the idiotic and wildly expensive high speed rail if this were such a deadly emergency? Water is a necessity of life, railroads to nowhere are not, this does not add up. Plus we\u2019ve had a rainy winter and spring, but there is never a dent in the drought? Why aren\u2019t desalination plants going up, we are next to an ocean. Brown ordered mandatory water use reductions for the four year drought by 25 percent reduction on the state\u2019s 400 local water supply agencies, the state\u2019s agencies will be responsible for coming up with restrictions to cut back on water use and for monitoring compliance to enforce punitive measures, including FINES. Brown wants to fine big water wasters up to $10,000 per day. I have no problem with conserving and do so even when we aren\u2019t in a drought but something is off here when for 4 years this has been a problem but not one plan other than conservation and fines in the fourth year of a mega drought has been addressed or will be addressed. This is about revenue, alarmist global warming BS, we\u2019re in a drought, it is not the end of the world.
