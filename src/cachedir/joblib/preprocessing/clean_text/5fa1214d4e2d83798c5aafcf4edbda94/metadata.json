Sanders was correct. Elections are supposed to be contests about ideas and visions for the future. However, the Republican Party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts, and hopes for visions. \\nTrump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory. \\nIt takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles. Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office. \\nThe media will never say it, but real candidates for office don\u2019t try to win by discouraging people from voting. The best candidates get people excited to vote and play their vital role in the democratic process. \\nBernie Sanders gets it. Donald Trump never will.'"}, "time": 1742561630.0733702}
