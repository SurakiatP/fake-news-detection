The United States wants its troops in position by June. \\nLondon is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. \\n\u201cAlthough we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO,\u201d Fallon said. \\nSYRIAN SHADOW \\nOthers NATO allies joined the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Canada said it was sending 450 troops to Latvia, joined by 140 military personnel from Italy. \\nGermany said it was sending between 400 and 600 troops to Lithuania, with additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. \\nStoltenberg said allies\u2019 commitments would be \u201ca clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.\u201d Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. \\nFor the Kremlin, the U.S.-led alliance\u2019s plans are already too much given Russia\u2019s grievances at NATO\u2019s expansion eastwards, although Stoltenberg denied going too far. \\nBut NATO\u2019s troop announcements in the Baltic states and Poland were partly overshadowed by the dispute about whether Spain should refuel the Russian warships, which was later resolved by Moscow\u2019s decision to withdraw its request. \\nNATO\u2019s tensions with Russia have been building since Crimea and the West\u2019s decision to impose retaliatory sanctions. \\nBut the breakdown of a U.S-Russia brokered ceasefire in Syria on Oct. 3, followed by U.S. accusations that Russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election, have signaled a worsening of ties. \\nEven before the break down of the Syrian ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria. \\n(Additional reporting by Sabine Siebold; Editing by Tom Heneghan)'"}, "time": 1742564022.0719721}
