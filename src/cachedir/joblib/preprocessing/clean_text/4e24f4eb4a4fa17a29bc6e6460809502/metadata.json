[Speaking to a packed ballroom at the Bellagio conference center on the Las Vegas Strip, the former vice president, who himself declined to run for president, said he believes Clinton was not the \u201ccorrect\u201d candidate, but he was.  \u201cI never thought she was the correct candidate,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI thought I was the correct candidate. \u201d The audience erupted into applause. The Salt Conference is an annual gathering of private equity leaders here in Las Vegas, organized by SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci, last cycle, supported   Donald Trump. Biden declined to run for president last cycle after the death of his son. \u201cNo man or woman should announce for the presidency unless they genuinely believe that for that moment in the nation\u2019s history they are the most qualified person to deal with the issues facing the country,\u201d Biden also said. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in 2015 in his Trump Tower office, Trump said he expected to face Biden in the general election if Biden ran since Clinton had so many problems. \u201cI think Hillary has got huge problems right now,\u201d Trump said then, adding: \u201cIs she going to make it? I hear this thing is big league. Why did she do it? You use the server? Because they\u2019re always looking to go over the edge, whether it\u2019s Whitewater or anything else. They always want to go over the edge. I\u2019m just looking at it saying, \u2018What the hell was she doing?\u2019 You know what she was doing. She was guarding from the president seeing what she was doing. \u201d Biden did not run, Clinton got the nomination, and Trump smoked her on Election Day in the electoral college.'"}, "time": 1742628579.5371907}
