As agreed, the wall will go along the entire U.S. Mexico border.\u201d \\nUnbeknownst to Trump, he did not specify how tall the wall should be, and when he finds out the wall will only be three feet high, he is sure to hit the roof. \\n\u201cThat is a minor detail we did not reveal to Se\u00f1or Trump. The wall will be three feet high but it will fulfil our contract, and there is nothing the Don can do about it. Even an eight year old kid can jump over,\u201d the Mexican president added. \\nTrump was not available for immediate comment when contacted.'"}, "time": 1742564575.9135182}
