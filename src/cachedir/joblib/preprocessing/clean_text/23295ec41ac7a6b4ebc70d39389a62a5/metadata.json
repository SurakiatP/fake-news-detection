He decided he deserved a raise. With soccer in crisis and an unprecedented scandal beginning to boil, Mr. Blatter  \u2014   who had just won   to a record fifth   term  \u2014   signed a new employment contract that increased his salary to $3 million a year and guaranteed him a $12 million bonus if he completed his mandate. That arrangement, completed just as FIFA was plunging into organizational chaos, was one of many instances in which three of FIFA\u2019s top officials arranged over five years to pay themselves more than $80 million, according to an internal investigation of world soccer\u2019s governing body by the American law firm Quinn Emanuel. It was the latest in a series of   accusations about a culture of corruption pervading FIFA. For years, top soccer officials have been accused of using bribes and payoffs to profit from their roles overseeing the billions of dollars FIFA and other governing bodies generate through tournaments like the World Cup. But in the past year, dozens of soccer officials  \u2014   though not the three accused Friday  \u2014   have been charged with fraud, racketeering and money laundering in a broad corruption investigation led by the United States Justice Department. On Friday, lawyers from Quinn Emanuel, which was hired by FIFA in the wake of last year\u2019s arrests, published a synopsis of some of the findings of their own investigation. In it, they identified three former FIFA officials  \u2014   Mr. Blatter and his former deputies J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke and Markus Kattner  \u2014   as having mounted a \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to enrich themselves through a series of raises, bonuses and other payments. The three were also accused of modifying the termination clauses in their employment contracts to ensure that they would receive   payouts even if they were fired for cause. \u201cThey had the authority they needed,\u201d Quinn Emanuel investigators wrote of Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner, \u201cand they simply told payroll and HR, the department generally in charge for employment contracts at FIFA and which reported to Mr. Kattner, how much should be paid out and to whom. \u201d In a statement responding to the accusations, Mr. Blatter\u2019s lawyer, Richard Cullen, said Friday, \u201cWe look forward to showing FIFA that Mr. Blatter\u2019s compensation payments were proper, fair and in line with the heads of major professional sports leagues around the world. \u201d Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner did not immediately respond to FIFA\u2019s statement. None of the three men currently work for FIFA. Mr. Blatter was barred from soccer by FIFA in December and replaced by a new president, Gianni Infantino, in an election in February. FIFA suspended Mr. Valcke, Mr. Blatter\u2019s longtime deputy, last fall and fired him in January amid accusations of corruption. Mr. Valcke was replaced temporarily as secretary general by FIFA\u2019s finance director, Mr. Kattner. That effectively placed Mr. Kattner in control of FIFA\u2019s finances in the months leading to this year\u2019s presidential election, but he, too, was fired, in May, after FIFA said it had discovered he had breached his fiduciary duty to the organization. The accusations by FIFA and its lawyers seemed intended to paint a picture of a leadership group operating outside FIFA financial controls: \u25a0 In 2010, Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner were awarded $23 million in retroactive bonuses for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that FIFA said were not called for under their employment agreements. \u25a0 In 2011, with Mr. Blatter in a contested election for the FIFA presidency, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner were given   contract extensions that included guarantees that they would receive full payment of their salaries if they lost their jobs, a likely outcome under a new president. \u25a0 That same year, Mr. Blatter received a bonus of 12 million Swiss francs (about $12 million) for overseeing the 2014 World Cup. \u25a0 In May 2015, only days after the arrests of several of their colleagues in Zurich, Mr. Blatter, who signed a contract in 2008 that paid him 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) a year, executed a new contract that increased his salary to about $3 million and included the prospect of another performance bonus of $12 million if he completed his term. A day after that, Mr. Kattner\u2019s contract was extended four years  \u2014   through December 2023  \u2014   and modified to include a clause that he be paid in full even if he was fired. In its statement, FIFA dryly labeled the timing of that contract extension \u201cnoteworthy. \u201d The details of Quinn Emanuel\u2019s investigation deflected attention  \u2014   at least momentarily  \u2014   away from two other FIFA stories this week: the news that the Swiss attorney general\u2019s office had conducted a new raid on FIFA headquarters in Zurich on Friday as part of a continuing investigation into possible corruption, and recent issues regarding transparency that have plagued Mr. Infantino. Earlier this week, a German newspaper reported that Mr. Infantino had worked behind the scenes to marginalize FIFA\u2019s independent auditor in a leadership power struggle. That situation came to light when the auditor, Domenico Scala, abruptly resigned at FIFA\u2019s recent Congress in Mexico, saying that Mr. Infantino and others had orchestrated a change in FIFA\u2019s bylaws that shifted the power to hire and fire the independent ethics officials with FIFA\u2019s new governing council  \u2014   a body led by Mr. Infantino. FIFA has defended Mr. Infantino by saying the shift was done to protect the organization against the possibility it might be unable to separate itself from individuals who come under investigation, but the assertion seemed to run counter to Mr. Infantino\u2019s professed support for reform and his stated goal of greater separation of powers at FIFA. Then this week came the German report, which said that Mr. Infantino had instructed FIFA staff members to delete recordings of an executive session in which removing Mr. Scala had been discussed. Mr. Scala, as part of his role leading the audit and compliance committee, also was responsible for setting Mr. Infantino\u2019s salary  \u2014   a process that reportedly had gone poorly, with Mr. Infantino describing Mr. Scala\u2019s initial proposal of a $2 million salary as \u201cinsulting. \u201d All of this comes as FIFA tries to emerge from the worst corruption scandal in its history, a period which began just over a year ago when more than a dozen soccer and sports marketing officials with ties to soccer\u2019s global governing body were arrested in predawn raids before a FIFA meeting in Zurich. Several have pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the United States, including more FIFA executives arrested in a second Zurich raid in December. Many of those executives held top posts in the FIFA led by Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner, so it was not surprising that more detailed allegations against the three men might emerge. In its news release on Friday, FIFA and its lawyers accused Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner of working together to bulk up their compensation in agreements as far back as 2007. The evidence, the lawyers said, revealed breaches of fiduciary duty and also raised questions about FIFA\u2019s internal financial controls, especially the role of its compensation subcommittee. It was unclear whether all the salary and bonuses were paid and if FIFA would seek to recover any of it. FIFA said that all of the contracts would face further investigation, and that it had shared its findings with the Swiss attorney general\u2019s office and would do the same with the Justice Department.'"}, "time": 1742563575.5582871}
