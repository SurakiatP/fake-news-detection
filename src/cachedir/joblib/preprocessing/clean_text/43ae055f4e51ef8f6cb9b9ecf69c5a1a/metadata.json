He has acknowledged killing before  \u2014   in 2015, he said that he had killed at least three men suspected of kidnapping and rape in Davao City  \u2014   but his remarks on Monday appeared to be his first such public admission since he became president. When he was mayor of Davao City, Mr. Duterte was known to carry a . 38 pistol and was accused of overseeing a death squad to kill people suspected of being criminals. As president, he has led a nationwide \u201cwar on drugs\u201d by the police and vigilante groups, which has left more than 3, 000 people dead. Hours earlier on Monday, Mr. Duterte spoke at an awards ceremony in Manila, where he said, \u201cI am not a killer,\u201d and then threatened to kill police officers who disobeyed him. \u201cI do not relish or enjoy a Filipino sprawled there with all the blood,\u201d he said, according to the Philippine Star. \u201cWith regard to the killing of persons on bended knees, with hands tied behind their back, that\u2019s not ours. Will that make you a better soldier or policeman? If they do that, I\u2019ll shoot them. \u201d Though he has led a brutal crackdown on drug addicts, Mr. Duterte seemed to imply in his remarks to the business leaders that he had overused an addictive drug himself. Speaking in English, Mr. Duterte said he had been prescribed the powerful painkiller fentanyl because of chronic back pain and migraine headaches. \u201cI was only given a fourth of that square thing,\u201d he said, describing a patch containing the drug that was to be applied to the nape of his neck. \u201cThere was a time that if I took two  \u2014   of course, my doctor learned that I was using the whole patch, because I felt better. \u201d The Philippine Star posted a video of the speech online. A   hit man told a Philippine Senate committee in September, as part of an inquiry into extrajudicial killings in Davao City, that Mr. Duterte had personally ordered the killing of citizens when he was mayor. In October, Mr. Duterte compared himself to Hitler, saying that he would be \u201chappy to slaughter\u201d three million drug addicts.'"}, "time": 1742561776.7347374}
