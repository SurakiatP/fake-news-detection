I\u2019ve always said I would put him in simply because he elevated not one but two baseball cultures: the losing Red Sox who had a loser\u2019s mentality and the irrelevant Arizona Diamondbacks. He led both to World Series titles, and I think he changed the culture. Curt Schilling, though, you can argue like a Mike Mussina, if he is not a Hall of Famer, he\u2019s darn close. \u201d He continued, \u201cSchilling has now gone on social media and become a little unhinged and has been, what I would say, a little inappropriate. There is nowhere a voter is asked to consider somebody\u2019s   personality. In fact, the rules say voting shall be based upon the player\u2019s record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the team on which the player played. It says nothing about once you retire. \u201d According to Cowherd, these agendas by the media only contribute to the public\u2019s lack of trust. \u201cThis is how you lose the trust of the public  \u2014   when you start voting on things you\u2019re not asked to consider and you have an agenda,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t like what Curt Schilling said about the media, but I know I\u2019m not asked to consider it voting for the hall of fame. It never says, \u2018Consider   integrity.\u2019 It never says that. It says consider it on your team or plural teams. If you didn\u2019t consider it with Jackie Robinson and Ty Cobb, don\u2019t go political with Curt Schilling. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563725.3989909}
