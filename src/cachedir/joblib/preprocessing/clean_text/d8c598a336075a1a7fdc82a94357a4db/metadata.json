[One week after its March 6 debut, The Leather Special had received hundreds of   reviews from Netflix members. Schumer responded to the backlash Wednesday on her Instagram account, quoting a news report from Splitsider that claims hundreds of trolls purposefully flooded her comedy special with negative reviews.  \u201cThe alt right organized trolls attack everything I do. Read the @splitsider article,\u201d the Trainwreck star wrote. \u201cThey organize to get my ratings down. Meeting in sub Reddit rooms. They tried on my book and movies and tv show. And I want to thank them. \u201d Schumer also chided journalists for reporting on the news that her Netflix special is a critical dud. \u201cI am only alarmed by the people printing their organized trolling as \u2018news.\u2019 [T]his is what the current administration wants,\u201d she said. \u201cJournalists do better it\u2019s embarrassing. \u201d  I am so proud of my special and grateful to all the people spreading love on line about it. I am the first female comic who is selling out arenas all over the world and so grateful for that. I am embarrassed for the \u201djournalists\u201d who report on trolls activities as if it\u2019s news. It\u2019s indicative of administration right now. Anyone who reported that \u201dviewers aren\u2019t happy\u201d with my special, it would have been cool if you did a moment of research before posting. The alt right organized trolls attack everything I do. Read the @splitsider article. They organize to get my ratings down. Meeting in sub Reddit rooms. They tried on my book and movies and tv show And I want to thank them. It makes me feel so powerful and dangerous and brave. It reminds me what I\u2019m saying is effective and bring more interest to my work and their obsession with me keeps me going. I am only alarmed by the people printing their organized trolling as \u201dnews\u201d this is what the current administration wants. So this post has nothing against the trolls. I thank you trolls so much. It fills me with hope and power to see you all furiously posting so as always accuse me of whatever lies you want. Call me a whale. Call me a thief and I will continue to rise and fight and lead. I know who I am. I am strong and beautiful and will use my voice my whole time on this earth. Journalists do better it\u2019s embarrassing. Trolls see you on the next one! \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 A post shared by @amyschumer on Mar 15, 2017 at 9:28am PDT,  \u201cI thank you trolls so much,\u201d the comedian added. \u201cIt fills me with hope and power to see you all furiously posting so as always accuse me of whatever lies you want.

For example, Schumer\u2019s Netflix special currently holds a 4. 4 out of 10 rating on The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)  \u2014   down from 5. 5 less than a week ago. The Leather Special is also showing a 22% audience score of viewers who \u201cliked it\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews from television critics have also been lukewarm. The Los Angeles Times\u2018 Lorraine Ali writes that the special features Schumer\u2019s signature brand of dirty humor, but \u201cironically, the dirtier it gets, the less daring it feels. \u201d \u201c\u2018The Leather Special\u2019 not only relies on many of those familiar and explicit themes, but kicks it all up a notch so there\u2019s more of it  \u2014   with more frequency and extremities. And as it turns out, that\u2019s not a good thing,\u201d she wrote. Meanwhile, Newsday\u2019s Verne Gay gave the special a \u201cC\u201d grade. \u201cIt\u2019s all there. She\u2019s all there. Every bit of her,\u201d Gay wrote. \u201cAs usual, it\u2019s mostly also all one subject, or variations on that subject, along with every imaginable word to describe that subject, along with some physical pantomime or gesture to add texture and meaning to this subject, just in case the words themselves didn\u2019t quite suffice.
