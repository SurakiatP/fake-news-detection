[Sessions\u2019 remark came when Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin claimed Sessions would not support a \u201chumane\u201d rewrite of the nation\u2019s immigration law. \u201cThere\u2019s not a spot of evidence in your career to suggest that as Attorney General you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner,\u201d Durbin said to Sessions. \u201cTell me I\u2019m wrong. \u201d  \u201cWell, you are wrong, Senator Durbin,\u201d Sessions replied, adding: I\u2019m going to follow the laws passed by Congress. As a matter of policy, we disagreed on some of those issues. I do believe that if you continually go through a cycle of amnesty that you undermine the respect for the law and encourage more illegal immigration into America. I believe the American people spoke clearly in this election. I believe they agreed with my basic view. Throughout the 2016 election, the American people rejected multiple candidates who ran on a position of immigration amnesty in favor of a now   Donald Trump, whom Sessions endorsed and who was vocal about his desire to enforce U. S. immigration law. In addition, the American people have considered and rejected various amnesty proposals on multiple occasions, including in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. Ken Palinkas, the former head of the nation\u2019s immigration caseworkers \u2014  Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014  has warned that the DREAM Act proposals to give amnesty to illegal aliens who allegedly came to the U. S. as minors, a policy which has been championed by Durbin, would expand birthright citizenship to include the   (today it is applied to the U. S.  children of illegal immigrants). Palinkas has explained that DREAMer amnesty \u201cextend[s] birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries\u201d and represents a promise of \u201cperpetual amnesty. \u201d Palinkas has argued that the concept of DREAMers was intended to create a permanent loophole to U. S. borders. In other Western countries all foreign nationals illegally residing in the country are subject to immigration laws. In the United States, however, the   DREAMer population was created in order to effectively carve out a sector of the illegal alien population who are exempt from immigration law. During his Tuesday confirmation hearing, Sessions went on to tell the Committee that the American people are entitled to a lawful system of immigration that advances their best interests. \u201cIt\u2019s a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for the United States of America that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country, and if they\u2019re get accepted, they get in. If they\u2019re not accepted, they don\u2019t get it. And I believe that\u2019s right, and just, and the American people are right to ask for it. We have not delivered that for them,\u201d Sessions said. Sessions\u2019 declaration is remarkably similar to prior statements made by civil rights champion and   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who argued in favor of immigration control and explained that, \u201ccredibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in those who should be kept out, are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave. \u201d Throughout the hearing, Sessions\u2019 emphasized that it is the role of Congress to implement policies supported by the American electorate. \u201cThe best thing for us to do,\u201d Sessions said, \u201c[is] let\u2019s fix this system and then we can work together after this lawlessness has been ended and then we can ask the American people and enter into a dialogue about how to compassionately treat people who have been here a long time. \u201d \u201cI had a responsibility as a member of this body to express my view and vote as I believed was correct on dealing with issues of immigration,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the Attorney General\u2019s role. The Attorney General\u2019s role is to enforce the law. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562407.5110488}
