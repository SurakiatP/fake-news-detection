Please note: We will pause for Presidents\u2019 Day and be back on Tuesday. For a couple of weeks each February, Yosemite\u2019s Horsetail Fall puts on a show when the setting sun appears to transform its ribbon of water down the face of El Capitan into glowing lava. That\u2019s if conditions cooperate. The phenomenon only works when the sun is lined up just so, the skies are clear and the mountains are snowy enough to fuel the waterfall. A bit of mist whipped up by the wind helps to get the full effect. Pamela Marcelino, a Postal Service worker in San Francisco, made the drive to Yosemite last Saturday to capture the   firefall. More than 150 other photographers were there, cameras poised, she said. \u201cAnd you just wait for that moment, holding your breath,\u201d Ms. Marcelino, 41, said. Then, the   glow fades in gradually, peaks and fades out in a matter of roughly 10 minutes. And it\u2019s over. Since last weekend, photographers have been posting dozens of their images to Instagram. Here are a handful that they shared with us: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 Rain will continue today, with central and southern parts of the state facing heavy rain, flash floods and potential mudslides in some neighborhoods.

[The New York Times] This May marks 80 years since the Golden Gate Bridge opened, but today is a darker anniversary: Eighty years ago, 10 laborers fell from the bridge to their deaths, breaking what Life magazine called a \u201chistoric record\u201d of safety at a construction site. Up until that day, just one worker had died  \u2014   remarkable for a time when the rule of thumb in construction was to assume one death for every $1 million spent. The bridge cost $35 million, or about $590 million in today\u2019s dollars. The bridge\u2019s nearly perfect record was due to the obsession with safety protocols from its chief engineer, Joseph Strauss, along with an innovation he brought that was   in 1930s construction: a safety net to catch falling workers. Nineteen workers fell to the net while the bridge was being built, forming what they called the \u201cHalf Way to Hell Club. \u201d But on Feb. 17, scaffolding on the side of the bridge fell and ripped through the net, taking the 10 laborers with it. A plaque near the bridge honors the men who died.  \u2014   Tim Herrera Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here. California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
