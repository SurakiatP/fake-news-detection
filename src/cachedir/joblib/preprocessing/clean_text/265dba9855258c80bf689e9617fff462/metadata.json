According to Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the refusal was made in response to being threatened with sanctions. \u201cWe can never do business under this kind of blackmail,\u201d said Rutte, expressing amazement that family affairs minster Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya attempted to circumvent the Dutch ban on Turkish politicians campaigning in the Netherlands by bringing a fleet of ministerial cars across the German border, which the European Union\u2019s borderless Schengen Area leaves unprotected. \u201cWe drew a red line,\u201d he said, explaining why Kaya was escorted back to the German border  \u2014   a move which prompted Erdo\u011fan to denounce the Dutch as \u201cfascists\u201d and \u201cNazi remnants\u201d. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim vowed there would be \u201ca stronger reprisal against the unacceptable treatment toward Turkey and ministers who have diplomatic immunity\u201d on Sunday afternoon. \u201cOur   European friends who speak of democracy, freedom of expression and human rights have failed their class,\u201d he declared. It is not yet clear what form Turkish reprisals will take, but foreign minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu has hinted the country may open its borders and allow illegal migrants to flood into Europe.
