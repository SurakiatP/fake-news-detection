The leaders and people of Europe have decided not to stop their arrival. Light on action, the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival, particularly how Europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion. \\nAfter all your help\u2014all the seeds, and drugs, and technology\u2014[migrants] found it so much simpler just to say, \u2018Here\u2019s my son, here\u2019s my daughter. Take them. Take me. Take us all to your country.\u2019 And the idea caught on. You thought it was fine. You encouraged it, organized it. But now it\u2019s too big, now it\u2019s out of your hands. It\u2019s a flood. A deluge. And it\u2019s out of control. [\u2026] \\nYou\u2019ve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth, right in the heart of the white world, just to destroy it. That\u2019s what you\u2019re after. You want to destroy our world, our whole way of life. \\nRaspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce non-white migrants. Well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated, Raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be, as if he was reading into a crystal ball. He even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis . \\nAnd all at once whole sections of New York are deserted, a score of American cities watch the flight to the suburbs\u2014and half the historic Paris pavement too\u2014American tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind, tubercular Gauls flee in droves from our open-air clinics. \u2026 Tally-ho! Tally-ho! Just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate! \\nThe centuries-long segregation of the first and third-world brought great complacency upon Europe. No one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the third-world reached critical mass and started invading the West. \\n\u201cI can tell,\u201d Vilsberg continued, \u201cthat you really don\u2019t believe how serious the situation is. After all, we lived side by side with the Third World, convinced that our hermetic coexistence, our global segregation, would last forever. What a deadly illusion! Now we see that the Third World is a great unbridled mass, obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair. \\nIn a bittersweet scene, one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous Africans. Towards the end of the party, his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow. The horde\u2019s arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves. They began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d \\nNow, it\u2019s a known fact that racism comes in two forms: that practiced by whites\u2014heinous and inexcusable, whatever its motives\u2014and that practiced by blacks\u2014\u2014quite justified, whatever its excesses, since it\u2019s merely the expression of a righteous revenge, and it\u2019s up to the whites to be patient and understanding. \\nWhat drives the maniacal leftist? Raspail believes it\u2019s a suicide mechanism, likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence. Attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself. \\nWhenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm, there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of human misery and despair, set to music of sorts, that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else. It never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past, or against their own well-being. For them it was a drug, and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going, like addicts and their heroin. The fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference. Nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix, and poisons like that are easy to import. There\u2019s never a lack of pushers. Besides, modern man has always had, tucked away in the back of his mind, that singular longing for total destruction, sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him. \\nThe book even predicted a cucked Catholic Church. Raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with Europe\u2019s destruction for the third-world invasion to proceed seamlessly. \\nI came south like a lot of other priests, father, to hail what I thought would be mankind\u2019s redemption. To welcome the million Christs on board those ships, who would rise up, reborn, and signal the dawn of a just, new day. \\nThe European women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them. If you think this is too extreme, consider that European women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime , yet if a white man so much as brushes past them, he\u2019s accused of assault . \\nShe died in Nice, in a whorehouse for Hindus, disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular. At the time, each refugee quarter had its stock of white women, all free for the taking. And perfectly legal. [\u2026] \\nYes, the Third World had started to overflow its banks, and the West was its sewer. \\nRaspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders. We saw something similar recently when the German government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with German girls. \\nRalph Ginzburg, the famous American publisher, had printed a series of photos in his magazine Eros, which had caused not a little ink to be spilled. They showed an interracial couple\u2014white woman, black man\u2014in various stages of nude embrace. With a caption that read as follows: \u201cTomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age, in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race.\u201d \\nThe fleet made landfall in France. The French, impotent to do the right thing to save their country, tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat (they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming). You can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about. The new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the French, similar to what we already see in Western European nations. \\nIn war, the real enemy is always behind the lines. Never in front of you, never among you. Always at your back. That\u2019s something every soldier knows. In every army, since the world began. And plenty of times they\u2019ve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemy\u2014the so-called enemy, that is\u2014and give it to the real one, once and for all. [\u2026] \\nWhen freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction, then freedom is dead. \\nThe book itself wasn\u2019t my style of storytelling. Raspail made numerous detours and long-winded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals. It\u2019s more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace. The only flaw is that it didn\u2019t predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell. Even though an active invasion is taking place today, the anti-migrant side is far stronger than what\u2019s portrayed in the book. \\nThe Camp Of The Saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves weren\u2019t the only cause of Europe\u2019s destruction\u2014leftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival, a fact that many of us already know too well.
