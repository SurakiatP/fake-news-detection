This struggle has most recently manifested itself in India\u2019s decision to remove, wholesale, large denomination bills from public circulation. \\nMore: \\nThe country [banned] 500 and 1000 rupee notes (worth about US$7 and $14 respectively) and the mooted import restriction [banning gold imports] could be a reaction to dealers swapping the notes for gold. \\nIBJA national secretary Surendra Mehta told the Times of India its members should be ready. \u201cWe hear from certain circles of this possibility, though nothing official is out yet,\u201d he said. \\nThe larger issue here has to do with banning cash on a global level. It is typical of reporting in this modern era that few if any of the mainstream articles covering India\u2019s most recent move seemingly mention this. \\nGovernments around the world are beginning to ban cash. Sweden is far advanced but Uruguay and now India are not far behind. Uruguay is soon to demand that employers cease to pay employees via cash and instead deposit paychecks directly in bank accounts. \\nMost recently in Australia, Citibank announced it would no longer deal in cash because most depositors did not wish to be \u201cbothered.\u201d \\nWe are told these are disparate and individual decisions of various entities and nation states. But they are nothing of the sort. Once again, surreptitiously, the banking elites that want to run the world are surely organizing a pan-global stratagem to advance their control. \\nIf everyone\u2019s cash is controlled, further technocratic globalization of society on a worldwide scale becomes increasingly feasible. \\nThe ongoing implementation of a global cash ban has taken on increased urgency because of growing negative interest rates worldwide. People don\u2019t want to pay banks to hold their cash and are thus withdrawing it. The solution? Ban cash outright. \\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether this sociopathic endeavor was going to apply to gold, but India\u2019s apparent determination to attack the yellow metal as well as cash seems to give us a clear answer. \\nAs the attacks on wealth increase, any monetary element not immediately available digitally will come under scrutiny and eventually be targeted with demands for confiscation. \\nConclusion: These emergent attacks certainly illustrate a growing elite desperation to take control, worldwide, sooner rather than later.'"}, "time": 1742562104.6213224}
