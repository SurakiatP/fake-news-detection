Trump\u2019s coming investigation into voter fraud, claiming it is \u201cracist. \u201d[In an interview on CNN, Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the NAACP, insisted that his organization would \u201cresist\u201d the president\u2019s investigation into fraud during the 2016 election.  \u201cThe President has claimed millions of fraudulent ballots were cast. The only place you will find millions of fraudulent ballots are right beside that fake birth certificate for Barack Obama, inside the imagination of President Trump. They don\u2019t exist,\u201d Brooks said on Thursday. Instead of vote fraud, Brooks insisted that there was \u201cunrelenting voter suppression\u201d of the minority vote in 2016. \u201cWe have seen our rights denied as Americans. Particularly seniors,   Latinos and younger people,\u201d Brooks exclaimed. \u201cSo, if the President insists upon conducting an investigation into voter fraud as a pretext for voter suppression, the NAACP, along with millions of Americans of every human heritage, will resist. We will push back. \u201d Brooks recently jumped to his Twitter account to attack the President\u2019s investigation, calling it a figment of Trump\u2019s imagination. 1) Only place you\u2019ll find millions of fraudulent ballots are beside B. Obama\u2019s fake birth certificate \u2014  inside #POTUS \u2019s imagination. @NAACP pic. twitter.   \u2014   Cornell Wm. Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 26, 2017,  In a formal statement, Brooks called vote fraud a \u201cmyth\u201d and insisted that voter suppression is a fact. He wrote: Today, President Donald Trump called for the federal government to spend resources investigating alleged \u201cvoter fraud\u201d in the 2016 elections. Unable to accept the fact that he lost the popular vote by some 2. 8 million votes, President Trump has repeated his naked and reckless claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election by \u201cillegal immigrants. \u201d However, this notion of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election, or any other American election cycle for that matter, is false and dangerous. On CNN Brooks added that he would suggest the president change the direction of his investigation or they will have to resist it. \u201cIf the President goes down this road, we must resist, and we must resist massively,\u201d Brooks claimed. The claims Brooks made fly in the face of the evidence, according to longtime vote fraud investigator John Fund. In a piece published by Fox News, Fund and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Hans von Spakovsky say that Trump\u2019s investigation is a long overdue look at the problem of vote fraud in the U. S. Fund and von Spakovsky reveal that the Obama administration spent its entire eight years trying to quash investigations into vote fraud and also refused to allow the states to fix their voter rolls to eliminate dead voters and voters registered in multiple jurisdictions. The authors further point out that our electoral system is currently set up entirely on the honor system, expecting that all voters will be telling the truth by affirming they are both registered and will only vote once. Fund also notes that voter ID cards are perfectly acceptable and that, \u201cAll industrialized democracies  \u2026     require voters to prove their identity before voting. \u201d \u201cOur honor system for voting doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Fund concluded. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how big of a problem voter fraud really is because no systematic effort has ever been made to investigate it. But the public doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as insignificant as the media insists. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742561751.289122}
