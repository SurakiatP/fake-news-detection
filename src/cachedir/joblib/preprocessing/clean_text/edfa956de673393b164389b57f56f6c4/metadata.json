We have all been introduced to QM as \u201cthe science of stuff too small to really matter to everyday life.\u201d But recent developments in biological science have revealed that life itself puts powerful quantum mechanical principles to use as an everyday part of its function. \u201cQuantum Biology\u201d is one of the forefronts of modern science. Quantum Physics in Bird Navigation \\nWe\u2019ve known for decades that many species of birds migrate each year, most famously from north to south as the temperature drops in the temperate zones. But how they navigate during those migrations has always been a mystery. The magnetic field the Earth produces is terribly weak compared to the other forces that act on an animal\u2019s body. Furthermore, biologists knew from studies that birds\u2019 compasses are light-dependent, and that they detect magnetic fields relative to the surface of the planet, not the poles. \\nIt wasn\u2019t until the rule of quantum entanglement developed that we began to develop a theory of how bird compasses worked. Without delving too far into the science, the theory is that bird\u2019s eyes contain a protein that itself contains millions of entangled electrons. When light enters the bird\u2019s eye, it knocks some of those entangled electrons loose, but leaves others attached to the protein molecules. \\nThe \u201cloose\u201d electrons are much more dramatically affected by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field than the bound ones are, but the entanglement means the bound electrons move the same way. The subsequent \u201cwiggling\u201d of the protein that the bound electrons are attached to can be perceived by the bird\u2019s retina and translated by its brain into a \u201cpicture\u201d of the magnetic field it\u2019s flying through. Quantum Physics in Photosynthesis \\nPlants, it seems, use quantum mechanics for one of the most important aspects of life on Earth: turning sunlight into the power that life runs on. The biggest mystery of photosynthesis for as long as we\u2019ve understood it is \u201chow is photosynthesis so efficient?\u201d Our best machines achieve efficiencies of upwards of 30% \u2014 photosynthetic transfer of energy is upwards of 99% efficient. There are so many directions a photon could travel once it gets captured by a molecule of chlorophyll that science had no idea how such a high proportion of photons made it to the \u201creaction center\u201d where they were used in building new molecules. \\nThe answer turns out to be quantum coherence , the ability of a quantum particle to act like a wave until something \u201cdecoheres\u201d it. The theory is that photons enter plant cells, are captured by chlorophyll, and rather than traveling in a particle-like manner, they travel as waves , and the \u201creaction center\u201d has the ability to decohere those waves back into particle (photon) form. Quantum Physics In Your Digestion \\nEnzymes are catalysts \u2014 chemicals that trigger other chemical creations. But for decades, scientists have been unable to determine how enzymes can speed up reactions so much: up to a trillion times faster than they would naturally occur. Recent research has shown that enzymes may be a trigger of quantum coherence \u2014 as above \u2014 using the \u201cwave side\u201d of the wave-particle quality to cause electrons and even protons to simply \u201cteleport\u201d from one atom to another, bypassing the need for time, heat, and all of the other factors that enable or speed up classical chemical reactions. Quantum Physics In Your Sense of Self \\nFinally, worthy of a mention in passing is the theory being debated right now by many scientists: that quantum mechanics are fundamental to our consciousness . For centuries, humans have proposed \u201csecond processing systems\u201d in the brain or body that run parallel to our normal neuron firings, and that these overlapping systems are what give rise to our ability to mentally separate ourselves from our circumstances \u2014 what we call \u201cbeing conscious.\u201d \\nRecent evidence has come up that the cytokine in the brain \u2014 what we used to think of as the \u201cbrain\u2019s skeleton,\u201d holding it all together \u2014 is in fact a massive quantum processor. Laced with what the scientists call \u201cmicrotubules\u201d that vibrate at incredible speeds, the cytokine system appears to be operating on the quantum level as a \u201ctrinary\u201d computer \u2014 able to hold values of \u2018on,\u2019\u2018off,\u2019 and the quantum superposition of being both on and off at the same time. \\nWhat exactly this would enable our \u201csecondary processing system\u201d to accomplish is currently being explored \u2014 but the results, if we find them, are bound to change a lot of our fundamental assumptions about what we, as human beings, are capable of. \\nFeatured image courtesy of Crist\u00f3bal Alvarado Minic via Flickr.
