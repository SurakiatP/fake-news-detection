THE STATE OF NATIONAL INSECURITY\\nThe Directorate of National Insecurity--\\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the CIA, the Head of the National Security Agency,\\nThe President\u00b4s National Security Advisor, the Chief of Homeland Security,\\nThe Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Intelligence,\\nThe President of the Good Old USA--\\nAll answer to the 1% in a plutocracy posing as ersatz democracy,\\nKowtowing to Big Money, to Wall Streeters and their cohorts,\\nTo Oil Barons, the Multinational Corporations, the Drone Makers,\\nTo the vast network of contractors for the CIA, NSA, and Homeland Insecurity,\\nAll enjoying secret giveaways for their private pockets\\n(Estimated at a classified $4+ trillion for the War on Terror),\\nBig $$$ to the GMO inventors, big Pharma profiting from provisions in \u201cFast Track\u201d Free Trade Agreements,\\nTo insurance Racketeers serving up sickness under \u201cObamacare,\u201d\\nAnd all their lesser but well rewarded staff of hangers-on,\\nAll thinking that what the 1% want the 90% will get--\\nThe Shaft, not even the Trickle-down.\\nThe Terrorism of War lubricates the Shaft,\\nThe State of National Insecurity shoves it up the ass of any boogeyman foreign terrorist created\\nAnd any bold Peacemaker in the Homeland is at risk.\\nIn the Homeland all the agencies of repression mobilize to track the good guy.\\nWhistle-blowers, dead or alive, by any means necessary!\\nThe NSA passes on what poses as intelligence to the multiplying police agencies.\\nThe FBI infiltrates the peacemakers, tells local cops how to des-occupy the street scat.\\nBig Brother listens to every word you speak,\\nAnd if you don\u00b4t think Zombie, puts you on The List.\\nThe Department of War brings official terror instruments to the Homeland,\\nArms local police forces with \u201csurplus\u201d military armaments\\nTo provoke and then violently suppress peaceful demonstrators\\nProtesting police murder and immunity from prosecution.\\nThe State of National Insecurity has more sophisticated apparatuses than Mr. Orwell\\nOr Adolf Hitler could envision.\\nSo efficient that no Homeland Gestapo is needed--\\nAt least not time yet for domestic Death Squads\\nLike those created by Ronnie Raygun in Central America in the 1980s\\nAnd now the murderous Narco-State in Mexico fashioned by NAFTA and the War on Drugs,\\nAnd the neo-Nazi thugs in the Ukraine overthrowing the government\\nTo get Western access to the oil, gas, business opportunity and NATO bases\\nAnd start a new Cold War with Russia.\\nThe National Insecurity Agency, a monstrosity almost beyond comprehension,\\nScrutinizes billions of private messages of everyone, everywhere,\\nAbroad the Heads of State of allies are listened to for clues as to their thoughts and policies.\\nEverywhere searching for intelligence to compile lists of supposed terrorists to kill,\\nAt home compiling lists of millions among the thinking and peaceful,\\nPeople like you and me, now with FBI files,\\nSuspect because we oppose the Terrorism of the Super-Rogue.\\nWe pacifists are potential Terrorists.\\nThe President of nice words and dirty deeds\\nSays \u201cReform,\u201d but will as always follow the Dirty Way.\\nThere can be no balance of privacy and security, only cover-ups of what is really going on.\\nThe 2015 \u201cFreedom Act\u201d to limit the NSA is a long way from curtailing surveillance.\\nThe NSA searches for commercial advantage to pass on to Business Cronies.\\nNSA still spies on friend and foe, sabotages computer systems of \u201cenemies,\u201d like China,\\nConspires to facilitate then cloak in secrecy the Official Terrorism of the Super Rogue.\\nThe State of National Insecurity could be considered a fourth branch of government,\\nThe military, security, and police agencies supposedly\\nBacking the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.\\nGiven their centrality, these agencies are better considered\\nAs a State reduced to its all-powerful Repressive Apparatus,\\nTo its authoritarian essence.\\nIts centrality and power unchecked and not counterbalanced\\nBy executive, legislative, or judicial power.\\nThese branches respond to and do the bidding of the Repressive Apparatus.\\nThe agencies that directly constitute the Repressive Apparatus\u2014\\nThe Department of War, the Joint Chiefs of War Staff,\\nAnd the Special Forces created by the military (better termed Death Squads),\\nThe Central Intelligence Assassins, the National Insecurity Agency,\\nThe National Insecurity advisors around the Pres,\\nHomeland Insecurity, the Injustice Department, the Federal Bureau of Cointelpro,\\nLocal trigger happy police, the National Guard Against Insurgency\u2026.\\nThe Senate Insecurity Committee diapers their unwiped asses.\\nTogether these agencies have spawned a vast array of private contracting corporations\\nThat is well beyond the \u201cMilitary-Industrial Complex\u201d that President Eisenhower warned against.\\nIt is these days not just the big corporations producing weapons,\\nNow it is private contractors that do much of the dirty counter-terrorism work,\\nThe computer surveillance and sabotage work, the spy work on corporate competitors,\\nThe listening in on allies like the German Chanciler or reformists like the President of Brazil.\\nSecret mercenary work to disrupt and kill.\\nThe shadow private complex takes in trillions with no oversight or accountability.\\nThe State of National Insecurity is state agencies in symbiosis with a huge complex of private entities\\nContracted to share and profit from the Dirty Work.\\nThis Complex, the merging of government agencies and private corporations,\\nDoes the bidding of the entire Plutocracy, united by thirst for war and empire abroad\\nAnd social control on the home front.\\nA government that once had some lawful protections is transformed into a Regime of Repressive Lawlessness\\nThat jails or kills innocents\\nAnd accords impunity to the criminality of the agents of the Repressive Apparatus.\\nThe State of National Insecurity corporatizes its global operations,\\nWith no oversight or accountability.\\nA terror apparatus within the State of National Insecurity.\\nSubservient to the 1%,\\nNon-responsive to the courts or Congress.\\nThis State has its homeland, Fortress America;\\nIt has its dogma, the War on Terror;\\nIt has its policy guidelines, Neoliberalism;\\nIt has its ideology to instill in the populace, the religion of Zombyism\u2014\\nAmerica first, racism, sexism, the War of All Against All,\\nImposed cultural ethos of competition and individualism that compliment insecurity and proneness to violence.\\nLarge sectors of the populace are taught to view militarism and violence as a source of pride,\\nCriticism and resistance are unmanly cowardice, deserving of repressive punishment.\\nThe National State of Insecurity has its creative Think Tanks;\\nIt has its political action groups to spread millions around the electoral landscape;\\nIt has its means of avoiding accountability, a drawn curtain blocking heinous crimes,\\nA kind of Shari-like code of security and Impunity\\nA cloak of secrecy so dark only the top criminals who command it know what is going on...\\nUnlike their counterparts declaring jihad, the bearded Male Islamic Fanatics,\\nReacting to the violence perpetrated upon their peoples with their own gross violence,\\nThese Macho Warriors of the Insecurity Complex,\\nDress in suits and ties, don\u2019t sport beards, and don\u2019t wave the Bible\\nWhen they proclaim \u201cDeath to Terrorists\u201d\\nAnd at home intimidate the Rabble with teargas and clubs and guns,\\nCentral to the State of National Insecurity is a criminal organization,\\nA pivot for organizing the ruthless pursuit of the Imperial Vision.\\nThe CIA has a long, long, long history of deadly Interventions and Dirty Tricks.\\nThe torture episode publicized of late is only the shivering tip of a very dense iceberg of Official Terrorism.\\nAfter many years of cover-up the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\\nFinally exhibited a semblance of courage in December 2014.\\nIn spite of being spied upon by the insecurity apparatus\\nThe Committee issued a report critical of CIA \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d\\nThat was central to the War on Terror in the Bush years,\\nSuspended under Obama in favor of drone attacks and more troops in Afghanistan.\\nCommittee Chairwoman Feinstein termed CIA activity \u201cmisguided.\u201d\\nThe President blandly admitted \u201cWe tortured some folks.\u201d\\nThe Head of the CIA, unsuccessful in attempts to suppress the report on grounds of \u201cnational security\u201d\\nAnd former Vice-President Cheney, a principal architect of the war on terror,\\nAn array of those involved,\\nAll rose to defend the indefensible in extensive media coverage,\\nWhile not a single victim\u00b4s story was aired.\\nThe best that was said in official discourse is that torture is \u201cunfortunate\u201d and occasionally \u201cnever again.\u201d\\nThere is immunity for all perpetrators,\\nThe CIA Director and the battery of agents in Covert Operations,\\nPresident Bush, VP Cheney, the Attorney General and a battery of lawyers involved,\\nThe Secretary of War, Rumsfeld.\\nNo one will be prosecuted under American or international law\\nFor gross violations of human rights,\\nFor crimes against humanity\\nOr any other violation of law and international treaties.\\nNo consequences for kidnappings and renditions to Black torture sights,\\nFor indefinite imprisonment in Guantanamo,\\nFor interrogation techniques that included\\nRectal feeding (liquefied gourmet Middle Eastern cuisine no doubt)\\nRectal hydration (convenient substitute for a water fountain)\\nDiapers \u201cGenerally not to exceed 72 hours\u201d (no latrines, on delayed order from private contractors)\\nCramped confinement, stress positions, insect placement, total darkness, sleep deprivation,\\nInfliction of pain, hunger, and humiliation, threats of rape and execution,\\n\u201cWalling\u201d, facial hold and slap, and the most notorious--Waterboarding.\\nDonald Trump asked about reinstating waterboarding said, \u201cYou bet your ass.\u201d\\nThese are heinous crimes committed by persons devoid of humanity,\\nThe Gestapo of our era responsible to institutions serving only the most perverse ends.\\nLest we forget, American judges in 1946 condemned Nazi torturers to death by hanging.\\nThe only sane response by American citizens is prosecution of those responsible.\\nHurrah to Code Pink that attempted to make a citizen\u00b4s arrest of Henry Kissinger for his crimes,\\nThe good Ladies were forcibly evited from a Senate Armed Services hearing on Imperial Strategy\\nAnd Labeled by Warlord Senator John McCain as \u201clow-life scum\u201d,\\nNo doubt a projection of his own war-mongering character.\\nFor the institution that sponsored these depravities there is only one remedy,\\nABOLISH the CIA. Along with the National Security Agency that monitors all of us,\\nAnd Homeland Security that that creates long lines at airport,\\nAnd ridiculously has us take off our shoes before boarding an airplane.'"}, "time": 1742628289.7536156}
