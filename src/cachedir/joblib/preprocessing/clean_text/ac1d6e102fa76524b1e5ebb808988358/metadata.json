AFP offers a bit of analysis: \\nThe incident raises serious questions about the extent to which pilots are able to track the complex airspace they operate in. \\nWell, sort of. Basically, there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space \u2013 and that\u2019s your problem, right there. Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that U.S. systems can interpret, and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia. \\nLooking at the air command/control assets that seem to be available for operations, there shouldn\u2019t have to be a safety or awareness issue, at least not during planned air strike and air support operations. When they have aircraft operating, both coalitions, Russian and U.S., have the technical means to maintain good, fine-grain air pictures in the area in question. (The general area the encounter occurred in can be inferred from where the U.S. coalition conducted air strikes on 17 October . See map.) Locations of coalition air strikes in Syria on 17 Oct 2016. The locations at Ayn Isa, Abu Kamal, Al Shaddadi and possibly Palmyra could qualify as \u201ceastern\u201d Syria, the region reported for the close air encounter. If the Russian fighter was escorting the Tu-214R, the night Russian commanders expected to see ISIS fighters making their way into Syria, the easternmost area where Al-Shaddadi and Abu Kamal \u2014 or Al-Bukamal \u2014 are located would be the most likely. (Google map; author annotation) \\nThe Russians have their S-300 and S-400 radars and command vehicles, along with the radars and command center of the Syrian national system. Russia has also operated the A-50 Mainstay AWACS over Syria since December 2015, although there\u2019s no way to know if it was operating on 17 October. The A-50 isn\u2019t forward-based in Syria, but rather operates out of Mozdok in southern Russia. (It may well have been operating that night, given the other things going on.) \\nThe U.S. coalition has E-2C Hawkeyes from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) airwing, which come up from the Persian Gulf to support operations in both northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

It\u2019s not clear where Charles de Gaulle \u2019s E-2Cs are flying, but they are capable of providing interlocking air space coverage with Ike \u2019s E-2Cs, when both are airborne. French carrier FS Charles de Gaulle. (File image via Le Parisien) \\nWorking with de Gaulle on 17 October were also two destroyers, USS Ross (DDG-71) and FS Chevalier Paul , one or both of which would have been able to track Russian aircraft to some distance inland over Syria. (Their more-constant but less extensive air picture(s) would complement and enhance that of the airborne Hawkeyes.) \\nThese operational-level assets keeping up an area air picture supplement the on-scene information an individual aircraft has from its own radar system, as well as enabling the air defense command/control platform to keep each aircraft under combat direction. \\nAt the time of the encounter, U.S. and French systems had the ability to know where Russian aircraft were, even if the Russians had to be identified by default, rather than by positive confirmation from Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). (The Russians, recall, up in the Baltic, have been going out of their way to not \u201csquawk\u201d IFF in good faith where NATO systems can detect it. They presumably reserve the right to behave the same way over Syria. From what U.S. officials have sometimes been careful not to say, it sounds to me like that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. That said, there aren\u2019t so darn many unidentified aircraft zorching around over Syria at 500 knots that it would have to take very long to know you\u2019ve got either a Russian or a Syrian jet fighter.) \\nRussian systems also had the ability to know where U.S. coalition aircraft were on 17 October. It\u2019s not credible to claim that they had no awareness. And they probably had the IFF codes of those aircraft, and knew whose they were, since the coalition is presumably squawking as per normal. \\nThe \u201cincredibility\u201d of the claim that the Russian aircraft \u201ccouldn\u2019t see\u201d the U.S. warplane is compounded by the fact that the Russian fighter was said to be escorting a \u201clarge spy plane.\u201d This was probably the Tu-214R , Russia\u2019s newest, uniquely capable airborne ISR platform, with a sensor suite somewhat similar to the U.S. E-8 JSTARS. If the Russian fighter escort really didn\u2019t know that a U.S. fighter was within weapons range of the \u201cspy plane,\u201d the fighter pilot\u2019s head should have been delivered on a platter 15 minutes after he got back on the ground. (The search sector of his radar isn\u2019t an issue. He\u2019s getting paid to make it comprehensive, maneuvering as necessary, while he\u2019s up their escorting a high-value asset. The fighter plane was probably an Su-30SM using a Bars N011M series radar system, incidentally.) \\nSo it would take a lot of convincing for me to believe that the close encounter the night of 17 October occurred because of any inadequacy in system capability. The dangerously inadequate coordination arrangements the U.S. is tolerating are the real issue, I suspect. \\nA couple of points about those arrangements. One, let\u2019s review the assessment from earlier again: \\nBasically, there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space \u2013 and that\u2019s your problem, right there. Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that U.S. systems can interpret, and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia. \\nThis is the situation when two hostile forces are operating in the same air space. Another word for that is \u201ccombat.\u201d There\u2019s no political will for combat between the two forces in question, of course. But the mechanical arrangements of military operations in the battle space don\u2019t reflect that. It\u2019s an incredibly stupid situation. \\nTwo, the close encounter occurred at an interesting time; i.e., the second night of the ground assault on Mosul , which started on Sunday, 16 October. The U.S. had been striking targets around Mosul for about three days at that point, and had started pounding ISIS positions on the outskirts of Mosul with artillery late Saturday or early Sunday, according to local sources. Russia, at the time, was playing up a non-credible report that the U.S. planned to let thousands of ISIS fighters leave Mosul and move into Syria \u2013 implicitly to fight Syrian regime forces and thwart the intentions of the Russian coalition. (Trying to track such a stream of guerrilla evacuees, if the Russians really believed their own hype, would have been an ideal mission for the Tu-214R \u201cspy plane.\u201d) \\nOne more significant thing was happening at exactly the same time. A NATO AWACS contingent was deploying to Turkey to support the U.S. coalition in Syria and Iraq. Russia opposes that move. Although the NATO AWACS hadn\u2019t flown a mission yet, its first mission was three days later, on 20 October. The Russians knew it was there, in Turkey, setting up for operations. \\nIn other theaters, Russia has been signaling dissatisfaction through dangerous, unsafe military encounters for many months now. We can conclude with strong confidence that that\u2019s what has happened in Syria. We can expect it to happen again.'"}, "time": 1742562863.3780766}
