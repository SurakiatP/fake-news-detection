He explained how Muslims can use burkas as a way to commit voter fraud.\\nProject Veritas wanted to test this theory by sending an undercover journalist dressed in full burka to Huma Abedin\u2019s polling location to see if they could vote. Shockingly, an election official offered the PV journalist Huma Abedin\u2019s ballot.\\nPV Journalist: \u201cNot even just voter ID because of people voting twice, but people can like cover their faces, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\\nAlan Schulkin: \u201cThe Muslims can do that too. You don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\\nPV Journalist: \u201cThe Muslims, yeah. Especially, all those Burkas. Someone could claim oh it\u2019s my religion, but you don\u2019t know if they are pretending or not.\u201d\\nAlan Schulkin: \u201cExactly.\u201d\\nAlan Schulkin: \u201cYour vote doesn\u2019t even count even, because they can go in there with a burka and you don\u2019t know if they are a voter. Your vote gets discounted because they come in there with a burka on and they can vote. People think that it\u2019s a liberal thing to do, but I take my vote seriously, and I don\u2019t want ten other people coming in negating my vote by voting for the other candidate when they aren\u2019t even registered voters.\u201d\\nElection Offical: \u201cGoodmorning. Last name.\u201d\\nPV Journalist: \u201cAbedin.\u201d\\nElection Official: \u201cAbedin.\u201d\\nElection Official: \u201cAnd that\u2019s your last name?\u201d\\nElection Official: \u201cAnd how do you spell Abedin?\u201d\\nPV Journalist: \u201cA B E DI N.\u201d\\nElection Official: \u201cI don\u2019t know honey. I\u2019m looking for it in the books. But your name is not in the book. For some reason it\u2019s not here, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t vote by paper ballot. You just can\u2019t vote by machine\u201d\\nPV Journalist: \u201cOk so I can vote today?\u201d\\nElection Official: \u201cBy paper.\u201d\\nPV Journalist: \u201cSo I can vote as Huma Abedin, but just with the paper ballot?\u201d\\nElection official: \u201cIf that\u2019s the name you voted with in the last election, and you haven\u2019t changed your name?\u201d\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742561782.659928}
