He immediately mailed his resignation letter to his boss and uploaded his resume on Naukri.com. \\nSpeaking to our correspondent, Mr. Ayub said, \u201cI realized yesterday that my country needed me, but I was unsure as to whether the election results triggered the thought or I was really missing my homeland. Later when I was watching a movie\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cSwades?\u201d we inquired. \\n\u201cHmm, so while watching the movie, I could hear my heart pleading to me, \u201cYe jo des hai tera, swades hai tera, tujhe hai pukaaraaaa\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cIs it actually possible?\u201d \\n\u201cDon\u2019t know about yours but my heart definitely can sing.\u201d \\n\u201cBut why did you leave India in the first place?\u201d \\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s be honest, things were not that great last year.\u201d \\n\u201cBut nothing has changed since then. People still fight over issues they are not remotely concerned about in reality.\u201d \\n\u201cThat happens only on the internet. Do the same people fight in real world? No.\u201d \\n\u201cBut can you really live peacefully amid sanghis and bhakts?\u201d \\n\u201cArrey, no no, we never classified anyone. When there are 1.25 billion people living together, there will be difference of opinions, but we need to resolve our differences amicably, because at the end of the day, we are one big family.\u201d \\n\u201cAnyway, that was a good decision. So, whom did you support in the US election?\u201d \\n\u201cHillary Clinton.\u201d \\n\u201cWas it because of Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim statements or was there any other reason behind it?\u201d \\n\u201cNo, no other reason. He is a racist and that\u2019s why I did not support him. If I had a voter Id card, I would\u2019ve voted against him,\u201d his eyes darted towards a poster of Madonna on the wall in his living room as we concluded the interview.'"}, "time": 1742562903.8320608}
