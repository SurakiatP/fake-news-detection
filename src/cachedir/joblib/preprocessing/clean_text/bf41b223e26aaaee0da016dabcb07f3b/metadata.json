The network announced the news on Monday after several days of negotiations over the terms of his departure, less than two weeks after a video from 2005 surfaced in which he and Donald J. Trump engaged in a vulgar and misogynistic conversation about women. \u201cI am deeply grateful for the conversations I\u2019ve had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues,\u201d Mr. Bush, who was a   of \u201cToday,\u201d said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to what lies ahead. \u201d Terms of Mr. Bush\u2019s departure were not disclosed but he was believed to be walking away with a payout worth millions of dollars, according to a person briefed on the settlement who spoke on condition of anonymity. The settlement does not include a noncompete clause, so Mr. Bush is free to look for a position elsewhere, the person said. It has been just 10 days since video from an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was made public by The Washington Post. The tape, in which Mr. Trump described sexually assaulting women, has roiled his campaign for president. Mr. Trump has said he was not proud of what he said in the video, but dismissed the comments as \u201clocker room talk. \u201d In an interview broadcast on CNN on Monday night, Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, accused Mr. Bush of egging her husband on to say \u201cdirty and bad stuff. \u201d Though NBC initially had no plans to discipline Mr. Bush, he never again appeared on the air after the tape became public. Mr. Bush had started appearing on \u201cToday\u201d in August. NBC will now have to find a replacement for him as a   of the 9 a. m. hour. In a note to the show\u2019s staff members, Noah Oppenheim, the \u201cToday\u201d chief said, \u201cWhile he was a new member of the \u2018Today\u2019 team, he was a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564354.7841146}
