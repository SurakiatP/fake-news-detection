The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. \\nOne bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a \u201cC\u201d on the documents for \u201ccolored,\u201d and that was a sign that they should be denied. \\nThe Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s involvement with his father\u2019s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father\u2019s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization\u2019s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away \u2013 it\u2019s still there. \\nFeatured image via screen capture Share this Article!
