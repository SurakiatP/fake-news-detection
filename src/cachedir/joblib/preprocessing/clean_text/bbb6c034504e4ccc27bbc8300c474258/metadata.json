Last month the opportunity rover took some images fro a strange perfect triangular object. First reactions from people were that it was just a weird shadow, but the angles seemed to be too perfect to be \"just a shadow\". now, a few days leter, that same opportunity rover took some images from a side view of that same anomaly, and it turns out that it is anything but \"just a shadow\" or \"just a rock\". see for yourself.
