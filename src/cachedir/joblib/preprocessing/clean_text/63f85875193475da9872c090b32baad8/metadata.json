CEO Gary Miliefsky joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the massive ransomware attack that swept the world over the weekend. [Miliefsky said the details of the story sounded like something from a movie script: \u201cThis group called the \u2018Shadow Brokers\u2019 got ahold of NSA   eavesdropping worm code, malware that worms its way across vulnerabilities in Windows, and somebody merged it with ransomware and created the world\u2019s first ransom worm. \u201d  \u201cThe software doesn\u2019t just affect you if you click a link. You may click the link and get infected then have to pay the ransom. But it also worms its way across your Intranet looking for more computers with same vulnerability,\u201d he elaborated. Marlow asked if the outbreak of this malevolent software was under control after the chaotic events of the weekend. \u201cA lot of people worldwide have gotten concerned about it, but you\u2019re not going to believe the numbers. Over the weekend, we thought it was slowing down. It started out, it hit about 100, 000 computers by Sunday. By the end of the day yesterday, it was about 179, 000. Today, sadly, the numbers are more than double. We\u2019re at 367, 589 infected,\u201d Miliefsky replied. \u201cMost of them are offline. That means they\u2019ve been unplugged from the Internet so that people can decide: \u2018Do I wipe the drive and reinstall, or am I going to pay the fee? But I don\u2019t want it to propagate to other computers.\u2019 But there\u2019s still about 426 computers online that continue to propagate the worm,\u201d he added. Milifesky said his company\u2019s technology, which he unsuccessfully tried to sell to the \u201cbig guys\u201d in the computer industry, is focused on protecting \u201csmall to   enterprises where all the GDP really comes from. \u201d \u201cAnd guess what? All of our customers in the SME [Small and   Enterprise] space can not get infected with this worm. We can block it in milliseconds,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had technology to do this for years, but I can\u2019t sell it to the big guys. It\u2019s called NetShield. \u201d He explained that NetShield is a corporate product that was the first software to \u201cgo on the offensive\u201d against malware.  \u201cFor consumers, I have some great advice today,\u201d he said. \u201cI put a consumer advisory out, and you can just Google it, \u2018SnoopWall consumer advisory.\u2019 In the advisory, I have links to the current stats of the worm infection, what countries are getting infected in real time. But I also have a link to Microsoft\u2019s TechNet page where they didn\u2019t really want to tell everyone right away, two months ago they had the fix. So I have the link to the fix for every version of Windows in that advisory. \u201d Marlow asked about   reports that a North Korean hacking group appeared to be behind the ransomware attack. \u201cI\u2019ve been told by someone who\u2019s connected to someone in Anonymous that there\u2019s actually, believe it or not, a kind of Russian cyber arms dealer who sells weaponized malware, somewhere in Russia, and also hacks videogames, and that person may have sold it to North Korea,\u201d Miliefsky said. \u201cI don\u2019t know much more, I\u2019m told that on hearsay, but I\u2019m passing that on to the authorities and I know they\u2019re going to research it. \u201d Miliefsky said this was a \u201cwatershed moment in cybercrime history. \u201d \u201cI have to tell you, drug crime in 2015 was bigger than any other form of crime worldwide. By 2016, cybercrime surpassed drug crime and reached $600 billion. This year, I\u2019m predicting cybercrime will be a   industry. It is not going to go away. It is only going to get worse,\u201d he warned. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. '"}, "time": 1742628487.0502188}
