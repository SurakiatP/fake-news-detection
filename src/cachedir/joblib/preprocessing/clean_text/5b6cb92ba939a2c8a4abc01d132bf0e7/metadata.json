Chris Christie (R) commuted the prison sentence for former Marine Sergeant Hisashi Pompey, arrested six years ago for possessing a legally owned gun that was unregistered in the state of New Jersey. [On April 13 Breitbart News reported that Pompey brought his handgun into New Jersey while visiting from Virginia. Following an altercation at a nightclub, one of Pompey\u2019s friends retrieved the gun and was arrested. Pompey was also arrested because the gun was not registered in the state of New Jersey.  ABC 7 reported that Pompey did \u201cthree tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan for which he received medals for bravery. \u201d He was a military police sergeant who now has a wife and young children at home. Until Christie intervened on Friday, Pompey was preparing to surrender to authorities for what would have been a minimum   sentence for possession of an unregistered firearm. When news of the commuted sentence reached Pompey, he responded by making sure it was not a joke. Pompey said, \u201cOh my God, oh my God, oh my God, this isn\u2019t April Fools, right? I don\u2019t know how to react. I\u2019m grateful, grateful. \u201d Pompey\u2019s wife said, \u201cI just said, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve given us our life back. \u201d Christie\u2019s decision to commute Pompey\u2019s sentence does not expunge the arrest from his record, it simply removes the punishment that resulted from the arrest. In April 2015, Christie pardoned Pennsylvania mother Shaneen Allen, who was arrested in October 2013 for carrying a legally owned handgun in her car. Allen had a Pennsylvania permit to carry, but New Jersey does not recognize Pennsylvania\u2019s permit. And on December 23, 2015, Christie pardoned U. S. Marine Joshua Velez, a Massachusetts concealed carry permit holder who was arrested over a year earlier for bringing his 9mm handgun into the state of New Jersey.
