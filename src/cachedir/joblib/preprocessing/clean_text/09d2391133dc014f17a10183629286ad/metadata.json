Brady has been getting a lot of these, beginning with Super Bowl week\u2019s Opening Night on Monday at Minute Maid Park in Houston. This is not your average    Super Bowl week in America. The chaos in Washington, bedlam at airports and protests across the country serve as an unsettling crowd noise to even the serene superstar quarterback for the New England Patriots. Brady is friends with President Trump. So are the Patriots\u2019 owner, Robert Kraft, and Coach Bill Belichick. No sports team has been more closely associated with a new president, or perhaps any president, at least since Richard Nixon very publicly adopted the Washington Redskins as his own and even called occasional plays for Coach George Allen. Like Trump, the Patriots are a divisive juggernaut that tend to engender strong passions for and against. The team represents a kind of sporting ideal of Trump\u2019s promise to make \u201cAmerica win so much, you\u2019ll be bored of winning. \u201d New England, which will appear in an N. F. L.  ninth Super Bowl on Sunday, is a team that wins so much that a lot of America has become, yes, bored of its winning. And no small number of fans are convinced that the Patriots (like Trump) achieve their victories through dubious means and wish they would just go away and get off their TVs forever. The three main architects of the team\u2019s success  \u2014   Kraft, Belichick and Brady  \u2014   have taken pains to emphasize that their allegiance to Trump is based on friendship and loyalty, nothing more. They play golf and attend weddings and call to congratulate one another on elections and Super Bowl wins, those kinds of everyday things. They are quick to assert their bipartisan or apolitical bona fides. Kraft has been a supporter of many Democrats and Democratic causes over the years Belichick declared himself apolitical in response to queries last fall after Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire read aloud from an effusive note of congratulations that Belichick had sent him. Brady started getting questions about Trump last fall when a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap was spotted in his Gillette Stadium locker, reportedly put there by Kraft. Brady at first gave sheepish,   responses suggesting that it would be cool to have a golf pal as president. (\u201cThere\u2019d be a putting green on the White House lawn,\u201d he predicted.) But the questions took on an edgier urgency as Trump\u2019s victories and offenses kept mounting  \u2014   ending with Trump where he is now, and Brady dropping into a reflexive   every time Trump\u2019s name is mentioned to him. Brady, whose makeshift podium on the Minute Maid field on Monday night was swarmed with a few hundred reporters, was the central battlefield of incoming   questions. He countered with his most anodyne deflections. \u201cI\u2019m just a positive person\u201d became Brady\u2019s   blow off, which he also deployed in the face of several questions about Deflategate, the     scandal given new life this week by the prospect of Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s having to award the Super Bowl trophy to the man he suspended for four games to begin this season. Other Atlanta Falcons and Patriots players were also invited to weigh in on political matter but mostly demurred. The Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu, a practicing Muslim, was asked to discuss Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigration from seven   countries. He declined politely, other than to say that it was \u201c a very tough situation\u201d and \u201chard for me to talk about right now. \u201d I asked two of the more thoughtful members of the Patriots, the defensive linemen Alan Branch and Chris Long, if they had anything to say about these developments. They absolutely did, they said, and would speak out at some point later, but they did not want to create any \u201cdistractions\u201d during Super Bowl week. The Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett did say that if the Patriots won on Sunday and were invited to the White House, he would probably not go, because \u201cI don\u2019t support the guy that\u2019s in the [White] House. \u201d And really, was that so distracting? One enduring reason the Patriots are constantly being asked about their Trump connections is that the new president is hardly shy about reminding people of them. He has been dropping Brady\u2019s name  \u2014   and Kraft\u2019s, and Belichick\u2019s  \u2014   at every opportunity over the last several months. This first became evident to me in the fall of 2015 as Trump was enjoying his unlikely rise to   status in the Republican primaries and I had several visits with him for a profile I was writing for the magazine. A few months earlier, I had written a story about Brady, who had just won his fourth Super Bowl and was then embroiled in the Deflategate fiasco, in which the league said it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that Brady was \u201cat least generally aware\u201d that a minuscule amount of air pressure might have been removed from the footballs he used in the first half of the Patriots\u2019   blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the A. F. C. championship game. When Trump learned that I had recently spent time with Brady and around the Patriots, he became even more animated on the subject  \u2014   and insistent that I enlist the star quarterback to say nice things about him for my story. \u201cHe\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d Trump said about Brady for the first of many times. \u201cA really good friend of mine. \u201d Trump declared himself \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the N. F. L. \u2019s treatment of Brady over Deflategate. \u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculous what they\u2019re doing to him. \u201d He mentioned he had just spoken to Brady. \u201cHe said: \u2018Mr. Trump\u2019  \u2014   he calls me Mr. Trump, which he shouldn\u2019t, because we play golf all the time. Anyway, he says: \u2018Mr. Trump  \u2014   Donald,\u2019 he doesn\u2019t even know what the [expletive] to call me. It\u2019s the craziest thing. He\u2019s a friend of mine. \u201d Also, Kraft  \u2014   great friend, great friend. George Steinbrenner  \u2014   \u201cbig time winner\u201d  \u2014   was Trump\u2019s best friend, he said, and now Kraft is right up there, too, as one of his favorite guys. Kraft had visited him a few days earlier, and Trump said he chastised the Patriots owner for not fighting harder against the league\u2019s suspension of Brady, in addition to other sanctions levied by the N. F. L. against the Patriots (including the loss of a   draft pick and a record fine). \u201cYou know, Bob Kraft is also one of my best friends,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI said, \u2018Bob, you should have never made the deal. \u2019\u201d \u201cBob said, \u2018I had a wink from the commissioner,\u2019\u201d Trump added, meaning that Kraft seemed to think that by standing down and not fighting the N. F. L. the league would reduce Brady\u2019s penalty on appeal. Kraft was under pressure, Trump explained. \u201cHe choked, just like Romney choked. He said: \u2018You know what? They winked at me.\u2019 I said, \u2018Bob when you make a deal, you should have gotten it all wrapped up.\u2019 Who ever heard of making a deal like that? Now you got this mess. \u201d Kraft should never have trusted Goodell, he said. \u201cThe commissioner is a weak guy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen he made the Ray Rice deal, everybody said: You\u2019re stupid. You\u2019re weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he\u2019s going overboard with their star, Brady. \u201d He added: \u201cThe commissioner is a dope. He\u2019s a stupid guy. \u201d By far the best deal Kraft ever made was hiring Belichick, Trump said. Who, by the way, is also \u201ca great, great friend\u201d of Trump\u2019s, even though everyone just assumes he\u2019s \u201ca really rough guy. \u201d \u201cSo I go to the Patriots game last year,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m on the sidelines with Kraft. He\u2019s got Les Moonves right here. He\u2019s got a lot of different people. And Belichick comes over in his Patriots sweatshirt and the hoodie and the whole thing. He hugs me, and he kisses me, and he said: \u2018I love you. You\u2019re the greatest. \u2019\u201d Trump sat at his cluttered desk and seemed almost dreamy at the memory, as if the reception from Belichick genuinely moved him. \u201cHe just feels warmly toward me, Belichick does,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the craziest thing?\u201d After the Deflategate ruling was handed down by the commissioner that spring, Trump said he tried to persuade Brady to sue the league personally. \u201cI said, \u2018Tom.\u2019  \u2014   I gave him a lawyer.  \u2014   I said: \u2018Here\u2019s what you do. Sue the N. F. L. for $500 million tomorrow. Sue \u2019em up in Boston, for everything. They\u2019ll come to the table.\u2019 He said, \u2018Aw, man.\u2019 He really was torn. He\u2019s not Trump. He said, \u2018I just want to win another Super Bowl. \u2019\u201d Trump told Brady that he understood. A few weeks later, the future president was showing me around Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. We were accompanied by Damon Winter, a Times photographer who had, a few months earlier, photographed Brady for the profile that was published in February. At one point, as Trump showed me around his   golf Xanadu on the Pacific, he looked over at Winter. \u201cWho\u2019s got a better body, me or Tom Brady?\u201d he asked. (No answer from Winter that I recall.) In the course of my time with Trump, he kept urging me to call Brady and ask him about his great friendship with Trump. Brady would say great things, no doubt. \u201cAsk him, \u2018How is Trump as a golfer? \u2019\u201d Trump urged. Brady had been particularly hunkered down during the Deflategate ordeal. N. F. L. politics can be brutal like the   kind. Plus, the   in the press over his friendship with Trump was not making Brady any more eager to engage beyond his usual helpings of football platitudes. Finally, after Trump kept insisting, I reached out to Brady, fully expecting a polite   from the quarterback, and who could blame him? \u201cI really have no interest in political talk right now,\u201d Brady wrote. \u201cI have learned way too much about politics the last seven months. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561651.4230936}
