Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, will attend the funeral, as will Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top American diplomat in Cuba, to represent the United States, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The administration decided that the relationship between the two countries remained \u201cquite complicated,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThere are many aspects of the U. S.  relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime. \u201d Mr. Earnest said the administration continued to have significant concerns about the Cuban government, including its poor protection of basic human rights. \u201cSo, we believe that this was an appropriate way for the United States to show our commitment to an ongoing   relationship with the Cuban people,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. Although he is not a diplomat, Mr. Rhodes was the central White House interlocutor during negotiations with the Cuban government over the recent opening of relations between the two countries, and he was scheduled to be in Cuba this week for more meetings anyway, Mr. Earnest said.   Donald J. Trump warned Monday that the push to build ties with Cuba after decades of animosity could be quickly wiped away, despite growing business and commercial ties between the countries. \u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the   people and the U. S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,\u201d he said on Twitter. Mr. Trump\u2019s message threatened to end one of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy initiatives, an effort to overturn decades of enmity. Mr. Obama has relaxed restrictions on commerce, trade and financial transactions with Cuba, but he has not been able to overturn an embargo put in place by Congress. Mr. Obama has sought to strike a difficult balance between ending the countries\u2019 animosity and acknowledging the island government\u2019s faults. He has seen the decades of American efforts to undermine and even overthrow Cuba\u2019s government as being not only unsuccessful but also harmful to the United States\u2019 image in the region. By reducing the temperature of the language against Cuba, Mr. Obama believes that the world is more likely to focus more on Cuba\u2019s own difficulties on economic change and human rights, Mr. Earnest said. But Republicans were sharply critical on Saturday, the day after Mr. Castro\u2019s death, of a White House statement that noted that it was an occasion for Americans to \u201cextend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people\u201d while doing little to castigate the former leader\u2019s record of brutality. A few hours after the White House released its statement, a statement from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team called Mr. Castro a \u201cbrutal dictator\u201d who had oppressed his own people for decades and left a legacy of \u201cfiring squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562227.8574529}
