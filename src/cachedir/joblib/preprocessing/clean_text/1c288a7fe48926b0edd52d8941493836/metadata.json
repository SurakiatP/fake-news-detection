On a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump, who months before had called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslim immigration, argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century. The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East, and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs, offices and churches, he said. Extreme measures were needed. \u201cThe hateful ideology of radical Islam,\u201d he told supporters, must not be \u201callowed to reside or spread within our own communities. \u201d Mr. Trump was echoing a strain of   theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years. He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted, notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, now his national security adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s top strategist. This worldview borrows from the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with   critiques of Islam. It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1. 7 billion Muslims around the world. In its more extreme forms, this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah, the legal code of Islam, may take over in the United States. Those espousing such views present Islam as an inherently hostile ideology whose adherents are enemies of Christianity and Judaism and seek to conquer nonbelievers either by violence or through a sort of stealthy brainwashing. The executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump signed on Friday might be viewed as the first major victory for this geopolitical school. And a second action, which would designate the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political movement in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization, is now under discussion at the White House, administration officials say. Beyond the restrictions the order imposed on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, it declared that the United States should keep out those with \u201chostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles\u201d and \u201cthose who would place violent ideologies over American law,\u201d clearly a reference to Shariah. Rejected by most serious scholars of religion and shunned by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, this dark view of Islam has nonetheless flourished on the fringes of the American right since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With Mr. Trump\u2019s election, it has now moved to the center of American   on security and law, alarming many Muslims. Mr. Trump has insisted that the executive order is not a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d and his supporters say it is a sensible precaution to safeguard Americans. Asked about the seeming antipathy to Islam that appeared to inform the order, the White House pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in the August speech and on another occasion that signaled support for   Muslims. His administration, Mr. Trump said in August, \u201cwill be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voice. \u201d James Jay Carafano, a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who advised the Trump transition at the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, said the executive order was simply \u201ctrying to get ahead of the threat. \u201d As pressure increases on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, he said, \u201ctens of thousands of foreign fighters\u201d will flee. Some could try to reach America, perhaps posing as refugees, he said, so stronger vetting of those entering the country is crucial. But critics see the order as a clumsy show of toughness against foreign Muslims to impress Mr. Trump\u2019s base, one shaped by advisers with distorted ideas about Islam. \u201cThey\u2019re tapping into the climate of fear and suspicion since \u201d said Asma Afsaruddin, a professor of Islamic studies at Indiana University and chairwoman of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s a master narrative that pits the Muslim world against the West,\u201d appealing to Trump supporters who know nothing of Muslims or Islam beyond news reports of terrorist attacks, she said. The executive order, she said, will backfire by reinforcing the jihadist line that the United States is at war with Islam. \u201cThe White House is a huge soapbox,\u201d she said. \u201cThe demonization of Muslims and Islam will become even more widespread. \u201d Those in the administration with long records of criticizing Islam begin with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Flynn. Mr. Flynn last February tweeted a link to an   video and wrote, \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL. \u201d In an interview, he said that \u201cIslam is not necessarily a religion but a political system that has a religious doctrine behind it. \u201d Mr. Bannon has spoken passionately about the economic and security dangers of immigration and took the lead role in shaping the immigration order. In a 2014 talk to a meeting at the Vatican, he said the \u201c  West\u201d is at war with Islam. \u201cThere is a major war brewing, a war that\u2019s already global,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn\u2019t act. \u201d Elsewhere, on his radio show for Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cIslam is not a religion of peace  \u2014   Islam is a religion of submission,\u201d and he warned of Muslim influence in Europe: \u201cTo be brutally frank, Christianity is dying in Europe and Islam is on the rise. \u201d Others with similar views of Islam include Sebastian Gorka, who taught at the National Defense University and is a deputy national security adviser. Mr. Gorka\u2019s wife, Katharine, who headed think tanks that focused on the dangers of Islam, now works at the Department of Homeland Security. Tera Dahl, who was an aide to former Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is a National Security Council official. Walid Phares, a Lebanese American Christian who has advised politicians on counterterrorism, advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign but does not currently have a government post. All four have written for Breitbart News, the   website previously run by Mr. Bannon. They all reflect the   opinions of what some have described as the Islamophobia industry, a network of researchers who have warned for many years of the dangers of Islam and were thrilled by Mr. Trump\u2019s election. They warn about the danger to American freedoms supposedly posed by Islamic law, and have persuaded several state legislatures to prohibit Shariah\u2019s use. It is a claim that draws eye rolls from most Muslims and scholars of Islam, since Muslims make up about 1 percent of the United States population and are hardly in a position to dictate to the other 99 percent. \u201cThe majority of Muslims don\u2019t interpret the Quran literally,\u201d said Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution. \u201cYou can have five Muslims who all say we think this is God\u2019s exact words, but they all disagree with each other on what that means in practice. \u201d Among the most outspoken of those warning about Islam are Pamela Geller, of Stop Islamization of America, Robert Spencer, of Jihad Watch, and Frank Gaffney Jr. of the Center for Security Policy. All three were hosted by Mr. Bannon on his Breitbart radio program before he became chief executive of the Trump campaign in August. Mr. Gaffney appeared at least 34 times. His work has often been cited in speeches by Mr. Flynn. Kellyanne Conway, now counselor to Mr. Trump, did polling for Mr. Gaffney\u2019s center. Last year, the center gave Senator Jeff Sessions, who has warned of the \u201ctotalitarian threat\u201d posed by radical Islam and is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, its annual \u201cKeeper of the Flame\u201d award. Mr. Gaffney has been labeled \u201cone of America\u2019s most notorious Islamophobes\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The   League describes him as a \u201cpurveyor of   conspiracy theories. \u201d And even the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual meeting of   politicians and activists, banned Mr. Gaffney temporarily after he accused two of its organizers of being agents of the Muslim Brotherhood. In an interview, he explained his view of Islam, which focuses less on the violent jihad of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State than on the quieter one he sees everywhere. By his account, potential enemies are hidden in plain sight  \u2014   praying in mosques, recruiting at Muslim student associations and organizing through mainstream Muslim rights groups  \u2014   and are engaged in \u201cthis stealthy, subversive kind of jihad. \u201d \u201cThey essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions,\u201d Mr. Gaffney said, \u201cfor the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed. \u201d The day after the election, Mr. Gaffney told the Breitbart radio show how pleased he was with Mr. Trump\u2019s win. \u201cIt is a great blessing literally from God, but also I think obviously from the candidate himself, Donald Trump,\u201d he said. He praised the \u201csuperb people\u201d around Mr. Trump, naming Mr. Bannon and Mr. Flynn, who he said \u201care actually going to lead us to saving the Republic. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628500.5183485}
