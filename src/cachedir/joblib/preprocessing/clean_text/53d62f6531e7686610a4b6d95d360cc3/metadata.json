[\u201cMy mother is in trouble in Saudi. She wants to return home, but her Kafeel [visa sponsor] is not allowing her to get back here,\u201d Sameena Begum, the victim\u2019s daughter, told TOI.  Her daughter revealed that the victim \u201cis facing mental and physical harassment at the hands of her kafeel (sponsor) in Saudi Arabia,\u201d points the Indian news outlet. \u201cThe torture started when she denied to a contract marriage with her Kafeel in Saudi Arabia. She, however, informed me sending a message that she was sold by agents. So the Kafeel does not want to send her back,\u201d added the daughter, noting that her mother told her she was sold for 3 lakh, or 300, 000 rupees (about $4, 700). Sameena\u2019s mother has been identified as Salma Begum, 39, a resident of Babanagar, a suburb of Hyderabad in India\u2019s Telangana state. \u201cI am trying all efforts to bring my mother back home. I kindly request Telangana and central governments to bring my mother back to India,\u201d implored Sameena, noting that her Salma is asking New Delhi to intervene on her behalf. In January, Salma was reportedly taken to Saudi Arabia on a housemaid visa by two local Indian agents identified only as Akram and Shafi. \u201cI even met Akram requesting him to get my mother back, but he did nothing so far. We went to [the local] Kanchanbagh police station, but the police appear to be unmoved by the matter and have not taken any action so far,\u2019\u2019 noted the daughter. Although Indian authorities are aware of Akram and Shafi\u2019s involvement, they have failed to take action against them. Salma traveled to Saudi Arabia in search of greater financial security, Salma is reportedly the second woman to be deceived into going into the Sunni Saudi kingdom ruled by strict Islamic rules where authorities are known to broadly infringe women\u2019s rights. \u201cThe GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries   Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE  \u2014   manage its \u2018temporary\u2019 migrant workforce through the sponsorship or Kafala system,\u201d explains TOI. \u201cUnder this system, a local citizen or local company (the kafeel) must sponsor foreign workers in order for their work visas and residency to be valid. \u201d \u201cThis means that an individual\u2019s right to work and legal presence in the host country is dependent on his or her employer, rendering him or her vulnerable to exploitation,\u201d it adds.'"}, "time": 1742562924.759424}
