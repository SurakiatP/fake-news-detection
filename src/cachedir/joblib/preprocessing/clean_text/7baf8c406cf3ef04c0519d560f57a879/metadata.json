Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) with the Office of Congressional Ethics: \\n\u201cRepresentative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. \\nMembers of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.\u201d \\nThe complaint refers to this extremely misleading tweet, which fundamentally misrepresents what actually occurred. FBI Dir just informed me, \u201cThe FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d Case reopened \\n\u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nJason Chaffetz and the rest of the self-appointed inquisitors on the House Oversight Committee have wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer funds and Congressional time prosecuting fruitless investigations against the character of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s high time we held them all accountable for abusing their power for undemocratic hit-jobs against their political opponents.'"}, "time": 1742562754.1405644}
