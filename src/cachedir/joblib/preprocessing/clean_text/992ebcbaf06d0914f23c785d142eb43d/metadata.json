Lou Dobbs blows the lid off the casserole dish, exposes Evan McMullin\u2019s Mormon Mafia ties Posted at 1:11 am on October 27, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nAs Twitchy reported, presidential candidate Evan McMullin received some exciting news last week when a poll conducted by Emerson College showed him leading both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah. \\nUtah typically isn\u2019t a battleground state, but the Trump campaign dispatched Mike Pence there Wednesday to try to win back those voters who say they\u2019re voting for McMullin. How exactly did a third-party candidate manage to put the state in play? \\nThere\u2019s been plenty of chatter on the periphery of Twitter about the \u201cMormon Mafia\u201d driving McMullin\u2019s poll numbers in Utah, but it was a (now deleted) retweet by Fox Business Channel\u2019s Lou Dobbs that got people talking about how a Mormon mafia would go about shaking down citizens for their votes. \\n\u2014 Liam Donovan (@LPDonovan) October 27, 2016 \\nA Mormon Mafia tool? That just doesn\u2019t sound threatening at all. @LPDonovan @chrislhayes First I've heard of the Mormon Mafia. Is this a thing? \\n\u2014 kerMitt Frogney (@giguerja) October 27, 2016 @LPDonovan um, is that real? \\n\u2014 Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) October 27, 2016 \\nThe tweet or the mafia? Both, apparently. @LPDonovan Mormon Mafia is legit.They've been running the green jello and caffeine-free Coke racket for years. \\n\u2014 Soy Juan Miller (@EveryTrumpFan) October 27, 2016 @LPDonovan Imagine operating a worldwide Mafia without even drinking coffee. Now that is badass.\""}, "time": 1742563603.2898118}
