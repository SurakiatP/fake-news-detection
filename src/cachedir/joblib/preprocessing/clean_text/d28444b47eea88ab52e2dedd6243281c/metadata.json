The facts are that she definitely worked in the United States before getting her first visa in 1996 : \\nMrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband\u2019s hard line on immigration. \\nThe wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. \\nThe documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. \\nLater reports from the Trump organization about her immigration status appeared to show that under the Republican nominee\u2019s own policies , Melania Trump probably would not be allowed in the country. \\nImmigration violations can be re-litigated at any later date, if they are fraud or misrepresentation on any of the documents used to gain entry or US citizenship, although this almost never happens. \\nThe AP reports that the United States government only seeks to revoke citizenship in the \u201cmost egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.\u201d \\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that Melania Trump\u2019s immigration status and her Republican nominee husband\u2019s hypocritical stances towards immigration may be thrust into the maelstrom of the waning days of this year\u2019s presidential campaign. \\nThe big question is: Using the Trump standard for deportation \u2013 which would send his wife home to Slovenia \u2013 will the Republican candidate petition to send his wife out of the United States?'"}, "time": 1742563540.1077485}
