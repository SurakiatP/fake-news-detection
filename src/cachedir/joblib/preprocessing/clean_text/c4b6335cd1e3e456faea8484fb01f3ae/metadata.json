Questions about Melania Trump\u2019s speech dominated the Republican National Convention, distracting attention on a day that was supposed to be about Gov. Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Meredith McIver, a longtime Trump employee, took responsibility for lifted passages in Ms. Trump\u2019s speech, which originally appeared in Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech. \u201cI feel terrible for the chaos I have caused,\u201d she said. Mr. Trump\u2019s own speech, to be delivered Thursday, is being vacuumed of any hint of borrowing. _____ 2. The convention\u2019s organizers are confronting a range of troubles, like an ever emptier hall and schedule slippage that pushes top speakers out of the   broadcast TV window. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who was booed after he did not endorse Mr. Trump, was among tonight\u2019s speakers, who also included Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric. But all eyes were on Governor Pence, who accepted the vice presidential nomination. And Mr. Trump, on the eve of accepting the Republican nomination for president, played down the role of the U. S. in global crises, saying he wouldn\u2019t automatically defend NATO members from a Russian attack. _____ 3. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared a   state of emergency as he expanded his crackdown. In the days since the government thwarted a coup attempt, nearly 60, 000 soldiers, police officers, judges, educators and other civil servants have been suspended or detained. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have come to the end of it yet,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said, adding that he suspected foreign countries might have been involved. _____ 4. An advance in neuroscience: Researchers published a spectacular new map of the brain that includes 83 familiar regions and identifies 97 more that enable specific functions. A neuroscientist praised the work, calling it \u201ca step towards understanding why we\u2019re we. \u201d _____ 5. Twitter barred @Nero, a. k. a. Milo Yiannopoulos, a technology editor at the conservative news site Breitbart, after he orchestrated a trolling campaign against the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d actress Leslie Jones. The social media platform, acknowledging criticism that it has been slow to curb online abuse, said it would be detailing new tools and policies within weeks. Above, Mr. Yiannopoulos outside the Republican convention in Cleveland. _____ 6. International investigators suspect that people close to the embattled prime minister of Malaysia, above, have siphoned off billions of dollars from a sovereign wealth fund since 2009. The Justice Department traced what it called a   trail to the U. S. and moved to seize more than $1 billion in real estate, art and other luxury goods. _____ 7. Britain\u2019s new prime minister, Theresa May, navigated through her first session of questions from Parliament and then flew to Berlin to meet with Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Ms. Merkel will play a leading role in negotiating terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the E. U. On Thursday, Mrs. May will be in Paris for meetings with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. _____ 8. Here\u2019s one way to measure cultural differences: the reaction to Pok\u00e9mon Go, the wildly popular   smartphone game, which has expanded into 26 more countries. Saudi clerics renewed a fatwa against Pok\u00e9mon, calling it \u201c . \u201d Bosnia warned players to avoid chasing the digital creatures onto land mines left from the wars of the 1990s. And Russian websites published articles claiming the game is a C. I. A. plot. _____ 9. Lifting relatively light weights can build just as much strength as heavier ones, so long as repetitions are increased. Researchers who made the findings say you must lift until you\u2019re exhausted, meaning the effort feels like at least 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. So 10 to 12 reps with heavy weights equals 25 reps with lighter ones. _____ 10. In memoriam: Garry Marshall, a titan of Hollywood and network TV who specialized in romantic, family and buddy comedies. He was behind \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d \u201cHappy Days,\u201d \u201cThe Odd Couple,\u201d \u201cThe Princess Diaries\u201d and, biggest of all, \u201cPretty Woman. \u201d _____ 11. Finally, police departments and community groups around the nation have been hunting for ways to defuse tensions, but Wichita, Kan. may have come up with an idea that\u2019s the most fun: a barbecue, with music and dancing. A video of one young officer, Aaron Moses, doing the \u201c  Slide\u201d with black and white residents has gone viral. He says he\u2019s being called \u201cOfficer Brown With the Get Down. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
