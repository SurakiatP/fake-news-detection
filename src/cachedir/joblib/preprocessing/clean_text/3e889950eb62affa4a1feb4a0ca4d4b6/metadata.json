He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.\u201d\\n\u201cI guess Brock\u2019s plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,\u201d writes Budowsky.\\n\u201cI cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,\u201d adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad.\\nThe email once again underscores the Clinton camp\u2019s paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could.\\nSome black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as \u201csuper predators\u201d.\\n\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742562276.4898663}
