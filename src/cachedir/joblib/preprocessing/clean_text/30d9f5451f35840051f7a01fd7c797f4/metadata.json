The embassy also said that the employee, Shai Masot, who described himself as a former major in the Israeli Army now working as a political officer, would soon leave his job. Mr. Masot made the comment in October, in footage filmed in a London restaurant and obtained by the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. The recording was made by an Al Jazeera reporter acting undercover, who called himself Robin and who described himself as working for a political group called Labour Friends of Israel, which rejected any connection to him. The conversation involved Mr. Masot and Maria Strizzolo, an aide to Robert Halfon, an education minister and former political director of Conservative Friends of Israel. Mr. Masot was particularly eager to target Alan Duncan, a minister in the Foreign Office who has been critical of Israel and its settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, a sensitive issue in British politics. Mr. Duncan, he said, \u201cis causing a lot of problems. \u201d In the footage, Mr. Masot asked Ms. Strizzolo, \u201cCan I give you some M. P. s that I would suggest you would take down?\u201d he asked. He went on to say that she knew which M. P. s  \u2014   members of Parliament  \u2014   he was referring to. She asked him to remind her. \u201cThe deputy foreign minister,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Duncan. She said, \u201cYou still want to go for it?\u201d His reply was ambiguous, but he said that Mr. Duncan was still causing problems. Ms. Strizzolo then asked, \u201cI thought we had, you know, neutralized him just a little bit, no?\u201d Mr. Masot answered, \u201cNo. \u201d Mr. Masot also mocked the opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, whom he called \u201ccrazy,\u201d and his \u201cweirdo\u201d supporters. Ms. Strizzolo told the newspaper that her conversation with Mr. Masot was \u201c   and gossipy. \u201d But Crispin Blunt, a member of Parliament and the chairman of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, said the \u201capparent activity of a diplomat of a foreign state,\u201d in reference to Mr. Masot, was \u201cformally outrageous and deserving of investigation. \u201d (In the video, Mr. Masot was also very critical of Mr. Blunt.) Stuart Polak, a member of the House of Lords and the director of Conservative Friends of Israel, said, \u201cWe utterly condemn any attempt to undermine Sir Alan, or any minister, or any member of Parliament. \u201d In its statement, the Israeli Embassy said it \u201crejects the remarks concerning Minister Duncan, which are completely unacceptable\u201d and described Mr. Masot as \u201ca junior embassy employee who is not an Israeli diplomat, and who will be ending his term of employment with the embassy shortly. \u201d Mr. Regev, the statement said, spoke to Mr. Duncan on Friday to apologize \u201cand made clear that the embassy considered the remarks to be completely unacceptable. \u201d Reached on Sunday, Yiftah Curiel, the embassy spokesman, said that Mr. Masot was \u201cnot a diplomat and not a   member of diplomatic corps  \u2014   he\u2019s an assistant to the deputy ambassador, who handles parliamentary affairs. \u201d Mr. Masot, sent from Israel, has been at the embassy for about a year, on a contract that is being terminated. Mr. Curiel emphasized that the Foreign Office judged the issue concluded. \u201cThe Israeli ambassador has apologized and is clear these comments do not reflect the views of the embassy or government of Israel,\u201d a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThe U. K. has a strong relationship with Israel, and we consider the matter closed. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561857.4611728}
