We told you last week about Lee   a deaf South Korean tennis player who is ranked 143rd in the world, a notable achievement in the sport\u2019s professional era. But a keen reader informed us that more than 100 years ago, a British player who lost her hearing was also a champion. Charlotte Cooper Sterry was a rising star at a time when female players wore dresses and used wooden rackets. Her style of attacking the net and serving overhand were rare then. A year after winning her first Wimbledon title in 1895, she went completely deaf  \u2014   why is not clear.
