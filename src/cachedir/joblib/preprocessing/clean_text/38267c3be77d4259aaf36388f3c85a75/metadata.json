Dana Rohrabacher ( ) was knocked unconscious by   protesters as she attempted to leave her office, according to a report from CBS Los Angeles. [Kathleen Staunton, who works as Rohrabacher\u2019s district director, had the door of her Huntington Beach office yanked open in front of her as she tried to leave, causing her to trip, hit her head, and fall unconscious. A    girl also got caught up in the incident, but thankfully was not harmed.  In a statement, Rohrabacher said that he was \u201coutraged beyond words that protesters who mobbed my Huntington Beach office violently knocked down my faithful district director, Kathleen Staunton, causing her to be hospitalized. \u201d \u201cAnd, yes, deliberate or not, the incident came as part of a mob action that not only intimidates but coerces. Though the protesters think of themselves as idealists, they engaged in political thuggery, pure and simple,\u201d he continued.

Rohrabacher\u2019s disdain for visiting constituents led to Lola sliding her card under his door, which led to a staffer accidentally opening the door on Lola\u2019s head and the following   \u2018tussle,\u2019\u201d they continued.
