This week has been no different: The number of letters only increased over the weekend and during the first half of the week, coming in  \u2014   at their highest rate  \u2014   at around 500 per day. Many readers were still questioning The Times\u2019s election coverage  \u2014   more on that in Sunday\u2019s public editor column. Another related topic was the paper\u2019s plans to cover the Trump presidency over the next four years. Some offered suggestions. Several other writers proposed methods for responding to a president whose falsehoods, thus far, have been difficult to keep up with. Others offered words of encouragement in response to the  \u2019s barrage of angry tweets about The Times. One reader wrote: When The Times reported on Trump\u2019s first White House appointees, many readers believed that the paper was already normalizing Trump\u2019s presidency by inaccurately describing them. On The Times\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s pick to reshape the Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell, as a climate \u201ccontrarian\u201d: (A memo that went out to Times editors last year advised that the paper \u201cshould not use the shorthand \u2018climate skeptics\u2019 except when referring to the (relatively few) trained scientists who see only moderate consequences in global warming. Other doubters  \u2014   political, religious, whatever  \u2014   need a more deliberate description, like \u2018people who reject established climate science\u2019 or, subsequently, \u2018climate denialists\u2019 or \u2018climate contrarians.\u2019 \u201d) On The Times\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s pick for a top White House post, Stephen Bannon, as \u201ca   media provocateur\u201d and \u201ca nationalist media mogul\u201d: Some readers were mystified by The Times\u2019s postelection analysis. Several were concerned with a story that featured a map describing two separate Americas: one Hillary Clinton\u2019s, one Trump\u2019s. A story on the Trump camp\u2019s refusal to close the door on putting Hillary Clinton in jail raised readers\u2019 eyebrows when it compared Trump\u2019s possible investigation to President Obama\u2019s decision over whether to investigate the George W. Bush administration for torture. The sentence has since been updated, though readers were not notified. The earlier sentence read: \u201cThe decision [Trump] faces echoes one confronted by Mr. Obama and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. over whether to investigate Bush administration officials for extreme interrogation tactics against terrorism suspects that the Obama administration later deemed to be torture. \u201d It was changed to: \u201cWhen Mr. Obama took office, he and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. also faced a decision over whether to investigate the previous administration. \u201d One reader wrote: The public editor\u2019s take: The editors were wise to rethink their    comparison. Equating Clinton\u2019s email travails to the actions of C. I. A. water boarders just doesn\u2019t hold up. After a Times live briefing included the term \u201cdeath tax,\u201d a slew of readers wrote in to point out the misstep. One reader wrote: We raised the concern with the editor of the briefing he told us that the term had slipped by, and that he\u2019d discuss it with the author. (The term still remains in the briefing at time of publication.) Notwithstanding the various complaints  \u2014   and Trump\u2019s claim otherwise  \u2014   The Times this week reported a drastic uptick in paid subscriptions since the election  \u2014   41, 000, to be exact. Many of the new subscribers wrote in to our office to explain their decisions. One reader even asked how he could go a step further: Another reader said she would will be relying on The Times not just for its reporting but also for inspiration. Although we can\u2019t speak for the newsroom, we can promise Beth that the public editor\u2019s office will do its best to help the newsroom answer the call.'"}, "time": 1742564188.7785652}
