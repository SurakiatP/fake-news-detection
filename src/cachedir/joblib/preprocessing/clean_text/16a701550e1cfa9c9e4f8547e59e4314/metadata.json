Those who succeed make it difficult to appreciate how radical they were. When Helen Gurley Brown published \u201cSex and the Single Girl\u201d in 1962, her frankness about the fact that unmarried women had sex  \u2014   and liked it  \u2014   shocked reviewers and sold millions of copies. When she took over Cosmopolitan in 1965, staff members grumbled. But over the 32 years she served as editor in chief, her message  became mainstream. \u201cThere is a catch to achieving single bliss,\u201d Brown told her \u201cSingle Girl\u201d readers. \u201cYou have to work like a son of a bitch. \u201d Cosmo reiterated that any girl could diet, exercise, groom, shop, flirt and sleep her way into having it all  \u2014   another phrase that Brown helped make ubiquitous. The trick was indefatigability. Today, when career advisers exhort us to \u201cdo what you love, and love what you do\u201d and pop songs tell us to \u201cwork it,\u201d to be sexy at work and to work at being sexy not only isn\u2019t shocking it\u2019s expected. This may be why, four years after her death at the age of 90, Helen Gurley Brown is experiencing something of a revival. Matthew Weiner, the creator of \u201cMad Men,\u201d frequently cited \u201cSex and the Single Girl\u201d as a source of inspiration and urged writers for the show to read it. In the introduction to her 2014 memoir \u201cNot That Kind of Girl,\u201d Lena Dunham identified Brown as a key influence. The   pilot that Dunham is currently developing for HBO revolves around a writer for women\u2019s magazines during the early years of   feminism. A play based on Brown\u2019s life is also in the works. Now, two new biographies of Helen Gurley Brown have arrived within months of each other: \u201cEnter Helen,\u201d by Brooke Hauser, a contributing writer at Allure and \u201cNot Pretty Enough,\u201d by the longtime culture journalist Gerri Hirshey. (The feature film rights for \u201cEnter Helen\u201d were  optioned before the book was even finished.) Both books draw heavily on the personal papers that Brown bequeathed to Smith College, as well as published works by Brown and her husband, the film producer David Brown. Both authors interviewed colleagues, friends and the few relatives who survived Helen. And both highlight the exhausting feedback loop between her anxieties and her ambition. Hauser and Hirshey are not the first. In her 2009 biography \u201cBad Girls Go Everywhere,\u201d the gender and women\u2019s studies professor Jennifer Scanlon presented a rigorous assessment of the relationship between   \u201cGurley girl feminism\u201d and the more privileged precincts of the women\u2019s movement. \u201cEnter Helen\u201d and \u201cNot Pretty Enough\u201d offer engaging takes on Brown\u2019s life for a popular audience. \u201cEnter Helen\u201d focuses on the 1960s and 1970s, the decades when Hauser\u2019s heroine took off. Hauser lifted the title from a repeated stage direction in a musical that Brown tried to write about her own life, and the book has the   footed and slightly manic quality of a revue. Most chapters run only a few pages. All are signposted with dates and epigraphs. We enter in medias res, shortly before Helen married David, and follow her rise for 165 pages before flashing back to her childhood in Arkansas. \u201cGenteel poor\u201d was a phrase Helen used to describe it. She felt a keen need to compensate for her \u201cmouseburger\u201d origins for the rest of her life. \u201cHer insecurity was cellular,\u201d Hauser writes. It was also her great selling point. The improbability of her success proved that her   methods worked. Throughout, Hauser weaves in  passages connecting Brown to her contemporaries and the cultural landscape of the 1960s. These side glances not only help situate her life in the context of its times. They remind us of how many of her stances were truly progressive  \u2014   her vocal support of access to contraception and legal abortion, for instance. They also offer amusing glimpses into friendships and catty contretemps. We learn that Hugh Hefner was an early ally and that Gloria Steinem was often dismissive. Joan Didion was agnostic. A 1965 profile by Didion, published in The Saturday Evening Post, observed that Brown seemed mostly \u201cvery tired. \u201d Gerri Hirshey\u2019s \u201cNot Pretty Enough\u201d presents a narrower, but deeper, perspective. As Hirshey states in her introduction, her book is concerned more with the character and psychology of its protagonist than with her cultural surroundings. Where Hauser\u2019s method is montage, Hirshey suggests her own approach is  \u201cpointillist. \u201d \u201cNot Pretty Enough\u201d begins with contemporary reminiscences before it dissolves, like a classic Hollywood flashback, to 1893, when Brown\u2019s mother, Cleo Sisco, was born in the Ozarks. Brown\u2019s father died in a freak elevator accident in June 1932, when Helen was only 10 and her sister, Mary, was 14. Their childhood was impoverished and itinerant. Cleo moved her daughters across state lines several times before settling in Los Angeles and remarrying. Mary was afflicted by polio, while Helen suffered from disfiguring acne. Hirshey makes a strong case that the \u201cintimate rituals of utter frustration and despair\u201d that Brown shared with her hapless mother, along with her idealization of her dead father, shaped her forever. Indeed, they may have shaped the entire Cosmopolitan empire: \u201cCleo\u2019s basic   message was a dour version of the one Helen would banner with   cheer in her own best sellers and in her magazine: Honey, do the best with what you have. \u201d Hirshey\u2019s psychological insights into Brown\u2019s childhood, as well as the book\u2019s treatment of Brown\u2019s long partnership with her husband, deepen and complicate the plucky image that Brown projected in public. Given how fixated she was on the connections between sex appeal and success, it\u2019s unsurprising she struggled as she got older. After her death, Brown was treated with the special cruelty that our culture reserves for women who do not know when to desist from trying to be desirable. Even her obituary in The Times included a snide remark: \u201cShe was 90, though parts of her were considerably younger. \u201d Hauser speeds over Brown\u2019s twilight, when she turned into a grim caricature of herself, the emaciated octogenarian in fishnets doling out oral sex tips and saying reprehensibly ignorant things about H. I. V. and sexual harassment. \u201cFor all her confessions,\u201d Hauser concludes, \u201cHelen remained unknowable, even to those who knew her best. \u201d Hirshey lingers over the denouement, taking several chapters to chronicle Helen\u2019s later years as the editor of Cosmopolitan\u2019s international editions, her declining health, her    weight gain and her stunned grief after the death of David. When people asked how she was dealing with it, she offered a pantomime of nonchalance that sounds like a kind of despair: \u201cWell, I come to work every day. \u201d \u201cWrite the way you speak,\u201d Brown admonished, and for better or worse, both Hauser and Hirshey use prose strongly inflected  \u2014   you might even say infected  \u2014   with Brown\u2019s own idioms and idiosyncrasies. \u201cWas he riding on his wife\u2019s coattails?\u201d Hauser writes of David Brown. \u201cAbsolutely! And why not? She had ridden on his. \u201d The new Cosmo that he and Helen cooked up would consist of \u201cfrank discussions about sex, money, careers, apartments, fashion and beauty  \u2014   oh, and men, men, men. \u201d The prose of \u201cNot Pretty Enough\u201d is less cartoonish, but Hirshey\u2019s attempts to ventriloquize sometimes verge on pastiche. She describes one early lover as \u201ca Wow\u201d and a title Brown wrote as \u201ca   grabber. \u201d From time to time, Hirshey adopts the kind of   innuendo Cosmo favored. Helen\u2019s speaking voice was \u201cwell suited to the dark, whispery in tone, pleasant and   with a musky minor note of boudoir. \u201d These biographies convey the sense of desperation that attended someone whose success depended so fundamentally on  . \u201cEnter Helen\u201d shows Brown trying to become everything anyone else wanted. She insisted that she loved sex even when she did not orgasm: \u201cIt was the most marvelous feeling because, my goodness, he was looking at me, at me. \u201d \u201cRelax chin, stay at 105 pounds . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. torture!\u201d was her New Year\u2019s resolution for years. \u201cNot Pretty Enough\u201d announces this central problem in the title. Yet neither book quite answers the deepest questions it poses. Why does Helen Gurley Brown matter now? Why does her story feel so timely? Hauser, despite her vivid treatment of Steinem and Betty Friedan, simply neglects to discuss contemporary feminism. Hirshey, from the outset, dismisses questions about Brown\u2019s legacy the way she imagines Brown herself would: \u201cAw, pippy poo. \u201d \u201cI do find much of the revisionist analysis and H. G. B.   to be tedious, solipsistic and drearily beside the point,\u201d Hirshey sighs. It\u2019s a standard kind of complaint for popular writers to lob at academics. But refusing to situate Brown in the current context seems like a missed opportunity. The past few years have seen a powerful revival of feminism in the United States, along with its commercial acceptance  \u2014   or, depending on your perspective, its appropriation. In \u201cBad Girls Go Everywhere,\u201d Scanlon presented Brown as a complicated feminist figure: Cosmopolitan may have been crass, but it also disseminated feminist messages to a   audience whom the canonical front of the women\u2019s movement didn\u2019t reach. These two biographies matter precisely because Brown\u2019s life and career anticipated the tensions that countless women are talking about now. She offered a blueprint for success in a sexist world, telling readers how to game a system that was set up to exploit them. Was this the right approach? Whatever your answer, this is the same debate we are still having about the most powerful women in America, from Hillary Clinton to Beyonc\u00e9. Paradoxically, the most prominent heir to Brown\u2019s     feminism may be Sheryl Sandberg. In a 1982 interview with Gloria Steinem, Brown conceded that women faced obstacles specific to their gender, but, she insisted: \u201cYou can do pretty well anyway. You can rise above it. \u201d Sandberg hardly shares Brown\u2019s mouseburger origins, but in \u201cLean In\u201d she delivers a message Brown would have recognized. \u201cWe can reignite the revolution by internalizing the revolution,\u201d Sandberg promises. A girl can hope, and as Brown knew, hope sells eternal.'"}, "time": 1742562983.3231936}
