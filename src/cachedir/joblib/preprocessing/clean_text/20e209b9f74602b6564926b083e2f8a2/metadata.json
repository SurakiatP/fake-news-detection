Trump, Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr. who was attorney general under President Obama, to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder, who is now a prominent Washington lawyer, is the latest sign of  the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president, defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here. \u201cHaving the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California,\u201d Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the Senate, said in an interview. \u201cThis means we are very, very serious. \u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said he expected California to challenge Washington  \u2014   and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington  \u2014   on issues including the environment, immigration and criminal justice. He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency. \u201cIt was very clear that it wasn\u2019t just campaign rhetoric,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals over the past year. \u201cHe was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California. \u201d Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment. The move by Mr. de Le\u00f3n and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly, Anthony Rendon, follows Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month, to succeed Kamala D. Harris, who was elected to the United States Senate. That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the   Latino officials in this state, and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants. Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle. The Democratic Party controls   of both the Assembly and the Senate in California. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat. Mr. Holder was Mr. Obama\u2019s attorney general from 2009 to 2015. He was the first   to hold that position. He is a partner at Covington  Burling, a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government. \u201cI am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California\u2019s residents and policy priorities,\u201d Mr. Holder said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature. \u201d The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff, but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years. Mr. de Le\u00f3n said the final compensation for the firm had not been set, but would be publicly disclosed once it was. \u201cThe cost will be very minimal compared to the billions of dollars at stake if California doesn\u2019t adequately make its case,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561819.4203107}
