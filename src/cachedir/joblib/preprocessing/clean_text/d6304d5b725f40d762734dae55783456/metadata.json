Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Beyonce swear by lemon water first thing in the morning. There are even entire diets based on this fruit. According to some health advocates, drinking lemon water on an empty stomach takes you one step closer to optimal health.But does swapping your morning coffee for this fashionably healthy lifestyle choice offer any significant benefit? Or is this just another health fad? Let's take a closer look at ten incredible reasons why you should start your day with a glass of lemon water. 1. Nutrient powerhouse While low in calories, lemons are loaded with health-promoting essential nutrients, including vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. 2. Boosts immune system Vitamin C plays a major role in our immune system, and lemons are loaded with it. A strong and healthy immune system will help you keep bacterial and viral infections at bay. 3. Digestion aid The citric acid in lemon interacts with enzymes and acids involved in digestion. It stimulates digestion and the secretion of gastric juice. Furthermore, lemon juice loosens toxins in the digestive tract and may help relieve symptoms of indigestion such as bloating, burping, and heartburn. 4. Detoxifies your body Every day, we are subjected to a wide variety of chemicals and toxins present in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. While our body has its own cleansing systems, it is a good idea to put less stress on your already overworked body and give these cleansing mechanisms a boost. Lemon juice stimulates the liver by enhancing its enzyme function, thus helping your body to flush out more waste materials and toxins . 5. Boosts heart and brain health Thanks to its high level of potassium, lemon juice aids in the proper functioning of the nervous system. Furthermore, it has been shown to lower blood pressure which is a major risk factor for a heart attack. 6. Promotes glowing skin Lemons are packed with antioxidants. These little free radical fighting substances help to decrease blemishes and wrinkles for a rejuvenated, radiant skin. When applied to the skin, lemons can also reduce the appearance of scar tissue and age spots. 7. Weight loss aid While lemon juice might not be a weight loss miracle on its own, its high levels of pectin fibers curb the appetite and will help you to eat less at main meals. 8. Fights inflammation Lemon water possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties to soothe a sore throat or inflamed tonsils. Additionally, it removes uric acid from the joints, which is one of the main contributors to chronic pain and inflammation. 9. Boosts energy levels Lemons energize the body and fight feelings of depression and anxiety. So instead of having a coffee in the morning why not try a glass of lemon juice instead? 10. Hydrates your body After a night of hard work, your body is dehydrated and in desperate need of water. Lemon juice provides your body with the much-needed water and electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) to rehydrate body tissue and flush out more toxins and waste materials.While lemon water seems to be the perfect drink to prevent or cure a myriad of our daily aches and pains, not all that glitters is gold. Lemon juice can be hard on teeth enamel. Therefore, it's important to dilute it with water and rinse your mouth thoroughly with filtered water after drinking lemon juice.
