[The Daily Mail reports that the group was aboard the Captain Hook Pirate Ship dinner cruise with other revelers when they broke out into the chants, shocking other tourists on board.  Anaximandro Amable Burga, a Peruvian tourist, was on board with his Mexican wife Suly when he witnessed the scene. \u201cToday I was with Suly, my wife (who is a native of Mexico) watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat, and at the end of the show, a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol, or maybe not) began to sing the infamous \u2018Build that wall\u2019 chant louder and louder,\u2019\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Mexican tourists aboard the ship reportedly complained about the chants, but the spring breakers did not stop. The Yucatan Times denounced the chanting in an editorial Friday saying it was an act of \u201cxenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country. \u201d The paper also added that the \u201cracist hymn\u201d was \u201cfar from being an isolated incident\u201d that has drawn the ire of tourism sector workers who say that the spring breakers\u2019 actions were offensive and rude towards the Mexican people. This is not the only time chants of \u201cbuild a wall\u201d have been deemed racist by others. CNN called a video of children chanting \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at a Michigan middle school that went viral in December an example of \u201cracism. \u201d Photo: file'"}, "time": 1742628541.063125}
