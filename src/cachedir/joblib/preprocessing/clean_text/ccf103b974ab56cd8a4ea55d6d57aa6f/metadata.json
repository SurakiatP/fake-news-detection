November 2, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \\nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nLike a warped Islamic version of Santa Claus, Obama had a secret Muslim list. And his people checked it at least twice. The list was of Muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments. \\nIt included a Muslim who had described Israel as an \u201cApartheid State,\u201d Iran\u2019s \u201cgo-to guy in New York financial circles\u201d and a number of figures linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. \\nIt was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them. \\nObama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cnot American.\u201d \\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims,\u201d he huffed from Turkey. His Muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of Islamic terror. \\n\"We don\u2019t have religious tests,\u201d he insisted. \\nExcept we did and we do. Obama also had religious tests. His religious tests excluded Christians and favored Muslims. That is why his Syrian refugees were between 98% and 99% Muslim with only 68 Christians and 24 Yazidis, even though both groups are real victims of the Muslim religious war. \\nSyria is 10% Christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Yet only 68 have made it past Obama\u2019s iron curtain. That\u2019s either an Islamic religious test or the world\u2019s greatest coincidence. \\nBut would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test? \\nOf course he would. \\nThe hacked emails include a list of \u201cMuslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees.\u201d \\nThe list was sent to John Podesta who headed the Obama-Biden Transition Project. It had been put together by a woman who had sat on the Commission on International Religious Freedom, but boasted that she had, \u201cExcluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian.\u201d \\nHow \u201cshameful.\u201d How \u201cnot American\u201d of Barack Hussein Obama. \\n\u201cMost who are listed appear to be Muslim-American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian),\u201d she assured Podesta. \\nReligious tests are only out of line when they exclude Muslims. Not when they exclude Christians. \\nThat\u2019s the pattern which emerged from the Obama-Biden Transition Project and Obama\u2019s refugee policy. There has been a clear pattern of administration bias against Christians and Jews. And in favor of Muslims. That bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed Islamic supremacist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of non-Muslim populations. \\nThis policy led to the displacement and death of countless Christians, and the persecution of entire communities, by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies. \\nAdministration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored Islamic candidates. \\nObama appointed Farooq Kathwari, the first name on the \u201cMuslim list\u201d sent to Podesta, to the President\\'s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. \\nThe \u201cMuslim list\u201d email had warned that, \u201cKathwari\u2019s then 19-year-old American-educated son Irfan (aka Imran), was killed in 1992 fighting Jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan.\u201d The actions of his son, who may have been with the Mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over India\u2019s defense of Kashmir, is of less relevance than Kathwari\u2019s appearance at an ISNA conference and another conference co-sponsored by the Muslim Students Association. Both groups are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. \\nHe co-chaired the American Muslim Task Force whose members included Salam Al-Marayati , Director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which has defended Hamas and Hezbollah, Yahya Basha, president of the American Muslim Council and a former board member of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and assorted other Islamists . Its report complained that Muslims were inhibited from donating to \u201ccharities\u201d run by Islamic terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. Yahya Basha also appeared on Obama\u2019s Muslim list. \\nAlso listed was MPAC\u2019s Aslam Abdullah who had claimed that \u201cZionists,\u201d Christians and Hindus were behind the War on Terror. He had described Israel as an \u201capartheid state\u201d and a \u201cracist state.\u201d \\nThe second Muslim on the list, Cyrus Amir-Mokri, was named assistant treasury secretary. He became the first Iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the Iran nuclear sellout. Mokri attended a meeting with members of the Iran Lobby at the White House. He also reportedly advised Obama on Iranian sanctions. \\nObama had famously told NASA boss Bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was Muslim self-esteem. But Bolden almost didn\u2019t make it in. The Muslim list included two alternative candidates for NASA administrator. One of them, Dr. Charles Elachi of JPL was dismissed as \u201cpossibly Christian.\u201d Indeed Elachi, who grew up admiring John Wayne and believes that American success is possible because it isn\u2019t \"held back by the long-standing, ingrained systems and beliefs found in the Middle East\" would have been a rather poor fit. But it is deeply shameful and un-American that his potential NASA appointment questioned his religion. That is an inappropriate religious test that Obama must apologize for. \\nThe other name on the list however is Firouz Naderi, an Iranian board member of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans which advocated in support of the Iran nuke sellout. \\nEboo Patel, whose name would frequently appear on lists of Islamists in the Obama administration, first made an appearance on the Muslim List. Despite his Islamist ties, he got the posting at the Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships. Also listed were Keith Ellison, Andre Carson and Larry Shaw. Shaw sits on the board of CAIR. \\nDilawar Syed, the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments, was named to Obama\u2019s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Syed is a co-founder and chair of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islander Victory Fund which has come out for Hillary Clinton. The secret Muslim list describes him as \u201canimated by policy issues relating to the Muslim world.\u201d A similar description is appended to the bio for Kashif Zafar who served as a Co-Chair of the South Asian American Leadership Council at the DNC. \\nAlso on the list was Hamid Biglari. Bloomberg described Biglari as \"Iran\\'s Man in New York\u201d and as the Iranian president\u2019s \u201cgo-to guy in New York financial circles.\u201d Biglari was a key Iran Lobby figure. \\nThe recently revealed secret Muslim list is deeply troubling. There should be no religious test for political appointments. Yet Obama had one. And his people sought to screen out Christians and favor Muslims. \\nThis represents behavior that is in Obama\u2019s own words, \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cnot American.\u201d One can\u2019t help but conclude that, based on his own principles, Obama is shameful and not American.'"}, "time": 1742561930.0495317}
