Trump.\u201d \\n\u201cTrump Tower\u201d was a magnificent flop and Trump, staying true to his penchant for not admitting obvious failure, removed his name from the book in its second iteration and gave all credit to ghostwriter Jeffrey Robinson. However, as Trump is now to learn, once something is on the Internet it is on their forever \u2014 even if you are a not-yet-convicted sexually predatory offender with money. Below is the original listing with the U.S. ISBN agency: Jeffrey Robinson\u2019s #TrumpTower has it all. The ultra rich, powerful, and beautiful. It\u2019s your summer must-read http://t.co/lQKvIzzV \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 13, 2012 \\nIn delving into the story, which appears to have been written for those with the reading comprehension of a first grader in mind, it routinely degrades women. The opening chapter speaks of a tenant who is bound and gagged to a bed naked only to be found by one of the tower\u2019s staff: \\nThere she was, completely naked and gagged, her arms above her head, handcuffed to the top of the bedstead, with her legs tied to the bed and stretched wide apart. \\nThat sounds icily similar to the rape accusations being levied against Trump, no? The official court documents filed against Trump state : \\nDefendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff\u2019s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. \\nThe other gems of literary genius included: \\n\u201cTake off your sweatshirt,\u201d he said again. Her hands were trembling. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cTake off your sweatshirt. She reached for the bottom of her sweatshirt, but all she could do was hold onto it. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYes you can. Do as I tell you. Take off your sweatshirt.\u201d She tried to swallow, but her mouth was totally dry. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u201cDo it. Take off your sweatshirt. Do as I tell you.\u201d She closed her eyes, hesitated, then pulled off her sweatshirt. \\nAnd: \\n\u201cI\u2019d probably like his mama\u2019s titties, too,\u201d and, instead of using his key, he rang the bell. \\nOn top of the sordid sexual scenarios in Trump\u2019s book, there are disrespectful racial references: \\nCome on, you\u2019re a shoo-in.\u201d He reminded her, \u201cTwo white guys and a great-looking minority girl with perfect boobs? No contest.\u201d \\nApparently Trump was too cheap to hire an editor as the book is riddled with grammatical errors such as, \u201cIn fact, none of the apartments in the tower was numbered.\u201d \\nIn his quest for attention Trump attempted on numerous occasions to have his clap trap babble transitioned to television. The book had been in the works since the late 90s and according to Bob Frederick, who represents MVP Entertainment, \u201cWe hired a writer out of Los Angeles and developed a pilot with Showtime. And Donald was happy with it.\u201d \\nMore than a decade later in 2008 Trump pitched the story to Lifetime which presented its own disgusting irony. The likely soon-to-be-convicted sexual predator wanted his story on a network known for producing shows about sexual predators. \\nTrump\u2019s co-author, Mr. Robinson, has refused to comment on the book. However, if one were so inclined they are able to read the first few chapters for free on Amazon\u2019s kindle version , using the preview option. That is all one should read for two reasons. The first is purchasing the book would put money in Trump\u2019s pocket, and the second is ingesting the entire story will likely lead to psychosis, the loss of brain cells, and IQ points.'"}, "time": 1742563758.3897486}
