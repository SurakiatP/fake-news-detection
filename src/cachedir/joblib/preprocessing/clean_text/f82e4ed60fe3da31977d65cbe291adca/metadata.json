[\u201c  \u201d was the brainchild of Alex Godin, a    tech entrepreneur, who says Donald Trump\u2019s election inspired the event.  \u201cI woke up like a lot of Americans feeling pretty crappy on November 10,\u201d Godin told CNNMoney. \u201cI looked for an opportunity to do something. \u201d The event\u2019s organizers  \u2014   which include tech PR consultant Kara Silverman and Sam Koppelman, digital content strategist at Hillary for America  \u2014   hope to raise a minimum of $500, 000. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important opportunity to support causes like Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, Earthjustice, as they gear up to do [critical] work,\u201d Godin said. Other celebrities expected to participate in the event include Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Guest, Tim Robbins and Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy. The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California will also benefit from the fundraiser.
