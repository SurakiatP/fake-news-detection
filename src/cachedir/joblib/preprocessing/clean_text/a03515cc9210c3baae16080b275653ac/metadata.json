You are fascinated with sex and you don\u2019t care about public policy! That\u2019s what I get out of watching you tonight!\u201d \\nAt a Trump event in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, an MSNBC reporter asked Gingrich what he would say to Republican women who were \u201cupset\u201d by his remarks in Kelly\\'s interview, according to the Blaze . \\nGingrich had a pretty insightful response: \\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of Republican women write me and thank me for standing up to the baloney that is thrown at us by people who excuse Bill Clinton \u2014 ignore Bill Clinton \u2014 and then explain to us how shocked they are by Donald Trump.\" \\nHowever, not all Republican women are standing by their party. Katie Packer, a deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney in 2012, told the Washington Post the GOP has a lot to make up for after Election Day: \\n\u201cFor next-generation professional women, the party is going to have to do something very, very drastic to change the course of where this candidate has taken us. I think the leaders in our party are going to have to aggressively reject this. Come November 9, they better be prepared to make very strong statements condemning all of Trump\u2019s behavior.\u201d \\nA recent Fox News poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by three points among likely voters.
