His FBI, including a network of 15,000 paid informants, already has a record of spying on mosques and activists , and his NSA\u2019s surveillance empire is ubiquitous and governed by arcane rules, most of which remain secret. He will inherit bombing campaigns in seven Muslim countries, the de facto ability to declare war unilaterally, and a massive nuclear arsenal \u2014 much of which is on hair-trigger alert .Caught off guard by Hillary Clinton\u2019s election defeat, Democrats who defended these powers under President Obama may suddenly be having second thoughts as the White House gets handed over to a man they described \u2014 with good reason \u2014 as \u201cunhinged, \u201d and \u201cdangerously unfit.\u201d In the years after the 9/11 terror attacks, Vice President Dick Cheney and his legal adviser David Addington dramatically expanded the powers of the presidency, asserting the unilateral right in wartime to ignore legal limits on things like torture and government eavesdropping. Congressional Democrats generally caved , but made a few efforts to push back .The Democrats went silent on executive overreach when Obama was elected, however.When the New York Times revealed Bush\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program in 2005, 60 percent of registered Democrats thought the program was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d But after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed a dramatically larger surveillance apparatus in 2013, a 61 percent of Democrats said the opposite \u2014 presumably because they trusted the man in charge.The Obama administration has counted on that trust repeatedly. When defending the drone program in 2012, instead of referencing its legal standards, administration officials reassured the New York Times that Obama is \u201ca student of the writings on war by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas,\u201d and that CIA director John Brennan is like \u201ca priest with extremely strong moral values who was suddenly charged with leading a war.\u201dAfter eight years of trusting the President with expanding military power, liberals must now reckon with the fact that Obama will pass the same capabilities to a man who has proposed killing terrorists\u2019 innocent family members, who has said he would do \u201ca hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\u201d and who has suggested dipping bullets in pigs\u2019 blood is sound counterterrorism strategy.And most of the paltry few legal limitations that regulate the security state could easily be repealed by a President Trump...\\nObama has continued the Presidential tradition of going to war without Congress, sometimes in almost absurd ways. In 2011, for example, the White House needed to argue that it could continue bombing Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s forces in Libya without Congressional authorization. So the top lawyer in the State Department sent a memo to Congress arguing that a bombing campaign did not amount to wartime \u201chostilities,\u201d mainly because the enemy could not fire back. \\nEven when the Obama administration sought Congressional authorization in 2013 to strike Syrian President Bashar Hafez al-Assad\u2019s forces in retaliation for using chemical weapons, he insisted that he didn\u2019t really need to. And he has not sought out a separate authorization to extend the war on terror to fight ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Libya, Al Shabaab in Somalia, or Boko Haram in Nigeria. \\nWith such expansive war powers, and armed with the broad, Bush-era 2001 Congressional resolution authorizing war \u201cin order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism,\u201d the next President could conduct military operations on a whim.
