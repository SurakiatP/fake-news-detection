The scale of the \u201cuplift\u201d is estimated to be between two and two and a half metres. @TonkinTaylor/Twitter / Via Twitter: @TonkinTaylor \\n\u201cThis is not at all surprising as Kaikoura experiences the fastest uplift as it sits on the [tectonic] plates, which are pushing up under there,\u201d marine geologist Neville Exon told BuzzFeed News. \\n\\n\u201cThe kelp positioned on top shows it is an uplift of the seabed through the sand a couple of metres,\u201d Exon said, commenting on a picture posted by Facebook user Anna Redmond. \u201cThe kelp positioned on top shows it is an uplift of the seabed through the sand a couple of metres,\u201d Exon said, commenting on a picture posted by Facebook user Anna Redmond. \\n\u201cSo much devastation,\u201d Redmond posted. One photo shows a disgruntled crustacean adjusting to life above sea level atop a bed of seaweed and abalone. \\nMore than 600 Kaikoura residents were evacuated by boat and helicopter following the quake, which killed two people. But Kaikoura\u2019s sewerage system is still not working and many train tracks and roads remain in ruins. \\nSome of the tourist town\u2019s population of 2,000 residents have chosen to remain at home until the roads are cleared.
