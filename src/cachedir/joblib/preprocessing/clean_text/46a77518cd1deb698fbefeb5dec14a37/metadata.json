[In the latest episode in extreme fake news, the foundering Newsweek Magazine has concocted an entire web of Russian connections around Trump\u2019s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon simply because Bannon knows something about Russian politics and literature.  While acknowledging that Steve Bannon, \u201chasn\u2019t been implicated in any of the ongoing probes\u201d into \u201cmurky connections\u201d with Russian hackers and spies, and while further noting that Bannon \u201cisn\u2019t under investigation by the FBI for possible collusion with the Kremlin,\u201d Newsweek writer Owen Matthews insists that something even more nefarious is going on between Bannon and the Kremlin. \u201cBut Bannon\u2019s ties to Russia are ideological,\u201d Matthews proclaims, \u201cand therefore, arguably, they\u2019ve had a more profound impact on White House policy with Moscow. \u201d Hitting a new low in fake news, Newsweek doesn\u2019t even bother citing \u201cunnamed sources\u201d in relating its imaginary version of White House intrigue, but simply puts forward unsourced allegations that \u201cBannon was booted off Trump\u2019s National Security Council in a White House coup\u201d that was partly about \u201cwhether to appease a resurgent Kremlin or confront it. \u201d In his rambling piece, titled \u201cAlexander Dugin and Steve Bannon\u2019s Ideological Ties to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d Matthews makes the verifiably erroneous claim that Bannon \u201chas praised not only Putin but also a brand of Russian mystical conservative nationalism known as Eurasianism. \u201d Matthews does not explain to readers how Bannon\u2019s characterization of Putin as a \u201ckleptocrat\u201d that Americans have to be \u201con guard of\u201d can be considered praise. Nor does Newsweek inform us how Bannon\u2019s mere mention that Putin\u2019s belief system is based on Eurasianism should be construed as anything other than analysis, and has nothing to do with \u201cpraise. \u201d Still, in his magnificent house of cards, Matthews imagines that \u201cBannon and the  \u2019s admiration for Putin has come into direct conflict with the White House\u2019s new policies. \u201d Not content with this sophomoric application of guilt by association, Matthews goes further still, suggesting that the slogan \u201cAmerica first\u201d somehow relates to the worldview of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin, whose philosophy \u201cglorifies the Russian Empire. \u201d This is like saying that Charles de Gaulle must have been in cahoots with Cambodian dictator Pol Pot because the two were nationalists. Despite no   ties between Bannon and Dugin, Matthews alleges that they \u201chave common cause in the idea that global elites have conspired against ordinary people \u2014  and the old order must be overthrown. \u201d Bannon \u201cseems to admire Dugin,\u201d Matthews proposes, a theory for which he adduces no evidence, evidently springing from his overly fertile imagination. At best, Matthews sees common threads running through Bannon and Dugin\u2019s speeches and concludes that they must somehow be colluding or at very least admire one another. Since Bannon believes that \u201cindividual sovereignty of a country is a good thing,\u201d Matthews suggests, he must have Russian ties, because this is \u201cprecisely what Putin\u2019s Kremlin is promoting as it backs anti \u2014  European Union candidates from Hungary to France. \u201d By this strained logic, anyone who believes that national sovereignty is a positive value must therefore be a supporter of Putin\u2019s Kremlin. After saying literally nothing of substance in his exhaustingly   article, Matthews arrives at the ridiculous conclusion that the \u201cideological honeymoon\u201d between Trump and Bannon is over. \u201cThe only question now is whether Bannon can survive the divorce. \u201d Truth be told, Owen Matthews and Newsweek are not completely to blame for their exercise in groundless  . They are following the example of an equally fatuous story published by the New York Times last February. Remarkably, the Times dedicated an entire article to Steve Bannon\u2019s familiarity with the writings of Italian philosopher Julius Evola \u201cwho inspired Fascists,\u201d and therefore must somehow share his worldview. In the eyes of the New York Times, literacy has now become a crime. \u201cThe fact that Bannon even knows Evola is significant,\u201d the article eerily reports, citing Mark Sedgwick, a British intellectual teaching in Denmark. While admitting that the entire connection amounted to \u201ca passing reference by Mr. Bannon to an esoteric Italian philosopher,\u201d somehow the Times saw fit to produce a   essay in a desperate effort to tease out a dark association between the two men. Nowhere but in the discredited mainstream media could such   be seriously proposed as anything remotely akin to true journalism. Reporting on the news is being systematically replaced by news fabrication. Apparently, propaganda vehicles like Newsweek and the New York Times have reached the conclusion that their readers are so ideologically driven that facts no longer matter at all. Any story \u2014  however baseless and absurd \u2014  is worth publishing as long as it advances the narrative that   want to believe. Follow Thomas D.
