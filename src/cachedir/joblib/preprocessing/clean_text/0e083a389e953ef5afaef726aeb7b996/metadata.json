N. C. \u2019s apparent transformation from a celebrated liberation movement with cherished ideals to a corrupt party interested in   and  . But in the weeks since the Aug. 3 municipal elections, the A. N. C, which remains in power at the national level, has brushed aside calls from inside and outside the party to replace the   president, Jacob Zuma, before the end of his term in 2019. Instead of introspection, Mr. Zuma and his allies have moved aggressively to tighten their grip on the state\u2019s coffers, surprising opponents and allies alike with their undisguised moves. With little explanation, Mr. Zuma announced that he would directly oversee the state enterprises that have long been the source of public corruption. And his allies have renewed their attacks on Mr. Zuma\u2019s finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who has built a reputation for probity and has tried to uproot malfeasance in government even one of the A. N. C. \u2019s closest allies, the South African Communist Party, has described the moves against the minister as intended to \u201cweaken Treasury\u2019s struggle against corruption. \u201d \u201cThis is further confirming the people\u2019s suspicions about the A. N. C. ,\u201d said Sasabona Manganye, the chairman of the Sefako Makgatho branch of the A. N. C. in Johannesburg, which has called on Mr. Zuma and the party\u2019s top leaders to resign. \u201cUnfortunately, the biggest loser out of all of this is the A. N. C,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the A. N. C. leaves Zuma to remain president until 2019,\u201d he added, \u201cwe should just accept that Zuma will be the last president that the A. N. C. had. \u201d The party\u2019s reaction to the rebuke of voters has deepened doubts that, 22 years after winning power after the end of apartheid, it can fully transform itself from a liberation movement to a   political party. Will it suffer the fate of Africa\u2019s other liberation movements, which, years after abandoning their original ideals, have clung to power through patronage, coercion or even force? The liberation movements that helped free much of southern Africa decades ago are still in power  \u2014   in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and Angola. Like the A. N. C. they have used their liberation credentials to maintain their grip on power and to fend off rivals. But their records in government have been mixed at best, or, in the case of Zimbabwe, deeply tarnished. \u201cWe\u2019re in the lingering days of these liberation movements,\u201d said Roger Southall, a professor emeritus at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and an expert on liberation movements. \u201cThey\u2019re not suddenly going to lose power,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ll go on organizationally. But they\u2019ve certainly lost their shine, the hopes that they were embodied with, and, in South Africa, that process has been hugely accelerated by the Zuma presidency. \u201d Many African nations gained their independence in the 1960s after former colonial rulers withdrew from the continent. But the liberation movements took up armed struggle against colonial powers or white settlers, in that way gaining greater moral authority. In the constellation of liberation movements, none shone brighter than the A. N. C. and its most famous leader, Nelson Mandela. To liberation movement leaders like Mr. Zuma, who said last year that the A. N. C. \u201ccomes first,\u201d even before the nation, nothing remains more vital than the movement. Many leaders have described their movement in religious terms, including Mr. Zuma, who until last month often said that the A. N. C. would rule \u201cuntil Jesus comes. \u201d The qualities that were prized in liberation leaders and movements have often proved detrimental in government. \u201cThe A. N. C. is now being forced to change into a political party,\u201d said Rekgotsofetse Chikane, a university student leader and A. N. C. member who is the son of a famous party leader, the Rev. Frank Chikane. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a political party in name, it is still a liberation movement through its actions  \u2014   the way it thinks about how it\u2019s going to deliver services, the way it builds its rhetoric and the way it defends itself. \u201d Because of its past as a liberation movement, the younger Mr. Chikane said, the A. N. C. practices a \u201ccentralized democracy\u201d in which leaders simply give commands and are not used to a    with other party members or with voters. Given the strength of South Africa\u2019s democratic institutions compared with those of its neighbors in the region, Mr. Chikane said he was optimistic that the party would successfully transform itself. But he said it would be an arduous process because many in the party, shocked by last month\u2019s elections, were focused simply on retaining power through two more presidential elections, or through 2024. \u201cThose who\u2019ve been pillaging the state in one way or another will pillage as much as possible until the last possible moment, so that when the game is over, they will be set for the rest of their lives,\u201d Mr. Chikane said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see with parastatals,\u201d he added, referring to state enterprises. In Zimbabwe, the same liberation movement and leader remain in power 36 years after the end of white minority rule. In the first years after liberation, decades before Zimbabwe degraded into a kleptocracy, President Robert Mugabe and his   party were celebrated around the world, including by Western governments, as embodying the hopes of a new Africa. Over the weekend, Mr. Mugabe accused the West of continuing to plot to replace southern Africa\u2019s liberation movements with \u201cpliant puppet regimes. \u201d Zimbabwe\u2019s economy is in free fall government workers, who make up most of the 10 percent of Zimbabweans fortunate enough to be employed in the formal sector, are being paid weeks late because of the government\u2019s severe cash shortage. The fierce struggle to succeed Mr. Mugabe, increasingly frail at 92, has dominated the capital, Harare, in recent months. Zimbabwe\u2019s political elites have focused their attacks on rivals\u2019 liberation credentials  \u2014   exhuming events that occurred generations ago. Joice Mujuru, a liberation hero known by her nom de guerre, Spill Blood, served as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s vice president for a decade until she was expelled from the governing party in 2014.   officials, who once lauded her wartime heroics, have been calling her a fraud since she created her own party this year. They say that the act of heroism for which Ms. Mujuru became famous  \u2014     shooting down an enemy helicopter  \u2014   was a fabrication. In turn, Ms. Mujuru and her allies have said that Mr. Mugabe  \u2014   an intellectual who was imprisoned for years before becoming one of the liberation movement\u2019s political leaders  \u2014   was not a war veteran. He did not see combat, they said, and did not even have a nom de guerre. \u201c  and the A. N. C. will never change because their support is based on the history of their liberation struggles,\u201d said Margaret Dongo, a former   politician who is now allied with Ms. Mujuru. \u201cThat\u2019s their trump card. \u201d Ms. Dongo, who also fought during the war of liberation and was known as Tichaona Muhondo, or We Shall See in the War, led the latest riposte against Mr. Mugabe and his liberation credentials. The    has reinforced the popular impression that the country\u2019s politicians make up a class out of touch with the nation\u2019s problems. \u201cPeople are concerned about the    issues of this country and not how this and that became a hero or turned into a villain,\u201d said Richmond Gumbo, a student who was reading newspapers in the library of the University of Zimbabwe in Harare recently. He added, \u201cLeaders need to bow down to the needs, the basic needs of the people, and not to brag about how they fought in the liberation war over 36 years ago. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564327.210941}
