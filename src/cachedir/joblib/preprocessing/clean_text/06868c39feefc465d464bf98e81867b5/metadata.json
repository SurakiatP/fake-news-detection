Limit the number of relievers, end the intentional walk, limit the time and frequency of replays all these issues and more have found their way to Commissioner Manfred\u2019s desk. [Another area in need of improvement, in their minds, was found by The Good Phight, the blog at SB Nation which covers the Philadelphia Phillies. They discovered that there aren\u2019t enough minorities in MLB broadcasting booths.  According to Hardball Talk, \u201cOf 164 announcers in 30 teams\u2019 booths, 148 (90. 2 percent) are white men. Only nine are   men (5. 5 percent) five are Latino men (3. 0 percent) one is an Asian man (0. 6 percent) and one is a white woman (0. 6 percent). \u201cThere are only two broadcast teams with multiple persons of color: the Twins (Torii Hunter and LaTroy Hawkins) and Angels (Victor Rojas and Jose Mota). 17 broadcast teams are comprised of only white people. \u201cThe broadcast booths do, however, reflect viewership. Cohen, citing Nielsen stats, notes that 83 percent of those who watch baseball on television are white and 70 percent are men. \u201d Bill Baer of Hardball Talk concludes by saying, \u201c  \u2026    I am pessimistic about baseball\u2019s future with its reluctance to cater to a younger, more diverse audience. MLB was, until only very recently, behind the times in technology and social media and still is in some ways. It has made no effort to curb culture policing by white players past and present. \u201cIf MLB wants to remain a mainstay in the sporting realm, it will have to bridge the demographic divide as much as it has recently bridged the technological divide. \u201d The idea that MLB hasn\u2019t reached out to minorities is ridiculous. The league has hosted tournaments and helped build ballparks in   neighborhoods for years. Commissioner Manfred even fired the league\u2019s leadership search firm after teams failed to hire any minorities for managerial and GM positions. Have those efforts yielded great results? Evidently not, but those failures should not be confused with a lack of effort. MLB has clearly attempted to increase its appeal to minorities. The problem is, despite those efforts minorities don\u2019t necessarily seem more interested in playing baseball. Perhaps that will change in the near future. Hopefully it will, yet right now it doesn\u2019t seem clear that MLB\u2019s efforts have worked. Which brings us to the point about the study pertaining to the lack of minority broadcasters. The problem isn\u2019t that there aren\u2019t enough   in the broadcast booth, the problem is that there aren\u2019t enough of them on the field. Channeling Hillary Clinton here for a moment, what difference does it make, if MLB teams hire more black broadcasters? Are black high school and college players going to become more likely to pursue a career in baseball because the number of black broadcasters directly mirrors the percentage of blacks in the general population? What baseball needs, especially after the retirement of Vin Scully the greatest sports broadcaster of all time, is an infusion of great   and   artists. If those guys happen to be black, then great. What we don\u2019t need is yet another social justice crusade. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn'"}, "time": 1742562057.7549016}
