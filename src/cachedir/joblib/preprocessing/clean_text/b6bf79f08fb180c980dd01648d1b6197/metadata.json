[\u201cIn some degree there\u2019s a difference between Gawker and Breitbart,\u201d claimed Denton during an interview with Digiday. \u201cGawker is sensational, shameless news that is grounded in truth, a dramatic version of the truth, but it is the truth. While Breitbart and fake news on Facebook are further escalation: They are not just sensationalization of the truth, but also go beyond the truth. \u201d  Denton went on to add that the left needs to adopt a nicer approach to beat Breitbart News and the rise of conservatism, before falsely associating Breitbart with Nazism. \u201cI think the answer to Breitbart is not going to be, \u2018Let\u2019s do more aggressive fake news on the left,\u2019\u201d Denton explained. \u201cThere might be some Zen Buddhism response to Breitbart. It is going to be hard because the sensation is you want to punch the Nazi, but they have the guns. \u201d Gawker Media became infamous for publishing news that often ruined or negatively impacted people\u2019s lives before it was bankrupted and shut down following a lawsuit from one of its targets. \u201cFacebook makes me despise many of my friends, and Twitter makes me hate the rest of the world,\u201d said Denton during his SXSW panel, before praising Reddit as the model of the future. \u201cEven if we\u2019re full of despair over what the Internet has become, it\u2019s good to remind yourself when you\u2019re falling down some Wikipedia hole or having a great conversation with somebody online \u2014  it\u2019s an amazing thing,\u201c he concluded. \u201dIn the habits that we enjoy, there are the seeds for the future. That\u2019s where the good Internet will rise up again. \u201d Last year, Denton and Gawker were forced to pay out $140 million to Hulk Hogan following a lengthy lawsuit over the gossip outlet\u2019s unauthorized posting of Hogan\u2019s private sex tape. The lawsuit was backed by PayPal   and billionaire Peter Thiel, who himself had been affected in the past by the outlet after being outed as gay, and forced Denton to file for bankruptcy. At SXSW on Sunday, Denton claimed that Thiel had become a \u201cnational figure\u201d and \u201cextremely prominent\u201d in American politics and culture. \u201cPeter Thiel, through his financial support of litigation and his support for political disruption through Donald Trump, has become a national figure,\u201d Denton proclaimed. \u201cHe has become extremely prominent and an avatar, an embodiment, of the merger of the reactionary elite with a kind of populist celebrity in Donald Trump. \u201d Thiel is not the first homosexual that Gawker outed, while the gossip media empire also mocked the death of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s dog, accused actor James Franco of being a rapist, encouraged readers to pirate Quentin Tarantino\u2019s film The Hateful Eight, published several celebrities\u2019 nude photos, and refused to remove an uploaded video of the potential rape of a girl in a bathroom. When former Gawker editor A. J. Daulerio was asked in court what the limits would be in deciding not to publish a sex tape, he replied that the video would have to feature someone aged four or under. Following the controversy, Gawker Media was bought by Univision, who made it their first act to shut down the media company\u2019s flagship site, Gawker, and rebrand themselves as Gizmodo Media. Since filing for bankruptcy, Denton was denied the ability to lease his $4. 25 million apartment in Manhattan, and he has since moved into a cheaper property. Hogan has since purchased a $1. 6 million beach house. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
