Close Authorities say Silver\u2019s body was found facedown still clutching onto several dozen Marist College surveys. NEWS November 4, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 43 \u00b7 News \u00b7 Election 2016 \\nEL PASO, TX\u2014Saying they were forced to use lethal force after the statistician and FiveThirtyEight founder attempted to breach a secure checkpoint, United States Border Patrol agents confirmed Friday that Nate Silver was gunned down while trying to cross into Mexico with all the polling data from the 2016 general election. \\nA government spokesperson stated that the 38-year-old political blogger, who presented a patrolman at the border crossing with a doctored U.S. passport listing his name as Rafael Ignacio Salvador, reportedly appeared agitated and nervous when responding to simple questions, resulting in his being flagged for further screening and apparently prompting his decision to flee. Silver is said to have rammed his vehicle into a patrol car during his attempt to evade authorities before trying to escape on foot with as many national and state-level opinion polls as he could carry, at which time he was shot repeatedly by multiple officers. \\nSilver was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter. \\n\u201cUpon initial contact, border agents found Mr. Silver to be acting erratically and noticed what appeared to be a large quantity of materials concealed under a blanket in his backseat,\u201d said Division Chief David Stefans. \u201cWhen instructed to pull his vehicle to the side for further inspection, Silver abruptly accelerated forward and crashed through a barrier, leaving agents with no choice but to discharge their weapons. A subsequent search of the scene yielded over 20 months\u2019 worth of surveys of likely voters, election models, and long-term electoral forecasts concealed in numerous places throughout the vehicle.\u201d \\n\u201cWe can verify at this time that Mr. Silver was in possession of every piece of U.S. polling information dating back to last spring when he attempted to flee the country,\u201d Stefans added. \\nOfficials stated that in addition to the thousands of presidential election polls found strewn about Silver\u2019s 1984 Oldsmobile 98 following the incident, investigators discovered hundreds of weighted congressional forecasts hidden within the car\u2019s wheel wells. The entirety of Silver\u2019s polls-only and polls-plus forecasts since the beginning of the primaries were also reportedly discovered inside the car\u2019s hollowed-out speaker system. \\n\u201cAfter he sideswiped a barricade, his trunk popped open, and all these Zogby and Pew surveys came flying out all over the road,\u201d said long-haul trucker Ernesto Nunez, who described watching Silver struggle out of his wrecked vehicle still clutching an armful of high-sample-size phone and online opinion polls. \u201cEven after they struck him a couple times, you could see he was still trying to hold onto as many A-plus\u2013rated surveys as he could.\u201d \\n\u201cHe might have made it, too, if he\u2019d just dumped all the Monmouth University tracking polls on the ground and made a quick break for the Rio Grande,\u201d Nunez added. \\nAccording to authorities, a posthumous search of Silver\u2019s person also found a stash of bullet-ridden Ciruli Associates and ABC News/Washington Post polls duct-taped to his legs and abdomen. While officials refused to speculate on the matter, they noted that an autopsy would be conducted in the next several days to determine if the statistician had ingested any further polling data or secreted it in any of his orifices for transport across the border. \\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d removed every poll from the vehicle after we pried open the glove compartment and found all the Rasmussens he\u2019d stuffed under there, but then we cut open the upholstery of the seats and realized he\u2019d packed them full of swing state demographic analyses,\u201d said Border Patrol agent Paul Vasquez. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we had the K-9 unit go through the vehicle that we discovered Silver was actually using a false bottom under the car\u2019s chassis to smuggle every candidate favorability rating since Ted Cruz announced he was running for the presidency. This guy was thorough.\u201d \\n\u201cWe hate to use deadly force, but we\u2019re incredibly lucky we stopped him when we did,\u201d Vasquez continued. \u201cMr. Silver could have left our country with absolutely no polling numbers, no electoral projections, and no approval ratings just days before the election.\u201d Share This Story: Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \\nGive your spam filter something to do.
