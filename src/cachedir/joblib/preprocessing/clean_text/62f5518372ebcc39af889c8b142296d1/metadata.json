[The unnamed student was expelled from Amherst College despite arguing that his accuser had actually assaulted him, while a judge blocked his attempt to subpoena his accuser into releasing text messages on the grounds that   the case \u201cwould impose emotional and psychological trauma\u201d on her.  \u201c[The student] was blackout drunk at the time \u2014  a detail that Amherst administrators deemed \u2018credible,\u2019 on subsequent review,\u201d wrote Reason, who used the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d placeholder name for the student, before adding, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s questionable whether a blackout drunk student can actually provide the level of consent that Amherst\u2019s sexual misconduct policy requires. \u201d The incident in question took place years ago, during the late night   early morning hours of February   2012. Jones was Doe\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s roommate at the time. Jones went to Doe\u2019s dorm room and sexual activity ensued: Jones performed oral sex on Doe. But Doe was blackout drunk at the time \u2014  a detail that Amherst administrators deemed \u201ccredible,\u201d on subsequent review. Of course, it\u2019s questionable whether a blackout drunk student can actually provide the level of consent that Amherst\u2019s sexual misconduct policy requires. Other factors cast doubt on the idea that Jones was the victim and Doe the perpetrator. After leaving Doe\u2019s dorm room, Jones texted another male student and asked him to come to her dorm room for sex. She also texted a residential advisor about her \u201cstupid\u201d decision to engage in sexual activity with her roommate\u2019s boyfriend. In these text messages, Jones admitted that she was \u201cnot an innocent bystander. \u201d She also complained about how long it was taking this second male student to do anything sexual with her. She did not file a complaint against Doe until two years later. Based upon the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard that was established by the Obama administration, Doe was expelled from Amherst. Legal scholars KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor of The Volokh Conspiracy at The Washington Post argue that the preponderance standard established by the \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter of the Obama administration \u201ctold all of the more than 7, 000 colleges that receive federal money to use the lowest possible standard of proof\u201d in determining the outcome of sexual assault cases on college campuses. President Trump\u2019s Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos was harshly criticized by the left for donating to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) which supports the notion that the burden of proof in campus sexual assault cases should be higher and that all accused should be afforded proper due process.
