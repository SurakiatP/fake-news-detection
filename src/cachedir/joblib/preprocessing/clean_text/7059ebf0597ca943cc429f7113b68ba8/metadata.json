In probate documents filed with the Carver County District Court in Minnesota, Tyka Nelson, 55, Prince\u2019s sister, said that her brother died without a spouse, children or surviving parents, and that \u201cI do not know of the existence of a will. \u201d Ms. Nelson\u2019s petition also listed five   as heirs, and asked the court to appoint a special administrator for the estate \u201cbecause no personal representative has been appointed in Minnesota or elsewhere. \u201d Minnesota law treats surviving   the same as full siblings, raising the possibility of a   family battle. In the music business, Prince  \u2014   who died on Thursday at 57  \u2014   was known as a mercurial star who cycled through lawyers and representatives frequently, and who often preferred to deal personally with record companies, concert promoters and even digital music services. But that history of   could have severe consequences if Prince did not leave an orderly estate  \u2014   a strong possibility if no will turns up, several   lawyers and executives said. \u201cIt could be a huge tragedy,\u201d said Howard E. King, a veteran entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles who represented Prince in the past. \u201cYou could have a difference in valuation of hundreds of millions of dollars depending on whether the right people get in there to manage the legacy of Prince. \u201d A lawyer for Ms. Nelson did not respond to requests for comment. The probate court has not identified an executor, and estimates of Prince\u2019s net worth and of the value of his estate have varied widely. Forbes magazine last estimated his earnings in 2005, when it said that he made $49. 7 million before taxes that year. But Prince\u2019s worth could be much greater now, particularly since two years ago he took control of his valuable publishing catalog  \u2014   the copyrights for songwriting  \u2014   and negotiated a favorable new deal with Warner Bros. his former record company. Since his death, Prince has sold at least 650, 000 albums and 2. 8 million tracks in the United States, according to Nielsen. Beyond his music, Prince, who was born Prince Rogers Nelson, owned extensive property in the Minneapolis area. Its value is unclear, but Paisley Park, his studio complex in the suburb of Chanhassen, Minn. has been assessed at over $7 million, according to Carver County public records. Since Prince\u2019s death, music industry executives  \u2014   including even those he dealt with closely  \u2014   have been anxiously awaiting word about who controlled the estate, which includes Prince\u2019s \u201cvault\u201d of unreleased recordings. This voluminous collection has long been legendary among fans and collectors, and Prince stoked that interest. \u201cI didn\u2019t always give the record companies the best song,\u201d he once told Rolling Stone. But who now has the power to make the decisions about the music in that vault is unclear. Prince was known to be exacting in his dealings with record companies, and fought hard to retain as much control as possible. Ms. Nelson\u2019s petition, which was first reported by TMZ, asked the court to name an affiliate of the Bremer Bank in St. Cloud, Minn. as the special administrator, saying that the bank had provided financial services to Prince and had knowledge of his business affairs. A bank spokeswoman said it was not bank policy to reveal information about customers, but added that \u201cour sympathies are with family and fans in mourning the loss of a talented musician and Minnesotan. \u201d In addition to Ms. Nelson, the document lists as heirs three   John Nelson, Alfred Jackson and Omar Baker and two   Norrine and Sharon Nelson. An autopsy was performed on Prince, but its results are not expected for several weeks. A police investigation is continuing. As fans have swarmed Paisley Park and other musical sites around Minneapolis, the music industry has also been paying tribute to Prince, with executives hoping that the estate is sorted out quickly and managed well. A frequent comparison has been to the estate of Michael Jackson, who was badly in debt when he died in 2009 but had a will that estate has since earned hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cPrince was a major star and a cultural influencer, but he was a human being,\u201d said Kenneth J. Abdo, an entertainment lawyer in Minneapolis. \u201cIt comes down to taking care of business. If you don\u2019t take care of it, you\u2019re leaving a mess to the family or the courts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628379.7043834}
