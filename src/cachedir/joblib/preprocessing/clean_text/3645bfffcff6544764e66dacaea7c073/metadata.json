She was not so interested in what was happening on the water. \u201cYou will notice that the commentators are not speaking French,\u201d she said, indignantly. \u201cIn the venue, none of the signs are in French. \u201d Monitoring the use of French at the Olympics is a frustrating and quixotic job, particularly when the Games are being held in a    country preoccupied with    matters like street crime, economic chaos and how to cram thousands of excitable spectators into the beach volleyball venue. But Rule 23 of the Olympic charter states that the Games have two official languages, and Ms. Jean\u2019s organization, which represents 80 Francophone countries, is determined to make sure nobody forgets that one of them is French (the other is English). \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle each time you have the Olympic Games, in a different country and a different city,\u201d Ms. Jean said. \u201cWe must be there to make sure the French signs and documents and information are there. We have 3, 000 athletes and a lot of people in the public from Francophone countries. \u201d Rule 23 is no accident. As the founder of the modern Olympic Games at the turn of the 20th century, Pierre de Coubertin got to choose what language they would be in, and he was French. But as the century wore on, and English became more dominant as a common international language, French usage at the Games began to fall by the wayside. This alarmed the   world and the Francophonie organization, one of whose goals, it says, is to \u201ccombat the perverse effects of globalization on languages. \u201d At each Olympics since Athens in 2004, the group has appointed a person known as le Grand T\u00e9moin  \u2014   the Great Witness  \u2014   whose job is to make the case for, and keep track of, French usage at the Games. This year\u2019s Grand T\u00e9moin is the internationally celebrated jazz saxophonist Manu Dibango of Cameroon. (Ms. Jean, a former governor general of Canada, had the job in London in 2012.) Responsibilities include negotiating with the International Olympic Committee and the host country, closely monitoring the French situation at the Games, and producing a report afterward. The reports tend to reflect a mixture of hopefulness and dismay. \u201cIn Beijing, all Olympic signage appeared first in French, then English and Chinese,\u201d the Sochi report says, for instance. \u201cIn Sochi, the signage addressing the international audience was trilingual, but that addressing the spectators appeared in Russian and English. \u201d In addition, it pointed out, \u201cthe arrival of some new sports to the Olympic program (slopestyle and halfpipe) was not accompanied by a terminology sufficient for these disciplines to be discussed with French terms in the media. \u201d The Olympics are \u201cobviously a very important showcase,\u201d said Mr. Dibango, who is also serving as a cultural ambassador, performing with Brazilian and   musicians in Rio as a way to promote the international nature of French. \u201cI see the job as being the   of the 300 million people around the world who speak French,\u201d Mr. Dibango said. The average member of the public may have little idea that any of this is going on, but the Francophonie organization takes the issue so seriously that no sooner does one Olympics end than it starts negotiating the terms of the next one. Early discussions about French at the Rio Games were positive, Ms. Jean said, because the Brazilian government was sympathetic and because Carlos Nuzman, the president of the Brazilian organizing committee, speaks fluent French. But then the economy collapsed and the friendly government fell. When the new government came in, it had a lot on its mind, and that did not include the use of French at the Olympics. As the day of the opening ceremony approached, the Francophonie organization had no idea how the evening  \u2014   traditionally a fine time for the world to hear and appreciate a lot of beautifully enunciated French spoken by important international officials  \u2014   would go. It turned out to be a runaway success. All the main announcements and speeches were delivered in French, along with English and Portuguese. Even better, Ms. Jean said, \u201ceverything was announced first in French  \u2014   did you notice?\u201d The opening ceremony is one thing the rest of the Olympics is another. Ms. Jean visited the athletes\u2019 village, only to discover that there were   signs in the cafeteria but nowhere else. She attributed it to Rio\u2019s budget woes  \u2014   translation is expensive  \u2014   and the frantic nature of   preparations. While she understood, she said, \u201cWe were very disappointed at the situation. \u201d Visitors to the Games, too, will see that the thousands of signs at the various event venues are printed only in English and Portuguese, not in French. (Not that the English signs are anything to get excited about, seeming at times to owe more to Google Translate than to a sentient being. \u201cPress the wheelchair button if you have locomotion issues,\u201d a sign next to an elevator at the media center reads. ) At the rowing venue on Saturday, the events moved along so quickly that sometimes it was all the announcers could do to pack in the commentary in both Portuguese and English, never mind any other languages. In the stands, several (  ) spectators said that, to be honest, language was not at the forefront of their minds. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about it,\u201d said Amy Burba, 44, of Virginia. \u201cBut I heard the people behind us speaking French. \u201d Scott MacRae, a Scottish chef who was holding a beer and wearing his Union Jack on his head as a form of sun protection, said that except at the opening and closing ceremonies, French should be kept out of the Olympics. \u201cI like the French passion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to use French at the Olympics when you have them in a country that is not France. \u201d Several   rowing officials at the site bemoaned the loss of French not just at the Olympics but also in sports (and in the world) in general. Americans in particular, they said, do not speak other languages and do not really want to. French used to be the official language of rowing\u2019s governing body, FISA, but it is now used less frequently, said Jean Christophe Rolland, FISA\u2019s president. Even FISA, whose acronym stands for F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019Aviron, has had to adopt a zippy English   World Rowing, which it uses for \u201ccommercial purposes\u201d but which is slipping more and more into the rowing lexicon, he said. As Mr. Rolland talked nostalgically about the days when rowing meetings were held in French and English speakers had to listen to the translation on headphones, the Rolling Stones song \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d began playing over the loudspeakers. \u201cIt\u2019s a daily fight,\u201d he said. \u201cA daily fight. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563283.401635}
