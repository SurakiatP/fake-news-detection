B. A. finals on Monday. Coach Steve Kerr approached Draymond Green, the team\u2019s   forward, and told him that he had been suspended. \u201cHe\u2019s disappointed,\u201d Kerr said. The N. B. A. announced Sunday that the league had retroactively assessed Green with a   foul for striking the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James in the groin in the fourth quarter of the Warriors\u2019   Game 4 victory on Friday, triggering an automatic   suspension, per league rules. A   foul is less severe than a   which results in an automatic ejection. However, four flagrant foul \u201cpoints\u201d in the postseason (two points for a   one point for a  ) result in a suspension. Green, who has had trouble keeping his appendages to himself in recent weeks, already had three. It was a seismic decision by the N. B. A. with the Warriors heading into Game 5 at Oracle Arena with a     lead in the    series and an opportunity to clinch their second straight championship. Green\u2019s value to the team is difficult to overstate. In the finals, Green is averaging 14. 8 points, 9. 3 rebounds and 5. 8 assists while playing more than 38 minutes a game. Without him, the Warriors will need to find solutions by committee. Green did not address the news media. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to kill him not being there,\u201d shooting guard Klay Thompson said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to go out there and do it as a team and win for him. \u201d The Warriors sounded edgy about the situation. Andrew Bogut, the team\u2019s starting center, said he had no doubt that the Cavaliers had lobbied for Green\u2019s suspension. Bogut also described the N. B. A. \u2019s disciplinary system as one without \u201crhyme or reason\u201d and compared it to the league\u2019s draft lottery process. \u201cPull out a   ball and make a decision,\u201d Bogut said. \u201cThey made a decision, which was an interesting one. \u201d On Friday, after James pushed Green to the court late in the fourth quarter and tried to step over him, Green retaliated by swiping at James and making contact with his groin. After the game, James said he was \u201cnot cool\u201d with some things that Green had said to him. Green, in turn, took offense to the way James had stepped over him. On Sunday, Kiki Vandeweghe, the N. B. A. \u2019s executive vice president for basketball operations, said in a statement that while Green\u2019s actions in Green 4 did not merit a suspension as a \u201c  act,\u201d he was deserving of a flagrant foul. It was an accumulation of offenses that resulted in the   suspension. The series  \u2014   already physical  \u2014   has reached a heightened state. After Sunday\u2019s practice, Thompson basically accused James of being a crybaby. \u201cI guess his feelings just got hurt,\u201d Thompson said, adding: \u201cGuys talk trash in this league all the time. I\u2019m just kind of shocked some guys take it so personal. I mean, it\u2019s a man\u2019s league, and I\u2019ve heard a lot of bad things on that court. But at the end of the day, it stays on the court. \u201d When James was informed of Thompson\u2019s comments, he asked a reporter to repeat them. Then he laughed. \u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to take the high road. I\u2019ve been doing it for 13 years. It\u2019s so hard to continue to do it, and I\u2019m going to do it again. \u201d Green has always had a tendency to treat games like   acts. Consider his   blowup inside the Warriors\u2019 locker room at halftime of a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder in February. His volatility can fuel his play and that of his teammates (the Warriors wound up winning that game against Oklahoma City) but he also risks becoming a distraction. \u201cWe thrive off of Draymond\u2019s competitiveness and his edge,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cand it\u2019s been very important for us this year. And maybe that same quality has led him to this point  \u2014   just his competitiveness and his passion. And that\u2019s all part of it. \u201d Bogut said that Green had to play with emotion, otherwise he would not be nearly as effective. So the Warriors accept the pros while bracing for any potential cons. Against Portland in the conference semifinals, Green was borderline obsessed with psychological games. After guaranteeing one win, he declared that the Trail Blazers\u2019 playoff chances were dead before the series was over. His fondness for the dramatic arts bled onto the court, where he swung his arms in reaction to a call and made inadvertent contact with the official Ken Mauer, who had to seek treatment for a cut to his hand. Green\u2019s fire worked out against the Trail Blazers because he produced, averaging 22. 2 points, 11. 2 rebounds and 7. 4 assists over the course of the series as the Warriors advanced. Against the Thunder in the conference finals, Green kicked Steven Adams in the groin in Game 3, drawing a   foul, and tripped Enes Kanter in Game 4. (The league did not penalize Green for the latter offense, and perhaps he was fortunate.) But all the outside noise appeared to affect him. In Games 3 and 4 against the Thunder, Green scored a total of 12 points while shooting 2 of 16 from the field. Now, with the Warriors on the cusp of a championship, they will need to find a way to cope with his absence. \u201cWe know we have the personnel and the depth to come out and get a win, and that\u2019s all that really matters,\u201d Stephen Curry said. \u201cIt honestly doesn\u2019t matter what we think about what he did or didn\u2019t do. The situation is what it is, and we\u2019ve got to win. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562256.3597436}
