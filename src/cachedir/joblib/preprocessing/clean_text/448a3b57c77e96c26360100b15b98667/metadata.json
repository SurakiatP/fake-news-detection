The Senate confirmed him by a voice vote less than two weeks later, after a perfunctory   hearing during which the nominee smoked cigarettes and doodled while senators praised his legal skills. On Monday, one of White\u2019s former law clerks, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, will appear at his own Supreme Court confirmation hearing. It will last for days and reflect the brutal politics of a polarized era. In 2002, as a lawyer in private practice, Judge Gorsuch recalled his old boss\u2019s smooth ride and rued the modern judicial confirmation process, which he described in an article as \u201can ideological food fight. \u201d Fifteen years later, the atmosphere has grown even more rancorous and sour. In particular, Senate Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court last year was a shock to the system, said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford. \u201cThe Senate confirmation process for Supreme Court justices has always been cabined by norms of behavior and unwritten rules,\u201d Professor Persily said. \u201cWith the failure even to have a hearing on Garland, the norms have all gone out the window. The Democrats now feel emboldened to try anything. \u201d Senate Democrats have indeed pledged to probe every aspect of Judge Gorsuch\u2019s background and views. They say he has failed to distance himself from President Trump\u2019s attacks on judges, that he cannot be trusted to rein in executive power and that his jurisprudence is skewed toward business interests. It is not clear whether those critiques will resonate with the public or matter in the end. Republicans hold 52 seats in the Senate, and they say they are committed to confirming Judge Gorsuch even if that requires revisions to rules requiring a   majority. Supreme Court appointments are committed to the political branches of the government, meaning they are to some extent political by constitutional design. But politics were not always in the foreground to the extent they are today. In his 2002 article, Judge Gorsuch seemed to trace the change in tone to the lingering aftermath of the Senate\u2019s 1987 rejection of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork. \u201cWhen a favored candidate is voted down for lack of sufficient political sympathy to those in control,\u201d Judge Gorsuch wrote, \u201cgrudges are held for years, and retaliation is guaranteed. \u201d Whatever its origins, the modern confirmation process is doing harm to the Supreme Court\u2019s authority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in February last year. \u201cWhen you have a sharply political, divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cIf the Democrats and Republicans have been fighting so fiercely about whether you\u2019re going to be confirmed, it\u2019s natural for some member of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t work as Democrats or Republicans,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s a very unfortunate impression the public might get from the confirmation process. \u201d Chief Justice Roberts spoke just weeks before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia, who was confirmed in 1986, the year before Judge Bork was voted down, was the product of a different era. \u201cI was confirmed 98 to 0,\u201d Justice Scalia told a bar group in 2007. \u201cI was known as a conservative then, but I was perceived to be an honest person. I couldn\u2019t get 60 votes today. I guess the name of the game\u2019s changed. \u201d In 1991, Justice Clarence Thomas, facing accusations of sexual harassment, barely squeaked through by a    vote. Last year, he said confirmation battles had turned into total war. \u201cThis city is broken in some ways,\u201d Justice Thomas said. \u201cWe have decided that rather than confront the disagreements and the differences of opinion, we\u2019ll simply annihilate the person who disagrees with us. \u201d Things were different in 1962, Judge Gorsuch wrote, when White sailed through based on \u201chis integrity, accomplishment and life experience. \u201d \u201cExcellence plainly is no longer the dispositive virtue, as it was to President Kennedy,\u201d Judge Gorsuch wrote in 2002. Though White was nominated by the Democratic president, he was widely seen as a staunch pragmatist  \u2014   and later grew comfortable as a jurist in the court of conservative Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Instead, Judge Gorsuch wrote, \u201csome of the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated. \u201d He named two, calling them \u201camong the finest lawyers of their generation. \u201d One was John Roberts, who was then waiting to be confirmed to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The other was Judge Garland, who had waited 18 months before his confirmation to the D. C. Circuit. In January, just after Mr. Trump announced his nomination, Judge Gorsuch called Judge Garland. It was, some said, a welcome gesture of grace and respect. Others called it empty and calculated political theater. Given Republican control of the Senate, Judge Gorsuch is likely to be confirmed, though perhaps only after a momentous revision to Senate practices to eliminate the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. But justices and others worry about the cost to the Supreme Court\u2019s authority when its members are portrayed in starkly political terms. \u201cI am sad that the public has lost confidence in the judiciary,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor told law students at the University of California, Berkeley, this month. \u201cThat so many people believe we are politicized is also saddening to me. \u201d The truth, she said, is \u201cnot that the court has become politicized, but that the society has. \u201d These days, Chief Justice Roberts said last year of Supreme Court confirmations, \u201cthe process is not functioning very well. \u201d \u201cLook at my more recent colleagues, all extremely well qualified for the court,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said, \u201cand the votes were, I think, strictly on party lines for the last three of them, or close to it, and that doesn\u2019t make any sense. That suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees. \u201d   senators voted against Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. who was nominated by President George W. Bush.   senators voted against Justice Sotomayor, and 37 against Justice Elena Kagan, both nominated by Mr. Obama. \u201cThe court is increasingly being perceived as a political institution,\u201d Professor Persily said. That means, he said, that the justices \u201care less likely to be able to rely on the reservoir of good will that they have built up over time because attitudes toward the court are now swaying with the political winds as well. \u201d But there is reason to think that Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings will shift public opinion away from a purely political conception of the Supreme Court, said Lori A. Ringhand, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an author of \u201cSupreme Court Confirmation Hearings and Constitutional Change. \u201d \u201cOne of the values of confirmation hearings is the public discussion of constitutional issues in the language of constitutional law,\u201d Professor Ringhand said. \u201cI don\u2019t think hearings, over all, hurt the legitimacy of the court. Whether this particular situation hurts the legitimacy of the court will depend a lot on how it plays out. \u201d Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago, also said there was some reason for optimism. \u201cConfirmation hearings can matter a great deal,\u201d Professor Driver said. \u201cSome people say they are a boring ritual. I agree with the \u2018ritual\u2019 part but not the \u2018boring\u2019 part. What is said at the confirmation hearings indicates a lot about the shape of our constitutional conversation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628458.7255294}
