But it was actually a song transformed  \u2014   throwing off its appropriation by the far right to become an anthem of unity and hope. That change had begun to occur after the earlier Charlie Hebdo attack  \u2014   something noted by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who named 2016 the Year of the \u201cMarseillaise. \u201d This month, about 100 academics, government officials and military personnel gathered at a daylong conference at the French Defense Ministry to help mark an end to that commemoration. They debated the song\u2019s meaning, especially its climax that calls on people to \u201cwater the fields with impure blood\u201d (the debate was over whose blood it was). They discussed how its melody had inspired revolutionaries from Russia to Chile. And they listened to countless versions of it, a feminist \u201cMarseillaise\u201d going down particularly well (its chorus  \u2014   \u201cTremble, tremble, jealous husbands\u201d  \u2014   was met with laughter).   Todeschini, who is responsible for veteran affairs at the Defense Ministry, said that the Year of the Marseillaise was declared precisely so that the French, especially the young, could   the republican values of the song, which was written by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in 1792 during the French Revolution. \u201cI am thinking in particular of freedom, resistance and fraternity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt belongs to all the French, not to one political party or sectarian ideology. It\u2019s important in the current context of terrorism and risk to our social cohesion to unite all French people around our hymn. \u201d At the same time that the government has been promoting its reappropriation, others in France have been debating the value of the song  \u2014   and its ability to unite  \u2014   in less formal settings. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with the mentality of singing it,\u201d said Philippe Fragione, better known as Akhenaton, one of France\u2019s most popular rappers. \u201cI\u2019m from Marseilles and there\u2019s always been a feeling there that we have to rebel against the state. My view changed a bit after the attacks when people in other countries were singing it  \u2014   that showed solidarity  \u2014   but sometimes politicians and fake philosophers use it to point out differences, and that\u2019s a problem. \u201d Magyd Cherfi, a   writer and frontman of the band Zebda, said that in his view, \u201cthings have evolved in France\u201d over the past year, changing people\u2019s relationship to the country and the anthem. \u201cFear lives on every street now and people lose confidence in the nation. They take refuge in extremes. \u201d Mr. Cherfi has a long, complicated history with the \u201cMarseillaise. \u201d In the late 1990s, he made an album of covers of revolutionary songs, but chose not to include the anthem, saying at the time, \u201cFrance, in some ways, does not want us,\u201d referring to   immigrants like himself. However, after the Paris attacks, he wrote in a widely republished Facebook post: \u201cThere are days like this when we love France, when we want to sing the \u2018Marseillaise.\u2019 \u201d He went on: \u201cIt was carnage and it\u2019s my day of baptism. I become solemnly French. \u201d He feels the same connection today, he said, but seems less certain about the anthem. \u201cThe Marseillaise is lost in modernity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt addresses the French of more than two centuries ago. I think it is good to change the text to make it more universal, because now France\u2019s children are black, Asian, North African. They must find themselves in it. \u201d There are no surveys to reveal how common such views are, but it is just as easy to find people who celebrate the song. Georges Salines of the victim association 13onze15: Fraternit\u00e9 et V\u00e9rit\u00e9 lost his daughter, Lola, in the attack at the Bataclan concert hall and soon afterward heard the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d at a national remembrance ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m not really a fan of the tune, but it was the version by Berlioz, and it was most beautiful I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d he said. He buried his daughter on the same day. \u201cI can\u2019t separate it from those memories now. It\u2019s taken a different meaning to me, beyond an anthem. \u201d He said the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d has probably helped unite the country since the attacks thanks to its lyrics \u201cagainst tyranny, absolutism and intolerance. \u201d He said he understood why some disliked it, since he used to share many of their reservations. But he disagrees with calls to change the words. \u201cI don\u2019t like this idea of correcting pieces of art for political correctness purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are racist phrases in \u2018Tom Sawyer,\u2019 but you will not change \u2018Tom Sawyer.\u2019 \u201d The Year of the Marseillaise has not put questions of national identity at its forefront, preferring initiatives focused on educating children about the anthem\u2019s origins. Not all have been successful. A competition for musicians to cover the anthem, for instance, largely received joke entries. One simply involved Google Translate reading out the lyrics. Even the winner turned the anthem into a stark soul song. (The singer behind it, Student Kay, said this was because he found its call for sacrifice \u201cquite tragic. \u201d) Speakers at the conference this month agreed that the anthem was playing perhaps its largest role since World War II, when it helped motivate people against German invaders and the collaborationist Vichy government. \u201cIn recent years, the Front National were the only party to use these republican symbols,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Dr\u00e9villon, a professor of modern history at Paris 1 university, referring to the   party. \u201cThe attacks gave legitimacy to the other parties to   it. \u201d All the candidates for next year\u2019s French presidential election have been singing it at rallies, he added. But several speakers noted that some in France were still uncomfortable with the anthem. They either find its lyrics calling citizens \u201cto arms\u201d outdated and violent, or find the line about \u201cimpure blood\u201d inflammatory given France\u2019s colonial history.   and Corsicans booed the anthem at football matches in the 2000s. Mathieu Schwartz, a documentary maker who spoke at the conference, said such objections were not about \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d itself. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different from other national hymns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a problem with the nation, you have a problem with it. If you changed the music or words, you\u2019d still have a problem. \u201d Ismael El Iraki, a Moroccan filmmaker who has been living in Paris for 15 years and escaped the Bataclan during the attacks, said the lyrics did not need to be changed. \u201cThat infamous line about impure blood is my favorite,\u201d he said, sharing an unusual interpretation from his high school history teacher: Rouget de Lisle was calling on people to shed their own impure blood in defense of the French Revolution  \u2014   purity having been something previously associated with the aristocracy. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the \u2018Marseillaise,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIn a moment in history where purity is used as a horrible goal by jihadists and   fear mongers alike, I think it\u2019s a cool line to keep in mind, reminding us that impurity is our own, and our strength. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563904.0034468}
