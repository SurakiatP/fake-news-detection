I mean, it just seems like \u2014 that\u2019s not the FBI,\u201d Franken said. \\n\u201cWe will have hearings. I\u2019m sure that FBI Director Comey will be before us,\u201d Franken said. \u201cI think he should be able to answer questions about this, and he should be able to control the FBI.\u201d \\nThe senator also went to bat for the Clinton Foundation after Tapper questioned him on whether or not the organization should be shut down should Clinton win the election. However, the Minnesota lawmaker redirected his answer to address alleged illegal activities perpetrated by Donald Trump\u2019s foundation. \\n\u201cI think that sometimes people should compare the two foundations, the Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation \u2014 that the HIV drugs to millions of people vs. the Trump Foundation, which doesn\u2019t seem to have done much of anything for anybody other than Donald Trump,\u201d Franken said. \\nFranken also reassured viewers that he wasn\u2019t worried about which way his home state would vote in the election. \\nTrump is scheduled to visit Minnesota, a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972, as one of his last few campaign stops before Tuesday. \\nWhen asked if he felt Clinton was in trouble there, Franken replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d \\nHowever, Franken admitted, \u201cI\u2019m always nervous.\u201d \\n\u201cWe run through the finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what I tell everybody, I go to canvassing centers, I say, \u2018Many of you have jobs, many of you have families \u2014 ignore them. Get on the doors.\u2019\u201c \\nFranken\u2019s nervousness is shared by millions of Americans who worry about the idiocy of some of their family, friends, and neighbors who seem hell-bent on handing the country over to Trump tiny slimy hands. \\nFeatured image via YouTube'"}, "time": 1742561945.391431}
