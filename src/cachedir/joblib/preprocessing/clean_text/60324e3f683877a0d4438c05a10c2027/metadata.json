Mr. Tsujihara, the Warner Bros. chief executive, is on track to deliver record operating profit this year, with film leading the way. Last week, Time Warner said his division  \u2014   home to Batman, Clint Eastwood, Bugs Bunny, \u201cThe Middle\u201d and TMZ. com  \u2014   had income of $433 million, a 12 percent increase from a year earlier. Its corporate sibling HBO, by comparison, with $530 million in profit, grew 2 percent. Yet many people consider Warner Bros. a troubled operation, a notion that Mr. Tsujihara thinks is rooted in an underappreciation of the studio\u2019s   businesses and the lingering effect of film pipeline problems that it has moved past. \u201cQuietly, we\u2019ve been having an amazing year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe narrative, over all, has not reflected that. \u201d Warner Bros. sits in the long shadow of HBO, a darling of the news media and Wall Street. When ATT agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion last month, Warner Bros. was largely a footnote in the resulting analysis  \u2014   even though the studio, among other things, has promising streaming services in the works involving Harry Potter and Batman that could be supercharged by the telecommunications company. So how does Mr. Tsujihara correct the narrative? The surest way is to deliver a smash hit, and Warner\u2019s film division may be holding one in \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. \u201d Arriving in theaters on Nov. 18, the $180 million movie (not including an estimated $150 million in global marketing costs) expands J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter universe. Ms. Rowling, who wrote the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d screenplay, last month announced four sequels, news that elated fans. Reviews for \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d have not yet been published, but people (including this reporter) have been wowed in advance screenings. Set in New York in the 1920s and focused on the eccentric \u201cmagizoologist\u201d Newt Scamander, the film could sell $70 million or more in tickets in its first three days in domestic theaters alone, according to analysts. More hits could follow. Over the next year, Warner Bros. will release \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d \u201cKong: Skull Island,\u201d \u201cJustice League,\u201d Christopher Nolan\u2019s war epic \u201cDunkirk\u201d and two animated Lego movies. Salted among those behemoths are   entries from Warner\u2019s New Line Cinema unit, like \u201cAnnabelle 2,\u201d a horror movie. When it comes to recasting Warner as the   giant he believes it is, Mr. Tsujihara also knows that the studio needs to do a better job of telling its own story. Warner executives tend to hunker behind those beige walls, which allows others in Hollywood  \u2014   especially those who have left the studio under unhappy circumstances  \u2014   to do the talking for them, at times contributing to bracingly negative news media coverage. This year, for instance, some reporters and bloggers took gleeful delight in beating up Warner over the poor critical response to \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad. \u201d Lost in the criticism, Mr. Tsujihara and other members of his executive team think, has been the films\u2019 financial success: \u201cDawn of Justice\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d collected a combined $1. 6 billion worldwide. Add the box office success of \u201cSully\u201d and several modestly budgeted, expertly marketed New Line films this year, including \u201cCentral Intelligence,\u201d \u201cLights Out\u201d and \u201cThe Conjuring 2,\u201d and the studio is on pace to have one of its most profitable years ever. At a time when smaller rivals like Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment are struggling, Warner Bros. has been frustrated that its own financial success has not garnered more notice. \u201cPeople overlook our consistency,\u201d Mr. Tsujihara said. But what about those bad superhero reviews? Analysts worry that the impact of    movies like \u201cDawn of Justice\u201d could be felt down the line, perhaps when consumers weigh whether \u201cJustice League\u201d is worth their money. Mr. Tsujihara said he was confident that management changes he has been making (putting a pair of executives, Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, in charge of superhero movies, for instance) will make for more satisfied fans. With any luck, even a critic or two could come around. \u201cThe thing that really makes me confident is that I\u2019ve seen \u2018Wonder Woman,\u2019 and it\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Tsujihara said. Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst with Nomura, recently raised his   financial estimates for Warner Bros. in anticipation of ticket sales for \u201cFantastic Beasts. \u201d But he noted that Time Warner \u201cfielded exactly zero questions\u201d from analysts on last week\u2019s earnings call about its studio, with the attention going instead to the Turner cable networks and HBO. Warner Bros. would most likely contend that investors were not looking at its operation in full. While movies receive most of the attention, they actually make up a small part of Warner\u2019s overall business. The studio produces nearly 80 television series, including \u201cWestworld\u201d for HBO and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d for CBS. Warner has 10 shows airing this season that are based on DC Comics characters those shows alone generate more than $1 billion a year in revenue, according to Time Warner. Warner Bros. is also one of the world\u2019s largest video game makers, cranking out titles that include Mortal Kombat and Lego Dimensions. While most of Warner\u2019s rivals  \u2014   Disney in particular  \u2014   have struggled to develop a lasting gaming business, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment is now big enough to pick up the slack when sibling divisions underperform, as happened last year when Warner movies like \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cJupiter Ascending\u201d flopped. The studio is a growing digital force, forming a new division in June dedicated to managing investments in online networks like Machinima (dedicated to games) and Uninterrupted (pro athletes) while accelerating the rollout of   services dedicated to superheroes and, perhaps, Harry Potter. \u201cCombining with ATT will allow us to go    with brands like DC even faster,\u201d Mr. Tsujihara said. Finally, Mr. Tsujihara has moved to strengthen the studio\u2019s toys and apparel division, hiring a former Disney executive, Pam Lifford, to remake Warner Bros. Consumer Products. All those \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies play a big part in Ms. Lifford\u2019s efforts  \u2014   a consistent content pipeline is crucial to retail buyers  \u2014   as do revitalization plans around other Warner brands, including the Looney Tunes cartoons. Mr. Tsujihara says he sees consumer products as \u201ca real growth engine. \u201d Will such efforts help Warner persuade outsiders to view it more holistically? It\u2019s unclear. But at least Mr. Tsujihara\u2019s boss has noticed. \u201cKevin has a great understanding of how fast consumer behavior is changing and how the company is changing to meet their expectations,\u201d Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, said in an email. \u201cWhat\u2019s really impressed me is how he\u2019s breaking down silos and driving greater collaboration among the businesses, which is helping the company produce the right kinds of content, for the right platforms, at the right time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563080.1062763}
