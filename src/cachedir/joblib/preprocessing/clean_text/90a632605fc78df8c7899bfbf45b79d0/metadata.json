[The hotel monolith Mariott\u2019s chief executive is personally demanding Trump not enact   rights policies that could jeopardize the company\u2019s bottom line. The New York Times, which published the lies that made it possible for Fidel Castro to become the island\u2019s dictator, laments that \u201cthe United States Congress, businesses and other interested groups,\u201d including the Cuban government, may not be pleased by the changes (this is, the Times posits, a bad thing).  The foreboding tone of American liberal media coverage surrounding the potential repeal of Obama\u2019s 2014 \u201cnormalization\u201d effort demands selective memory of the Obama era\u2019s effect on the Cuban people to take seriously. His policies may have prompted optimism among the CEOs of companies like AirBNB and Carnival Cruises. But Cuban dissidents report skyrocketing rates of arbitrary arrests and an   disregard for human rights in a country that already held one of the world\u2019s worst records on the matter before 2014. Below, eleven images that capture the suffering of the Cuban people following President Obama\u2019s call for bilateral ties with the Castro regime, and the callous disregard the White House showed towards these consequences as they became impossible to ignore. February 2015: President Obama announced he would   friendly ties with the Castro regime in December 2014. Two months later, the regime challenged the call for treating dissidents with respect by not only beating and arresting members of the Ladies in White  \u2014   a dissident group whose sole act of protest is silently attending Catholic Mass on Sundays dressed in white and holding the photos of political prisoners  \u2014   but tarring one of their members, Digna Rodr\u00edguez Iba\u00f1ez.

September 2015: In a move meant to signal to the international community that they could ease the pressure on the Castro regime, Cuba invited Pope Francis to tour the city of Havana and the eastern regional capital of Santiago de Cuba. The government did not use the occasion of the pontiff\u2019s presence on the island to cease repressing dissidents, however. Zaqueo B\u00e1ez, a member of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) approached the papal convoy in Havana and shouted \u201cfreedom!\u201d within earshot of the Pope. He was beaten in front of the pope and whisked away into a police vehicle. Pope Francis later denied knowledge of the incident, though video proved he was feet away as B\u00e1ez was beaten. The photo below shows B\u00e1ez being taken away from Pope Francis. AP   Espinosa,  December 2015:      Francisco Morales had traveled to his home country every Christmas for the past decade to set up a Christmas display for the children of his Havana neighborhood without incident. After President Obama announced his \u201cnormalization\u201d measures, however, Morales was arrested for setting up animated characters like Santa Claus and Mickey Mouse on the roof of his family home. Cuba is an atheist state that has persecuted and tortured Christians since the 1960s and only allowed leftist Liberation Theologists and Jesuit Catholics to operate unperturbed on the island in recent years. Evangelical Christians, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and   Adventists are especially subject to arrest and other state abuse.  @CubanetNoticias,  January 2016: Cuban dissidents from a number of prominent groups on the island regularly suffer actos de repudio, \u201cacts of rejection,\u201d in which the government sends angry mobs to their homes to intimidate and insult them. In a particularly brazen rejection of international human rights norms, one acto de repudio featured a bonfire made up of copies of the United Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Marti Noticias. March 2016: President Obama\u2019s trip to Cuba triggered some of the Cuban government\u2019s most aggressive abuses against dissidents. Below, the mass arrests of dozens of Ladies in White, grabbed by the clothes and hair and beaten into submission, shortly before the president\u2019s arrival. Adalberto    Images,  March 2016: The oppression was not limited to Ladies in White. One Cuban dissident succeeded in using the occasion of President Obama\u2019s visit to protest live on American television. Yasser Rivero Bon\u00ed, the son of a Lady in White who has lost most of his vision following beatings by Castro police, ran onto the set of ESPN and interrupted Bob Ley\u2019s live broadcast to call for freedom on the island. Within seconds, a sqaud of   Cuban police apprehended and whisked him away.  .  March 2016: President Obama was not the only   visitor to the island this month. The Rolling Stones, a British band that Fidel Castro had banned from the island for their \u201cimperialist\u201d music, played a \u201chistoric\u201d concert for those in the government\u2019s good graces that month. Naturally, this irked Cuba\u2019s punk rock community, and in particular the band Porno para Ricardo, who writes punk music against the regime. In protest, they played a \u201cconcert\u201d titled \u201cPublic Scandal,\u201d in which they stood in silence, holding their instruments, for the duration of a concert. Porno Para Ricardo social media,  March 2016: President Obama completed his itinerary in Cuba, delivering a speech in which he quoted poet Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, stopping for   under the image of Castro butcher Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara at the Plaza of the Revolution, and attending a baseball game with Ra\u00fal Castro.

In the below photo, he was conducting his 23rd hunger strike against the Castro regime. In this one, he also refused water. The below photo shows friendly trying to carry him to a local hospital after he had lost mobility.

Llorente interrupted the Castro\u2019s May Day parade  \u2014   an international celebration of communism  \u2014   by running in front of the parade waving an American flag. Llorente became an active dissident following the \u201cnormalization\u201d announcement, using his American flag to welcome Carnival Cruises to Havana, where Cuban agents berated and insulted him. Llorente was placed in a mental institution following his act of defiance in May. AP   Espinosa.  Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564197.0582707}
