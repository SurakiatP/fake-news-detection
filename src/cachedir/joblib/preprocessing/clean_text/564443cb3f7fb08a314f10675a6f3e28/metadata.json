People were standing around and filming his \u201cbrave act\u201d, we imagine it took several minutes to accomplish this, yet no one intervened, no one called the cops.\\nMost of the fake accusers have already been debunked but batshit crazed liberals still push on the narrative that Trump is a rapist.\\nThis is a classic tactic from Saul Alinsky of whom Hillary Clinton idolized and based her college thesis on. Divert attention away from your issues with the same issue but falsely accusing it on your opponent. Nice!\\nSo Hillary wants to divert attention away from her open marriage and from her husband\u2019s rapes of multiple women with false accusations of Trump. Make no mistake about it, this is not a Trump issue. She would have done the same thing with any other opponent. If it were Ted Cruz, same story, if he would have exposed Bill Clinton\u2019s rapes, the next week you would have had multiple women falsely accusing Ted Cruz of raping and groping them. Unbelievable!\\nThe vandal identified himself as James Otis and he removed the emblem from the middle of the star to sell it and donate the money to all the women who were raped by Trump.\\nYou would think that in the light of Project Veritas videos and how they exposed the DNC evil who paid agitators, violence, voter fraud and more they would chill out for a while but nope, the viciousness is going on. These people are pushing the limits of law in this country and as of now its a banana republic led by banana-boy Obama but if Trump gets in, a lot of people are RIGHTFULLY going to be locked up and have the key thrown away for all this chaos, anarchy and lawlessness.\\nLAPD is currently searching for the vandalism suspect.\\nTrump received his star in 2007. In July 2016 a protester built a 6-inch wall around the star which is a legitimate form of protest, but destroying the star is just anarchy and that man needs to be locked up for a while along with the Democrats who paid him to do that.\\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said they are planning to repair the star. Well at least they have some honor in them.\\n\u201cPeople can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property\u201d the chamber\u2019s president said.\\nThese sort of things are normally expected to happen in poor countries with little to no freedoms where the opposition party is systematically oppressed but in a country like America which brags to the world how it is \u201cthe greatest democracy in the world\u201d it is surely setting a bad example which no one in its right mind would like to follow.\\nIf it has come to the point that even the communist state press in China is saying that what the media in America is doing to Trump is pure bias, then we know how bad it is in America.\\nThe media people in America are rubbing their hands at this one. They are truly happy and excited this happened.\\n\\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742562318.2353601}
