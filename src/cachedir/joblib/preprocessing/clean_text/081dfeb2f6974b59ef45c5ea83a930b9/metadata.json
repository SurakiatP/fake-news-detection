He received a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 Scientists have been urging the mainstream scientific community, which today is littered with scientific fraud and industry influence as well as invention secrecy , to open up to a broader view regarding the true nature of our reality. \u201cThe day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade that in all of the previous centuries of its existence.\u201d\u2013 Nikola Tesla advertisement - learn more Not long ago, a group of internationally recognized scientists came together to stress this fact and how it\u2019s overlooked by the mainstream scientific community. It\u2019s \u2018post-material\u201d science, an area of study dealing with the \u2018non-physical realm, and it\u2019s challenging the modern scientific worldview of materialism that\u2019s dominated mainstream science. The idea that matter is not the reality is finally starting to gain some merrit. The summary of this report presented at the International Summit On Post-Materialist Science can be found HERE . \u201cThe modern scientific worldview is predominantly predicated on assumptions that are closely associated with classical physics. Materialism\u2014the idea that matter is the only reality\u2014is one of these assumptions. A related assumption is reductionism, the notion that complex things can be understood by reducing them to the interactions of their parts, or to simpler or more fundamental things such as tiny material particles.\u201d\u2013 Manifesto for a Post-Materialist Science MIT\u2019s Max Tegmark,a theoretical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, is one of the latest to attempt explaining why he believes consciousness is a state of matter. He believes that consciousness arises out of a certain set of mathematical conditions, and that there are varying degrees of consciousness \u2013 just as certain conditions are required to create varying states of vapor, water, and ice. As PBS emphasized, \u201cunderstanding how consciousness functions as a separate state of matter could help us come to a more thorough understanding of why we perceive the world the way we do.\u201d ( source ) Tegmark describes this as \u201cperceptronium,\u201d which he defines as the most general substance that feels subjectively self-aware and this substance should not only be able to store information, but do it in a way that form a unified, indivisible, whole. \u201cThe problem is why we perceive the universe as the semi-classical, three dimensional world that is so familiar. When we look at a glass of iced water, we perceive the liquid and the solid ice cubes as independent things even though they are intimately linked as part of the same system. How does this happen? Out of all possible outcomes, we do we perceive this solution?\u201d\u2013 Tegmark ( source ) This new way of thinking about consciousness has been spreading throughout the physics community at an exponential rate within the past few years. Considering consciousness as an actual state of matter would be huge, considering the fact that modern day definitions of matter require a substance to have mass, which consciousness does not have. What it does have, however, is some sort of effect on our physical material world, and the extent of this effect and how far it goes is the next step for science. \\nThe quantum double slit experiment is a very popular experiment used to examine how consciousness and our physical material world are intertwined. It is a great example that documents how factors associated with consciousness and our physical material world are connected in some way. \\nOne potential revelation of this experience is that \u201cthe observer creates the reality.\u201d A paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Physics Essays by Dean Radin, PhD, explains how this experiment has been used multiple times to explore the role of consciousness in shaping the nature of physical reality. \\nThe study found that factors associated with consciousness \u201c significantly\u201d correlated in predicted ways with perturbations in the double slit interference pattern. ( source ) \u201cObservation not only disturbs what has to be measured, they produce it. We compel the electron to assume a definite position. We ourselves produce the results of the measurement.\u201d (source) For a physicist to brush off the fact that understanding consciousness is necessary for the advancement and understanding of the nature of our reality is not as common as it used to be but, despite the empirical success of quantum theory, even the suggesting that it could be true as a description of our reality is greeted with harsh cynicism, incomprehension and even anger. \\nR.C. Henry, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University wrote in a 2005 publication for the journal Nature: \\nAccording to [pioneering physicist] Sir James Jeans: \u201cthe stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter\u2026 we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.\u201d . . . The Universe is immaterial \u2014 mental and spiritual. Live, and enjoy. \\n(\u201cThe Mental Universe\u201d; Nature 436:29,2005) (source) Thanks for reading.'"}, "time": 1742628431.3569143}
