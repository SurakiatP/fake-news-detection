[Border Patrol agents assigned to the Eagle Pass Sector in south Texas responded to possible illegal activity along the river. When they arrived, they discovered a man stranded in the frigid water having failed to make a successful crossing.  An agent who is also an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and others rescued the man from the river and determined he was suffering from hypothermia  \u2014   a potentially deadly condition where the person\u2019s core body temperature drops, causing the brain to shut down critical organs. The man was transported to Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center for treatment, information obtained from U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials stated. The rescue took place around sunrise on Monday. The man, later identified only as a    Honduran national, was released from the hospital following treatment. Agents took custody of the illegal immigrant and transported him to the Eagle Pass South Border Patrol Station where he will be processed in accordance with local policies. Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials warned that while the climate in south Texas is generally warm, the cold water can act quickly on the body creating a dangerous situation. \u201cThe winter months can bring about environmental hazards that all individuals must heed,\u201d CBP officials wrote. \u201cImmersion in water and exposure to cool air will accelerate the progression of hypothermia and possible death. \u201d \u201cThis event highlights the environmental hazards that undocumented immigrants face,\u201d Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak said in a written statement. \u201cThanks to the agents\u2019 quick thinking and training this story didn\u2019t end in tragedy. \u201d \u201cBeing a Border Patrol agent means more than just enforcing the law,\u201d Hudak continued. \u201cIt means being able to handle any situation with the commitment to preserve human life. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
