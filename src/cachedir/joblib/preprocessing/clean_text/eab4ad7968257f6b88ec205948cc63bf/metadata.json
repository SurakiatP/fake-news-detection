[Thomas de Maiziere told public broadcaster ARD that Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, had received \u201ctips of an attack and passed them on\u201d to local security authorities in Essen.  \u201cThe case was evaluated several times   \u2026     and it couldn\u2019t be eliminated that there could have been a concrete attack at this mall. This was prevented,\u201d de Maiziere said. Daily papers Bild, Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung and public broadcaster WDR had reported earlier, citing anonymous security sources, that a German fighter with the IS in Syria had contacted via online messenger a group of fighters  \u2014   based in Germany and abroad  \u2014   and tried to motivate them to attack the mall Saturday. De Maiziere also confirmed a connection between \u201csomebody who had traveled there from Germany and indications and assignments from that region. \u201d The mall in Essen, one of the biggest in Germany, didn\u2019t open Saturday. About 100 heavily armed police officers positioned themselves around the compound to prevent anyone from entering. The apartments of two men were later searched in nearby Oberhausen and they were detained and interrogated. One was released Saturday, police said, with no details. The mall in downtown Essen will open again on Monday because there is no longer an increased threat of an attack, the German news agency dpa reported. Germany has been on the edge following a series of attacks in public places over the past year. When a man went on a rampage with an axe on Friday night at Duesseldorf\u2019s main station and injured 10 people, hundreds of police officers were deployed to the scene, even though it later turned out that he had no links to extremists, but was suffering from psychological problems.'"}, "time": 1742564529.9012952}
