Calhoun. The president, Peter Salovey, also said the university would name its two new residential colleges for Anna Pauline Murray and Benjamin Franklin. The selection of Ms. Murray, a legal scholar and civil rights activist who graduated from Yale Law School in 1965, represents the first time the school has honored either an   or a woman with the naming of a college. Many students were perplexed by the selection of Franklin, who received an honorary degree from Yale. Franklin, like many other founding fathers, was once a slaveholder himself before he became involved in the abolitionist movement. Mr. Salovey explained that Franklin was a \u201cpersonal hero and role model\u201d of Charles B. Johnson, a businessman and Yale alumnus who donated $250 million to pay for the new buildings  \u2014   the largest gift in the school\u2019s history  \u2014   and who suggested the honor. In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Salovey said that while Mr. Johnson\u2019s gift was not contingent upon naming the college after Franklin, \u201cI really want you to remember this is the largest single gift ever given to Yale. \u201d In addition, the faculty leaders of all Yale residential colleges will shed their   title of master they will now be called heads of college, acknowledging the discomfort many students and faculty members felt toward a title that conjures the country\u2019s history of slavery. As part of the resolution, Yale will start a historical study examining the \u201c  people, events and narratives behind the familiar facades seen on campus,\u201d beginning with an appraisal of Mr. Calhoun\u2019s legacy. The various decisions came in consultation with the Yale Corporation, the university\u2019s governing body. On Wednesday night, the Black Student Alliance at Yale issued a statement calling the naming of Murray College and the abandonment of the master title \u201c  first steps towards creating a better and more inclusive Yale. \u201d Retaining the name Calhoun, they said, \u201cis a regression. \u201d Mr. Salovey defended the Calhoun decision as the best possible way for the university to confront its history. \u201cUniversities have to be the places where tough conversations happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is advanced by hiding our past. \u201d Similar heated discussions about historic ties between universities and their racist pasts have inflamed campuses across the country. Princeton\u2019s board of trustees decided this month that the name Woodrow Wilson would remain on its buildings and school, despite vociferous student objections. Mr. Wilson was an admirer of the Ku Klux Klan and reinstated segregation in the federal government. Yale has long grappled with the legacy of Mr. Calhoun, who advocated slavery as \u201ca positive good,\u201d but the issue found footing last fall after an online petition demanding that the college\u2019s name be changed garnered around 1, 500 supporting signatures. The dispute over Calhoun College, founded in 1933, that ensued soon revealed deeper discontent among students and professors over more substantive issues regarding race, in particular what many saw as the university\u2019s lack of commitment to faculty diversity and the alienation experienced by many minority students. A group of student activists  \u2014   operating under the name Next Yale  \u2014   handed Mr. Salovey a list of demands last year that included increasing the number and tenure of diverse faculty members increasing the budgets for ethnic and racial cultural centers abolishing the title of master and naming the two new residential colleges after minorities. Those demands were met in part, but students have largely remained skeptical. In November, the university announced that it was committing $50 million to a   initiative, an effort to address the fact that less than 3 percent of its Faculty of Arts and Sciences is black. Among Yale\u2019s roughly 5, 400 undergraduates, 11 percent identify themselves as black or  . Karl\u00e9h Wilson, a senior from Louisiana who has helped organize the Next Yale protests, said she felt the university did not go far enough to meet student demands. \u201cThere are more than enough alumni of color who the naming committee could have drawn from,\u201d Ms. Wilson, 22, said. Crystal Feimster, a professor of   studies, agreed, saying she was \u201cdeeply disappointed with the decision not to rename Calhoun\u201d and found the selection of Franklin \u201ca missed opportunity. \u201d Still, she lauded the choice of Ms. Murray, whom she called \u201ca relentless advocate for racial equality and women\u2019s rights. \u201d Jonathan Holloway, the college\u2019s first black dean of students, called this year \u201ca moment of reckoning\u201d that he hoped would strengthen the university. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reconcile our current values and aspirations with these names,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have failed if we do not do that work going forward. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562687.2515094}
