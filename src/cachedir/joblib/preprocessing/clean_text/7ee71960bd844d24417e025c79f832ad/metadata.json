Who\u2019ll work as hard to stay as morally pure? Who the hell is gonna be named Debbie? These days, when we talk about \u201cshowbiz,\u201d we have to adjust for deflation, because it just doesn\u2019t mean as much as it did when Ms. Reynolds was a star. We\u2019ve all been happy to be at the movies. She always seemed happy to be in the movies. She never ceased to be thrilled to be herself. Ms. Reynolds, who died Wednesday, didn\u2019t so much act as sell  \u2014   she sold happiness, she sold pragmatic romance, she sold professional stardom. If you were a certain kind of female Hollywood performer in the 1950s, you pushed corniness. But over and over, Ms. Reynolds rose to the challenge of making that corniness seem like a form of patriotism. Ms. Reynolds was born in El Paso, educated in Southern California. She won a beauty pageant (Miss Burbank!) and played the bassoon and French horn in a youth orchestra  \u2014   basically, she was a showgirl who could make her music. She \u201carrived\u201d in 1952 in Stanley Donen\u2019s \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d playing what she was at the time: a   ing\u00e9nue. She stayed one for most of the decade. She worked again the next year with Mr. Donen in the Marge and Gower Champion vehicle \u201cGive a Girl a Break. \u201d (Compared with the other movie, this one could have been called \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Mud. \u201d) Her character was a brunette starling named Suzy Doolittle, because   \u2026     of course. There\u2019s a part for Bob Fosse, who, with Ms. Reynolds, does the singing and most of the dancing. But in their big number together, Ms. Reynolds is as much an athlete as he is an artist. She spent her career outpacing the other men she worked with  \u2014   Frank Sinatra, Glenn Ford, Leslie Nielsen, James Garner, Dick Van Dyke. Even after Eddie Fisher, her first husband, outpaced her, leaving her at 26 with two kids, for Elizabeth Taylor, she kept going, never appearing to seek a part that would bring what you would call catharsis. Taylor, meanwhile, kept looking for parts to unleash a darker side. She became drama incarnate. Ms. Reynolds was, as they say, a trouper. So she did what came naturally to her: She trouped. And maybe all that shining and all that chastity were cathartic. If Taylor indulged vulgarity, Ms. Reynolds embraced virtue. She was the least ostensibly neurotic of her peers  \u2014   a class that included Shirley MacLaine and Doris Day. The movie titles got a lot of that   decency across. She played \u201cThe Singing Nun,\u201d for heaven\u2019s sake. But she also starred in the 1964 musical \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown,\u201d a title whose adjective best explains the full Debbie Reynolds experience: maximum buoyancy. \u201cMolly Brown\u201d was Ms. Reynolds in full command of her  . In a little over two hours, she goes from   Rocky Mountain tomboy to highfalutin femme to a hero of the wrecked Titanic (yes, it was that Molly Brown). And she looks like a leprechaun for the whole thing. She practically shouts and grunts the opening number. But this was the character she committed to: a clump of dirt determined to become a diamond. Molly winds up married to a yokel played by Harve Presnell, who\u2019s as unconscionably strapping as his voice is outrageously strong. Ms. Reynolds, however, doesn\u2019t hit her notes. And she bangs on them harder than she does the piano she pretends to play. The fun of her stardom in this kind of movie is that you can see all of her work. She\u2019s not afraid to pop her eyes or try about a dozen other \u201cobvious\u201d things, including fall flat on her back and do triple takes. Even after the ship goes down and people are on the verge of death, Ms. Reynolds\u2019s face is wet with both water and showbiz. Who needs realism when you\u2019ve got that twinkle? But the more   or   the movies got, the more suffused with social politics and method acting, the less that breeziness made sense. She works herself mad in \u201cDivorce American Style\u201d with Dick Van Dyke, in 1967. But the emotions don\u2019t leave the surface. During this period, Ms. Reynolds never played parts as complex as Ms. MacLaine\u2019s or Taylor\u2019s. And Doris Day monopolized \u201csexy virgin. \u201d Ms. Reynolds became too good for sex, anyway. By her own admission, she wasn\u2019t that kind of actress. She didn\u2019t want to be. Misery wasn\u2019t her thing. Not at work. She became a star in \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d a musical about how talkies put the silent movie out of business. By the late 1960s, when the movies actually started saying something, Ms. Reynolds\u2019s twinkle started to put her out of business. In 1971, she made a fascinating train wreck called \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter with Helen? ,\u201d in which she and Shelley Winters more or less turn \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d into a   horror film that actually predicts the onscreen, rooftop brawl, six years later, between Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in \u201cThe Turning Point. \u201d \u201cHelen\u201d was just about the only   movie Ms. Reynolds made during that decade. There wasn\u2019t much place for many of the old stars in the new Hollywood, which was less about appearances and salesmanship and more about psychology and behavior. The classic stars were now the squares. Instead, she sought other places to practice showbiz. Her   NBC sitcom, in 1970, lasted for one season, partly because she didn\u2019t like the cigarette commercials. So Ms. Reynolds did lounge shows in Las Vegas. She worked on Broadway. She trouped. Meanwhile, the acting career of her daughter, Carrie Fisher, took off, and then so did the second act  \u2014   as rehabbed addict and memoirist who chronicled her bitterness over Ms. Reynolds\u2019s mothering and career obsession. \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d was Ms. Fisher\u2019s roman \u00e0 clef that portrayed Ms. Reynolds as a kind of nonchalant, casually narcissistic gorgon of a mother. That incarnation of Ms. Reynolds was cemented by Ms. MacLaine, her professional rival, in Mike Nichols\u2019s 1990 movie adaptation of that book. It\u2019s not a heartless portrayal, but it\u2019s an ambivalent one. It gets at the glorious raconteur Ms. Reynolds clearly was, as well as how   for real life she might have been, at least according to her daughter. And Ms. MacLaine used sharp, affectionate comedy to capture what feels essential about Ms. Reynolds: that the show could never go off. And you got the sense that Ms. Reynolds and Ms. Fisher came to accept over the years their very public symbiosis and that Ms. Reynolds had a flair for the dramatic after all. They were relatives. They were neighbors. They made their exits a day apart. There was a moving, human beauty in the extremity of that bond. They so couldn\u2019t live without each other that they couldn\u2019t die without each other, either.'"}, "time": 1742628517.7077577}
