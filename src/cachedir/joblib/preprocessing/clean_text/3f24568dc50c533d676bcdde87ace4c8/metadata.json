[In a recent interview, exorcist Father Francisco L\u00f3pez Sedano insisted that the devil exists and that he is not a mere personification of evil but an actual being. \u201cJesus often confronted Satan himself and spoke with him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not talk with a thing, you talk to a person. \u201d  The priest, who normally treats three to five cases a day, says that he has personally spoken with the devil on many occasions. \u201cWho are you to expel me?\u201d Satan has challenged him. \u201cAnd I answer: \u2018I am nobody, but I come from Christ, your God and Lord and you leave right now, I command you in the name of Him to go away!\u201d he said. Lopez Sedano said that Linda Blair\u2019s portrayal of a possessed person in The Exorcist film is not so far from reality. \u201cWhen the devil is present, anything can happen,\u201d he asserts. One particularly memorable case was that of a boy in his late teens who \u201cpushed five enormous, extremely heavy benches that not even 10 people could have moved. He had a tremendous strength,\u201d he said. Possessed people \u201ccan climb walls, yes, and even fly,\u201d he said. Lopez Sedano says he became an exorcist not by personal inclination but \u201cout of necessity,\u201d after witnessing some very serious and painful cases of demonic possession. \u201cBefore, I did not think the devil could act so aggressively. It seemed fanciful, not realistic. \u201d A fellow priest also told Father Lopez that fighting the Evil One was an obligation. \u201cYou have to get into this by the Lord\u2019s command,\u201d he said. The Word of God carries three mandates from Jesus, the priest added, \u201cto preach the word of God, heal the sick and cast out demons. \u201d All three of these are still in force in the church, he said, but many priests do not dare to engage the devil because \u201cthey are afraid of him. \u201d Others, he said, simply do not believe in the devil. The priest said that he has had cases in which people have gone to their pastor with their problems, but he has responded: \u201cYou are imagining things, that doesn\u2019t exist. \u201d And the person leaves without knowing what to do, \u201cbecause at night \u2018someone\u2019 bothers him, hits him, throws him out of bed, throws him against the wall,\u201d he said. Demonic possession manifests itself in many ways, Father Lopez says. \u201cA person possessed by demons may start screaming, barking like a dog, shrieking or writhing on the ground like a snake. There are a thousand ways,\u201d he said. The priest claims that he is not afraid because God protects him. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t, nobody would get into this work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe devil is afraid of me. \u201d What the devil looks for is \u201cto turn us away from God,\u201d the priest said. \u201cHe wants to make us lazy, tire us out, fill us with distrust, make us despair and hate. Everything negative,\u201d he said. What he really likes is \u201cto separate us from God, frighten us, threaten us, and keep us trembling,\u201d he said. Lopez Sedano said that the devil often enters people because they let him in, because they play around with occult practices. \u201cPeople let the devil in. He would not mess with us if we did not open doors for him,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why God forbids practicing magic, superstition, witchcraft, sorcery, divination, consultation of the dead and spirits and astrology. \u201d Those are the lands of \u201clying and deceit,\u201d he said. According to the priest, consulting horoscopes is ridiculous, but can also be dangerous. Thinking that the stars influence our lives is \u201cthe biggest lie,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThey\u2019re a million miles away! They are bodies made up of metals and gases, how are they going to influence us?\u201d \u201cThe same goes for magic, which is to attribute to things a power they do not have,\u201d the priest said. \u201cCarrying around a horseshoe because it\u2019s going to give me good luck is a lie,\u201d he said. Despite the grim reality of the devil, Lopez Sedano says he keeps a positive attitude toward life. \u201cMy hope is confirmed because on the cross Christ already triumphed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won the absolute war,\u201d he said.
