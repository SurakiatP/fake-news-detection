According to the agreement between the regime and Hillary Clinton while she was SOS all funds given to them from foreign donors had to be cleared by the State Department. Wikileaks exposed the \u201cgift\u201d a while back. And now they are forced to admit it. And figure out a way to \u201cexcuse\u201d it. Reply - Share uncle Bob 1 Today 9:25 pm \\nTo the US\u2019s \u201ceternal shame\u201d we now have the choice for President between the \u201csmut talking clown\u201d (Trump) and the \u201ccriminal warmonger\u201d (Clinton).I don\u2019t really care too much about Trump\u2019s antics. But I have kids,and friends,I don\u2019t want dying in neo-con wars.So the choice is totally clear for me. I\u2019m hoping Trump wins. Though I\u2019m not holding my breath over that hope.
