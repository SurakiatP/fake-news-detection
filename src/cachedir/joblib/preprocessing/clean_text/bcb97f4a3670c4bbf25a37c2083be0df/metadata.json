Arlie Hochschild\u2019s generous but disconcerting look at the Tea Party presents a likable fellow named Lee Sherman, who once worked for a Louisiana chemical plant where his duties included illegally dumping toxic waste into the bayou. Sherman did the dirty work then the company did him dirty. After 15 years on the job, he was doused with chemicals that \u201cburned my clothes clean off me\u201d and left him ill. But rather than pay his disability costs, his bosses accused him of absenteeism and fired him. Sherman became a fledgling environmentalist and got his revenge after a giant fish kill threatened the livelihood of nearby fishermen. Company officials feigned innocence, but Sherman barged into a public meeting with an incriminating sign: I\u2019M THE ONE WHO DUMPED IT IN THE BAYOU.   a couple of decades and Sherman, still an environmentalist, is campaigning for a Tea Party congressman who wants to gut the Environmental Protection Agency. Sherman still distrusts chemical companies, but he distrusts the federal government more, because it spends his tax money on people who \u201clazed around days and partied at night. \u201d In \u201cStrangers in Their Own Land,\u201d which has been nominated for a National Book Award, Hochschild calls this the \u201cGreat Paradox\u201d  \u2014   opposition to federal help from people and places that need it  \u2014   and sets off across Louisiana on an energetic,   quest to understand it. A distinguished Berkeley sociologist, Hochschild is a woman of the left, but her mission is empathy, not polemics. She takes seriously the Tea Partiers\u2019 complaints that they have become the \u201cstrangers\u201d of the title  \u2014   triply marginalized by flat or falling wages, rapid demographic change, and liberal culture that mocks their faith and patriotism. Her affection for her characters is palpable. But the resentments she finds are as toxic as the pollutants in the marsh and metastasizing throughout politics. What unites her subjects is the powerful feeling that others are \u201ccutting in line\u201d and that the federal government is supporting people on the dole  \u2014   \u201ctaking money from the workers and giving it to the idle. \u201d Income is flowing up, but the anger points down. The people who feel this are white. The usurpers they picture are blacks and immigrants. Hochschild takes care not to call anyone racist but concludes that \u201crace is an essential part of this story. \u201d When she asks a   mayor to describe his politics, his first two issues  \u2014   or is it one in his mind?  \u2014   are welfare and race: \u201cI don\u2019t like the government paying unwed mothers to have a lot of kids, and I don\u2019t go for affirmative action. \u201d In welfare politics, this is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. It\u2019s been two decades since Bill Clinton signed a tough welfare law aimed in part to end the politics of blame. \u201cEnding welfare as we know it\u201d would recast the needy as workers, he said, and build support for a new safety net. The rolls of the main federal cash program have fallen by 80 percent from their 1990s highs  \u2014   in Louisiana, by 95 percent. But reverse class anger is more potent than ever. Liberals have long wondered why    voters support policies that (the liberals think) hurt the working class. Why would victims of pollution side with the polluters? Theories abound. Thomas Frank accuses the G. O. P. of luring voters with social issues but delivering tax cuts for the rich. Others point to the political machines built by   donors like Charles and David Koch. Still others emphasize the influence of conservative media like Fox News. Hochschild sees these as partial explanations but wants a fuller understanding of \u201cemotion in politics\u201d  \u2014   she wants to know how Tea Partiers feel, on the theory that the movement serves their \u201cemotional  \u201d by providing \u201ca giddy release\u201d from years of frustration. Six characters dominate the book, including Harold Areno, who lives on a swamp so polluted even the rugged cypress trees are dead. He and his wife have had cancer. Yet Areno supports politicians hostile to environmental regulation because he cares more about banning abortion. \u201cWe vote for candidates that put the Bible where it belongs,\u201d he said. Mike Schaff lost his neighborhood to the Bayou Corne sinkhole, which started to swallow 37 acres in 2012 after a lightly regulated drilling company punctured an underground salt dome. But he remains a \u201cfree market man,\u201d because \u201cBig Government\u201d threatens \u201ccommunity. \u201d Many Tea Party adherents warn that more regulation will cost them jobs. (A   mayor says the pungent chemical plant \u201csmells like rice and  gravy. \u201d) But Hochschild detects other passions and assembles what she calls the \u201cdeep story\u201d  \u2014   a \u201cfeels as if\u201d story, beyond facts or judgment, that presents her subjects\u2019 worldview. It goes like this: \u201cYou are patiently standing in a long line\u201d for something you call the American dream. You are white, Christian, of modest means, and getting along in years. You are male. There are people of color behind you, and \u201cin principle you wish them well. \u201d But you\u2019ve waited long, worked hard, \u201cand the line is barely moving. \u201d Then \u201cLook! You see people cutting in line ahead of you!\u201d Who are these interlopers? \u201cSome are black,\u201d others \u201cimmigrants, refugees. \u201d They get affirmative action, sympathy and welfare  \u2014   \u201cchecks for the listless and idle. \u201d The government wants you to feel sorry for them. And who runs the government? \u201cThe biracial son of a   single mother,\u201d and he\u2019s cheering on the line cutters. \u201cThe president and his wife are line cutters themselves. \u201d The liberal media mocks you as racist or homophobic. Everywhere you look, \u201cyou feel betrayed. \u201d Hochschild runs the myth past her Tea Party friends. \u201cYou\u2019ve read my mind,\u201d Lee Sherman said. \u201cI live your analogy,\u201d Mike Schaff said. Harold Areno\u2019s niece agrees, and says she has seen people drive their children to Head Start in Lexuses. \u201cIf people refuse to work, we should let them starve,\u201d she said. Actually, anger this raw may depart from the 1990s, when welfare critics often framed their attacks as efforts to help the poor by fighting dependency. The resentments Hochschild presents are unadorned, and they have mutated into a broader suspicion of almost everything the federal government does. \u201cThe government has gone rogue, corrupt, malicious and ugly,\u201d one Tea Partier complains. \u201cIt can\u2019t help anybody. \u201d Did welfare really \u201cend\u201d? Conservatives say no. Cash aid plummeted, but food stamp usage soared to new highs and the Medicaid rolls expanded. There\u2019s room for debate, but the grievances Hochschild presents feel immune to policy solutions. As long as larger forces are squeezing whites of modest means, it\u2019s going to \u201cfeel as if\u201d people are cutting in line. In Lexuses. None of Hochschild\u2019s characters appear to have been directly hurt by competition from people of color. Their economic problems lie elsewhere, she argues, in unchecked corporate power and technological transformation. Still there\u2019s no denying that demographic and cultural change have robbed white men of the status they once enjoyed. Hochschild doesn\u2019t buy the racial   but she can see their pain. Whatever racial or class resentments she finds, Hochschild makes clear that she likes the people she meets. They aren\u2019t just soldiers in a class war but victims of one, too. She mourns their economic losses, praises their warmth and hospitality, and admires their \u201cgrit and resilience. \u201d While her hopes of finding common political ground seem overly optimistic, this is a smart, respectful and compelling book.'"}, "time": 1742628583.6281862}
