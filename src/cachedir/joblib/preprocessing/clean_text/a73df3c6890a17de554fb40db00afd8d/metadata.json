[Ugly Betty actress America Ferrera, chair of the organization\u2019s \u201cartist table,\u201d said the march is about standing up to the incoming administration.  \u201cSince the election, so many fear that their voices will go unheard,\u201d Ferrera said in a statement. \u201cAs artists, women, and most importantly dedicated Americans, it is critical that we stand together in solidarity for the protection, dignity, and rights of our communities. Immigrant rights, worker rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, racial justice and environmental rights are not special interests, they affect us all and should be every American\u2019s concern. \u201d Actresses Scarlett Johansson, Zendaya, Debra Messing, and Julianne Moore and talk show host Chelsea Handler are also expected to participate in the January 21 event. Comedian Amy Schumer  \u2014   who initially vowed to move to Spain if Trump won, and later said the statement was a joke  \u2014   took to Instagram last month to encourage her five million followers to join her at the march. \u201cJanuary 21 I\u2019ll be there,\u201d the Trainwreck star wrote. \u201cWho\u2019s coming with me? The group wants the event to \u201csend a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women\u2019s rights are human rights. \u201d \u201cThe rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us  \u2014   immigrants of all statuses, Muslims and those of diverse religious faiths, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, survivors of sexual assault  \u2014   and our communities are hurting and scared,\u201d the organization says.

I am marching on Washington to let our next president know that we, men and women alike, will not stand down or be silenced and will fight to protect our bodies and our choices. \u201d The   Women\u2019s March on Washington has not been without controversy. As the New York Times reports, some organizers of sister protests across the country and volunteers for the Washington D.
