They chatted among themselves, fanning one another with torn bits of cardboard in the close, sticky corridor and examining their nails, which had been sharpened to talons and encrusted with miniature gems. They received compliments with the languorous equanimity of court ladies, which for a night they were. Not for the first time, and surely not for the last, the thought occurred that the European fashion shows, with their ritual peregrinations from palace to palace, were not so different from the French court, which took its pomp and circumstance on the road at regular intervals. The thought occurred with particular force Wednesday evening because Rihanna  \u2014   pop megastar, fledgling designer  \u2014   had decreed that the look she wanted for this, her Fenty show for the German sportswear giant Puma, was Marie Antoinette \u201cif she was going to the gym. \u201d Rihanna was in a chamber two rooms back. She was wearing a pink   of her own design, twirling a long strand of pearls and receiving guests who had come to pay court: journalists executives   Pinault, chairman and chief executive of Kering, which owns Puma. (\u201cThe collection is very interesting,\u201d he said gamely, on his way to the salons downstairs where the show would eventually begin.) Attendants were barking out orders  \u2014   \u201cNails, nails, we need nails! We\u2019re losing nails!\u201d  \u2014   but Rihanna was serene and unusually humble for a reigning monarch, which, for the evening at least, she was. \u201cI would never expect that I would be allowed in Paris to show a collection this early as a designer,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a thing that I expected at all. I couldn\u2019t believe  \u2014   I still right now can\u2019t believe it happened. \u201d When the time came for the show to start, the models sashayed through, fanning themselves coquettishly, their chinoiserie boiler suits and filmy, frilly windbreakers dipping off their shoulders. The reaction from those outside the court, from the queen\u2019s   subjects, was rapturous (on Twitter, a sampling: \u201cI love this\u201d \u201cLIFE GIVING\u201d \u201cThe look of the century\u201d) and the designer, who took the final lap herself, did so with a giant smile on her face. Earlier in the evening Rihanna had been asked if she related to Marie Antoinette and she nodded. \u201cShe was very dramatic,\u201d she replied.'"}, "time": 1742564065.1267903}
