Joe Biden\u2019s response: \u2018Oh, God\u2019 By Oliver Milman The Guardian October 31, 2016 \\nAs a fractious and often sordid presidential campaign reaches its denouement, Hillary Clinton may be reflecting upon the grim irony that it is Anthony Weiner who has provided what could be the final, miserable twist. \\nWeiner\u2019s predilection for sending sexually laden text messages derailed his career in Congress and his chances of becoming mayor of New York City , but his soap-opera-style re-emergence in the 11th hour of the presidential race may yet trigger the greatest political carnage of all. \\nHis appearance comes in an election already defined by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Clinton\u2019s husband, former president Bill Clinton, and by the Republican nominee, Donald Trump . \\nOn Friday, Clinton called on the FBI to \u201cimmediately\u201d explain its announcement that it was reviewing a new batch of emails relating to her, after a review of her use of a private email server was closed in July. \\nThen, the FBI director, James Comey, said Clinton had been \u201c extremely careless \u201d in her use of a private server while secretary of state, but said there were no grounds for a criminal investigation. \\nOn Friday, he said in a letter to members of Congress that the bureau would analyze newly discovered emails that \u201cappear to be pertinent to the investigation\u201d. Republicans were quick to characterise the move as a \u201creopening\u201d of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s server, a description Democrats rejected. \\nIt was later reported that the new emails came from an iPad, cellphone and laptop seized by the FBI and previously shared by Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. \\nClinton\u2019s campaign and the Obama administration have been left bewildered by the latest FBI intervention, less than two weeks before the election, with Weiner\u2019s involvement rubbing salt into the wound. \\nJohn Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, said: \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant. \\n\u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.\u201d \\nVice-president Joe Biden was more direct, telling CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish in an interview broadcast on Saturday: \u201cWell, oh God, Anthony Weiner. I should not comment on Anthony Weiner . I\u2019m not a big fan. I wasn\u2019t before he got in trouble.\u201d \\nWeiner is being investigated by the FBI and police in North Carolina over text messages sent to a 15-year-old girl . In the wake of the latest allegations against him, Abedin, who has herself been a target for criticism from Republicans for some time, separated from Weiner . She has continued in her role as Clinton\u2019s closest ally on the campaign trail. \\nOnce seen as a rising Democratic star, Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after he sent a picture of his penis, clad in his boxer shorts, to a 21-year-old student via Twitter. After he initially denied involvement in the messages, further pictures sent by Weiner emerged and he stepped down, at the urging of Barack Obama .'"}, "time": 1742628305.18568}
