Buchanan noted the biggest cheerleaders of Trump\u2019s action were Sens. John McCain ( ) Lindsey Graham ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) which he deemed to be \u201cthe war party. \u201d However, argued that they would not \u201cget the war they want\u201d from Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s McCain and Graham and Marco Rubio  \u2014   the war party,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cBut let me say this, Laura  \u2014   my view is they\u2019re not going to get the war they want. If Donald Trump the president takes us into Syria\u2019s civil war and he\u2019s already made the first strike  \u2014   it will consume his presidency. And the sense I get this morning and listening to some of these folks on yesterday\u2019s show is that, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, this is just a  . We\u2019re not going into Syria. The enemy is still ISIS, as indeed it is if you take a look at what happened in Egypt yesterday, 47 dead and 100 injured. \u201d \u201cSo I think the war party is going to be frustrated because I cannot believe that Donald Trump on second thought is going to plunge us into Syria, which he told us again and again and again would be an act of folly  \u2014   that our enemy is ISIS and our enemy is   and that we should finish them off,\u201d he added. \u201cThen we\u2019re necessarily going to have to work with the folks who did most of the heavy lifting in finishing them off. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562065.7284524}
