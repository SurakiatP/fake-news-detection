The verdict by the 12 jurors came in after a   deliberation. [The jury of 10 women and two men recommended that Roof be put to death in each of the 18 counts where he was found guilty of murdering nine people in Charleston\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015, CNN reported.  \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told, I have a right to ask you to give me a life sentence, but I\u2019m not sure what good that will do anyway,\u201d Roof told the jurors while representing himself during the sentencing phase of the trial. \u201cBut what I will say is only one of you has to disagree with the other jurors. \u201d No one did, and the jury quickly responded with the verdict of death. Judge Richard Gergel is expected to formally deliver the sentence on Wednesday morning. Breitbart Texas previously reported that some of the jurors cried during testimony provided by victim\u2019s family members in the sentencing portion of the trial. Even court staff members were brought to tears during the emotional testimony. One such witness, Denise Quarles, the daughter of Myra Thompson, told the jury how much her mother meant to her. They talked several times a day, and her mother would make financial sacrifices for her even though they did not have a lot of money, Breitbart Texas reported. She said she still starts to dial her mother\u2019s phone number but then she remembers that she is not there. Judge Gergel told a local television station he would have been stunned had the jurors not cried. As the sentencing portion of the trial began, Breitbart Texas reported that Roof announced he rejected the inanity defense. \u201c(T) here\u2019s noting wrong with me psychologically,\u201d he told the jury. The judge had previously ruled Roof was competent to stand trial. He was instructed by the judge not to approach any witnesses or jurors while representing himself in the trial. A manifesto had previously been uncovered where Roof expressed \u201cdeeply racist,     and white supremacist views,\u201d Breitbart News reported in June 2015. In the journal attributed to Roof, he wrote, \u201c\u201cNi \u2014    are stupid and violent. \u201d He continued, \u201cJewish agitation of the black race\u201d is the reason blacks behave the way they do. He apparently supported segregation as a solution to race relations. \u201cSegregation was not a bad thing   \u2026     It existed to protect us from them. \u201d Dylann Roof was found guilty in the murders of nine black Americans. Those included six women and three men who were gathered at the church to pray. Editor\u2019s Note: This article has been updated with additional information.
