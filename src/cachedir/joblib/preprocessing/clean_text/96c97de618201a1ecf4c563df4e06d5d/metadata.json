[\u201cThere\u2019s no airtime for this orange [person],\u201d in season four of the show, actress Ilana Glazer told USA Today. \u201cWe bleep his name the whole season. \u201d  From actress and executive producer Amy Poehler, Broad City follows two       \u2014   played by actresses Abbi Jacobson and Glazer  \u2014   living in New York City. A trailer teasing season four sees the show\u2019s stars wearing pussy hats at a protest. A moment later, Glazer yells \u201cF*ck You, Trump. I\u2019m going back in,\u201d and proceeds to turn on what appears to be a vibrating sex toy.  Of the   scene, Glazer says Jacobson\u2019s character struggles to stimulate herself sexually due to all the \u201cdanger\u201d imposed by the Trump administration. \u201cIlana\u2019s \u2018powers\u2019 are decreasing during the current administration because it\u2019s just so hard to (orgasm) when you know so many people are in such danger,\u201d the actress said. \u201cSo Ilana works through her   ( ) and it\u2019s wild. \u201d The show, which began as a web series in 2009, has veered into politics in the past. A season three episode saw Glazer\u2019s character volunteering for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Pandemonium erupts when Clinton makes a surprise visit to the campaign office. On the set of @broadcity season 3 with @abbijacobson, @ilazer and Amy! #yas pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) December 11, 2015,  Jacobson defended Clinton\u2019s appearance on the show, telling Entertainment Weekly that they \u201cwere not trying to make a statement\u201d by having the former Sec. of State on. A year later, however, Glazer said season four was written with the expectation that Hillary Clinton would win the election. \u201cWe wrote (Season 4) being like, \u2018Here we go! Hillary for president! \u2019\u201d Glazer told USA Today. But after \u201cthis   host became president of our country, we rewrote a lot. \u201d The comedy series saw a considerable ratings dip in season three, falling from an average of 1. 2 million viewers in its season one debut in 2014 to about 600, 000 viewers in March 2016. The fourth season of Broad City premieres on Comedy Central August 23.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742562185.4332054}
