Look at them,\u201d said Hillary Clinton, speaking before a crowd in Cincinnati about FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to re-open the investigation into her private email server while investigating the emails from former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is suspected of having sexually charged communications with a 15-year-old girl.\\n\u201cI made a mistake. I\u2019m not making any excuses,\u201d said Clinton.\\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch has objected to Comey\u2019s decision to notify Congress of the re-opened investigation simply because it could interfere with the election less than a week away.
