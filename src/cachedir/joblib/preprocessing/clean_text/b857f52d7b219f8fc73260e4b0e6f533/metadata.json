Trump said on Sunday that he had fallen short in the popular vote in the general election only because millions of people had voted illegally, leveling the baseless claim as part of a daylong storm of Twitter posts voicing anger about a   recount push. \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote Sunday afternoon. The series of posts came one day after Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign said it would participate in a recount effort being undertaken in Wisconsin, and potentially in similar pushes in Michigan and Pennsylvania, by Jill Stein, who was the Green Party candidate. Mr. Trump\u2019s statements revived claims he made during the campaign, as polls suggested he was losing to Mrs. Clinton, about a rigged and corrupt system. The Twitter outburst also came as Mr. Trump is laboring to fill crucial positions in his cabinet, with his advisers enmeshed in a rift over whom he should select as secretary of state. On Sunday morning, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser, extended a public campaign to undermine one contender, Mitt Romney  \u2014   a remarkable display by a member of a  \u2019s team. In television appearances, she accused Mr. Romney of having gone \u201cout of his way to hurt\u201d Mr. Trump during the Republican primary contests. Claims of   voter fraud have been advanced for years by Republicans, though virtually no evidence of such improprieties has been discovered  \u2014   especially on the scale of \u201cmillions\u201d that Mr. Trump claimed. Late on Sunday, again without providing evidence, he referred in a Twitter post to \u201cserious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. \u201d A day earlier, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team ridiculed the idea that recounts were needed. \u201cThis is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded,\u201d it said in a statement, \u201cand the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused. \u201d That message runs counter to the one Mr. Trump sent on Sunday with his fraud claims  \u2014   if millions of people voted illegally, presumably officials across the country would want to pursue   ballot recounts and fraud investigations. But the Twitter posts could energize some of his supporters, who have claimed online that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s two   lead in the popular vote has been faked. Mr. Trump at times promoted other conspiracy theories during the campaign, including claiming that Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father was somehow tied to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters have been galvanized by the notion that vote recounts in the three states  \u2014   where Mr. Trump leads by a combined total of about 100, 000 votes  \u2014   could somehow overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s commanding Electoral College victory. By announcing, three weeks after Mrs. Clinton conceded, that it would participate in the Wisconsin recount, her team has helped reignite the contentious atmosphere of the campaign, of which Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter barrages were a fixture. (By all accounts, Mr. Trump types out many, though not all, of his own Twitter posts.) After spending almost five days in Palm Beach, Fla. where he celebrated Thanksgiving at his    resort, Mr. Trump made no public statements on Sunday other than those via Twitter. He returned in the afternoon to Trump Tower in Manhattan. Through the day, Mr. Trump appeared fixated on the recount and his electoral performance. In a series of midafternoon Twitter posts, not long before he boarded his flight, Mr. Trump boasted that he could have easily won the \u201c  popular vote\u201d if he had campaigned only in \u201c3 or 4\u201d states, presumably populous ones. \u201cI would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\u201d he wrote. The afternoon messages followed a string of   Twitter posts in which Mr. Trump railed against the recount efforts. In an initial post at 7:19, he wrote: \u201cHillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change. \u201d He went on to quote a comment by Mrs. Clinton during one of their debates, in which she said she was horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to say that he would accept the outcome of the election. And he noted that in her concession speech, she had urged people to respect the vote results. \u201c\u2018We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald Trump is going to be our President,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, quoting Mrs. Clinton. One person who spoke with Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend said the   had appeared to be preoccupied by suggestions that a recount might be started, even as his aides played down any concerns. Another friend said Mr. Trump felt crossed by Mrs. Clinton, who he believed had conceded the race and accepted the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team\u2019s general counsel, said the campaign would participate in Ms. Stein\u2019s recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result, partly out of a sense of duty to the millions who voted for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states  \u2014   Michigan  \u2014   well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount,\u201d Mr. Elias said, noting that Clinton campaign officials had found no \u201cactionable evidence\u201d of hacking or attempts to tamper with the vote. Late Sunday night, Mr. Elias responded on Twitter to Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations, writing, \u201cWe are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn\u2019t ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud. \u201d In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22, 177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10, 704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70, 638 votes. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides echoed his concerns about the recount effort in appearances on Sunday morning television news programs. Ms. Conway, who was his campaign manager, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Mrs. Clinton and her campaign advisers would have to decide \u201cwhether they\u2019re going to be a bunch of crybabies. \u201d As for the debate over Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway, echoing comments she posted last week on Twitter, made clear that she opposed choosing Mr. Romney as secretary of state. \u201cThere was the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement, and then there was Gov. Mitt Romney,\u201d she said on ABC. During the primaries, Mr. Romney called Mr. Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony. \u201d Ms. Conway said it was important for Mr. Trump to seek to unify the Republican Party by making gestures to those who opposed his candidacy. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think the cost of party unity has to be the secretary of state position. \u201d Moments after appearing on the show, Ms. Conway, who is under consideration to be Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, wrote on Twitter that she had told Mr. Trump her opinion privately, \u201cand I\u2019ll respect his decision. \u201d On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d she said people felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the idea that Mr. Romney could get a top cabinet job. \u201cI\u2019m not campaigning against anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just a concerned citizen. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if he voted for Donald Trump,\u201d she added.'"}, "time": 1742564383.7795897}
