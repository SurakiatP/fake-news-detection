N. Security Council to block a resolution condemning the attack and calling for its perpetrators to be brought to justice. [China abstained from the vote instead of voting \u201cno,\u201d a decision President Donald Trump praised as \u201cwonderful\u201d and a sign of progress in U. S.  relations since China generally votes with Russia on Syrian affairs.  China\u2019s U. N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said the resolution could be \u201camended\u201d into a form China would vote for and said it was his country\u2019s \u201clongstanding hope that the Security Council can speak with one voice on Syria. \u201d \u201cWith its veto, Russia said no to accountability. Russia once again has chosen to side with Assad, even as the rest of the world, overwhelmingly comes together to condemn this murderous regime,\u201d said the American ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. \u201cYou are isolating yourselves from the international community every time one of Assad\u2019s planes drop another barrel bomb on civilians and every time Assad tries to starve another community to death,\u201d Haley told the Russians. The UK Daily Mail reports on a dramatic confrontation between Russian deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov and British ambassador Matthew Rycroft at the U. N. that reportedly occurred on Wednesday night. \u201cTime and time again, Russia has abused its veto protect the regime and to defend its use of chemical weapons,\u201d said Rycroft. \u201cWhat has Russia got in return for its seven vetoes in six years? Russia\u2019s initiative in 2013 to dismantle Syria\u2019s chemical weapons has been exposed as a shambles. Russian pride in the Astana process has been turned to humiliation and Russia\u2019s credibility and reputation across the world have been poisoned by its toxic association with Assad. \u201d The \u201cAstana process\u201d is a reference to   Syria peace talks held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Safronkov exploded in a   rant at Rycroft, claiming that the United Kingdom was trying to undermine improving relations between the United States and Russia. \u201cYou\u2019re losing sleep that we might be working together with the United States,   with the United States. That is what you fear,\u201d Safronkov thundered at the British ambassador. \u201cYou\u2019re doing everything to make sure this kind of cooperation is undermined. What have you done to advance a  ? You welcome various opposition groups in London and Paris, illegal armed groups. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you dare insult Russia again,\u201d Safronkov reportedly told Rycroft, accusing him of \u201cirresponsibility\u201d and using \u201cdirty language. \u201d At one point during his tirade, when Rycroft turned his attention elsewhere, the Russian deputy ambassador snapped, \u201cLook at me. Don\u2019t turn your eyes away. Why are you looking away?\u201d Safronkov explained that the reason Russia vetoed the U. N. resolution was because it \u201cappointed the guilty party prior to the investigation, prior to an independent and objective investigation,\u201d an approach that was \u201cincompatible with the legal norms. \u201d However, the U. N. resolution did not actually name the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as the perpetrator of the attack. It condemned \u201cthe reported use of chemical weapons, in particular the attack on Khan Sheikhoun\u201d and called upon the Syrian government to fully cooperate with an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The resolution, which was drafted by Britain, France, and the United States, would have obliged Syria to provide flight plans and details of air operations on the day of the chemical weapons attack, the names of its helicopter squadron commanders, and access to airbases from which the attack might have been launched. This was evidently the provision to which Russia objected most strongly. Safronkov\u2019s accusation that the U. K. wanted to sabotage relations between Russia and the U. S. might seem odd, given the talk from both Washington and Moscow about how those relations have hit a   War low, but this is emerging as the official Russian narrative about the current diplomatic tension. For example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that the Trump administration is under pressure from \u201cthose who want to prevent it from curing the wounds inflicted by Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and are using the Russian card in internal political struggles. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable, and we regret what is going on, but we can do little except asking to back accusations with facts,\u201d said Lavrov. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a single fact, although under the pressure of President Donald Trump\u2019s foes the White House has been forced to periodically make statements containing unfounded accusations against us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562450.4829812}
