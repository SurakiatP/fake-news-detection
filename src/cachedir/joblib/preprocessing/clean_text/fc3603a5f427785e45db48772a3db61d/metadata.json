[Gaffney expressed dismay at the combination of these holdovers, globalists President Trump has brought into the White House, plus \u201ca group of establishment Republicans in leadership positions, particularly on the Hill, who align pretty much with those liberal Democrats. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a formula for this president to be foiled at every turn, even if he\u2019s still committed to and pursuing assiduously his agenda,\u201d Gaffney warned. \u201cIf he starts trimming sails, or worse yet throwing ballast out of the balloon all of the things that brought him into office, it will never appease this assorted group of adversaries. I think it will simply reinforce their conviction that if they hang tough, and they hang together, they will be able to keep the swamp full of toxic waste and prevent him from draining it, let alone moving the country forward as he promised to do in the 2016 election. \u201d He suggested the ideas which propelled Trump to victory in 2016 are the glue that holds his unusual coalition of voters together across partisan lines, and also help to explain \u201cwhy Breitbart connects so well with so many people. \u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t just on the right,\u201d he noted. \u201cI think it\u2019s that Trump base, which as you know better than anybody, Alex, wound up being an awful lot of Democrats who were sick to the teeth of what their party has become: an   party. \u201d \u201cI would argue that the thing that brings us together, that brought Donald Trump to the White House as much as anything, was common sense. I think that\u2019s what you serve up in very substantial doses on Breitbart Radio, and it\u2019s a privilege to be able to contribute to that,\u201d said Gaffney. Asked to grade President Trump\u2019s first 100 Days from a national security perspective, Gaffney said \u201cthere are some points that are encouraging. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m very happy with a lot of his rhetoric, notably about restoring American policy to the practice of peace through strength, which my old boss Ronald Reagan of course espoused. I like the fact that he has set his sights on rebuilding our military, ensuring that our military deterrent is once again \u2018top of the pack,\u2019 as he put it, that we have a     missile defense for example. I think some of the uses of power that he has conducted have also helped give credibility to those rhetorical statements,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cThat\u2019s on the plus side, Alex. On the negative side, I have to say I am very troubled that he is not pursuing what he promised  \u2014   as I think he must  \u2014   in regards to one particularly dangerous aspect of the national security picture, and of course that\u2019s the phenomenon he\u2019s called \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019 I call it sharia supremacism, but whatever term you prefer, it is very much with us,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe thing that is most alarming to me, which causes my grade to be considerably lower than it might otherwise be  \u2014   maybe a C,  ?  \u2014   is the appointment of people to his national security team who do not get the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. In fact, some of them refuse even to call it that, which is evidence of a disconnect with this president that I think is not only a problem, but it\u2019s undermining his effectiveness in a very critical space,\u201d he said. Gaffney agreed with Marlow that the specter of \u201cclimate change\u201d obsession still hangs over the national security apparatus, describing it as \u201ca priority for Ivanka Trump and apparently for Jared Kushner, who are playing outsize roles in all aspects of the administration\u2019s   it seems. \u201d \u201cThere is no question that many of the people that are either holdovers from the previous administration, or that have been brought in by this new administration, have not simply paid lip service to the Obama agenda on national security  \u2014   whether it\u2019s calling radical Islamic   supremacism what they used as a euphemism, \u2018violent extremism,\u2019 which really in a way meant that they could justify being as worried about returning veterans and Tea Party activists and constitutionalists as they were about Islamists  \u2014   on the one hand, and then on the other there\u2019s this idea that really the problem that we are confronting is actually climate change, not live human beings seeking our destruction. I think this is, again, completely at odds with common sense and the national security interests of the United States,\u201d he warned. Marlow asked if the Trump administration is \u201cholding Iran accountable for their pursuit of nuclear weapons adequately at this point. \u201d \u201cThis is a classic example of what we\u2019ve just been talking about in the abstract,\u201d Gaffney replied. \u201cYou had Obama holdovers who were deeply involved in bringing this disastrous deal  \u2014   the president was absolutely right, it is arguably the worst deal ever negotiated, in fact it isn\u2019t even a deal, nobody signed this thing  \u2014   but it was brought to him by people who are still staffing his administration. One of them, I believe, was instrumental in getting the State Department last week to certify that the Iranians are complying with this deal. \u201d  \u201cFirst of all, that\u2019s not true,\u201d he objected. \u201cSecond of all, even if they were, it would still mean they could be beavering away at a nuclear weapon, and they are. \u201d  \u201cThe president was furious, I\u2019m told, when he discovered the State Department had done this,\u201d Gaffney revealed. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, given who\u2019s staffing most of it below Rex Tillerson\u2019s level. But he\u2019s directed, apparently, Rex Tillerson to muster out the next day, Wednesday of last week, and deliver personally a statement essentially denouncing the Iranians both for the nuclear deal and for terrorism, and much much more  \u2014   properly so. \u201d  \u201cThere is a certain incoherence, I think it\u2019s fair to say, that emerged in part because people who lack common sense are still helping to guide his policy, and he\u2019s obliged to try to correct it. This is no way to run a government,\u201d he declared.  \u201cI hope he will clean house at long last, both with respect to this odious deal, but also more generally, and bring in people who supported him in the campaign, who get national security the way I think he does  \u2014   certainly the way he ran on, his platform of peace through strength. By so doing, I think we have a shot at turning this thing around. If we don\u2019t get those changes, though, the grade is going to be a lot worse in the second hundred days, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. Gaffney said he hoped legislators briefed by the White House on North Korea would seize the opportunity to \u201chear what I think is the single most ominous threat from North Korea, bar none. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not gotten a lot of attention. Jim Woolsey, the former director of Central Intelligence under Bill Clinton, Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, among others have been warning for a long time that what the North Koreans have almost certainly done  \u2014   and if they haven\u2019t, they could at any moment  \u2014   is place aboard one of their two satellites now in orbit, or future ones, a small nuclear weapon that is optimized to create something called electromagnetic pulse,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a weapon like that were detonated over the United States  \u2014   and those satellites overfly it all the time  \u2014   it would be the end of our electric grid, and our nation,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThat threat must be neutralized, Alex. I believe, I hope that\u2019s what the administration is going to talk to them about on the Hill today and in the White House complex. Also, we need to protect the electric grid against these sorts of threats. \u201d Gaffney expressed gratitude to Breitbart News for \u201cthe emphasis it has placed on doing just that. \u201d He expected the congressional briefings on North Korea to include information about \u201ctheir ballistic missile program, and about their nuclear weapons testing, and about their belligerent statements, and perhaps about the pathology of this lunatic who runs the country, and those sorts of things. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all old news,\u201d he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t know that if that\u2019s all that is described, it will be that useful an exercise. But if, as I pray, these legislators will be told about the sorts of threats that I\u2019ve just described, it will I hope really concentrate the minds and support what the president\u2019s trying to do to bring the North Koreans to heel. \u201d Gaffney added that if China is \u201cenabling the North Korean threat\u201d instead of helping us contain it, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do it ourselves. \u201d \u201cIt would start, in my judgment, with neutralizing those satellites now overhead, and ensuring there aren\u2019t new ones put up there that could have this kind of   threat aboard them,\u201d he advised. He noted China certainly could be helpful if it wanted to.  \u201cThey could make all the difference in the world. If they say it\u2019s over for Kim   it\u2019s over. But I see no evidence that they intend to do that,\u201d he said. Gaffney pointed out that the missile canisters displayed by North Korea in recent military parades \u201clooked an awful lot like Chinese   canisters, and they were aboard    that were provided by the Chinese. \u201d \u201cThose are tangible signs that the Chinese think a more dangerous North Korea  \u2014   one that worries us, worries us to the point where we might give them concessions, or at least give concessions to North Korea to prop up this client state of theirs  \u2014   this is a practice, this is a policy that is being deliberately pursued by the Chinese, and has been for years,\u201d he charged. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are on our side. Could they be? Yes. I don\u2019t see evidence of them doing it just yet,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cI think that the Chinese are pursuing a   strategy which has, at its core, displacing the United States as a global power, certainly in their region of the world, but I think it\u2019s really worldwide. \u201d  \u201cI think that having strong and dangerous clients like North Korea, and frankly building bases around the world, and fortifying new islands they\u2019re creating in the South China Sea, and massing their military for future global operations are all signs that is where they\u2019re headed. I think their policy toward North Korea is part of that larger strategic design,\u201d he judged. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
