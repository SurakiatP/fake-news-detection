Security Council president now dedicated to the struggle against socialist Chavismo in his native country  \u2014   sees removing dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power as only a first step in saving Venezuela from decades of corruption and decay. [Arria emphasized in an interview with Breitbart News, conducted in both Spanish and English, that removing Maduro would do little to establish a free democratic republic in Venezuela without a clean sweep of the thousands of government employees and soldiers affiliated with terrorism, drug crime, and still loyal to a socialist model of government.  \u201c[We need] a model based on liberty, free economy  \u2014   not a   or socialist model or anything remotely like that,\u201d Arria noted. \u201cIf we do not change the political and economic model, we will always be an unstable country. \u201d Arria deemed this establishment of a   political and economic model a \u201crefounding of the republic,\u201d which would require a new constitution and an abandonment of both the leftist ideology of the ruling party and the   approach of the official opposition. The Venezuelan opposition today largely focuses on the removal of Maduro from power, demanding free and fair elections. What the leaders of the opposition wish to see replace Maduro is not clearly defined, largely because of their own backgrounds: many also identify as socialists. While they oppose the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) many of the parties that form the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) the opposition coalition in the National Assembly, are member parties of the Socialist International, including Popular Will, the party led by political prisoner Leopoldo L\u00f3pez. Henry Ramos Allup, a key member of the Venezuelan opposition, is a vice president of the Socialist International. Asked to explain this phenomenon to an American audience, who largely reject the label \u201csocialist,\u201d Arria laments that many Venezuelan parties feel the need to identify as socialist, even nominally. \u201cFor a long time, the official opposition was \u2018Chavista light\u2019  \u2026     there has been a sort of hijacking of the political class, as if the Socialist International were the club of dignified, enlightened, or democratic governments in the world when this is not true,\u201d he notes. \u201cAmong the official parties there are all kinds [of ideologies] but all are social democrats or moderate socialists, there is not a single [other kind]. \u201d \u201cIn Venezuela, people have a complex about calling themselves conservative,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have to enter a period of transition,\u201d he explained, \u201cthat will not be conventional, it will not be a \u2018Jeffersonian model\u2019 [of reform] because Venezuela has things like this:\u201d We have 50, 000 Cubans in Venezuela. This is more than the number of forces that Spain had occupying Venezuela during our war of independence. I am not saying that these 50, 000 Cubans are all soldiers, but thousands of them are trained for these ends. We have 100, 000 militiamen, paramilitaries  \u2026     and the influence of the drug cartels in the armed forces, in police forces, in the judicial system. How do you remove that simply with an election replacing one government with another? Late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez forged a lasting bond with the communist government of Cuba that persists to this day, in which Venezuela relies heavily on Cuba for doctors, ( ) medicine, soldiers, and intelligence officials. Venezuela supplies Cuba with oil, filling a void left by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Venezuelans have long complained that among the cruelest and most violent state officers acting against peaceful protesters have been Cubans, easily identified by their accents and superior ranking. The word \u201ccolony\u201d for what the Castros have done to Venezuela surfaces often. A 2013 estimate by   General Antonio Rivero put the number of Cuban nationals that had passed through Venezuela since Ch\u00e1vez took power at upwards of 200, 000. Arria emphasizes that civilian Cubans seeking an escape from the island prison are not the problem. \u201cTo begin with, the ones who are doctors and sports players, I\u2019m sure they would like to stay in Venezuela, so those are no problem because you give them nationality and they are fine,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe problem is with the people who are today in the intelligence departments  \u2026     Cubans have killed Venezuelans and tortured Venezuelans and they are doing that now. \u201d Rescuing Venezuela from failed state status, then, also requires the demise of the Castro regime, because any resources that fall in the hands of the Castros further their colonial ambitions in the South American country. \u201cYou cannot exclude in the U. S.  agenda my own country, because we play a fundamental role in the preservation of the Cuban economy and we pay the consequences of that relationship,\u201d he notes.
