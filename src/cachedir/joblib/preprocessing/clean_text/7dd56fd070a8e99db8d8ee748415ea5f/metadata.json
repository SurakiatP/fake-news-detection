The conversation began with her thoughts on the previous night\u2019s airstrike against Syria. [\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned. I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Geller said. \u201cIt seems like a   reaction. It doesn\u2019t speak to a coherent policy. It seems to me that Trump has switched sides. \u201d  LISTEN: \u201cIt does seem that way,\u201d Kassam agreed. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been saying for now the last 48 hours: there seems to be a malign influence on him. He\u2019s saying things like, hey, we can get you really good coverage. CNN will stop writing \u2018Trump\u2019 on its chyron, they\u2019ll start writing \u2018President Trump\u2019 on its chyron. Time magazine will put you on the front, and this time it won\u2019t be scary or a joke. We\u2019ll make you look like a leading statesman around the world. All you have to do is compromise on every single thing you said during the campaign. \u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Geller said with a rueful laugh. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m laughing, but I\u2019m laughing with blood. It\u2019s not funny. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know when he began to care. I mean, that was the beauty of Trump. For those of us that have been in the trenches, you have to become inured to this kind of withering criticism. You have to develop a crocodile skin. He seemed to have it. He seemed to have come to the party with it. It was really sort of the most fantastic thing about him,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand, I always console myself with, \u2018It\u2019s not Hillary.\u2019 That\u2019s always my mantra. It\u2019s my religion,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this really, I think, is a terrible mistake. Back in 2012, my organization American Freedom Defense Initiative, issued a call to President Obama and to the United Nations warning of an impending genocide in Syria. I\u2019ve been acutely aware of what\u2019s going on in Syria. They did nothing, and millions of Christians and religious minorities were slaughtered. I don\u2019t understand this visceral response. And what is the objective? Who are we partnering with? What   \u2018rebel gang\u2019  \u2014   is it  ? Which   satellite are we partnering with?\u201d She shared Kassam\u2019s skepticism about the size of the truly \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel force in Syria, and whether Western intelligence services could identify real moderates and work with them effectively. Kassam noted ISIS,   and the other \u201creal, real enemies\u201d of the United States were celebrating the attack, and asked what conclusions should be drawn from it. \u201cIt tells us that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing there,\u201d Geller replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing there. I understand the   \u2018humanitarian,\u2019 but I\u2019m always first and foremost concerned about national interest. What is the national interest of this for us?\u201d \u201cLook, Obama gave Syria to Russia. He did. He gave it to Russia, and so this could very well escalate into something truly unforeseen,\u201d she warned. \u201cI just think the United States should have taken action in a comprehensive, and logical, and strategic way years ago. Right now, it\u2019s just a huge catastrophe, and what\u2019s he doing? Is he putting a finger in the dam? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s that. Is it just this action?\u201d Geller stressed that it was President Barack Obama\u2019s policies that led to this moment.  \u201cHe turned Syria over to Russia, and so this could escalate to World War III, and for what? For Syria? Seriously?\u201d she said. \u201cMy concern is that like President Bush, President Trump has two factions warring with each other. In the case of President Bush, it was    Bolton, the hawks as it were, versus the trimmers, versus the RINOs like Colin Powell, Condi Rice, Hadley Burns,\u201d she judged. \u201cAnd the trimmers always win, because it seems like the safe bet. It seems like the   \u2018extremists\u2019 are taking it a step too far. \u201d \u201cBut the fact of the matter is, it\u2019s the trimmers that get you into trouble, because you can\u2019t have a bold policy, you can\u2019t go after a bold policy \u201d Geller warned.  \u201cI\u2019m concerned about McMaster, who is just another one who denies the motivating ideology of the terrorists,\u201d she said of President Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser. \u201cHe says jihad terror is not Islamic. This hampers our ability to respond to terrorism effectively. You can\u2019t defeat an enemy that you don\u2019t understand. \u201d Geller and Kassam found this a contradiction of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to speak forthrightly about the dangers of radical Islamic terrorism. \u201cHe promised to deal effectively with the terrorism problem and call it Islamic,\u201d Geller recalled. \u201cThis is exactly what Obama and Hillary refused to do. McMaster represents a defeat for the Trump promise to drain the swamp. It\u2019s a retreat from his stated goals. Believe me, it pains me to say this. It gives me no pleasure. \u201d \u201cAnd Mattis, that \u2018terrorism defames Islam\u2019  \u2014   what book are they reading?\u201d she added. \u201cAre they not reading the Koran? I mean listen, just because you talk about it this way doesn\u2019t mean that all Muslims are terrorists. But we don\u2019t have to pat on the back every Muslim that doesn\u2019t want to kill us. \u201d \u201cDo you think Jared Kushner or Dina Powell has ever read the Koran   ? Do they understand the enemy?\u201d Kassam asked, referring to President Trump\u2019s    and deputy national security adviser for strategy, respectively. \u201cNo, I think Kushner\u2019s a Manhattan liberal. That\u2019s what I think,\u201d Geller replied. \u201cAnd I think that he may be a very smart kid, but that\u2019s got nothing to do with the price of eggs in China. I think that he has undue influence. I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these moves with the settlements in Israel, the   \u2018  solution,\u2019 inviting these Palestinian terrorists into this country  \u2026    \u201d Kassam interjected to suggest adding Ivanka Trump\u2019s reported meetings with Planned Parenthood to the list. \u201cYes, this is Kushner. I don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to have to lose before Trump gets back on track. He\u2019ll have to get back on track, because we\u2019ve suffered under these failed policies, for the past really 15 years,\u201d Geller said, quoting Albert Einstein\u2019s famed admonition that \u201cdoing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result\u201d is the definition of insanity.
