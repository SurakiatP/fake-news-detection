Journalists, their subscriptions and ratings spiking, howled about another move to undercut the role the free press plays in a democracy (which \u201cDies in Darkness\u201d as the new Washington Post slogan has it). The administration doubled down on its antipress aggression, this time declaring it was \u201cgoing to get worse every day\u201d for these \u201cglobalist\u201d and \u201ccorporatist\u201d journalists (and other such gobbledygook from the former Goldman Sachs executive Stephen K. Bannon). And all the while, so many of the most important and credible leaders in the president\u2019s own party more or less kept their traps shut or looked the other way. If there were ever a moment for government leaders who believe that true information unearthed by independent news sources is vital to our nation to stand up and say so, this would be it. President Trump\u2019s argument that the national press corps is illegitimate and dishonest has emerged as one of the most consistent themes of his presidency, alongside  \u2014   and seemingly as important to him  \u2014   his calls for a major tax code overhaul, an end to Obamacare, a border wall and \u201cextreme vetting. \u201d Those other parts of his agenda appeal to large groups of Republicans on Capitol Hill, including the leaders of the House and the Senate. So you could see the appeal of staying out of the way to let Mr. Trump do his thing against the press  \u2014   no great favorite on The Hill anyway  \u2014   as their other big policy dishes marinate and cook. But they might be wise to rethink that strategy. The journalism that Mr. Trump and his aides seek to delegitimize today could be the legitimate research and bipartisan data points they try to use to make policy arguments with Mr. Trump tomorrow. There\u2019s also that part of putting your money where your mouth is after spending long careers extolling the genius of the founders who created our system to ensure our president never became an infallible king, ever cognizant that, as James Madison put it, \u201cpopular government without popular information,\u201d is \u201ca prologue to a farce or tragedy. \u201d Asked on Thursday about Mr. Trump\u2019s first declaration that the press was \u201cthe enemy,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said, \u201cI don\u2019t view you guys as the enemy. \u201d It warms the heart. He went on to say: \u201cI expect adversarial questions. And you rarely disappoint me. And I think it\u2019s part of what make America function. \u201d It was a start, I guess. But it fell short of the   \u201cknock it off\u201d to Mr. Trump that these times demand, at least when it comes to calling true journalism false or calling journalists dishonest enemies. The office of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, declined to engage with me on Saturday when I asked for a comment on whether Mr. Ryan was comfortable with what I called Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to delegitimize the fourth estate. His office said it disputed the premise of the question. As a couple of senior congressional Republican aides told me on Saturday  \u2014   on condition of anonymity, to speak candidly about private discussions  \u2014   there is a view on their side of the aisle that, while Mr. Trump\u2019s bombast is notable, the press is being too quick to hyperventilate, and that, in the end, things will be just fine. And every week I wonder about it myself  \u2014   how serious are all the threats and bluster against the news media by Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, given that news organizations continue to break big stories about the administration with help from leaks that have not abated despite the presidential pounding? None of it stopped The Washington Post from reporting on Friday that presidential aides, after failing to convince the F. B. I. to publicly dispute reports by The New York Times and CNN about contact between Trump campaign aides and Russian intelligence, went on to successfully pressure other intelligence officials and key congressmen to do the same. It didn\u2019t keep The Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal from reporting on a Department of Homeland Security assessment disputing the basis for the administration\u2019s attempt to block travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Nor did it stop the news team at KOKH, a Fox television station in Oklahoma City, from learning and reporting that Mr. Trump\u2019s new leader of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, conducted some state business by private email during his time as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, despite denying that he did so in recent Senate testimony. On Saturday, I turned to a sage of the Washington press corps, Bob Schieffer of CBS, whose time in Washington dates to the Nixon administration, to see how seriously he took the recent threats against the press. It was his 80th birthday. \u201cWe need to be taking this very seriously  \u2014   any time you undermine the press, I think that\u2019s very dangerous for democracy,\u201d Mr. Schieffer said. \u201cDo we want a situation where the only source of information is the government? I mean, really? Somehow I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the founders intended. \u201d Mr. Schieffer was struck by Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration on Friday that the press should not rely on anonymous government sources when his administration had pushed officials to speak anonymously to reporters that very same day. Mr. Trump was quite fond of anonymous sources himself when, for instance, he promoted the lie that President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States by announcing \u201can extremely credible source\u201d had told him Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cbirth certificate is a fraud. \u201d All of which leaves the question of what\u2019s to be done about it. The most obvious answer came in the statement CNN made after the network  \u2014   along with The New York Times, BuzzFeed, Politico and The Los Angeles Times  \u2014   was cut out of an   press briefing with Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Friday: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep reporting regardless,\u201d the network declared. There should be, however, legitimate questions about whether that reporting should include blanket coverage of the next speech Mr. Trump gives in which he calls honest journalists dishonest or \u201cthe opposition. \u201d Those kinds of polemical statements are no longer \u201cnews\u201d (defined as \u201cnew\u201d) but rather part of a repetitive, antipress, negative branding campaign. Another lesson came on Friday after several news organizations went along with Mr. Spicer\u2019s exclusive gaggle, including CBS News, ABC News, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, even as Time and The Associated Press refused. After Twitter vented proper umbrage  \u2014   I was in that chorus  \u2014   The Journal and Bloomberg said they wouldn\u2019t \u201cparticipate in exclusionary briefings of the sort that happened today\u201d in the future, as the Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait said. It was the   thing to do. Your turn, responsible leaders of America.'"}, "time": 1742563074.8520708}
