And has that person been drawn and quartered?\u201d \\nYikes, better sooner than later? Which emails? And then why would Podesta think they need to dump all of those emails if there isn\u2019t anything important in them? They mus have just about yoga, right? Hah. \\nIntent? Hey, I\u2019ve got an idea! let\u2019s blame the Russians! \\nPass the popcorn please\u2026 \\nIt is also not clear which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: \u201cbetter to do so sooner than later.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.
