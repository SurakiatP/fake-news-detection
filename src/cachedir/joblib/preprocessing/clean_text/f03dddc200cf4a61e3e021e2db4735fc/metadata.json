Satirists, who had hoped to resume control of a vehicle that has now nullified itself by creating real world conditions so ridiculous that it is impossible to send them up, called the decision \u2018disappointing but understandable\u2019. \\n\u2018Just to recap,\u2019 said Satire, \u2018I actually began all this in the States a year ago so it\u2019s come full circle. The joke seemed to have gone stale after a while, so I switched to Britain. I whipped up an unnecessary referendum, chucked in some grotesque stock characters and got an overgrown blonde child to pretend to be for one side when he had been for the other just months before.\u2019 \\n\u2018I encouraged him to do just enough to get an honourable defeat, only to have him win so that his school chum who had been ruling the country had to resign. Then, I arranged for his weird sidekick to stab him in the back, only to get chucked out in turn, then let two demonic female figures fight it out and had one win who thought much the same as the original man about the original problem, which wasn\u2019t really a problem at all and ensured she is bound to win an election on the decision, even though most people regret it.\u2019 \\nAt that point, Satire took a back seat, agreeing that the possibility of a fictional orange-skinned character might become the world\u2019s most powerful man after a campaign based on telling obvious lies, losing every debate and winning the evangelical vote by gripping vaginas was just too ridiculous to write about. Now, however, he has decided to make another go of it. \\n\u2018OK, so I\u2019m in my comfort zone now,\u2019 Satire concluded. \u2018The world\u2019s leading nation devoting its entire energy to building a wall to stop brown-skinned people coming to do the jobs they won\u2019t do themselves, people protesting against the 1% by voting for the epitome of the 1%, a thin-skinned, twice-bankrupt narcissist making decisions that will affect the whole world for a generation \u2013 it\u2019s going to be epic. I mean, seriously, what\u2019s the worst that could happen? \u2026 Nuclear war, you say? Hey, that could lead to another satire boom too. Boom \u2013 geddit? Did you see what I did there? Oh please yourselves\u2026\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 9th, 2016 by Oxbridge Click for more article by Oxbridge .. More Stories about: Left Alert 0'"}, "time": 1742561788.091362}
