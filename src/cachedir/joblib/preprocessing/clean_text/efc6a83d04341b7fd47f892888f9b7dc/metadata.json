Going into the weekend, most box office analysts predicted that \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d would easily remain the No. 1 movie in North America. One challenger, \u201cThe Boss Baby,\u201d had received negative reviews. (The Los Angeles Times deemed it a \u201crancid diaper. \u201d) Another new arrival, \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d had been written off as a contender after becoming embroiled in a \u201cwhitewashing\u201d casting controversy. But \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d  \u2014   in the tradition of \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking,\u201d Stewie from \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and the   Baby Herman from \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d  \u2014   proved enormously popular, pushing past Belle of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d to take in roughly $49 million. Theaters far from the coasts (Indianapolis, Denver) saw especially strong turnout, according to the film\u2019s distributor, 20th Century Fox. Produced by DreamWorks Animation, \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d cost at least $200 million to make and market. It has taken in an additional $59 million overseas. Alec Baldwin, riding a wave of popularity for his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d portrayal of President Trump, gave voice to the baby. \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d (Disney) had $47. 5 million in ticket sales, for a   domestic total of $395 million and a global one of $876 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Fizzling in third place was \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a   version of a  Japanese manga by Shirow Masamune. It collected about $19 million  \u2014   not nearly enough given production and marketing costs of at least $150 million. \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d (DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures) was also weak overseas, where it took in about $40 million. Casting Scarlett Johansson in a role originally played by an Asian actor was one misstep. The marketing may have been another Paramount\u2019s campaign was visually arresting but failed to broaden the film\u2019s appeal beyond older male   fans. And the film was in many ways a mishmash, leading to weak reviews and word of mouth, as evidenced by CinemaScore exit polls.'"}, "time": 1742562187.657008}
