We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. \\nAs Breitbart reported , the focus of the day was supposed to be Obamacare and the enormous premium increases hitting Americans, but the FBI announcement changed things for not only Trump\u2019s speech, but maybe for the rest of the campaign. \\nIn light of the huge FBI announcement, advisers reportedly told Trump to skip the speech, but he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire.\u201d \\nTrump went ahead with his speech and touched on the major themes of his campaign, with bits about the FBI revelation sprinkled in. \\n\u201cJob-killing Obamacare is one more way the system is rigged. But with what I just announced, previously, it might not be as rigged as I thought, right? Right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe FBI, I think they are going to right the ship, folks. I think they are going to right the ship and they\u2019re going to save their great reputation by doing so.\u201d \\nWe\u2019ll see if this investigation does anything to \u201cright the ship.\u201d As FBI Director James Comey noted in his letter to Congress: \\nAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. \\nThis could all be one big smokescreen in an effort to somehow help Clinton, particularly if she should be elected president. It could also be something so damning that even Comey felt like he couldn\u2019t look the other way\u2026which, given the cover-up and lack of indictment, that would really be saying something. \\nTime will tell, of course, but at the very least this revelation is another blow to the Clinton campaign. It doesn\u2019t seem likely that an investigation will be completed before election day, so there will certainly be yet another cloud hanging over the corrupt campaign.'"}, "time": 1742563432.6244657}
