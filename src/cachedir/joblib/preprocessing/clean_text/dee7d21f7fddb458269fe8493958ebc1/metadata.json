Or if you\u2019ve had a bit of a flirty email exchange with that girl from accounts who you felt you had a bit of chemistry with, but then you took it a bit too far that one time and now suddenly realise you are in grave danger of being dismissed for sexual harassment. \\n\u201cYou know, everyday sort of situations.\u201d \\nThe new Microsoft Office suite is due to be released next year, and Outlook is reportedly not the only software with a Clinton inspired update. \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tweaked Internet Explorer a little too,\u201d continued Mr Williams. \\n\u201cFor those users who routinely forget to use InPrivate Browsing, we will be adding a \u2018Bill\u2019 button which with one click will simultaneously close your browsing window and delete all of your search history and cookies. \\n\u201cThis will protect you from your wife ever knowing that you googled \u2018What is Monica Lewinsky up to these days\u2019. \\n\u201cOr in the case of a regular user it will prevent your spouse finding out whatever niche, depraved pornography you are into when she unexpectedly returns from a work social an hour early and catches you mid self-pleasure. \\n\u201cAgain, just normal, everyday situations our customers find themselves in.\u201d \\nThe button will be adjacent to the Minimize, Maximize and Close icons on the top toolbar, thereby saving the user a frantic search of the menus while pathetically attempting to conceal their erection as their significant other approaches. \\nIndustry experts are expecting sales to be high.
