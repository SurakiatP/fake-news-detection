The signs at some stands call it \u201canguria\u201d others say \u201ccocomero\u201d or \u201cmelone d\u2019acqua. \u201d Why so many different words for the same fruit? Because in their daily lives, many Italians don\u2019t speak Italian. That is, they don\u2019t shop or chat or argue in standard Italian, the kind that is studied in school and heard on the news. They use one of the country\u2019s hundreds of local dialects, each with its own quirks of pronunciation, inflection and vocabulary. \u201cYou call it watermelon in New York, and that would be \u2018anguria\u2019 in Italian,\u201d said Tino Mattiussi, a   owner of a fruit and vegetable stand in the colorful Campo de\u2019 Fiori market in central Rome. \u201cBut here, everyone knows it as \u2018cocomero,\u2019 so I wrote what people understand better. \u201d A few stands away, Mauro Ranucci had a different approach. \u201cWe advertise it as \u2018anguria,\u2019 as that is Italian,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s how people call it in the north. \u201d When a southerner once asked him for a \u201cmelone d\u2019acqua,\u201d Mr. Ranucci said, it took him a minute to realize what he meant. \u201cWe all speak Italian with strong regional connotations, even if the discrepancies are minor,\u201d said Giovanni Ronco, vice director of the Italian Linguistic Atlas. \u201cNo other country has so many linguistic differences in such a limited space. \u201d For centuries, Italy was a fragmented patchwork of thousands of small, insular communities. When the country unified in 1861, 90 percent of the population was illiterate and spoke only the local tongue. They are called Italian dialects, Mr. Ronco said, but many of these tongues are really separate languages, descended directly from Latin. That helps account for the many names for familiar things, even within a single region. An anchovy is an \u201calice\u201d in some parts of southern Italy, for example, but an \u201cacciuga\u201d in others. Neighboring dialects may be similar, but people from opposite ends of Italy  \u2014   say, Sicily and Lombardy  \u2014   might struggle to understand what the other said. Only in the 1950s, when televisions began to appear in bars and homes, did many ordinary Italians around the country start to hear the same standard language being spoken it\u2019s based on the Florentine dialect, which was used in the former royal courts and in many great works of literature. Now, most people know standard Italian as well as their local dialect  \u2014   which sometimes necessitates thinking twice about what to call a fruit. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big problem, after all,\u201d Mr. Ranucci said as he offered a customer a yellow and dark red peach. \u201cIf we don\u2019t understand each other, we just gesticulate. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563935.4399147}
