[Melania filed the suit in September in a Montgomery County, Maryland court alleging that   author Webster G. Tarpley libeled her when he called her a prostitute. The Daily Mail was also named in the suit for repeating the slanderous accusation.  \u201cThese defendants made several statements about Mrs. Trump that are 100 percent false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation,\u201d attorney Charles Harder said as he filed the suit last year. Lawyers for Tarpley and The Daily Mail had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, but this week Judge Sharon Burrell rejected arguments to summarily dismiss the lawsuit for failing to meet the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard for libel against public figures, Politico reported. Judge Burrell said that it seemed pretty clear that \u201c  escort\u201d can be construed to mean \u201cprostitute,\u201d and by that understanding there was enough to justify a charge of libel. \u201cThe court believes most people, when they hear the words \u2018  escort\u2019 that describes a prostitute. There could be no more defamatory statement than to call a woman a prostitute,\u201d Burrell wrote in her decision. The judge did not make it clear, though, if the inclusion of the British Daily Mail was going to be sustained. Since the paper is a foreign corporation, it is still unclear if the Mail would be dismissed from the suit, and Burrell did not rule on that aspect of the case. But for the claims by Tarpley\u2019s attorney, Burrell was dismissive. She said Tarpley\u2019s claim that the suit should be dismissed because it was brought in bad faith was clearly untrue (dismissing his SLAAP claim) and also proclaimed her skepticism that Tarpley\u2019s disgusting accusations were of the sort that should be protected under First Amendment rules  \u2014   most especially because Melania was just the wife of a candidate and not a candidate herself. \u201cThe interests affected are arguably not that important because the plaintiff wasn\u2019t the one running for office,\u201d the judge said. Burrell also didn\u2019t buy Tarpley\u2019s claim that his assertions were just \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d meant to enliven his text. She called his court claims \u201cword games\u201d meant to absolve him of blame. One claim made by Trump\u2019s legal team was tossed out. Harder claimed that Tarpley\u2019s accusations damaged Melania\u2019s current and prospective business deals, but Judge Burrell said the claims were too vague. The judge did promise to revisit the claims if Melania\u2019s lawyers could make them more specific. Trump\u2019s attorney is himself a bit of a celebrity, having helped former wrestler Hulk Hogan win his$140 million lawsuit against Gawker Media.
