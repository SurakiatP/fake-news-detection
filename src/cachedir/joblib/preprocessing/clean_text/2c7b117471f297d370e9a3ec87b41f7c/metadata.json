The other passenger was ostentatiously puffing on a big cigar. My friend pointed to the no smoking sign and politely, in Hebrew, asked the man to douse his smoke. \\n\u201cEff you,\u201d the man replied. \u201cWe\u2019re in charge now.\u201d Only he didn\u2019t say, \u201cEff.\u201d The Confederate battle flag, seen by many around the world as a symbol of white supremacy, has had a resurgence in public displays following Donald Trump\u2019s victory. \\nSound familiar? Well, it\u2019s a tiptoe through the tulips compared to what\u2019s going on in the United States right now. Incidents of hate-related violence and other abuses have proliferated throughout this lovely land of ours. \\nThe presidential campaign and now the election results have further allowed the pinheads of society to let their racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic freak flags fly. Despite denials from many on the Right and the Trump transition team, this is really happening \u2014 unlike that avalanche of fake news stories that have been overwhelming social media. (And yes, I know have been scattered incidents in which Trump followers have been vilified on the streets, but far fewer.) \\nJournalists who investigated Trump, his businesses, family and associates have been mailed anti-Semitic screeds or threatened with violence and even death. Women who have reported on Trump have been sent the vilest sexist epithets. Kshama Sawant, the socialist city council member from Seattle who recently urged protests at Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, has been targeted for email and phone attacks, some of which have suggested that she kill herself. \\nJust about everyone I know has a story or two or three from the last week and a half. My friend Deana tells of a part-Asian co-worker swung at by a white male who mistook him as being from the Middle East, of a friend\u2019s boyfriend who was told to \u201cGo back to Africa\u201d on his Facebook page, of another friend\u2019s middle-school-aged daughter and other girls who were pushed around by boys in her class, some wearing Trump T-shirts and shouting hateful things about women. \\nAn Upsurge in Ugliness \\nFrom the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) : \u201cBetween Wednesday, Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election, and the morning of Monday, Nov. 14, [SPLC] collected 437 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment\u2026 Venues of harassment included K-12 schools (99), businesses (76) and universities (67). Common also was vandalism and leafleting on private property (40) and epithets and slurs hurled from moving vehicles (38).\u201d   Trump and his running mate Mike Pence thank their supporters for the upset victory on Nov. 8, 2016.

According to their statistics, \u201cThere were 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 7,121 victims. Of those victims, 59.2 percent were targeted because of a race/ethnicity/ancestry bias; 19.7 percent because of a religious bias; 17.7 percent because of a sexual-orientation bias; 1.7 percent because of a gender-identity bias; 1.2 percent because of a disability bias; and 0.4 percent because of a gender bias.\u201d \\nCamila Domonosket at NPR notes, \u201cThe FBI report is based on local law enforcement data. It almost certainly understates the scale of the problem: In 2014, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated, based on victim surveys, that 60 percent of hate crimes are never reported to police.\u201d \\nHere in New York City, the police department reports that so far in 2016 , hate crimes have jumped 30 percent from the same period last year, \u201cincluding a spike during last week\u2019s hotly contested presidential election,\u201d according to DNAInfo New York . \u201cNYPD statistics show that anti-Muslim and anti-\u2018sexual orientation\u2019 motivations were responsible for much of the rise.\u201d \\nBut what was Donald Trump\u2019s response to the reports of the upswing in hate crimes after his election? \u201cI am very surprised to hear that,\u201d he told 60 Minutes\u2019 Lesley Stahl . \u201cI hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that.\u201d \\nLesley Stahl: But you do hear it? \\nDonald Trump: I don\u2019t hear it \u2014 I saw, I saw one or two instances\u2026 \\nLesley Stahl: On social media? \\nDonald Trump: But I think it\u2019s a very small amount. Again, I think it\u2019s \u2014 \\nLesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people? \\nDonald Trump: I would say don\u2019t do it, that\u2019s terrible, \u2018cause I\u2019m gonna bring this country together. \\nLesley Stahl: They\u2019re harassing Latinos, Muslims \u2014 \\nDonald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u201cStop it.\u201d If it \u2014 if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it. \\n\u201cStop it.\u201d Really? That\u2019s all? You sounded like a parent telling the kids in the back seat to quit fidgeting. Make your condemnation swift, adamant and loud. We know you know how to do loud. Demand that it cease. \\nThe Bannon Factor \\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, Mr. President-elect, the appointment of your campaign CEO Steve Bannon as counselor and chief White House strategist makes a hideous situation even worse. Cancel it. Steve Bannon, political adviser to   Trump. (Photo from YouTube) \\nThis is, after all, the person who \u2014 more than a year ago! \u2014 Joshua Green at Bloomberg BusinessWeek succinctly described as \u201cthe most dangerous political operative in America.\u201d \\nJulia Zorthian at TIME magazine writes that as head of the alt-right news website Breitbart , \u201cBannon has given voice to some of the unsavory forces floating around the conservative movement\u2019s fringe, including a resurgence of white nationalism. His appointment has fueled anger , with critics decrying Bannon\u2019s connections to racist and anti-Semitic views.\u201d \\nIn recent days, many of you have seen some of Breibart \u2019s headlines: \u201cBill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew,\u201d \u201cBirth control makes women unattractive and crazy,\u201d \u201cWould you rather your child had feminism or cancer?\u201d and \u201cGay rights have made us dumber, it\u2019s time to get back in the closet.\u201d \\nEven The Washington Post\u2019 s Kathleen Parker, who cut Bannon some slack in a recent column , concluded that \u201che has been willing to strategically encourage people\u2019s hate as a way of inciting them to action. How these methods will manifest themselves in the White House remains to be seen. But we can uncomfortably imagine that Trump under Bannon\u2019s direction will do whatever it takes to get what he wants.\u201d Swell. \\nSo hate speech and Steve Bannon: a perfect pair. Donald Trump, you\u2019ve let this evil genie out of the bottle. Set an example for a country so viciously torn asunder. Use one of your two remaining wishes and end this madness. \\nMichael Winship is the Emmy Award-winning senior writer of Moyers & Company and BillMoyers.com, and a former senior writing fellow at the policy and advocacy group Demos.
