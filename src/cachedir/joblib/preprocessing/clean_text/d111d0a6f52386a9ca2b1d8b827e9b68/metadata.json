Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton genuinely deserve to be in the White House, but elections are rarely fought, let alone won, on the issue of the deserving.\\nAs the election moves into it\u2019s the cracker phase, Trump is scrapping his way back in the polls, ever the immeasurable factor in this election. For the establishment, the battle is already won, creating a dangerous sense of entitlement for the Democratic nominee.\\nThat sense of entitlement shone through in the latest fury from the Clinton campaign, nervous about the FBI\u2019s foray into the last days of this election. As ever, it was that seedy matter of emails sent on a private server when she was Secretary of State that came bobbing back up.\\nOn Friday, Director James B. Comey sent a letter to the US Congress noting that he was wishing, due to \u201crecent developments\u201d to \u201csupplement\u201d previous testimony on the previous and closed investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server. \u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d [1]\\nThat unrelated case involved emails discovered on the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner, and a Clinton aide and Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, Huma Abedin. Clinton found herself back in the frame.\\nImaginations started to gallop, notably at the open nature of the remarks. The investigation would involve the old issue of whether classified information had been involved, and whether relevant emails would be pertinent to the investigation.\\nNo sense of scope, length or frame of the investigation was given: \u201cAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.\u201d\\nPreviously, Comey railroaded efforts to bring charges against Clinton\u2019s misuse of classified material despite noting \u201cevidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of information.\u201d In so doing, he did acknowledge that prosecutors ponder a \u201cnumber of factors before bringing charges.\u201d These include \u201cthe context of a person\u2019s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past\u201d and \u201cthe strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.\u201d\\nWhile his then recommendation for non-prosecution was hardly binding on the Attorney-General, it would have been irregular to expect a prosecution in absence of hearty approval from the FBI. The result, or so thought those manning the barricades of the Clinton campaign, was permitted to rest.\\nThis naturally unleashed a hailstorm of speculation from such figures as Rush Limbaugh, who pondered whether there had been an element of connivance between the Obama administration, Comey and Clinton. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch saw \u201ca disconnect between Comey\u2019s devastating findings and his weak recommendation not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.\u201d [2]\\nThis \u201cdisconnect\u201d has been a feature of the entire discussion about Email Gate. For one, President Barack Obama, despite being an enthusiast for prosecuting whistleblowers who disclose classified information for a perceived higher ideal for information transparency, did not see a legal problem with Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server.\\nIt was \u201cnot a situation in which America\u2019s national security was endangered\u201d even if it was imprudent. [3] Rather confidently, and in a manner befitting premature judgement, Obama insisted in April this year that Clinton \u201cwould never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.\u201d\\nCertain outlets of legal commentary, notably Lawfare , have taken note about the entire background surrounding Comey\u2019s moves as murky and compromising for a range of parties. Attorney-General Loretta Lynch, for one, had been compromised by the President\u2019s certitude on the subject of Clinton\u2019s behaviour, a point made even more complicated by a promise \u2013 albeit one made by Clinton \u2013 that Lynch would continue to remain AG in her administration. [4]\\nIn then testifying before Congress about his own decision not to prosecute, an investigation was essentially being given dramatic air time. Truly, we were bearing witness to another Clinton saga, the legal equivalent of constipation in an ailing Republic. \u201cAs a general matter,\u201d lamented Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution, \u201cwhen prosecutors and investigators decline to indict someone, we don\u2019t want a report, much less congressional oversight of the unindicted conduct. We want them to shut the heck up.\u201d [5]\\nThere was, however, no shutting up Comey, who is making more electoral history than is customary for a law enforcement organisation. It baffled Clinton, who has persistently wished the email matter to disappear in a confusing haze. Nor did Comey listen to senior Justice Department officials, who attempted to dissuade the move to send the letter. [6] \u201cNever in recent history,\u201d claimed the New York Times , \u201chas the FBI been so enmeshed in a presidential race.\u201d [7]\\nThe FBI director\u2019s intervention has already inflicted range of shocks, though it is imprecise to what extent his own announcement will alter set minds or convince the confused. Trump, most certainly, was emboldened, and the unpopularity contest is set for a few more hiccups prior to the November 8 poll.\\nNotes.\\n[1] http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0\\n[2] http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/05/republicans-and-conservatives-assail-fbis-decision-not-to-indict-hillary-clinton/\\n[3] http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/us/politics/obama-tells-60-minutes-hillary-clinton-made-email-mistake.html\\n[4] https://www.lawfareblog.com/james-comey-hillary-clinton-and-email-investigation-guide-perplexed\\n[5] https://www.lawfareblog.com/comeys-testimony-precedent\\n[6] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news\\n[7] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-emails.html\\n Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.
