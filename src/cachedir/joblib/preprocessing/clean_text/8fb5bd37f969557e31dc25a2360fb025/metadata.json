Speaker Paul D. Ryan has vowed to move legislation for a replacement for the Affordable Care Act by the end of March. But some Republicans are worried about a political backlash if they repeal the law without an adequate replacement  \u2014   potentially throwing millions of people off their insurance  \u2014   and have urged a more methodical approach. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, recently proposed repairing parts of the health care law ahead of scrapping the whole package. Mr. Trump said last month that he wanted to present a replacement soon after the Senate confirmed his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Price\u2019s confirmation this week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said in January. Last month, the president signed an executive order to begin unwinding the Affordable Care Act. It gave the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to ease what it called \u201cunwarranted economic and regulatory burdens\u201d from the existing law.'"}, "time": 1742563139.0072494}
