Or at least, that is the message that many people took from his unusually warm statement on the death of the Cuban dictator, whom he hailed on Saturday as \u201ca remarkable leader. \u201d \u201cFidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said in the statement, which was issued while he attended a summit meeting in Madagascar. He described Mr. Castro, who ruled as a Communist autocrat for almost 50 years, as \u201cCuba\u2019s longest serving President. \u201d \u201cWhile a controversial figure, both Mr. Castro\u2019s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for \u2018el Comandante,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trudeau continued. He added that Mr. Castro was \u201ca legendary revolutionary and orator\u201d whose death had brought him \u201cdeep sorrow. \u201d \u201cI know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. (His father, Pierre Trudeau, served as prime minister for over 15 years.) \u201cIt was also a real honour to meet his three sons and his brother President Ra\u00fal Castro during my recent visit to Cuba. \u201d Justin Trudeau\u2019s affectionate comments were a radical departure from American reactions to Mr. Castro\u2019s death  \u2014   the White House diplomatically said it hoped for warmer relations with Cuba, while   Donald J. Trump gleefully posted on Twitter, \u201cFidel Castro is dead!\u201d  \u2014   and his statement was quickly condemned by political observers in both the United States and Canada. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is   called the Canadian leader\u2019s remarks \u201cshameful and embarrassing. \u201d Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another   said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s statement was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and accused him of \u201cslobbering adulation\u201d of Mr. Castro. In Canada, several members of the opposition Conservative Party condemned Mr. Trudeau\u2019s statement. Kellie Leitch, a lawmaker running for the party\u2019s leadership, criticized the prime minister for his \u201cfawning characterization\u201d of Mr. Castro. Maxime Bernier, another Conservative leadership candidate, called Mr. Trudeau\u2019s praise \u201crepugnant\u201d and rebuked him for suggesting that the Cuban leader\u2019s decades in power had amounted to a form of public service. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s statement also generated a tidal wave of agitated online mockery, the kind of social media blowback to which the telegenic and infinitely   prime minister is rarely subjected. In a wink to the moment that brought Mr. Trudeau to national prominence  \u2014   his televised eulogy for his father in 2000  \u2014   jokes about his statement were organized under the hashtag #trudeaueulogies, where critics imagined him waxing poetic about some of history\u2019s great villains. The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 and imposed an embargo on the island for decades, but Canada never pursued similar policies. It began formal diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1945 and maintained them throughout the Cold War, when Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father developed a warm relationship with Mr. Castro. Pierre Trudeau was the first leader of a NATO member state to visit communist Cuba in 1976, and Mr. Castro served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.'"}, "time": 1742628335.8409836}
