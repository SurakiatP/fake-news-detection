Nothing about it can surprise. It plummets to infinite depths of slime, mold and rotting carrion. This is just another day in Clintonworld . \\nJohn Podesta, who draws no salary from the campaign, is making $7,000 per month from the Sandler Foundation, run by Herb Sandler, Politico reported. \\nThe Sandlers ran World Savings Bank, which was sold to Wachovia in 2006 for $25.5 billion and which was accused of offering adjustable-rate mortgages that contributed to the housing collapse. \\nSaturday Night Live got into trouble when it depicted the Sandlers as people who should be shot. Time Magazine listed them as one of 25 people to blame for the financial crisis. \\nIn the early 1980s, the Sandlers' World Savings Bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option ARM. And they pushed the mortgage, which offered several ways to back-load your loan and thereby reduce your early payments, with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades. The couple pocketed $2.3 billion when they sold their bank to Wachovia in 2006. But losses on World Savings' loan portfolio led to the implosion of Wachovia, which was sold under duress late last year to Wells Fargo. \\n\\nNotorious right wing comedy show Saturday Night Live also featured the Sandlers \\nOn October 4, 2008, however, Saturday Night Live aired a skit in which the Sandlers were depicted as predatory lenders. Under their names, SNL placed the caption \u201cpeople who should be shot.\u201d Compounding the Sandlers\u2019 negative press was a Time magazine list that identified them as two of the \u201c25 people to blame for the financial crisis.\u201d The New York Times also labeled the Sandlers \u201cpariahs\u201d -- and on December 24, 2008, the Times reportedthat their mortgages were the \u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d of the housing crisis. On February 15, 2009, CBS\u2019s 60 minutes also aired a segment that featured the Sandlers\u2019 World Savings Bank as one of the primary examples of how the mortgage industry had destroyed itself and unleashed an economic collapse.\\u200b \\nAnd this is whom Hillary's campaign chief is taking cash from.\""}, "time": 1742563764.7619295}
