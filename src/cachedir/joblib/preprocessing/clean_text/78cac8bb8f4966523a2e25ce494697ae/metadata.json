For now, the attention is on Hillary Clinton, whose corruption and true positions have been exposed on a number of issues .\\nClinton\u2019s long career in the highest levels of government has given Wikileaks plenty of material to publish, while Donald Trump\u2019s character as an arrogant woman-groper is being revealed from his time in the entertainment business.\\nJulian Assange said he does have some information about Trump, but there is a strange reality there:\\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s from a point of view of an investigative journalist organization like WikiLeaks, the problem with the Trump campaign is it\u2019s actually hard for us to publish much more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth every second day,\u201d Assange said.\\nThe horrible prospect of Trump or Clinton \u2013 both highly disliked by the populace \u2013 becoming president is the result of a system that is indeed rigged into a two-party dictatorship with the illusion of choice. Ben Swann explains some of it here .\\nOne of the more worrying revelations \u2013 or should we say, \u201cconfirmations\u201d \u2013 from the Podesta Emails is Clinton\u2019s allegiance to the Israeli lobby . Her top foreign policy aide reminded her not to say anything publicly to offend \u201cBibi,\u201d and she wrote a letter against the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) against Israel on behalf of her mega-donor, Haim Saban.\\nThis allegiance to the Israeli lobby means that Clinton\u2019s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will largely echo that of Israel\u2019s government, including its settlements on Palestinian lands and its treatment of Gaza as a giant prison camp.\\nFor decades, various presidents have claimed to be working on \u201cpeace accords\u201d with the Israelis and Palestinians, while the U.S. military-industrial complex reaps billions from Israel\u2019s militarism and use of U.S.-made weapons in repeated Gaza massacres.\\nWhy wage peace when war is so profitable, in the monetary sense and in the enablement of absolute State power?\\nIn one email, we see the kind of deceit presidents will engage in to maintain the narrative of \u201cpursuing peace.\u201d\\nFrom MondoWeiss :\\n\u201c Here\u2019s the context. In a March 2015 email, right after Netanyahu\u2019s victory in the Israeli election, Clinton foreign policy aide Jake Sullivan passed along a Times article in which Netanyahu offered a mild apology for his racist election-eve warning to Jewish voters that Palestinians were coming out to the polls \u201cin droves,\u201d and in which he flipflopped on his promise that no Palestinian state would be established on his watch. Per the Times: \\nThe two-state solution \u201cremains our goal today, because it is the only way to secure Israel\u2019s future as a Jewish and democratic state,\u201d [Netanyahu] added. \\nSullivan comments [from hacked Podesta emails]: \\nUnsurprisingly, Pragmatic Bibi makes an appearance. \\nClinton steps right in: This is an opening that should be exploited. A Potemkin process is better than nothing. \u201d For those who many not be familiar with the word, \u201cPotemkin\u201d or Potemkin village means constructing something to deceive others into thinking a situation is better than it really is. Merriam-Webster says, \u201cespecially one presented for the purpose or propaganda.\u201d\\nAs Weiss points out, we\u2019ve had a Potemkin process for 20 years already, so Clinton would merely continue using events to perpetuate the false hope of a \u201cpeace accord.\u201d\\nMichael Omer-Man, former news desk manager for the Jerusalem Post, had strong words for Clinton :\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more troubling statement about Israel/Palestine from a politician who will in all likelihood be the next president of the United States, even if it represents only part of her thinking on the region\u2026\\nwhen American politicians like Hillary Clinton say that the fa\u00e7ade of a peace process is better than no process, they mean it is better for the United States and Israel, not for Palestinians. A Potemkin peace process expressly means maintaining the status quo of occupation and oppression while neutralizing any consequences Israel might face for its actions.\u201d\\nFor establishment figures like Hillary Clinton, the illusion of a peace process is more important than actually pursuing peace. Maintaining the narrative while profiting from conflict is the modus operandi of the two-party dictatorship.\\nSource: The Free Thought Project \\n'"}, "time": 1742563562.5283284}
