Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the  stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). California Today will also rely on, and amplify, your voices. Tell us about the issues that matter to you  \u2014   and what you\u2019d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.  Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. Let\u2019s get to it. I just moved back to California after a long exile on the East Coast. I\u2019m a   Californian  \u2014   born outside Sacramento, where lawmakers come and go, and raised in San Juan Capistrano, where swallows do the same. I wanted to dive right in. So I\u2019ve been asking as many people as possible: What should California Today be paying attention to? Five answers that stood out: \u2022 We hear a lot, rightly, about drought and wildfires, but Californians should also be alarmed about another threat, said Steven Hackett, a Humboldt State economist who has focused on natural resources. The Pacific has been soaking up enormous amounts of carbon dioxide from human emissions, a process known as ocean acidification. Professor Hackett said, if left unchecked, it could set off \u201ctremendous cascading effects,\u201d devastating California\u2019s marine ecosystems. \u201cThere are a lot of questions about, \u2018What can we do about that? \u2019\u201d he said. \u2022 Specialists see no end in sight to California\u2019s housing shortage, which promises to worsen homelessness and fights over gentrification. Lateefah Simon, a Bay Area activist, said we should be talking more about another of its effects: the punishing commutes that   people face as they are priced out of urban centers. With spotty public transportation, and rising fares, they endure hourslong trips into San Francisco and other cities. \u201cInfrastructure is not a sexy thing for young millennials. It\u2019s not something you talk about everyday,\u201d said Ms. Simon, who is running for a seat on BART\u2019s board of directors. \u201cWe need to change that. \u201d \u2022 Carson Bruno, a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, warned that unless a solution appears to the housing crisis, which he blamed in part on the misuse of environmental law, Bay Area businesses would begin to flee the state. \u201cCalifornia faces a lot of challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this one has the potential to eliminate the California dream entirely. \u201d \u2022 Camille Rose Garcia, an artist in Northern California, talked about a   of the gallery scenes of San Francisco and Los Angeles. The spread of digital culture has led to \u201ca circumventing of the galleries that is making some of them irrelevant,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. The shift can be empowering for artists, especially younger ones, who increasingly connect with buyers directly online and through social media. \u201cThere is no more of the gallery holding the golden key to the kingdom,\u201d she said. \u2022 Finally, Mona Field, a political scientist in Los Angeles, talked about another   this one on the near horizon. Californians are facing a November ballot with, count them, 17 measures. To name a couple: marijuana legalization and the repeal of the death penalty. \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous that they are all on one ballot,\u201d she said, suggesting that California Today do a series that analyzes each proposition. Challenge accepted, Ms. Field. (Stay tuned.) \u2022 \u201cAmazing,\u201d \u201c\u201d \u201criveting. \u201d That\u2019s how readers are reacting to \u201cFramed,\u201d a   true crime saga involving a PTA mother in Irvine. [Los Angeles Times] \u2022 In reliably Democratic California, the action through Election Day is going to be in the voter initiatives, not the presidential race. Analysts expect close to $100 million in ad spending, writes Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief. [The New York Times] \u2022 President Obama on Monday waded into the debate over Colin Kaepernick\u2019s refusal to stand for the national anthem. He said he did not doubt the sincerity of the 49ers quarterback\u2019s protest. [The New York Times] \u2022 Santa Ana is on edge over its booming homeless population. One encampment has spread out along the dry bed of the Santa Ana River. A student journalist captured intimate photos of life in \u201cSkid River. \u201d [Voice of OC] \u2022 Among the Silicon Valley elite, meanwhile, so few homes are on the market that buyers are getting more aggressive in approaching owners who haven\u2019t officially decided to sell. [The New York Times] \u2022 How do Uber drivers decide when to call it a day? Many newer ones do the opposite of what economic rationality would seem to dictate. [The New York Times] \u2022 Hugh O\u2019Brian, who played a   peace officer on \u201cThe Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\u201d from 1955 to 1961, died in Beverly Hills on Monday. He was 91. [The New York Times] \u2022 Vin Scully, the Dodgers\u2019 broadcasting great, will call his last game on Oct. 2. Richard Sandomir, a Times columnist, said it would be a shame if TBS does not give him a national audience. [The New York Times] \u2022 Workers have installed the final piece of the spire atop the Wilshire Grand in downtown Los Angeles, making it the tallest skyscraper west of the Mississippi River. [Los Angeles Times] \u2022 Burning Man, the yearly carnival of   in the Nevada desert, wrapped up over the weekend. Jim Urquhart, a Reuters photographer, caught the pageantry. [The Atlantic] Craig Claiborne at The New York Times invented the modern restaurant review. Since 1963 the newspaper\u2019s reviews have been confined to the New York region. Now, Pete Wells is taking The Times\u2019s starred review on the road, visiting Cassia, an Asian restaurant in Santa Monica. Even after a wary moment with gnarled pig tail, Mr. Wells praised the chef\u2019s skill in creating big flavors without resorting to extremes. \u2022 On Wednesday, Apple will hold its annual fall event in San Francisco. It\u2019s expected to unveil its next iPhone. Are they going to ditch the headphone jack? \u2022 The 1995 crime drama \u201cHeat\u201d had three big stars, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro  \u2014   and Los Angeles. All will be on hand Wednesday night when the Academy screens an ultra   restoration in Beverly Hills. A Q. and A. will follow. \u2022 With the potential for a huge new market in California, marijuana entrepreneurs will gather to talk business Wednesday through Friday at the Cannabis World Congress and Business Exposition in Los Angeles. \u2022 The San Francisco Fringe Festival kicks off Friday. The theater world\u2019s answer to the bar crawl, the festival will present 38 shows over 16 days. \u2022 Fall is coming, folks. The Lake Tahoe Autumn Food and Wine Festival will greet the season beginning Friday and culminating with a wine contest on Sunday. There will be cooking demonstrations, mixology courses and a kids\u2019 zone. When I told Kevin Starr, one of the state\u2019s   historians, about the California newsletter, he kindly offered to share his contacts. Then came an admonition. \u201cPlease also pay attention not just to where California screwed up, but on things that are going well here,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody has to explain why we are the sixth largest G. N. P. on the planet. \u201d Asked if he could explain it, he laughed. \u201cBecause of the interaction of all sort of things,\u201d he said, \u201ca talented population,   of very educated people, the ascendancy of the entertainment business, the ascendancy of the digital business . .. \u201d He went on to mention biotech, agriculture and California\u2019s role as an arbiter of good design. James Canton, a futurist in San Francisco, described California as the nation\u2019s engine of innovation. We face serious problems. But, he said, there\u2019s no better population to tackle them. \u201cCalifornians are constantly inventing the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that future inevitably translates into jobs and wealth creation and opportunity, particularly for immigrants. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
