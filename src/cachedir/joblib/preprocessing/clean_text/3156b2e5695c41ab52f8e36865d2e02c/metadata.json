Trump called climate change a hoax, questioned the safety of vaccines and mocked renewable energy as a plaything of \u201c . \u201d So perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. Trump\u2019s first budget took direct aim at basic scientific and medical research. Still, the extent of the cuts in the proposed budget unveiled early Thursday shocked scientists, researchers and program administrators. The reductions include $5. 8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health, which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases, and $900 million, or a little less than 20 percent, from the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science, which funds the national laboratories, considered among the crown jewels of basic research in the world. The White House is also proposing to eliminate climate science programs throughout the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cAs to climate change, I think the president was fairly straightforward: We\u2019re not spending money on that anymore,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at a White House briefing on Thursday. \u201cWe consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. \u201d While the budget is only a blueprint and is sure to face strong opposition from members of both parties in Congress  \u2014   many lawmakers have already said that certain cuts, like those to the N. I. H. are nonstarters  \u2014   policy makers expressed concern about what the proposal says about the administration\u2019s commitment to science. \u201cDo they not think that there are advances to be made, improvements to be made, in the human condition?\u201d said Rush D. Holt, a physicist and the chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \u201cThe record of scientific research is so good, for so many years  \u2014   who would want to sell it short? What are they thinking?\u201d The American Society of Clinical Oncology, the leading professional society for cancer specialists, issued a statement warning that the proposed budget \u201cwill devastate our nation\u2019s already fragile federal research infrastructure. \u201d \u201cNow is not the time to slow progress in finding new treatments and cures for patients with cancer,\u201d the group said. Others said the proposed cuts would motivate more scientists to become politically active. Referring to the budget released early Thursday, Dr. Caroline Weinberg, a public health researcher and one of the organizers of a protest march by scientists set for April 22 in Washington, said, \u201cIt is a   document detailing exactly why thousands of people around the world will join together to march for science. \u201d Some cuts were singled out for criticism. The proposed budget would eliminate the Fogarty International Center, an N. I. H. program focused on global health. The center, founded in the 1960s, has worked on H. I. V.  Ebola, diabetes, dengue, maternal mortality and numerous other health problems, and trains American and foreign doctors and researchers in developing countries. \u201cThe Fogarty Center advances United States national interests in a multitude of ways, and it would be terribly unfortunate for the institution to cease to exist,\u201d said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a member of the Fogarty Center\u2019s advisory board. \u201cIt has a high reputation outside our borders,\u201d Dr. Morrison said of the center, which has had annual appropriations of about $70 million. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tiny institution,\u201d he added, in terms of the overall budget. Judith Enck, a regional E. P. A. official in the Obama administration and now a visiting scholar at Pace University School of Law, called the proposed science cuts in her former agency \u201cnonsensical. \u201d Noting that one of the programs being cut monitors chemicals known as endocrine disrupters, she said, \u201cNot having the latest science on endocrine disrupters will make more people sick. And that is not something the states will pick up. \u201d The administration proposal spares some programs. It would continue development of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s current generation of weather satellites, for example. NASA\u2019s budget would be cut only slightly, by less than 1 percent, but the White House is proposing a shift in where the money would be spent  \u2014   eliminating four earth science missions and the $115 million the agency is spending on education. Eliminating laboratory research on climate change, as the budget proposes, can have   effects, experts said, by making it harder to predict storms or other weather events that cause devastation and loss of life. \u201cCutting scientific research in E. P. A. and NASA and NOAA and other science agencies is not going to help us have more information on the causes and, more important, the effects of climate change,\u201d said Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center and a former E. P. A. official. The budget also calls for eliminating some programs that help bridge the divide between basic research and commercialization. Among the most prominent of these is the Advanced Research Projects Agency  \u2014   Energy, known as   the Energy Department office that funds research in innovative energy technologies with a goal of getting products to market. Its annual appropriation of about $300 million would be eliminated. James J. Greenberger, the executive director of NAATBatt International, a trade group for the advanced battery industry, said   had been of enormous benefit to the industry. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely stunned by it,\u201d Mr. Greenberger said of the agency\u2019s potential elimination, which he announced to industry leaders gathered at his group\u2019s annual conference in Arizona. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going through the administration\u2019s head. It\u2019s almost surreal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564151.9746962}
