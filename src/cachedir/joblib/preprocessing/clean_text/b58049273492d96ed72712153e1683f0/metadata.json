It goes something like this: If his team is taking the ball out of bounds with more than six seconds remaining and in need of a basket, he resists the urge to call a timeout. On Sunday afternoon, he looked up at the clock at FedEx Forum: 7. 2 seconds. He opted to trust his players. Like nearly everyone else inside the building, Williams turned into a mere spectator as Theo Pinson, a junior swingman, pushed the ball upcourt, into the teeth of Kentucky\u2019s defense, before tossing the ball outside to the sophomore forward Luke Maye, who set his feet and released an   jumper: swish. Maye\u2019s effortless shot with 0. 3 of a second left broke a tie and lifted   North Carolina to a   victory over   Kentucky in the South Regional final of the N. C. A. A. tournament. It was a wild ending to a thrilling game, a classic that the Tar Heels punctuated by snipping the nets in  . \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic feeling right now,\u201d said Williams, whose players doused him with water in the locker room. \u201cBest dadgum bath I\u2019ve ever had with my clothes on. \u201d By defeating the Wildcats, the Tar Heels set up a Final Four showdown between the Carolinas and the Pacific Northwest. On Saturday in Glendale, Ariz. North Carolina will face Oregon, and South Carolina will play Gonzaga in a matchup of newcomers to the Final Four. North Carolina, by comparison, will be making its 20th appearance in the Final Four, the most in tournament history. Justin Jackson scored 19 points to lead North Carolina ( ) and Maye finished with 17. On a court cluttered with   Maye  \u2014   an unsung reserve who averaged about 14 minutes of playing time during the regular season  \u2014   stood apart in the closing seconds. After trailing by 5 points with less than five minutes to play, the Tar Heels scored 12 straight points  \u2014   a surge initiated by Williams\u2019s decision to shift to a zone defense. Kentucky ( ) which starts three freshmen, looked lost before eventually rediscovering its rhythm. In the final minute, Kentucky\u2019s Malik Monk made a pair of   the second with just seconds left to tie the game at  . Williams glanced at the scoreboard, saw how much time was remaining and folded his arms. He had watched his players fend off every rally. He had watched Joel Berry II, his starting point guard, fight through two sprained ankles. And at practice all season, he had watched them operate with a   shot clock in drills. He knew they were capable of pushing the ball. So he left them in charge. \u201cI was just screaming, \u2018Go, go, go! \u2019\u201d Williams said. North Carolina stifled Kentucky\u2019s star backcourt. Monk finished with 12 points. And two days after scoring 39 points against U. C. L. A. in a regional semifinal, De\u2019Aaron Fox scored just 13. The Wildcats also labored with foul trouble throughout. Coach John Calipari was not pleased with the officiating. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s amazing that we were in that game where they practically fouled out my team. Amazing that we had a chance. \u201d For North Carolina, the win was the latest chapter in a   redemption tour. A couple of weeks after North Carolina lost to Villanova in last season\u2019s national championship game, an assistant coach informed Williams that one of Villanova\u2019s players was on campus. And not just any player: Kris Jenkins, the forward who had hit the winning jumper for Villanova. Jenkins was visiting his brother, Nate Britt, a senior guard for the Tar Heels, and wanted to know if he could join the team in some pickup games. \u201cTell him I\u2019m sending a hit man down to take care of him,\u201d Williams recalled telling his assistant. Williams chose benevolence, allowing Jenkins to work out with his players, but that loss to Villanova  \u2014   and the memory of it  \u2014   was becoming nearly impossible for Williams, his staff and his players to escape. In truth, they wanted it that way. They wanted that lingering disappointment to fuel them this season. \u201cThat was our ultimate goal last year: to win the championship,\u201d the senior forward Isaiah Hicks said over the weekend. \u201cWe was four seconds away from that. Just to see your dream taken away right in front of you, that\u2019s all the motivation you need. Of course, nobody likes to lose. But that one, when you\u2019re right there  \u2014   all of us, we just need that second chance. \u201d In a twist, Jenkins has become one of the Tar Heels\u2019 most visible supporters. He sat behind the bench for both of the team\u2019s victories in Memphis. For Maye, who was named the regional\u2019s most outstanding player, his place in North Carolina lore seems secure. His father, Mark, played quarterback for the North Carolina football team in the 1980s, and Luke always wanted to be a Tar Heel. He intended to walk on as a freshman before Williams came through with a scholarship late in the recruiting process. \u201cI was dumb, O. K. because I had offered some scholarships to some other people,\u201d Williams said. Against Butler on Friday in a regional semifinal, Maye scored 16 points off the bench. On Sunday, he somehow outdid himself, sinking 6 of 9 shots from the field. Behind a player named Maye, the Tar Heels are marching on.'"}, "time": 1742563788.5189316}
