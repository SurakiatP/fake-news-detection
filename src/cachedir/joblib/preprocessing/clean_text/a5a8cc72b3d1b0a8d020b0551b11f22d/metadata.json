[The Turner Broadcasting System will build on the popularity of Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s forays into the world of video games, creating a standalone show out of a segment that\u2019s been a solid viewer favorite since it transitioned from a web series to the nightly show in 2012.  Conan typically sits on a couch with various celebrity guests and   pokes fun at whatever they\u2019re playing. Thus far, Grand Theft Auto V, Halo 5: Guardians, Fallout 4, Mario Kart 8, DOOM, Final Fantasy XV, and Battlefield 1 have all been featured on Clueless Gamer, among many others.  There\u2019s just one little change: Conan won\u2019t be on the couch anymore. While O\u2019Brien will serve as an executive producer, the   will feature a new,   unannounced host. TBS president Kevin Reilly told The Hollywood Reporter that the segment has become popular enough that \u201cwe\u2019ve gotten to the point where video game companies are sending us their new product for us to play and make fun of because it\u2019s been such a huge success. \u201d They\u2019re pinning a lot on the hope that the viral popularity of the segment will survive transport into independent programming, and without the snarky wit of its creator.
