The out-of-power imperialists of the left and right, though, have been biding their time and doing what they do best: writing reports that only the foreign policy elite read inside the imperial city. Absurdly, or maybe the better word is frighteningly, the foreign policy elite\u2019s reports and studies \u201ccall for more-aggressive American action to constrain Iran, rein in the chaos in the Middle East and check Russia in Europe.\u201d The idea that Washington could bring order to the chaos it helped create in the greater Middle East is lunacy. \\nCome November 9, the nation better start preparing itself for more of the same with the almost guaranteed ascension of President Clinton the Second: perpetual, wealth-sapping, rights-eviscerating war. \\nBut what was particularly striking about the article was the appearance of former Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright discussing the need for more muscular American intervention in Syria. \\n\u201cThe immediate thing is to do something to alleviate the horrors that are being visited on the population,\u201d said former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who is leading a bipartisan and international team looking at U.S. strategy in the Middle East for the Atlantic Council. \\n\u201cWe do think there needs to be more American action \u2014 not ground forces but some additional help in terms of the military aspect.\u201d \\nJust in time for Halloween, Secretary Albright wants to dress up like a humanitarian. But fortunately we know that Secretary Albright believes that the lives of innocent children are okay to sacrifice in the pursuit of a U.S-led international order.* Back in 1996, Albright showed what\u2019s truly under that humanitarian costume during an interview with 60 Minutes on the toll of U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iraq: \\nLesley Stahl on sanctions against Iraq: We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that\u2019s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it? \\nMadeleine Albright: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price\u2013we think the price is worth it. \\nThese are the kinds of people ready to assume the commanding heights of the U.S. national security apparatus soon after Inauguration Day. They make the hard choices you don\u2019t want to make, and the price is worth it. \\n* NOTE: For a good analysis of exactly how many Iraqi children under five years old died because of U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iraq, see Matt Welch\u2019s Reason piece from 2002, \u201c The Politics of Dead Children .\u201d Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us!
