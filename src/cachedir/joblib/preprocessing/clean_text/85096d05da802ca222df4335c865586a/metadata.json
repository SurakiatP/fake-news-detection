Joy Behar asked, \u201cSo Mark your name has actually been tossed around as a potential presidential candidate. Let\u2019s make news here. Are you into it?\u201d Cuban replied, \u201cDefinitely. No. We\u2019ll see what happens. \u201d Discussing Trump\u2019s tweets, Cuban said \u201cHe is an idiot. I don\u2019t care what he says. Right? I got a thick skin. He doesn\u2019t. \u201d Cuban said that it is not Trump\u2019s inexperience that is the problem saying, \u201cNo one is ever totally qualified to be the president. What it takes is leadership skills, so you know what you don\u2019t know  \u2026    You\u2019re never going to know everything to be the president. You have to be smart enough to say, here\u2019s where my strengths are. Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t know, and let me find the best people to do that. And then listen to those people. You can make an argument that Donald Trump has hired some good people around him. Maybe some you don\u2019t love. He has hired good people, but he never listens. And if you are not willing to listen, if you are not willing to learn \u2014   the entire job  \u2014   the only certainty of the job of president is the uncertainty. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s next. \u201d He added that Trump was \u201coblivious to life. \u201d \u201cHe has no  . He has no contextual awareness, but other than that, he is a great president. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563160.7027748}
