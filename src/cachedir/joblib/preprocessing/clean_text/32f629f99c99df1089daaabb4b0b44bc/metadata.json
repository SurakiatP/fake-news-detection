Last night, our teams counted 40 to 50 new tents there in two days,\u201d Brossel said, adding there was now a total of 700 to 750. \\nThis means there are some 2,000-2,500 sleeping in the area, up from around 1,500 a few days before, she said. \\n{snip} \\nAfter years as serving as an illegal base camp for migrants trying to get to Britain, the \u201cJungle\u201d at Calais was finally bulldozed this week and the more than 6,000 residents of the ramshackle camp near the English channel were relocated to shelters around France. \\n{snip} \\nAma, a 24-year-old Sudanese who is six months pregnant, said she had come to Paris from Calais, but that was months ago. \\n\u201cI was in Calais before but I did not find the route (to Britain),\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay over there being pregnant, it was too hard.\u201d \\nDeputy Mayor Brossel said it was up to the central government, and not city authorities, to act. \\n\u201cThese people must be sheltered,\u201d she said. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742563018.3815348}
