While socialist Bernie Sanders did not win the democratic nomination for president, his surrogates are hard at work scheming to force as many socialists into office as possible. \\nSee the below list of socialists who are posing as Democrats in Iowa. \\nOur Revolution, Brand New Congress (who has not yet announced their candidates) \u2013 and Berniecrats , a compilation of socialist candidates \u2013 are just a few of the socialist organizations focused on infusing local, state and federal government with socialists. Related to Iowa specifically, the local affiliates of the AFL-CIO and Americans for Democratic Action also endorse socialists running as democrats. \\nThere are many other subversive organizations providing funding and other support to radical left-wing candidates, such as Emily\u2019s List , Human Rights Campaign and Council for a Livable World . \\nHere is the list exclusively for Iowa, sorted by organization:* Tim Kacena , Iowa 14 State Representative \\nBerniecrats (socialist candidates endorsed by Bernie Sanders, or have endorsed Bernie Sanders): Mason McCoy , State Representative, IA, 3rd District Timothy Kacena , State Representative, IA, 14th District Gary Kroeger , State Representative, IA, 60th District Teresa Meyer , State Representative, IA, 63rd District Joe Stutler , County Auditor, IA, Linn Co.

As America threatens to shatter, we must see how a semi-covert, global, cartel collective and their NWO in the USA (\"progressive\" neo-Marxists and neo-fascists corporatists, updated with 21st Century techniques and technology) intentionally perpetrate this sabotage, while we patriots try to prevent it. Have a look around our camp, as we struggle to survive. - your tour guide Archives Militarization in America About DHS militarization, see the new, breakthrough analysis from James Simpson, \" Police Militarization, Abuses of Power, and the Road to Impeachment \" and our earlier, \"Marxist President\u2019s Military Exercises in These U.S. Cities; Yours One?\" \\nAbout the trajectory of this, we must pray, communicate, keep calm, and do not become the first to engage. If it comes to it, do not even respond in kind, until after the after the first times that extreme, anti-American violence is done by them. It calls for an attitude of self sacrifice -- first cheek, second cheek, then no more. \\nAnd speak out about the potential and strategic \"sense\" of the Obama/NWO\\'s DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements. \\nWe are in a real war, right now (of which others and I have been trying to alert fellow Sovereign Citizens for years) and the prime war is for the minds, hearts, and wills of the American People. We are opposed by an anti-American insurrection using any means of power (see Gramsci, Frankfurt School) including government power, as they are granted that opportunity.'"}, "time": 1742564555.1096702}
