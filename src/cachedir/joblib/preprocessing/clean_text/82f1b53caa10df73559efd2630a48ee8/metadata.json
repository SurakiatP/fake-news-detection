[\u201cThe fact that there was substantiation that the Russians had hacked my emails, the DNC emails, that Wikileaks was an instrument of an attempt by Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation to undermine our democracy, that could have been reflected in the press and I don\u2019t believe it was,\u201d Podesta said in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis.  \u201cAnd I think that was actually a failing on behalf of the mainstream media and particularly some of the major news outlets in our country like The New York Times,\u201d he continued.  However, there is little evidence to support Podesta\u2019s claims, given that mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, CNN, and The Washington Post all gave extensive coverage to potential Russian interference in the election and did not fully report the range of explosive revelations that emerged from the Wikileaks releases. \u201cThe [mainstream media] decided it was more interesting, maybe more titillating, to get into the kinda campaign gossip which was what those emails were,\u201d Podesta continued. Podesta\u2019s claims are also undermined by the vigorous support Clinton received from nearly all the mainstream media, earning endorsements from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, New York Daily News, The Los Angeles Times, and nearly all metro and regional newspapers across the country. Furthermore, emails revealed by Wikileaks actually showed extensive collusion between mainstream media journalists and Clinton\u2019s campaign, principally via Podesta, without revealing this to their audience. Prominent examples of that collusion include CNBC\u2019s Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood regularly emailing Podesta to congratulate him on primary wins, former POLITICO reporter Glenn Thrush asking Podesta to approve a story he wrote pertaining to Clinton\u2019s campaign, while The New York Times\u2019 political correspondent Maggie Haberman was described by the campaign as a \u201cfriendly journalist\u201d who \u201cteed up\u201d stories and \u201cnever disappointed\u201d the Clinton campaign. A study in the run up to the November election also found that 96 percent of campaign donations from persons in the media went toward Hillary Clinton. Discussing the future of the Democratic Party, Podesta added that he was now \u201cfully into the resistance\u201d against Donald Trump and the new administration.
