In a series of tweets, Hannity accused figures including George Soros, David Brock of Media Matters, and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of \u201cliberal fascism,\u201d after his advertisers were reportedly \u201cinundated with emails\u201d from   groups asking them to stop advertising on the show. Now Bozell, whose organization the Media Research Center analyzes liberal bias across the mainstream media, has accused advertisers of \u201cjoining in the liberal cause and advancing the liberal strategy\u201d and becoming \u201cservants of the politically correct. \u201d He also attacked the military financial services company USAA for \u201csuccumbing to the pressure of   extremists,\u201d adding that Hannity has \u201cfor decades been a fierce supporter of the military at every turn. \u201d Please read my full statement slamming advertisers who are boycotting Hannity. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Brent Bozell (@BrentBozell) May 25, 2017,  Hannity is now the second Fox News show to have ads pulled this year, after over 90 companies dropped advertising on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show The O\u2019Reilly Factor over allegations of sexual harassment, following pressure from   activists. O\u2019Reilly was eventually released by the network, despite being America\u2019s   cable news host. \u201cWe have remained silent for far too long. A bridge has been crossed.
