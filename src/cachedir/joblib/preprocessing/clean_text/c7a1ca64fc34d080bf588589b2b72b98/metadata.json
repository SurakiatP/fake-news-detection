Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. \\nIn an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch\u2019s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran . Loretta Lynch Pleads the Fifth To Protect Obama In Iran $1.7 Billion Hostage Money \\nThe response from the attorney general\u2019s office is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to \u201cessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . \\nThe inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration\u2019s secret negotiations with Iran. \\n\u201cIt is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people\u2019s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cYour staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.\u201d Obama on Iran payment: \u2018We do not pay ransom\u2019 \\n\u201cAs the United States\u2019 chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,\u201d they stated. \u201cThe actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.\u201d The lawmakers included a copy of their previous 13 questions and are requesting that Lynch provide answers by Nov. 4. \\nWhen asked about Lynch\u2019s efforts to avoid answering questions about the cash payment, Pompeo told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration has blocked Congress at every turn as lawmakers attempt to investigate the payments to Iran. \\n\u201cWho knew that simple questions regarding Attorney General Lynch\u2019s approval of billions of dollars in payments to Iran could be so controversial that she would refuse to answer them?\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThis has become the Obama administration\u2019s coping mechanism for anything related to the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2014hide information, obfuscate details, and deny answers to Congress and the American people.\u201d Obama Administration Finally Admits $400M To Iran Was Ransom For Hostages \\n\u201cThey know this isn\u2019t a sustainable strategy, however, and I trust they will start to take their professional, and moral, obligations seriously,\u201d the lawmaker added. \\nIn the Oct. 24 letter to Rubio and Pompeo, Assistant Attorney General Kadzik warned the lawmakers against disclosing to the public any information about the cash payment. \\nDetails about the deal are unclassified, but are being kept under lock and key in a secure facility on Capitol Hill, the Free Beacon first disclosed . Lawmakers and staffers who have clearance to view the documents are forced to relinquish their cellular devices and are barred from taking any notes about what they see. \\n\u201cPlease note that these documents contain sensitive information that is not appropriate for public release,\u201d Kadzik wrote to the lawmakers. \u201cDisclosure of this information beyond members of the House and Senate and staff who are able to view them could adversely affect the diplomatic relations of the United States, including with key allies, as well as the State Department\u2019s ability to defend [legal] claims against the United States [by Iran] that are still being litigated at the Hague Tribunal.\u201d \\n\u201cThe public release of any portion of these documents, or the information contained therein, is not authorized by the transmittal of these documents or by this communication,\u201d Kadzik wrote. Congressional sources have told the Free Beacon that this is another part of the effort to hide details about these secret negotiations with Iran from the American public. \\nOne senior congressional source familiar with both the secret documents and the inquiry into them told the Free Beacon that the details of the negotiations are so damning that the administration\u2019s best strategy is to ignore lawmakers\u2019 requests for more information. \\n\u201cEvery Obama administration official and department involved in the Iran Deal appear to be running for cover,\u201d the source said. \u201cLike we feared, the Iran deal is turning out to be a disaster and Iran is emboldened in its aggression. Evidently Attorney General Lynch and the Department of Justice have decided \u2018refusal to cooperate\u2019 is their best strategy. But this is dangerous and ultimately won\u2019t protect them from anything.\u201d source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
