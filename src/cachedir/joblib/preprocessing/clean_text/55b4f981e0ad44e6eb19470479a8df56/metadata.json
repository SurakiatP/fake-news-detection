Clinton may not remember (if she was ever aware in the first place), but the original version of \u201cMy President is Black\u201d is a brazen middle finger to nonblack America. Just a few lines after the verse Hillary quoted, the song taunts:\\nHello Miss America, hey pretty lady\\nRed, white, and blue flag, wave for me baby\\nNever thought I\u2019d say this s\u2014, baby I\u2019m good\\nYou can keep your p\u2014, I don\u2019t want no more Bush\\nNo more war, no more Iraq\\nNo more white lies, the President is black\\nSo the poster granny for liberal white privilege, groveling for black votes, kissed the rings of celebrity Obama BFFs Jay-Z and Beyonce by parroting an inflammatory anthem laced with profanities and radical racialized gloating.\\nCould there have been a more perfect beclownment to cap Clinton\u2019s phony-baloney \u201cStronger Together\u201d campaign?\\nAfter denigrating millions of Trump supporters as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d earlier this year, Clinton then unctuously confessed on election eve: \u201cI regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became.\u201d\\nNote the classic textbook employment of the passive voice to evade personal responsibility.\\nThe good news is that after being blasted as haters by Clinton\u2019s hate-filled minions, after being slapped down as racial \u201ccowards\u201d by Clintonite holdover Eric Holder, after being lambasted as \u201cxenophobes\u201d and \u201cnativists\u201d by immigration expansionists in both parties, after enduring a string of faked hate crimes blamed on conservatives, after ceaseless accusations of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d in the wake of jihad attacks on American soil, after baseless accusations of \u201chomophobia\u201d for protesting the government\u2019s gay wedding cake coercion, and after mourning a growing list of police officers ambushed and targeted by violent thugs seeking racial vengeance, an undeniable movement of citizens in the 2016 election cycle decided to push back.\\nWhen all is said and done, one of the most important cultural accomplishments of Donald Trump\u2019s bid will be the platform he created for Americans of all colors, ethnicities, political affiliations, and socioeconomic backgrounds to defy soul-draining identity politics.\\nBeltway chin-pullers expediently focused on Trump\u2019s white and conservative supporters who are rightly sick and tired of social justice double standards. But they ignored the increasingly vocal constituency of hyphen-free, label-rejecting American People Against Political Correctness who don\u2019t fit old narratives and boxes.\\nAnd the same \u201cNever Trump\u201d pundits and establishment political strategists who gabbed endlessly about the need for \u201cminority outreach\u201d after 2012 were flummoxed by the blacks, gays, Latinos, women and Democrats who rallied behind the GOP candidate.\\nThe most important speech of the 2016 election cycle wasn\u2019t delivered by one of the presidential candidates. It came from iconoclastic Silicon Valley entrepreneur/investor and Trump supporter Peter Thiel who best explained the historically significant backlash against the intolerant tolerance mob and phony diversity-mongers.\\n\u201cLouder voices have sent a message that they do not intend to tolerate the views of one half of the country,\u201d he observed at the National Press Club last week. He recounted how the gay magazine The Advocate, which had once praised him as a \u201cgay innovator,\u201d declared he was \u201cnot a gay man\u201d anymore because of his libertarian, limited-government politics.\\n\u201cThe lie behind the buzzword of diversity could not be made more clear,\u201d Thiel noted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t conform, then you don\u2019t count as diverse, no matter what your personal background.\u201d\\nTrump\u2019s eclectic coalition was bound by that common thread: disaffected individuals tired of being told they don\u2019t count and discounted because their views do not properly \u201cmatch\u201d their gender, chromosomes, skin color or ethnicity. That is exactly why the more they and their nominee were demonized, the stronger their support grew.\\n\u201cNo matter what happens in this election,\u201d Thiel concluded last week, \u201cwhat Trump represents isn\u2019t crazy and it\u2019s not going away.\u201d \\nHe\u2019s right. I too often take for granted my own personal awakening about the entrenched tribalism of identity politics at a crazy liberal arts college in the early 1990s. The liberation from collectivist ideology is profound and lasting. Witnessing so many outspoken newcomers arrive at this enlightenment, however circuitous the route, has been the most encouraging and underappreciated phenomenon of the 2016 campaign.\\nMichelle Malkin is a senior editor at Conservative Review.
