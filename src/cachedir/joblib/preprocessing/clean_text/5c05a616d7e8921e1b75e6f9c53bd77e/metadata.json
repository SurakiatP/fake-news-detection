[\u201cI think that what\u2019s lost in the debate and discussion at times is the tools in the toolbox, if you will, that the EPA actually possesses or doesn\u2019t possess to respond to the CO2 issue,\u201d said Pruitt.   He looked back to the legal battle between the state of Massachusetts and the EPA in 2007, which ended at the Supreme Court. He noted the outcome did not force the EPA to regulate CO2 but \u201csimply said it had to make a decision on whether CO2 actually poses a risk to human health and the environment. \u201d \u201cFollowing that was the endangerment finding in 2009, which eventually led to the Paris discussion and clean power plan, all the rulemaking and the climate action agenda of the previous administration,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s not discussed at all is, has Congress ever responded or acted upon this matter, this issue of CO2 with respect to power generation? I will tell you, they clearly have not. \u201d \u201cIf you go back to the clean air amendments from 1990, many of the folks, including Congressman Dingell,  \u2014   a Democrat as you know  \u2014   said that it would be a \u2018glorious mess\u2019 to endeavor to use the current framework to regulate CO2. The framework that we have is a framework that\u2019s supposed to address local and regional air pollutants, not in my estimation, based upon those who amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, this phenomenon that people describe as the greenhouse gas effect,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe only power that agencies have, executive agencies have, is the power given to them by Congress,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWe can\u2019t reimagine authority. We can\u2019t make up authority. This Supreme Court has been very, very consistent at sending that message through court decisions over the last several years. \u201d Pollak built on Pruitt\u2019s point to argue there is a profound difference between the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s original mandate to combat pollution and \u201cwhat it\u2019s being asked to do by the left, which is to regulate fossil fuel use, and energy use, and energy efficiency around CO2. \u201d Pruitt agreed it was important to emphasize the distinction between pollutants and carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring component of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. \u201cThe American people deserve this debate. They deserve this discussion because it is an orthodoxy,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s been an orthodoxy for the last several years, and you have rightly stated it. \u201d He criticized those, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who imply that withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will strip the EPA of its authority to regulate genuine pollutants, with disastrous health consequences. \u201cWhat they\u2019re referring to is pollutants that we regulate under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards Program, criteria pollutants: SOx and NOx, and particulate matter, and ozone, and other types of things that they then commingle the CO2 discussion with, and that\u2019s where they come up with these types of statements  \u2014   which is not very transparent for the American people,\u201d Pruitt explained. \u201cWhat the American people deserve is a true, legitimate,   objective, transparent discussion about CO2,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a great article that was in the Wall Street Journal about a month or so ago called \u2018Red Team, Blue Team\u2019 by Steve Koonin, a scientist, I believe, at NYU. He talked about the importance of having a Red Team of scientists and a Blue Team of scientists, and those scientists get into a room and ask, \u2018What do we know? What don\u2019t we know? What risk does it pose to health in the United States and the world, with respect to this issue of CO2? \u2019\u201d \u201cThe American people need to have that type of honest, open discussion, and it\u2019s something that we hope to help provide as part of our leadership,\u201d said Pruitt. Pollak praised Pruitt for explaining in a press conference that allegedly harmless,     agreements like the Paris accord can be used by activists to trigger provisions in American laws such as the Clean Air Act that would force the EPA to issue new regulations  \u2014   in effect, creating a foreign legal regime with power beyond the U. S. Constitution. Pruitt added that another   point in the argument about the Paris accord is that President Obama did not submit it to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, an inexcusable omission given its   effects and the fact that Congress had duly ratified other international agreements Obama submitted. \u201cIt was discussed at the time that the \u2018agreement\u2019 was signed by the previous administration as an executive agreement. As you know, the previous administration walked up to the precipice, if you will, what they perceived as the precipice with respect to agreeing to certain types of targets and obligations of reporting and the rest  \u2014   and trying to stop at the precipice and say, \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t go far enough to trigger treaty obligations,\u2019\u201d he said. Pruitt denounced that approach as \u201creally unfair to the American people. \u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going to agree to targets in Paris  \u2014   if you\u2019re going to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to reduce our GHG, greenhouse gas emissions, by 26 to 28 percent\u2019  \u2014   the people of America deserve a voice in that process,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cThey need to make sure that if it\u2019s going to contract the economy, it\u2019s going to raise electricity rates  \u2014   as is already happening, by the way, if you compare our price per kilowatt versus Europe largely or Germany particularly I think we\u2019re at seven or so cents per kilowatt, far better than those in Europe and Germany particularly,\u201d he noted.  \u201cThe American people deserve a voice in that process, which is what the Founders put into the construct of the Constitution. If it\u2019s going to have an enforceable, obligatory type of response, the citizen\u2019s voice needs to be heard through ratification of these international agreements,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cWhat also is not talked about is the exposure domestically, through Section 115 of the Clean Air Act, because Section 115 of the Clean Air Act actually talks about international agreements,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe precursor to enforceability around those international agreements under Section 115 is reciprocity with other nations across the globe. At Paris, that\u2019s what we agreed to with China and India and all of those   nations. We agreed to reporting requirements. We agreed to take certain steps to engage in reciprocal types of obligations. \u201d  \u201cAs such, that reciprocity is evident and could trigger lawsuits by environmental groups here, the environmental left suing the EPA and the United States government and saying, \u2018Hey, we agreed to 26 percent and 28 percent targets in this international agreement. Why aren\u2019t you taking steps to meet those targets?\u2019 and then to compel action,\u201d he cautioned. Pruitt said this is where \u201cmost of the rulemaking has occurred at the EPA over the last several years  \u2014   not through general   administrative procedure act types of rulemaking, but consent decrees and third parties suing the EPA to compel certain action. \u201d  \u201cRegulation through litigation, if you will, which, I think, is an abuse of executive authority, an abuse of the rulemaking process,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that was absolutely key to this decision, is to mitigate and eliminate the exposure to those targets that were set by the previous administration. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
