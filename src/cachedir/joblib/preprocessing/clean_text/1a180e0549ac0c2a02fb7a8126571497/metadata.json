CDC Whistleblowers Team Up and Demand \u201cHouse Cleaning\u201d and Lend Credence to Increasingly Critical Views of Authority Structures \\nWhile the mainstream media and medical/Big Pharma spokespeople were doing their best to ignore the raging conflagration that is the VAXXED phenomenon and pretend it isn\u2019t happening, another major blow was just struck against the entrenched liars in politics claiming across-the-board \u201csafety\u201d and \u201czero risk\u201d of vaccines ( see: Victorian Health Minister Jill Hennessy ). CDC whistleblower/confessor William Thompson \u2013 the primary subject of the VAXXED documentary \u2013 appears to have triggered somewhat of a whistleblower avalanche following his explosive confession that he and his superiors literally binned (yes, threw in the trash) hard evidence linking vaccines to autism, thus vindicating the work of numerous scientists around the world who have detected such causal connections. \\nThis most recent blow against such malfeasance and criminal conspiracy consists of a letter addressed to Chief of Staff Carmen Villa at the CDC and signed off on by a group of at least a dozen disenchanted/fed up CDC scientists identifying themselves as SPIDER (CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research). \\nCDC SPIDER constitutes the biggest whistleblower event we\u2019ve ever seen, bigger even than Thompson\u2019s disturbing and compelling confession of conspiracy and coverup at the highest levels. The latest bombshell reveals (read: confirms once more) that the corruption and complicity are not anomalies, but entrenched systemic problems. \\nSPIDER\u2019s August 29, 2016 plaintive demand opens with this extremely revealing paragraph (emphasis added): \\nWe are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about the current state of ethics at our agency. It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests. It seems that our mission and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception. Some senior management officials at CDC are clearly aware and even condone these behaviors. Others see it and turn the other way. Some staff are intimidated and pressed to do things they know are not right. We have representatives from across the agency that witness this unacceptable behavior. It occurs at all levels and in all of our respective units\u2026We are asking that you do your part to help clean up this house! \\nLet\u2019s decode some key phrases: \u201cOutside parties and rogue interests.\u201d = Big Pharma and general corporate whores with connections to (or jobs in) these key agencies (CDC, AMA, etc.). It\u2019s well known that there is a revolving door between massive pharmaceutical corporations and government agencies, such that \u201coutside parties\u201d tend to become \u201cinternal parties\u201d and vice versa. The governmental arena has been thoroughly infiltrated by these \u201crogue interests,\u201d to the extent that such interests control policy creation itself. \u201c\u2026becoming the norm and not the rare exception.\u201d \u2013 Well, let\u2019s be real: this problem became normative a long time ago. Their statement shows that ALL authoritative claims around health/medical issues/medical interventions made by authorities such as the CDC or AMA should be viewed with suspicion and investigated thoroughly instead of taken prima facie (at face value). In other words, CDC and other such government agencies lie\u2026 a lot. \u201cSome senior management officials\u2026even condone these behaviors.\u201d \u2013 Because they are paid handsomely to sell humanity out to the highest bidder, whether Big Pharma, Coke, or what have you. Senior management condoning this activity creates a top-down systemic problem that poisons the entire barrel, so to speak. A strained climate of pressure to \u201cgo along to get along\u201d ensues. The public\u2019s suspicion of such agencies is thus well justified. \u201cIt occurs at all levels and in all of our respective units.\u201d I.e., no part of the CDC apparatus remains untainted by this repugnant corruption ( See: William Thompson\u2019s confession ). It is all-pervasive and, frankly, we have no reason at all to believe this problem is restricted \u2013 as if by magic \u2013 to just the CDC. Parallel government agencies with similar or related functions are just as compromised. Truth is a minor concern (or even just plain problematical) for these corrupt elements whose primary interest appears largely to be lining their pockets with a lot of cash. \\nThe SPIDER letter also outlines some other issues, including data manipulation by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the Wise Woman Program in order to present misleading results to Congress (\u201cto make the results look better than they were.\u201d) As they said, \u201cdefinitions were changed and data \u2018cooked\u2019\u201d \u2013 now where have we heard about definitions being changed before? Ah, yes, POLIO (but that\u2019s another scandal for another day). \\nSPIDER added: \\nAn \u201cinternal review\u201d that involved staff across CDC occurred and its findings were essentially suppressed so media and/or Congressional staff would not become aware of the problems. \\nSPIDER also singled out Drs. Barbara Bowman and Michael Pratt for their \u201cirregular (if not questionable) relationships with Coca\\xadCola and ILSI representatives. Neither of these relationships were necessary (or appropriate) to uphold our mission. Neither organization added any value to the good work and science already underway at CDC\u2026It appears to us that something very strange is going on with Dr. Pratt\u2026His behavior and that of management surrounding this is very troubling.\u201d \\nCarey Gillam reported on the notorious Bowman and dubious Pratt (whose surname seems apt): \\nBowman, retired after revelations of what the complaint called an \u201cirregular\u201d relationship with Coca-Cola and the nonprofit corporate interest group set up by Coca-Cola called the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Email communications obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by USRTK revealed that in her CDC role, Bowman had been communicating regularly with \u2013 and offering guidance to \u2013 a leading Coca-Cola advocate seeking to influence world health authorities on sugar and beverage policy matters. \\nEmails also suggested that Pratt has a history of promoting and helping lead research funded by Coca-Cola while being employed by the CDC. Pratt also has been working closely with ILSI, which advocates for the agenda of beverage and food industries, emails obtained through FOIA showed. Several research papers co-written by Pratt were at least partly funded by Coca-Cola, and Pratt has received industry funding to attend industry-sponsored events and conferences. \\nIt\u2019s all merely the tip of a corrupt and fetid iceberg, folks. \\nFinally, the CDC SPIDER letter closes with: \\nWhy has the CDC OD turned a blind eye to these things. The lack of respect for science and scientists that support CDC\u2019s legacy is astonishing. Please do the right thing. Please be an agent of change. Respectfully, CDC Spider (CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research) \\nRemember, fellow change agents: it is agencies such as the CDC, AMA, TGA, etc. that are orchestrating the war on natural/\u201dcomplementary\u201d medicine. It is these outlets that are enacting Big Pharma\u2019s modern day Inquisition against natural healing and demonizing those modalities and their practitioners at every opportunity, employing the lap dog mainstream media to great effect. Simultaneously they engineer a cult-like mentality in the public at large, touting the unquestionable \u201cbenefits\u201d of various mainstream interventions while aggressively discouraging any free thinking or critical analysis. Anyone who points out the well documented risks or harms resulting from said \u201cwonderful\u201d interventions is mocked and ostracised in the most juvenile form of groupthink imaginable. Welcome to 1984 , 2016 style. \\nBeware the players with the deepest pockets \u2013 they have the motive and the means for distorting collective reality and convincing millions of us that black is white and 2 + 2 = 5. \\nI\u2019m pretty sure that 2 + 2 = 4, even when it\u2019s not \u201cPC,\u201d and even when our government agencies and ministers insist the answer is \u201c5.\u201d \\nNot to worry \u2013 there are legal means of dealing with their mendacity and complicity. \\nThe truth will out. \\nThis article (\u201cCDC SPIDER is the Biggest Medical Whistleblower Event in History\u201d) is original copyrighted material belonging to Global Freedom Movement and may be re-posted freely in full, with proper (clickable) attribution, with all hyperlinks, author bio, and this copyright statement intact.
