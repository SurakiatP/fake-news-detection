We\u2019re not going to leave you hanging, wondering when the swollen red asses are going to show up. Here\u2019s one monkey ass to start this list of beautiful nature photos off right. 2. Elsewhere in nature, the blue whale is the largest animal in Earth\u2019s history, even bigger than the dinosaurs! And if you think we blew our entire red-assed money wad on that first one, then you are seriously mistaken. 3. The Alaskan wood frog has the amazing ability to freeze in winter and thaw itself out when the weather gets warm again. It sounds like something out of science fiction, and while it isn\u2019t a hulking red monkey ass, it\u2019s still an impressive example of the power of evolution. 4. No way we\u2019d skimp on monkeys with bulbous red buttocks. That\u2019s not how we treat our readers. When we promise inflamed red monkey asses, we deliver in spades. Feast your eyes on these remarkable specimens. 5. More monkeys with beacon-like red asses are coming up, but in the meantime here is the hummingbird moth. At first glance, you\u2019d mistake it for a bird, but it\u2019s actually an insect that happens to look like a hummingbird, which is pretty cool if you think about it. 6. Once again, it\u2019s time to behold red monkey ass, and this time there\u2019s a whole gaggle of monkeys with blindingly bright asses. But this isn\u2019t the end of the red assfest, no siree. This we promise. 7. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins in nature, with an almost human-like intelligence. They sadly were not blessed with a bright-red ass but are smart enough to use simple tools like sticks to catch termites. You can\u2019t help but wonder about humanity\u2019s place in nature when you see a creature so similar to us. 8. We\u2019ve got a real showstopper of a red ass on deck, but first let\u2019s do our due diligence and check out the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise. It can live over 170 years. Incredible. 9. Here we go! This monkey has a truly huge red ass, much bigger and redder than any ass we\u2019ve seen before. We are fortunate to share a planet with a bloated red miracle as beautiful as this monkey\u2019s breathtaking ass. Red monkey asses are nature at its finest, and we hope you\u2019ve had your fill of them. '"}, "time": 1742562790.7420166}
