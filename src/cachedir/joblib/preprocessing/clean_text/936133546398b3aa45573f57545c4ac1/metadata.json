The vote, by the California Air Resources Board, is the boldest indication yet of California\u2019s plan to stand up to President Trump\u2019s agenda. Leading politicians in the state, from the governor down to many mayors, have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. Mr. Trump, backing industry over environmental concerns, said easing emissions rules would help stimulate auto manufacturing. He vowed last week to loosen the regulations. Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of supporting stricter standards. But California can write its own standards because of a longstanding waiver granted under the Clean Air Act, giving the state  \u2014   the country\u2019s biggest auto market  \u2014   major sway over the auto industry. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D. C. follow California\u2019s standards, a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States. \u201cAll of the evidence  \u2014   call it science, call it economics  \u2014   shows that if anything, these standards should be even more aggressive,\u201d said the board member Daniel Sperling, a transportation expert at the University of California, Davis. The board\u2019s chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, was even more pointed, admonishing automakers for milking Mr. Trump for favors. \u201cWhat were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s take action today, and let\u2019s move on. \u201d Long a forerunner in environmental regulation, California worked with the Obama administration on joint standards that became a crucial part of the country\u2019s effort to combat climate change. Officials said the regulations would reduce the country\u2019s oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and eliminate six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution over the lifetime of the cars affected. That amounts to more than a year\u2019s worth of America\u2019s carbon emissions. Adopted in 2012, the standards would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54. 5 miles per gallon, forcing automakers to speed development of highly   vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars. Mr. Trump intends to lower that target. Friday\u2019s unanimous vote by the   board, which affirmed the higher standards through 2025, amounted to a public rejection of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans. Now, the question is how  \u2014   or whether  \u2014   the Trump administration will handle California\u2019s dissent. The administration could choose to revoke California\u2019s waiver, at which point experts expect the state would sue. California sued the George W. Bush administration after it challenged California\u2019s waiver in 2007. Mr. Obama reversed the federal challenge. The White House and the E. P. A. which have not yet determined their plans for the California waiver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several states that follow California\u2019s rules raced to its defense. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way together,\u201d said Steven Flint, director of the air resources division of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. \u201cWe\u2019re with you, and we believe in what you\u2019re doing. \u201d Environmentalists and public health experts have criticized the automakers\u2019 resistance to emissions rules under the Trump administration as an  . All major automakers previously voiced support for the more stringent standards. After the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nation\u2019s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d for the auto industry. Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3. 5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion by 2025 to comply. A separate study by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a think tank supporting emissions controls, has estimated that the cost of meeting those standards could be overstated by as much as 40 percent. And auto industry experts have warned that a slowdown in America\u2019s shift toward efficient cars could leave its auto market a global laggard. John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, an industry trade group, said before the California vote that companies agreed on the need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. But he urged California to fall into line with federal rules. \u201cThere is a more effective way forward than regulatory systems that are different,\u201d Mr. Bozzella said. He also suggested that demand for clean cars remained relatively tiny. What was required, he said, were standards that \u201cbalance innovation, compliance and consumer needs and wants. \u201d Automakers have also been critical of a California\u2019s   vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of electric cars and trucks in California and nine other states. The board voted on Friday to continue that program. Politicians in California, one of the country\u2019s most Democratic states, have embraced acting as a bulwark against Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, promising to defend the state\u2019s laws on immigration, health care and the environment. Many cities in California have broad \u201csanctuary\u201d policies aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. State law also provides some protections for immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation. In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr. the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House. Even at the federal level, the president\u2019s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E. P. A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration would then need to propose its own replacement   standards. Still, the Trump administration\u2019s move to ease emissions rules is the first part of an expected assault on Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will direct the E. P. A. to dismantle   regulations on pollution from   power plants. The E. P. A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not think carbon dioxide is a primary cause of global warming, a statement at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change. Bonnie   of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course. \u201cThe public is bearing a huge cost  \u2014   billions of dollars in health expenses and damage from climate,\u201d Ms.   said. \u201cI urge California to keep us on track. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563333.0125134}
