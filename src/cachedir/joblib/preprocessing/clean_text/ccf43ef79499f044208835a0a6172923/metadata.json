Then the Florida Gators\u2019 dynamic quarterback, Tebow cemented his destiny as that year\u2019s Heisman Trophy winner by accounting for seven touchdowns against the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. Sitting in the stands in   Stadium that day, and watching glumly, was the Honorable Stephen K. Benjamin, who at that point was still three years away from being elected mayor here. At the end of Tebow\u2019s display, Benjamin remembered having one thought: He was glad that Tebow was leaving town and hoped he was gone for good. Now, a decade later, Mayor Benjamin is thrilled to welcome Tebow back. \u201cWe are so glad he is finally on our side,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a story. \u201d Tebow departed Columbia 10 years ago as an enemy in shoulder pads. But this past Thursday, he returned as a hero with a bat, bringing his remarkable, and sometimes polarizing, appeal to a town  \u2014   and a region  \u2014   ready to embrace him. In his very first   for the Columbia Fireflies, the Mets\u2019 Class A affiliate in the South Atlantic League, Tebow added another chapter to his enduring story by blasting a home run, delighting the 10, 000 fans who had come to watch him, many of them wearing Tebow jerseys in all sorts of colors. On Sunday, Tebow hit his second home run in only four games, all of them wins for Columbia. Jeff Reed, 56, a lawn care specialist from nearby Blythewood, was in the crowd for Tebow\u2019s first homer run on opening night. Reed had actually been a fan of Tebow the football player despite living in a rival Southeastern Conference city. When Reed\u2019s wife went to Denver a few years back, she returned with a No. 15 shirt that Tebow wore when he played quarterback for the N. F. L. \u2019s Broncos. And for Tebow\u2019s first game with the Fireflies, Reed wore it to the ballpark. \u201cAs soon as we heard he would be playing here, we bought tickets,\u201d he said. So have fans from around the South Atlantic League, which includes teams from the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky and West Virginia, places where college football is king and where Tebow is revered for his gridiron prowess, his persona and, for many, his Christian faith. His baseball abilities are another matter. Still, Jason Freier, the owner of the Fireflies, said the team had been hoping for months  \u2014   ever since the Mets signed Tebow last September on what almost seemed to be a whim  \u2014   that he would be assigned to Columbia. In the end, Freier got his wish. Actually, Columbia was a logical place for Tebow, 29, to begin his professional baseball career. The South Atlantic League is a fairly low rung on the minor league ladder, making it a less challenging environment for an athlete who had been away from the sport for 12 years. But even if it made perfect sense for Tebow to start here, the Fireflies took nothing for granted. Over the past few months, they have been in constant communication with the Mets  \u2014   in part at the urging of Benjamin, who said he pestered the Fireflies\u2019 team president, John Katz, nonstop to prod the Mets. Freier said even fellow owners around the league were asking when the decision would be made official. They, too, were eager to start marketing their Tebow ticket packages for the dates when the Fireflies would visit their towns. Now, that marketing is in full force. \u201cThey tell me they have been selling well,\u201d Freier said of the league\u2019s other owners. \u201cAs soon as the announcement was made last month, about   friends in the business called and told me: \u2018You won the lottery. It\u2019s a marketing bonanza.\u2019 It is as unique a set of circumstances as you will find. \u201d Freier, who owns two other minor league clubs, said that before Tebow arrived here, he and members of his staff researched the   set of circumstances: Michael Jordan\u2019s foray into minor league baseball in 1994 for the Class AA Birmingham Barons. They read articles about that chapter of Jordan\u2019s life, watched an ESPN documentary and spoke to people who were in Birmingham at the time. With that as preparation, they then welcomed Tebow to Columbia  \u2014   the capital of South Carolina, with a population exceeding 130, 000  \u2014   and got ready for the whirlwind he seems likely to stir up, some of it financial. \u201cDoes anybody think he is a legitimate baseball prospect?\u201d said Robert Boland, the director of Ohio University\u2019s   program. \u201cProbably not. But Tebow will likely have an enormous effect on ticket and merchandise sales in a very powerful way. \u201d Normally, minor league teams market a   experience rather than individual players, because those players often spend no more than one season at a given minor league stop. Tebow, as is often the case, is the exception. However long he is in Columbia, he is almost certain to be the focus. The Fireflies\u2019 souvenir shop sells   with only one player\u2019s name on them  \u2014   Tebow\u2019s. Freier said that in 11 years owning three teams, he has seen such treatment extended to just one other minor leaguer. In that instance, a player named Josh Van Meter had been a star at Norwell High School in Indiana, and when he joined Freier\u2019s Fort Wayne TinCaps, Freier made up shirts with the hometown hero\u2019s name. Tebow, of course, is in a far different category. Freier said that when it became clear Tebow would be joining the Fireflies, national media executives told him that Tebow was second only to Tiger Woods over the past few decades when it came to measuring the appeal of an athlete in terms of online page views, clicks and overall video content. On a micro level, local businesses are hoping Tebow\u2019s arrival radiates all the way to their cash registers. Scott Hall owns the Bone In BBQ food truck that parks outside the Fireflies\u2019 stadium. While not a devout sports fan, he knew enough to compute Tebow\u2019s potential impact on his business. \u201cAt first I was like, \u2018Wait, isn\u2019t this the wrong sport? \u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really excited he\u2019s here. We want to get him out here and get a ton of barbecue in him. \u201d For Hall and others, the hope is that Tebow can thread the needle of being good enough to stay in the Fireflies\u2019 lineup but not so good that the Mets quickly promote him. And despite his home run Thursday, a quick rise in the Mets\u2019 system for Tebow seems unlikely. In his first two games, Tebow went two for 10 with four strikeouts as the Augusta Greenjackets quickly figured him out at the plate. In front of a little over 5, 000 people on Friday, Augusta even intentionally walked the bases loaded to have a lefty pitcher face the   Tebow, and he popped out to end that inning. By then, most of the two dozen members of the news media that had assembled for Tebow\u2019s debut on Thursday were gone, leaving behind a famous athlete looking to settle into a    normal baseball routine while figuring out if he has what it takes to somehow make it all the way to the major leagues. That verdict may take a while, but not that long. \u201cThis is the ultimate    business,\u201d Freier said. Clay Rapada, a former major league pitcher and the Augusta pitching coach, said he could see that Tebow had a plan when he got into the batter\u2019s box. But Tebow\u2019s development must be accelerated into a shorter time frame than the typical Class A player. \u201cHe hit a mistake,\u201d Rapada said of the home run. Still, he noted, \u201cthat\u2019s what the big boys in the major leagues get paid a lot of money to do. \u201d Tebow, who endured intense scrutiny playing in places like Gainesville in Florida or big cities throughout the N. F. L. knows that people are watching him again but shrugs off the pressure now back on his enormous shoulders. \u201cAll of my sports experiences helped me for a moment like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all help. \u201d And after Thursday\u2019s home run, and a     victory by the Fireflies, Tebow gave a rousing speech to a roomful of coaches and teammates. One of them was Dash Winningham, a    first baseman who is the Fireflies\u2019 real   star. He grew up in Ocala, Fla. a short drive from Gainesville. When Winningham was a boy, Tebow was his favorite football player. \u201cWhere I come from, Tim Tebow is like a god,\u201d Winningham said. \u201cBut he is really just one of the guys. A little older, maybe, but totally down to earth. Looking around during pregame introductions, it was pretty surreal to think that all of a sudden, we\u2019re teammates. \u201d As part of those   ceremonies on Thursday, Benjamin threw out the first pitch, then went to the home dugout to shake hands with the man who made his Saturdays so miserable a decade ago. But now, Benjamin sees Tebow as a real attraction for his city, and maybe for the sport Tebow is trying to master. At least that was the prevailing feeling after Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cWhen you think about what he represents,\u201d Benjamin said, \u201ceven in a Class A minor league system, he may in fact be the new face of baseball. \u201d That would seem to be an overstatement, but even a small dose of Tebowmania can have that effect.'"}, "time": 1742564208.1992013}
