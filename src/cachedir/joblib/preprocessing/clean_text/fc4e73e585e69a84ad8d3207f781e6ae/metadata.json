The same Democratic machine that spouts off about \"dark money\" lives on it, breathes it and thrives on it. And will take it no matter how dark and dubious it is, whether it\\'s routed from foreign interests, through foreign institutions and through roundabout ways. \\nThe system runs of money, on power and favors traded and influence bought and sold. For all the leftist politics on the surface, beneath the waters is the murkier tide in which folks like the Clintons swim. It\\'s the dark water in which money gets you access to Hillary or Obama. In which the royal courts of the royal left are filled with power brokers who do the things that make the money move around.'"}, "time": 1742562497.114013}
