Serial sexual predator and fascist ideologue Roger Ailes lost his job as the CEO of FOX News a few months ago after anchor Gretchen Carlson publicly accused her old boss of sexually harassing her and using his position to try to extort sexual favors from her. \\nAs the male stars of the network rushed to defend Ailes and over a dozen women came forward to share their own stories, Kelly stayed silent \u2013 for a time. Now, she\u2019s adding material to her upcoming memoir detailing how Ailes harassed her and threatened her job : \\n\u201cRoger began pushing the limits. There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger\u2019s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me\u2014veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the \u2018very sexy bras\u2019 I must have and how he\u2019d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\u201d \\nKelly also claims Ailes offered to promote her through the ranks \u201cin exchange for sexual favors.\u201d At one point, she writes, he \u201ccrossed a new line\u2014trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.\u201d Upon her rebuffing his advances, she recalls, \u201che asked me an ominous question: \u2018When is your contract up?\u2019 And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.\u201d \\nAfter Ailes was fired (with a $40 million severance package!), he almost immediately joined the presidential campaign of fellow serial sexual predator Donald Trump. \\nThe fall of Ailes and the backlash surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chot mic\u201d audio comments in which he admits to sexual assault have brought the issue of sexual harassment and the ways in which powerful white men abuse women in the workplace into the forefront of the public eye. \\nMen like Ailes and Trump have gotten away with their crimes for far too long; women have been forced to suffer in silence, forced to choose between their dignity and agency over their own bodies or their careers and financial well-being \u2013 a choice nobody should have to make. The more women that come forward to tell their stories, the more will follow \u2013 and hopefully we can someday geld the toxic patriarchy which silences women and allows predators to roam free.'"}, "time": 1742562923.0223207}
