He had a question for the owner: How was he going to tell his daughter that she would never see her mother again? His wife, Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, had been killed by falling debris after a commuter train barreled into Hoboken Terminal during the Thursday morning rush. She was the one fatality. Now, hours later, her husband, Adrianus de Kroon, was at Smart Start Academy, a day care center not far from the train station. He met with its owner, Karlos Magner, outside. \u201cHe said, \u2018What should I tell her? How should I handle this? \u2019\u201d Mr. Magner said. Mr. Magner had known children who had lost a parent to illness, he said, but never a death as sudden and violent as this. \u201cI told him honestly: \u2018I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no book. Life, we\u2019re not trained. We don\u2019t know. So just stand strong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Magner recalled during an interview on Friday. Ms. de Kroon, 34, had dropped her daughter, Julia, at the center on Thursday morning about an hour before the crash. Her life ended just as she was paving a new beginning in the United States with her husband and her daughter, whom they had 20 months ago in her native Brazil. Mr. Magner said Ms. de Kroon left Julia at the center and picked her up every day, sending a flurry of kisses in her daughter\u2019s way. \u201cHer daughter is attached to her,\u201d he said. The girl grew restless on Thursday as the hour that her mother normally arrived to get her came and went, Mr. Magner added. \u201cShe knew something was off,\u201d Mr. Magner said. Ms. de Kroon moved to Hoboken in April. She had planned to look for a bigger place for her family on the day she died. \u201cMaybe a house in Brooklyn,\u201d she had told a close friend, Roberta Lima. Ms. de Kroon and Ms. Lima had communicated through cellphone messages over WhatsApp, a messaging app, on Tuesday, as they often did. Ms. Lima, 35, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, asked Ms. de Kroon when she would return to Brazil for a visit. Ms. de Kroon told her that she had planned a trip for December, in time to celebrate Julia\u2019s second birthday. Ms. de Kroon was \u201ca bit apprehensive to be living far from her family now that she had a child,\u201d Ms. Lima said, but living away from family was nothing new to her. She and her husband, whom everyone knows as Daan, spent four years in Miami before moving to Brazil in 2011, where he led global business development for a Jamaican beer and a Brazilian cacha\u00e7a brand owned by an international distributor, Diageo. Mr. de Kroon, who is Dutch, was working in the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Paulo when he met his wife. Ms. de Kroon had grown up in Santos, on the Atlantic Coast, but moved to S\u00e3o Paulo for law school, Ms. Lima said. The couple moved to Miami in 2007, and they both studied business at Florida International University. \u201cThey were very focused on their careers and very much in love,\u201d Ms. Lima said. Four years later they were back in Brazil. According to Ms. Lima, as the country\u2019s economy sputtered, Mr. de Kroon moved to Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, to lead Diageo\u2019s expansion there. Ms. de Kroon was pregnant at the time and decided to stay in S\u00e3o Paulo, close to her mother, Sueli Bittar. Mr. de Kroon would travel home on weekends, Ms. Lima said. Ms. de Kroon told her that moving to the United States would give the couple and their daughter a chance to spend more time together. In April, Ms. Lima helped organize a farewell gathering for the couple in Santos. They went out dancing, had some drinks, had fun, she said. \u201cThey were both very happy, full of plans, really excited about the move,\u201d Ms. Lima said. Now, Mr. de Kroon will have to be \u201cboth mom and dad,\u201d Mr. Magner said. The only advice he could think of offering the widowed father was not to broach what had happened with his daughter until he felt the timing was right. \u201cOnly the parent will know what is the right time and when to disclose it,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren are like a sponge, they absorb so much, but they understand. \u201d Of Mr. de Kroon, Mr. Magner said, \u201cHe was strong, as strong as you can be in this situation. \u201d Ms. Lima and Ms. de Kroon were both 14 when they met, through a mutual friend. They last saw each other in Rio, at a birthday party for Ms. de Kroon\u2019s twin nephews, shortly before she left for the United States. When a bomb exploded in Manhattan recently, Ms. Lima sent Ms. de Kroon a message to make sure she, her husband and their daughter were all right. \u201cShe told me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, everything is fine,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lima recalled. \u201cShe said where they lived, on the other side of the river, was very safe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563235.8823004}
