Dispatches from our reporters on the ground a live storm tracker map and answers to reader questions will be updated below. \u25a0 The storm\u2019s death toll in the United States has climbed to at least 17. Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina said on Sunday morning that his state\u2019s toll had risen to eight. Officials in Georgia confirmed three deaths on Saturday. At least six fatalities in Florida have been attributed to the storm. Nearly 900 people have died in Haiti, according to a Reuters report based on information from civil protection and local officials. \u25a0 Bands of heavy rain are leading to   flooding in parts of eastern North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center, which may result in   flooding and flash flooding elsewhere in the region. Forecasters warned that areas along the Neuse River in Goldsboro, N. C. could experience flooding worse than the devastating inundation that followed Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The river was projected to hit 30. 9 feet around 2 a. m. on Monday, surpassing the record of 28. 9 feet caused by Floyd. \u25a0 In Georgia, the storm created a record surge at Tybee Island, near the state\u2019s border with South Carolina. The surge reached 12. 5 feet, according to the Chatham County Emergency Management Agency, which exceeded the previous high of 12. 2 feet, set during Hurricane David in 1979. \u25a0 To cover the storm and its aftermath, The New York Times has journalists deployed along the its path. Follow our correspondents on Twitter. The storm\u2019s assault on North Carolina extended into Sunday, and the governor said at least seven people had been killed in the state. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t assume that there aren\u2019t people clinging for life right now in houses that are underwater that we have yet to reach, especially in   areas,\u201d Gov. Pat McCrory told reporters in Raleigh, the state capital. \u201cThat\u2019s what my major concern is. \u201d Heavy rain was still pounding parts of the state as the governor spoke, and Mr. McCrory said floodwaters could rush through North Carolina for days. The fallout, he said, \u201cis going to be a prolonged event. \u201d \u201cThis is still an extremely dangerous situation,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cAnd I cannot stress it more especially in the areas of Rocky Mount, Kinston, Greenville, Goldsboro and other eastern towns, cities. We\u2019re going to have major issues with rivers and flooding. \u201d Mr. McCrory said 58 boat crews had rescued nearly 900 people by Sunday morning. More than 4, 000 people were in shelters on Sunday, Mr. McCrory said, and about 760, 000 homes and businesses were without electricity. Parts of Interstate 40 and Interstate 95 were shut down.  \u2014   ALAN BLINDER  The storm lashed South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry with rain and sent the sea surging upward. It turned roads into rivers and ripped trees from the inundated ground before making landfall north of Charleston. More than 430, 000 people around the state had been left without power as of late Saturday. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina said on Sunday that she had lifted evacuation orders for four counties, including Charleston. But residents in four other counties  \u2014   Beaufort, Georgetown, Horry and Jasper  \u2014   were still urged to stay away. \u201cWe had a lot of rain, for many hours,\u201d said Capt. Bob Bromage, the public information officer for the Sheriff\u2019s Department in Beaufort County, southwest of Charleston. \u201cWe had flooding, we may have had some surge that we\u2019re not aware of yet, we have downed trees, we have reports of downed trees on houses already. \u201d  \u2014   JESS BIDGOOD, in Charleston The American Red Cross has published a list of safety tips for homeowners returning to property damaged in hurricanes. Once cleanup begins, taking photographs of damaged or destroyed property before it is discarded provides a record for use in making insurance claims, says Ann Carrns, who writes the Your Money Adviser consumer finance column for The Times. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Saturday that the state had suffered \u201cunbelievable amounts of beach erosion,\u201d as well as damaged roads, flooding and felled trees. But Mr. Scott, who flew along the coastline to survey storm damage, said the storm\u2019s consequences could have been far worse. \u201cThe first thing we can say is we are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,\u201d he said. \u201cI worried the whole time that even though the track was off our coast, that it would turn in and have a direct hit at some point. \u201d State and local officials said they were trying to expedite recovery. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ride each other hard,\u201d said Lenny Curry, the mayor of Jacksonville. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ride our utilities, we\u2019re going to ride all of our workers to get this community back together as quickly and as safely as possible. Still, Mayor Charlie Latham of Jacksonville Beach asked for patience. \u201cWe\u2019re working diligently, and to be honest with you, we\u2019re doing our very best just to get people home and provide safe access,\u201d Mr. Latham said.  \u2014   ALAN BLINDER, in Orlando In Haiti, the Bahamas and Florida, the storm left behind stories of disaster and of disaster narrowly averted. Here are some of them \u00bb John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the storm. He rode out his first hurricane, Carla, in his hometown, Galveston, Tex. at age 4. He has covered the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as well as other storms for The Times.  Ask your hurricane questions here. Why do weather agencies and the news media keep getting the forecasts so wrong and overstate the severity of hurricanes? Is this some kind of insurance liability issue, where they are afraid of getting sued if they don\u2019t paint a \u2018doomsday\u2019 picture?  \u2014   Jim The conservative approach isn\u2019t about liability, Jim, it\u2019s about saving lives. The storm track that Matthew has followed has been well within the range of possibilities that the National Hurricane Center has been talking about all along. This is still a dangerous storm, and just because some stretches of the Florida coast have not been hit as catastrophically as was possible, that does not mean the rest of Florida or Georgia or South Carolina are in the clear. Marshall Shepherd, the director of Atmospheric Sciences Program, University of Georgia, has been fiercely defending the warnings on Twitter, and I\u2019ll let him do the talking here: Chris W. Landsea, science and operations officer for the National Hurricane Center, said that while the storm has weakened somewhat, it is now spread over a larger area, and \u201ca larger hurricane can cause more storm surge,\u201d and a larger wind field the wind damage, in other words, can be felt over a larger area. So a slightly weaker but larger storm is \u201ckind of a wash, as far as impacts,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628443.7625399}
