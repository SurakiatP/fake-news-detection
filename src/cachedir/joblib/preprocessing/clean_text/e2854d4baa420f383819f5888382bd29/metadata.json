Sure, they want athletes to be   but they also want to be entertained by raw human power. So yes, they would have preferred to see the Russian and Bulgarian teams, which were barred for doping. Likewise with Ilya Ilyin, a suspended   Olympic champion from Kazakhstan, who is the Barry Bonds of the clean and jerk. \u201cYou like to see world records,\u201d said Dan Rigney, 28, a physiotherapist and competitive lifter from Sydney. \u201cIt\u2019s like baseball. People just want to see home runs. \u201d There has long been a    pragmatism about weight lifting. Drugs have been a hushed but vital part of doing business. If there is an argument to be made that any sport should permit doping, or even make it mandatory, that sport is weight lifting. \u201cMaybe it already is,\u201d Dan Rigney said with a laugh, adding that, in his view, doping \u201cis what\u2019s keeping the Olympics going. \u201d Let\u2019s be honest. We don\u2019t want to see anybody lift a keg. We want to see someone hoist a Buick. We are nostalgic for champions like Vasily Alekseyev, the great Soviet superheavyweight who won gold medals in 1972 and 1976. He set 80 world records and was the first person to lift 500 pounds in the clean and jerk. He was so massive that his uniform fit like a chin strap on a bowling ball. And those sideburns  \u2014   great thickets wide and deep enough to plant potatoes. Oh, sure, we say we are against doping in sports. But we don\u2019t care enough to stop buying tickets or watching on television. And let\u2019s ask ourselves this: Would anyone stay tuned if the Olympic champion ran the 100 meters in 15 seconds instead of nine? Who would watch the N. F. L. if linemen were built more like Gilligan than the Skipper? Most fans seem to view doping in the same way they view special effects in \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, said Charles Yesalis, a retired Penn State professor and an expert on   drugs. \u201cIt enhances the enjoyment of viewing because you see    people doing    things,\u201d Dr. Yesalis said in a recent interview. \u201cIf everybody looked like normal people, chances are the N. C. A. A. the N. F. L. and the Olympics would not be   entities. \u201d Before the Games, international sports officials tossed out assorted male and female lifters from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, North Korea, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, a Fodor\u2019s guide through the world of banned substances. Olympic weight lifting without Russia and Bulgaria is like Harry Potter without Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange (if those villains wore spandex and had necks the size of Easter hams). The competition will go on, but it won\u2019t be the same. Until recently, weight lifting officials had mostly turned the other way, keenly understanding that the final word of the Olympic motto, \u201cFaster, Higher, Stronger,\u201d is not easily achieved over the counter. Of course, with the Rio Games upon us, the International Weightlifting Federation is suddenly affronted. It has called revelations of widespread doping in Russia \u201cshocking and disappointing\u201d and has said that the \u201cintegrity of the weight lifting sport has been seriously damaged. \u201d Integrity? Now they worry about integrity? There were 24 positive tests at the world weight lifting championships last year, and retesting of urine samples from the 2008 Beijing Games and the 2012 London Games revealed at least 20 additional positives, including four from Olympic champions, according to the news agency Agence  . Essentially, comedy has become reality. Remember that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch, with Phil Hartman playing a Soviet weight lifter named Sergei Akmudov at the All Drug Olympics? \u201cHis trainer has told me that he\u2019s taken anabolic steroids, Novocain, NyQuil, Darvon and some sort of fish paralyzer,\u201d the announcer, played by Kevin Nealon, says earnestly. \u201cAlso, I believe he\u2019s had several cocktails within the last hour or so,\u201d the announcer says. \u201cAll this, of course, is perfectly legal at the All Drug Olympics. In fact, it\u2019s encouraged. \u201d Akmudov tries to lift more than 1, 500 pounds, triple the world record in the clean and jerk, except for one small problem. \u201cOh, he\u2019s pulled his arms off!\u201d the witless announcer yells. \u201cHe\u2019s pulled his arms off! That\u2019s got to be disappointing to the big Russian. \u201d With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, the Olympics lost a gripping appeal for many Americans  \u2014   the rivalry between East and West. With Russia now absent from Rio in weight lifting and track and field, that enthralling tension erodes further still. \u201cThere was no one to root against,\u201d Matt Futterman wrote last month in The Wall Street Journal, lamenting the parting of the Iron Curtain for international sport. \u201cIt was like watching a Bond film in which everyone was working for MI6. \u201d One wonders whether medals won in Rio will be devalued in particular sports, as they were when the United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the Soviet Union reciprocated at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. \u201cWeight lifting is so riddled with doping problems, it\u2019s hard to call any medal devalued,\u201d said Bill Mallon, an Olympic historian. And to be sure, many people in weight lifting have applauded the mass suspensions. \u201cRules are rules,\u201d said Mika Tiainen, Finland\u2019s Olympic coach. \u201cLifting makes the competition, not the country. \u201d Still, it would surprise no one if the retesting of urine samples from Rio led to the stripping of medals in coming years. Anthony Rigney, 33, a teacher, said he had seen a meme online: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until 2024 to see who won the gold in Rio. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564541.5803423}
