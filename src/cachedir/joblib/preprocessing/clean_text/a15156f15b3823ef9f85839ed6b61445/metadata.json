[In a searing article published on BET. com Wednesday, Keith Murphy says the    singer has \u201cbecome the latest white pop act looking to reinvent themselves on the back of Black urban culture. \u201d  Murphy  \u2014   pointing to what he called the \u201cFirework\u201d singer\u2019s \u201ccringeworthy\u201d May 20 Saturday Night Live performances, one which featured Atlanta rap trio Migos \u2014   says Perry is no longer the \u201cbubbly, witty and at times   brunette who had began her professional career in 2001 as a virginal contemporary Christian music vocalist before hitting peak pop superstar levels. \u201d \u201cIn her place stood a static individual who was hardly recognizable,\u201d Murphy wrote. Perry\u2019s performance of her   single \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d on SNL last week was heavily panned by critics online and on social media (and in the comments section on YouTube). Perry\u2019s            act was called \u201codd\u201d by Spin and became the subject of several memes  \u2014   many of them accusing the singer of exploiting black culture.

And why did the      pop protagonist, who first arrived on the pop music scene in 2008 feel the need to Blacken things up?\u201d Perry\u2019s past collaborations with black musicians, including \u201cSnoop Dogg (\u201cCalifornia Gurls\u201d) Kanye West (\u201cE.
