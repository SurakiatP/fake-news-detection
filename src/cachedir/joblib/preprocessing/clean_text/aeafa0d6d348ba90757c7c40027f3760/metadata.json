A gangster boss who has become a celebrity criminal. A sister who knows his secrets, and fears for her life. A criminal justice system unable to keep him behind bars without her help. And the back story of a childhood that was \u201cdysfunctional to the max,\u201d Mr. van Gelderen said. Ms. Holleeder is the sister of Willem Holleeder, convicted of the 1983 kidnapping of the Dutch beer millionaire Freddy Heineken. He has been in and out of prison for years, but never for murder, though Ms. Holleeder calls him a \u201cserial killer\u201d in her book. Because she got close enough to tape him and agreed to testify against him, he is on trial again, this time facing six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. Mr. van Gelderen\u2019s instincts were right. The book, released in early November, has been the No. 1 best seller in the Netherlands for eight straight weeks, according to the Dutch   association CPNB. Rights have already been sold for publication in Danish, German and Swedish, and Little, Brown and Company in New York bought worldwide   rights this month. \u201cJudas\u201d is not a recounting of Mr. Holleeder\u2019s famous misdeeds, but the story of a childhood that included regular beatings by an alcoholic father, and, later, of Mr. Holleeder\u2019s   hold on his family. \u201cIn the writing, there\u2019s this strangling feeling of a guy who is controlling everybody,\u201d Mr. van Gelderen said. Ms. Holleeder, 51, a successful   lawyer, describes in chilling detail how, a year after their father\u2019s death in 1991, Mr. Holleeder was released from prison and took his place as the family abuser. She recounts how painful it was to interact with him after the murder of her    Cor van Hout, Mr. Holleeder\u2019s longtime friend and   in the Heineken kidnapping. She contends that Mr. Holleeder ordered that killing, and plans to testify to that effect in court. Ms. Holleeder has been observing the success of her book from the secret location where she has been living under protection since February, after an inmate in a   prison described being contracted by Mr. Holleeder  to arrange for the killing of Ms. Holleeder their sister, Sonja Holleeder, who was married to Mr. van Hout and a Dutch crime reporter who helped Astrid establish contact with the police. (Another brother, Gerard, has remained uninvolved in the case.) Astrid Holleeder agreed to speak with The New York Times only from a separate, secure location, and she said that she did not think she would ever be safe as long as her brother was alive. \u201cHe will not rest until we\u2019re dead,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about his pride. He cannot let his little sister take him down. \u201d Ms. Holleeder said that she wrote \u201cJudas\u201d as a kind of \u201clast will and testament\u201d for her daughter, who is 31 and has two children of her own. She said that testifying in court during the pretrial phase of the current case had so far felt ineffectual. (The trial is scheduled to begin in early 2017.) \u201cI want to tell everything, but they haven\u2019t given me the chance yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThe book is just about how I feel, how we grew up, what in fact made me and my brother into the opponents that we are now. \u201d Even when the   manuscript was finished, Lebowski Publishers did not provide details of its contents to bookstores, for fear that Mr. Holleeder would try to prevent its release. But after the publisher disclosed information on a   television talk show the day before the book\u2019s publication, the first print run of 80, 000 copies sold out immediately. About 400, 000 copies have been bought so far  \u2014   a milestone in a country of about 17 million, where sales of 5, 000 copies are considered strong. \u201cJudas\u201d is a narrative in the present, with flashbacks to the Holleeders\u2019 childhood. The account begins in January 2012, when Mr. Holleeder was released from prison after serving six years of a   sentence for extortion. Astrid Holleeder said she acted as a kind of consigliere for her brother  \u2014   advising him on legal matters, arranging his safe house when he got out of prison and serving as a confidante  \u2014   in an effort to get close enough to obtain material that she could share with the police. She started wearing a wire in 2013, and ultimately recorded hundreds of hours of conversations with her brother. Although the author describes the admiration she felt for her brother as a little girl, her adult attitude toward him is clear from an early passage in which she describes picking him up from a prison in Vught the last time he was released. \u201cDuring his detention, my brother developed a serious heart condition,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe barely survived, but he did because, as my mother used to say, a weed doesn\u2019t perish. I was surprised he had a heart at all. \u201d Mr. Holleeder\u2019s lawyers, Sander Janssen and Robert Malewicz, criticized the timing of the book\u2019s publication. Mr. Holleeder has been back in the   prison in Vught since December 2014, but he has appeared regularly at pretrial hearings. \u201cIt\u2019s not very favorable for any criminal case to have a book like this come out during the proceedings,\u201d Mr. Janssen said by telephone. \u201cYou never know if a witness will tell you something because he or she knows about it, or because he or she read it in a book. \u201d Franklin Wattimena, a spokesman for the public prosecutor\u2019s office, said that it learned about \u201cJudas\u201d only the day before it was released. The judges who will decide the case have said that they have not, and will not, read the book unless it is submitted as evidence. (There are no juries in the Netherlands trials are run, and decided, by three judges.) As for Mr. Holleeder, he reacted to the book with a brief statement for the panel of judges. \u201cI have not terrorized my family,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this book had not been about me, I would have been as shocked as everybody else is. What Astrid said is not the truth. \u201d Mr. van Hout, the   turned foe, once called Mr. Holleeder \u201cJudas,\u201d which inspired the title of the best seller. But today, Ms. Holleeder says she feels it is she who betrayed her brother. She said that she \u201chates\u201d herself for turning against her brother, and that, in spite of everything, she still loves him. She said she knew, however, that it was necessary to speak out, \u201cto end the problem for everyone else. \u201d \u201cI betrayed him,\u201d Ms. Holleeder said of testifying against him. \u201cHe trusted me with his life, he would tell me everything, and I was the only thing he had when he got out of prison. \u201d When the news broke that she would testify, she said she thought: \u201cNo, he cannot survive this. He\u2019s fighting back, of course, but I don\u2019t think he can win this time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561913.8652716}
