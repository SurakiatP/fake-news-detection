Portraying the lifelong friendship of two women, one of whom dies too young  \u2014   you could say that\u2019s a spoiler, but it\u2019s really the only thing the movie\u2019s about  \u2014   it was a shamelessly retrograde and   soap opera with a veneer of fake feminism. (Careers and single motherhood were fine as long as they involved constant suffering.) Depending on your susceptibilities, it could inspire cultish devotion or impel you to yell at the screen. It was not, by any measure, a movie that needed to be remade. But here we are, 29 years later, with a new television version of \u201cBeaches\u201d on Lifetime on Saturday night. Idina Menzel has taken the Bette Midler role of C. C. Bloom, the brassy Jewish   (originally from the Bronx, now from Venice Beach) and Nia Long succeeds Barbara Hershey as Hillary Whitney, who originally was a   lawyer. The Lifetime \u201cBeaches\u201d is a reduction of the original  \u2014   smaller emotions, smaller performances, fewer songs, shorter running time (about 87 minutes versus 123)  \u2014   and while that could have been an improvement, it\u2019s not. The things that made the original worth sitting through, whether you were   or   are mostly gone. Stuffing the story into 70 percent of the time makes C. C. and Hillary\u2019s cycle of fights and reconciliations feel more arbitrary than ever, especially in the absence of Ms. Midler, whose vivid portrayal of C. C. provided motivations that weren\u2019t in the script. The new things in the Lifetime film, written by Bart Baker and Nicole Beckwith (based on a novel by Iris Rainer Dart) and directed by Allison Anders, add nothing to the story. Casting Ms. Long, who\u2019s black, would seem to add diversity, but so much of the (admittedly clich\u00e9d)   and California   flavors have been stripped away from C. C. and Hillary that the characters feel more indistinguishable than they did before. Some of the film\u2019s precious time is devoted to a new character, Hillary\u2019s lawyer father, so that when he dies, she can make a statement about black men and the justice system. Meanwhile, you watch it noting the things that are missing, even those that made you cringe. No more Ms. Midler singing \u201cUnder the Boardwalk. \u201d No more Mayim Bialik as the frighteningly confident    C. C. belting out \u201cThe Glory of Love. \u201d No more John Heard supplying a touch of grace as the theater director whom both C. C. and Hillary love. No more \u201cThat\u2019s my robe. \u201d There is one improvement: Ms. Menzel sings \u201cWind Beneath My Wings\u201d a   sooner than Ms. Midler did. Just in case that\u2019s what you\u2019re waiting around for.'"}, "time": 1742563769.2671275}
