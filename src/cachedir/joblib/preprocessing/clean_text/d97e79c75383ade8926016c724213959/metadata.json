He was 76. The cause was a heart attack, his son Robert Freeman Jr. said on Monday. The death had not been widely reported. Mr. Freeman was still a teenager when he wrote and recorded the song that became his signature. Sung with infectious enthusiasm and featuring a driving Latin rhythm and a joyful guitar solo, \u201cDo You Want to Dance\u201d reached No. 5 on the Billboard singles chart. An energetic showman and dancer, Mr. Freeman was soon touring with Fats Domino and Jackie Wilson and appearing on television shows like \u201cAmerican Bandstand\u201d and \u201cThe Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show. \u201d Mr. Freeman\u2019s version of \u201cDo You Want to Dance\u201d (also known as \u201cDo You Wanna Dance,\u201d with and without the question mark) embodied the spirit of early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, but the secret to the song\u2019s longevity was that artists interpreted it in myriad ways. The Beach Boys reached No. 12 on the Billboard chart in 1965 with a typically     interpretation. John Lennon recorded a dreamy reggae version. The Ramones ramped up Mr. Freeman\u2019s energy to   levels. Both the Mamas and the Papas and Ms. Midler slowed the song down Ms. Midler\u2019s version, a sensual ballad, reached No. 17 on the Billboard chart in 1973. She told CBS News in 2006 that \u201cDo You Want to Dance\u201d was her favorite song. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of George Lucas\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll    film \u201cAmerican Graffiti\u201d (1973). Mr. Freeman was not a   wonder. \u201cC\u2019mon and Swim\u201d (1964)  \u2014   a young Sly Stone was its producer and a    \u2014   reached No. 5 on the Billboard chart. \u201cBetty Lou Got a New Pair of Shoes\u201d (1958) also charted. Robert Thomas Freeman was born in Northern California on June 13, 1940, and raised in San Francisco. He attended Mission High School there before joining the Romancers, a   group. In addition to his son Robert, his survivors include another son, Jerrald his partner of 17 years, Michele Ellen two daughters, April Freeman and Nichole Hackett and several grandchildren. Mr. Freeman released a handful of songs after 1964, but none became hits. He spent years performing at clubs in San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Reno, Las Vegas and other cities, and that was fine with him. \u201cI\u2019m just as content as I could be with what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 1990. \u201cI have no complaints whatsoever. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562491.704184}
