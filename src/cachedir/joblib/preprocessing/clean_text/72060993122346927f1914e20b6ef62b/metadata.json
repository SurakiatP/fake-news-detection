[\u201cWell, we did it,\u201d he told a cheering crowd at his first speech, given at the Liberty Ball. He continued:  Now the work begins. There are no game, no games, right? We\u2019re not playing games. I want to thank everybody. We love you. We\u2019re going to be working for you, and we\u2019re going to be producing results. \u201cNow the work begins,\u201d he said at his second speech, given at the Freedom Ball.  \u201cWe did a good job together   \u2026     there has never been a movement like this anywhere in the world,\u201d he told his enthusiastic supporters.  \u201cWe will not be taken advantage of anymore. We\u2019re going to have those great companies come pouring back in,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are not going to let you down. Remember the theme: Make America Great Again   \u2026     greater than ever before  \u2014   it will happen,\u201d he said.
