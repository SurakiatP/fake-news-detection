Trump and Hillary Clinton, interrupting each other and sometimes raising their voices, engaged in an angry debate on Thursday about how Mr. Trump pulled off his upset victory. Emotions were still raw at the campaign   held at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, particularly over the influence of Stephen K. Bannon, who left Breitbart News  \u2014   which he has called a \u201cplatform\u201d for the white nationalist    \u2014   to help run Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Mr. Bannon will serve as a senior aide to Mr. Trump. David Bossie, Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, called Mr. Bannon a \u201cbrilliant strategist. \u201d That provoked the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri, to respond, \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am more proud to have lost. \u201d Mr. Bannon was scheduled to participate in the event but did not attend. That did not stop several hundred demonstrators from protesting him Wednesday evening outside Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, where the   was held as part of a   conference. With campaign managers and pollsters talking over one another and a large crowd of campaign veterans from the news media looking on, Ms. Palmieri said her proudest moment from the campaign was a speech Mrs. Clinton gave in Nevada condemning the  . \u201cI would rather lose than win the way you guys did,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said. Kellyanne Conway, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s third and final campaign manager, asked, \u201cHow exactly did we win?\u201d She answered her own question: by connecting with voters in places \u201cwhere we were either ignored or mocked roundly by most of the people in this room. \u201d \u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Ms. Conway asked Ms. Palmieri. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look me in the face and tell me that?\u201d Ms. Conway went on, pointing out Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failings. \u201cDo you think you could have just had a decent message for the white   voters?\u201d she asked the Clinton advisers. \u201cHow about it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, she doesn\u2019t connect with people? How about they had nothing in common with her? How about you had no economic message?\u201d Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pollster, accused the Trump campaign of using \u201cdog whistles\u201d about immigrants and minorities to appeal to white voters in battleground states. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, disputed the notion that Mr. Trump won primarily by appealing on economic issues, citing exit polls in Michigan and Wisconsin showing Mrs. Clinton carried more voters who ranked the economy as their top issue. The highly charged exchange was followed by a more restrained conversation between Ms. Conway and Mr. Mook, moderated by the CNN host Jake Tapper. CNN will broadcast the discussion on Sunday. But it was the more raucous session earlier in the day where the passions of the campaign still seemed at a barely contained boil. The participants, half a dozen from each campaign who faced each other while seated at two tables, argued about whether Mr. Trump had won a mandate. \u201cYou won the Electoral College don\u2019t pretend you have a mandate,\u201d Mr. Benenson said. \u201cTwo and a half million more Americans thought she was a better candidate. \u201d \u201cHey guys,\u201d Ms. Conway replied. \u201cWe won. Why is there no mandate?\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers argued repeatedly that two public letters by James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails less than two weeks before Election Day pushed enough undecided voters away from her to swing the election. They also said that voters were seeking fundamental change in Washington, a strong headwind Mrs. Clinton could never overcome. In a rare point of agreement, both campaigns faulted the news media. They said leading newspapers and TV networks were so convinced Mr. Trump was unelectable that they never took him seriously. That led to \u201c \u201d on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, Mr. Mook said. \u201cMr. Trump had a unique ability to speak directly to the American people and go past the media, whether in 140 characters or making a statement somewhere,\u201d Mr. Bossie said. The Trump strategists repeatedly said the Clinton campaign had tried to disqualify Mr. Trump based on his temperament and statements, while misunderstanding the appeal of his promise to keep Americans safe from terrorism at home and abroad. \u201cThey wanted to frame the race as, \u2018Do you trust him to have his finger on the button? \u2019\u201d said Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Trump\u2019s pollster. \u201cAt the end of the day, what a lot of voters didn\u2019t buy was that it was ever going to be a time where you have to worry about his finger on the button,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t Barry Goldwater. \u201d Asked by Mr. Tapper whether Mr. Trump\u2019s recent posting of misinformation on Twitter about millions of undocumented immigrants voting was presidential, Ms. Conway defended the message. \u201cHe\u2019s the   so that\u2019s presidential behavior,\u201d she said. At one point, Ms. Conway threw up her hands in frustration at the close scrutiny of the campaign. \u201cEverybody wants to go back in a time machine and do things differently so this result that nobody saw coming won\u2019t come somehow,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628557.1356146}
