Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS\u2019s Military Base in Mosul By Ian Greenhalgh on November 2, 2016 Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS\u2019s Military Base in Mosul Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS\u2019s Military Base in Mosul \\nIraqi army and popular forces have discovered a number of US-made missiles from a military position of the ISIS (ISIL, IS, Daesh) in the Southern part of Mosul, informed local sources disclosed after the first group of pro-government troops opened their way into Southern Mosul on Monday. \\n\u201cSeveral US-made missiles were found in al-Shoura region to the South of Mosul,\u201d a local source said on Monday. \\nThe Iraqi army and popular forces had found US-made missiles in Anbar province several times before. \\nProvincial officials confirmed that the US-made weapons were sent by the US-led anti-ISIL coalition airplane for the ISIL terrorists in Anbar province. \\nMeantime, Iraqi security officials announced that the ISIL has sent US-made military equipment to Tal Afar region in the last two days to stand strong against Iraqi popular forces\u2019 impending attack to capture the region. \\n\u201cThe ISIL terrorists have sent US-made TOW anti-tank missiles to Tal Afar and it is quite evident that they are preparing for a long-term war,\u201d the Arabic-language media quoted an Iraqi security official as saying on Monday. \\nIn late August 2015, a senior Iraqi intelligence official revealed that the US helicopters drop weapons and other aids for the ISIL terrorists in the Western province of al-Anbar. \\n\u201cThe fighters present at the forefront of fighting against the ISIL always see US helicopters flying over the ISIL-controlled areas and dropping weapons and urgent aids for them,\u201d the official who called for anonymity told FNA. Yet, he said the helicopters could have also been sent from Turkey or Israel. \\nHe added that in addition to dropping aids, the helicopters transfer the ISIL ringleaders and wounded members from the battleground to some hospitals in Syria or other countries which support the terrorist group. \\nThe official cautioned that such assistance further prolongs the conflicts in Anbar, adding that when the Iraqi army and popular forces purge the terrorists from Anbar province, the US helicopters will transfer the ISIL ringleaders to other regions to prevent the Iraqi forces\u2019 access to ISIL secrets. \\nAlso in March 2015, a group of Iraqi popular forces known as Al-Hashad Al-Shabi shot down the US Army helicopter that was carrying weapons for the ISIL in the Western parts of Al-Baghdadi region in Al-Anbar province. \\nMeantime in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq\u2019s army had shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province. \\n\u201cThe Iraqi Parliament\u2019s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\u201d al-Zameli said.
