Soon after, one of her friends commented anxiously on the photo: \u201cGlad Pat is there and not in Dallas right now. \u201d Ms. Villasenor replied: \u201cHe\u2019s not here. \u201d Pat  \u2014   her husband, Officer Patrick Zamarripa  \u2014   was in Dallas during the game, caught in the crosshairs of a sniper\u2019s rifle that would eventually claim his life and those of four other officers. The news of the killings emerged almost in real time online. At 10:53 p. m. the Dallas Police Department posted a Twitter message announcing that 10 officers had been shot during a protest rally, three of them fatally. Twenty minutes later, a second message said that a fourth officer had been killed. Then, after midnight, there was a third: \u201cIt has been a devastating night. We are sad to report a fifth officer has died. \u201d By Friday afternoon, the full scope of the city\u2019s losses was clear: At least two of the slain officers had served overseas in the military, only to die back home in Texas. A third had made his way to Dallas after working at a jail outside Detroit. A fourth was a large man  \u2014   about     \u2014   who had the semblance of a grizzly bear, according to a friend. The fifth was a standout on Dallas\u2019s large, modern force: The local police association had named him the \u201cCops\u2019 Cop\u201d for February 2009. As condolences for the men poured in all day on Friday  \u2014   from the governor to the secretary general of the United Nations  \u2014   details of the officers\u2019 lives started to emerge. \u201cWe\u2019re hurting, our profession is hurting,\u201d said David O. Brown, the Dallas police chief. The first officer to be identified was Brent Thompson, 43, who worked for the police force of Dallas Area Rapid Transit, which operates trains and buses in the region. Mr. Thompson, the first DART officer to die in the line of duty, joined the transit force in 2009 and patrolled the northwestern section of the transit system, according to his LinkedIn page. Before Dallas, he worked for DynCorp International as a police liaison officer and helped train fellow officers in Afghanistan and Iraq. He had also been a police academy instructor in Corsicana, Tex. southeast of Dallas, where he attended high school. He started in law enforcement in the Navarro County sheriff\u2019s office, where he was assigned to the county jail, said Leslie A. Cotten Sr. the former sheriff. But like most young officers, Mr. Cotten said, \u201che wanted to get out on patrol and ride around in a patrol car and do a different job. \u201d Family members, writing on Facebook, were the first to publicly identify Mr. Zamarripa, a   veteran of the Dallas force who had spent time in the Navy and served tours in Iraq as a military policeman. His Navy records released on Friday showed that he enlisted in 2001 and had also been posted in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Virginia and Bahrain. When he finished his military service, Mr. Zamarripa, a fan of the Rangers and the Dallas Cowboys, returned to the Dallas area and joined the Police Department, said his uncle, Hector Zamarripa. He lived in the Fort Worth area with Ms. Villasenor and their    daughter, Lyncoln. He also had a stepson, his uncle said. On Friday afternoon, the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization  \u2014   Mr. Zamarripa was a member  \u2014   held a somber lunch for grieving supporters. \u201cA good kid, man, a good young kid,\u201d said Sgt. George Aranda, who runs the organization. \u201cHe loved his job. I talked to his mom last night, and even his mom said this was Patrick\u2019s dream. This is what he wanted to be, a police officer. \u201d The third slain officer was Michael Krol, 40. Before moving to Dallas, Mr. Krol had served in the Wayne County, Mich. jail system from 2003 to 2007, said the county sheriff, Benny N. Napoleon. Two of Mr. Krol\u2019s relatives declined to be interviewed on Friday. A fourth officer, Lorne Ahrens, was married to a Dallas police detective and regarded as a lawman devoted to the profession that he pursued in Dallas for more than a dozen years. \u201cThere are very few officers I\u2019ve met who are more passionate about doing the job right than that man,\u201d said Timothy S. Rodgers, a former prosecutor in Dallas County. \u201cHe was always calling me. He always had questions like, \u2018What can I do better in this situation?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Ahrens had worked in patrol and on property crimes. Mr. Rodgers recalled with a chuckle that his friend had a knack for finding criminals who would challenge him, despite his hefty size. The fifth slain officer was Michael J. Smith, who joined the Police Department in September 1989 after growing up in the southeastern corner of the state. In a publication acknowledging his Cops\u2019 Cop award, the Police Association said that Mr. Smith held an array of posts: in personnel, on patrol and at the airport. The publication also said he had been injured on duty years ago when a gang member \u201clunged at his partner with an unknown object in his hand. \u201d At a news conference on Friday morning, Mayor Mike Rawlings stood beside Chief Brown and said: \u201cTo say that our police officers put their lives on the line every day is no hyperbole, ladies and gentlemen. It\u2019s a reality. \u201d A few hours earlier, the department had posted yet another Twitter message: \u201cThank you to the members of our community for your show of support during this difficult time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562053.220853}
