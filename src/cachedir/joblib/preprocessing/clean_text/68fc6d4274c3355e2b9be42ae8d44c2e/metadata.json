Trump\u2019s foundation has acknowledged that it may have run afoul of   rules that guard against using money meant for charity to benefit principals of the organization, according to its 2015 tax filing. On the filing, the  \u2019s charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, checked \u201cyes\u201d to answer a question about whether its resources had been directed or used to benefit a \u201cdisqualified person\u201d  \u2014   meaning one of the organization\u2019s central people. The tax filing offers new details about Mr. Trump\u2019s charitable giving, which became the subject of intense scrutiny during his presidential campaign after news reports raised questions about whether he had followed through on pledges he made to donate money and his lack of financial support for the foundation. The Washington Post, which first reported the   admission on the 2015 form, earlier reported that Mr. Trump had used $258, 000 from the charity to settle legal disputes involving his businesses, possibly violating   provisions. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not answer messages seeking comment on the filing. Mr. Trump and his advisers have defended his charitable practices in the past, noting that Mr. Trump has made significant donations personally and through the foundation. Lawyers for the foundation uploaded the tax filing on Friday to Guidestar, a national database of nonprofits, and it was then made publicly available, according to representatives from Guidestar. It is unclear whether the Internal Revenue Service has received the filings. The 2015 form showed that Mr. Trump donated a total of $616, 000 that year to his nonprofit foundation, his first contribution to it since 2008 and his largest donation in a decade. The payments were made through two Trump businesses: the Trump Corporation ($566, 000) and Trump Productions LLC ($50, 000). The next largest contribution that year was $150, 000 from a foundation connected to Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian steel magnate. Mr. Pinchuk has been a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, a relationship that drew scrutiny during the presidential campaign as an example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s complex ties to foreign business interests. Douglas E. Schoen, a senior adviser to the board of Mr. Pinchuk\u2019s foundation, said in an email that the payment to Mr. Trump\u2019s charity was \u201cin support of appearance he did by video link at a conference Mr. Pinchuk\u2019s foundation organizes every year in September in Kiev, Ukraine. \u201d Mr. Schoen said that Mr. Pinchuk and Mr. Trump had met many years ago in New York, prompting the invitation for Mr. Trump to speak at the September 2015 conference. He said the two did not have any business relationship. During the speech, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Pinchuk and Ukrainians, saying, \u201cYou have had to endure a tremendous amount, and I just think it is all going to work out well in the future for the Ukraine. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s charity reported paying out $896, 000 in grants for 2015, some of which was disclosed during the campaign. The donations included support for health causes like cancer research and the American Red Cross, as well as $50, 000 for the private school attended by Mr. Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron. In late September, Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, ordered the charity to cease   in the state after his office found that the foundation was not properly registered to solicit donations. Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office is currently investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation to determine whether it is in compliance with state laws.'"}, "time": 1742563295.439538}
