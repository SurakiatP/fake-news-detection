Unfortunately, it only gets worse as we age. This happens because the fluid (synovial fluid) in the joints reduces as we age. Reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis. \\nBut research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis. Build-up of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain. The build-up happens when the kidneys don\u2019t excrete enough uric acid. It can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast. Long-term build-up of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility. \\nSwitch to an Alkaline Diet \\nThere\u2019s been a never-ending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not. In fact, some experts have discredited them as useless. But what does research say? Well, this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine. On the other hand, researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid. \\nAnother study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body. And they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints. \\nNote that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal. \\nEat these alkaline foods \\nYou simply need to reduce intake of acidic foods and eat more alkaline foods. Alkaline foods are mostly vegetables and legumes. Red pepper'"}, "time": 1742562661.8117452}
