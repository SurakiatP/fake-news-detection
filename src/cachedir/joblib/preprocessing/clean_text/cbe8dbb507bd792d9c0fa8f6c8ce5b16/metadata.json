[\u201cThis Supreme Court pick was Obama\u2019s to make and it was stolen by Republicans. Democrats had better block this and demand a nom we approve,\u201d Moore tweeted to his 3. 8 million Twitter followers.  Moore continued, \u201cSenate Dems, let\u2019s be very clear: You will filibuster  block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election\u201d: This Supreme Court pick was Obama\u2019s to make and it was stolen by Republicans. Democrats had better block this and demand a nom we approve.  \u2014   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 1, 2017,  Senate Dems, let\u2019s be very clear: You will filibuster  block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election.  \u2014   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 1, 2017,  Moore\u2019s gripes invoke the liberal argument that Democrats should block the nomination of Trump\u2019s SCOTUS pick in the same way that Republicans halted Merrick Garland\u2019s hearings after Obama picked him to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death. One U. S. senator has already heeded Moore\u2019s demand that Democrats block Gorsuch\u2019s nomination proceedings. Senator Jeff Merkley took to Twitter Wednesday and said, \u201cNot only is this a stolen seat, but @realDonaldTrump has nominated a far right extremist. Unacceptable. \u201d Not only is this a stolen seat, but @realDonaldTrump has nominated a far right extremist. Unacceptable. https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) February 1, 2017,  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742628361.2937124}
