I think it\u2019s great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it\u2019s structurally sound.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think it has all been made by hand. It\u2019s part of our history, so it should be kept.\u201d \\nWhen he first started digging, the shelter was almost completely full of mud. After the area was cleaned out, Marks discovered glass bottles and old newspapers inside. \\nSince some of those newspapers were much more recent than World War II, you have to wonder what else has gone on down there. \\nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about this incredible discovery.
