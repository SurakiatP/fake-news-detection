[Ironically, just two days ago, Council President Donald Tusk criticized Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order putting a moratorium on new visas for nationals of seven particularly dangerous seedbeds of terrorism, calling the U. S. President a \u201cdemagogue\u201d who poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the EU.  And yet, Tusk seems to have taken a page from his namesake\u2019s recent actions, boldly proposing that the   route be \u201cclosed down. \u201d \u201cThe flow of migrants from Libya into Italy and the EU is not sustainable,\u201d Tusk said Thursday after a meeting in Brussels between European and Libyan officials. \u201cEurope has proved it is able to close down irregular routes of migration, as we did on the Eastern Mediterranean route,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cWe have discussed the example of our cooperation with Turkey and other countries in this part of the region. Now it is time to close down the route from Libya to Italy. \u201d Populist leaders in Europe were quick to highlight what they consider the hypocrisy of the Council President, who has tended to downplay Europe\u2019s migrant crisis. The Leader of Italy\u2019s Northern League Party, Matteo Salvini, challenged the EU official for his slowness to recognize the problem and his sudden   which occurred just after President Trump decided to draw a line in the sand on the problem of international terrorism and its links to migration. \u201cWhen we at the League said the same thing five years ago,\u201d Salvini asked, \u201cweren\u2019t we racists?\u201d referring to accusations leveled against the League for its warnings of the dangers of unchecked immigration. Libyan Prime Minister Fayez   who met the press together with Donald Tusk, said that the problem of illegal migration is \u201csomething dramatic\u201d and affects security, and social, economic and political stability. \u201cWe must find ways to deal with all these aspects of the phenomenon,\u201d   said, noting that migrants need to be held back \u201cin their countries of origin,\u201d before they embark on the dangerous journey toward Europe.
