He\u2019s heard that the author E. B. White\u2019s house is somewhere around here, and he\u2019s determined to find it. My mother, next to him in the passenger seat of our rusty gold station wagon with my baby sister on her lap, raises her eyebrows at my other two sisters and me,   in the second row. It\u2019s the early 70s, and seatbelts haven\u2019t caught on yet. We gaze back at her, knowing that once Dad gets an idea into his head, it\u2019s almost impossible to stop him. We range in age from 1 to 10 (I\u2019m the oldest) and all of us are literally and figuratively along for the ride. Besides, we\u2019re excited at the prospect of meeting this author we already feel we know. We\u2019ve been lulled to sleep every night by the soft cadence of my dad\u2019s Southern accent as he reads us stories about a wise spider and a hapless pig, a resourceful mouse and a mute swan. Dad pulls off the road into the dusty parking lot of a country store with a lone gas pump, and gets out of the car. We hear him chatting with the attendant through the open window. \u201cSure is nice around here. \u201d The guy shrugs. My sisters and I glance at each other. Rural Mainers tend to be   and   averse. But as usual, Dad doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cYou lived here long?\u201d \u201cAyuh. \u201d Amazingly, before long, and with only a little coaxing, the attendant is telling Dad about his grandkids and his lobster boat and pointing off into the distance, giving him the intel he\u2019s come for. \u201cMr. White lives right over that hill there. Privet hedge in front. Can\u2019t miss it. \u201d Back on the road, my sister Cynthia ventures, \u201cIsn\u2019t it rude to show up on someone\u2019s doorstep without asking?\u201d Dad grins and winks at us in the rearview mirror. \u201cHe\u2019ll be flattered. \u201d We pull up to the farmhouse to find a courtly   man trimming the hedge with a set of clippers. \u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d Dad whispers. He rolls down his window and leans out. \u201cHello, good sir!\u201d The man seems a little nonplused. \u201cI have a car full of young readers here who\u2019d give anything to meet their favorite author. A word from you, and they\u2019ll remember this moment for the rest of their lives. \u201d What choice does the poor man have? Within a few minutes, the famously reclusive E. B. White is demonstrating to a cluster of little girls in bathing suits that when you crush pine needles between your fingers and hold it to your nose, the smell is as strong as patchouli. And Dad is right  \u2014   we never will forget it. My childhood was rife with moments like this. Dad was always going out on a limb, befriending people who didn\u2019t necessarily seem to want new friends, trespassing on private property, pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior in quest of adventure. His philosophy was that you don\u2019t need money or plans, only a willingness to be present in the moment and to go where inspiration takes you. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll miss the entire point of being alive. Raised dirt poor in rural Georgia by a millworker mother and a father who often went to the bar rather than home after work, Dad learned early on that his quickest route up the social ladder was through charm and smarts. He got himself to college  \u2014   the first in his family  \u2014   on a football scholarship, then used seminary to springboard to a doctorate in a foreign land. As a young academic in the \u201860s, he grew to reject traditional values and had scant respect for the social codes of privilege. At parties, he could often be found talking to the bartender or a    Irish grandmother in the kitchen rather than the hosts. A Southerner through and through, even after moving to Maine, he was constitutionally incapable of walking down a street in New York without stopping to chat with doormen, bodega owners and homeless people. He never met a taxi driver whose story he didn\u2019t want to know. Dad\u2019s unorthodox and sometimes embarrassing friendliness got him, and us, into trouble now and then. Some people didn\u2019t take kindly to probing questions. Others found his   openness suspect or unsophisticated. But his innate, bottomless curiosity about the world also taught his four daughters to be open to new experiences and comfortable with improvisation. Even now, in his late 70s, he lives each day with a kind of purposeful recklessness, asking provocative questions and seeking new experiences in the belief that he can break through to something better, more meaningful, more satisfying. Though my parents had little money, they took us on adventures all over the world. Driving through Scotland in a rainstorm, we pulled over to the side of the road and rode the wild ponies grazing by the fence. We coaxed a stray lamb over to our rented R. V. to feed it. One year my father switched houses, cars, teaching jobs, committees and pets with a professor in Melbourne, Australia, sight unseen. Another year our family of six flew to Crete without a plan at the airport Dad bought a map and started asking random strangers, with the help of a woefully inadequate Greek phrase book: \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d \u201cWhere should we stay?\u201d This spontaneity meant that we missed flights, lost luggage, drove on perilous roads late at night, stayed in some   hovels, and sometimes went hungry. But it also yielded beautiful surprises: an undiscovered beach, a fisherman\u2019s hut with a breathtaking view, a hillside breakfast of goats\u2019 milk yogurt and fresh honey that I still remember 35 years later. It led to his daughters\u2019 sense of the world not as a huge frightening place but as a wonderland ripe for discovery. The Maine farmhouse in Andrew Wyeth\u2019s iconic painting \u201cChristina\u2019s World\u201d was not yet a museum or even open to the public when my father got it into his head  \u2014   soon after our ambush of E. B. White  \u2014   to take a family field trip there. Following his usual routine, he pulled into the small village of Cushing and asked a local how to find the Olson house. When we arrived (no doubt trespassing) we picnicked in the field where the woman in the pink dress in the painting had lain. Looking up at that weathered gray house on the hill, and hearing the story of the woman with my name who spent her lifetime there, I was entranced. Years later, I drew on that experience to tell my own story of the painting in my new book. There\u2019s no doubt that my dad\u2019s endless curiosity has shaped who I am. I often find myself  \u2014   to my own kids\u2019 embarrassment  \u2014   chatting with strangers in lines, accepting spontaneous invitations, and seeking     adventures. I think the most important thing I learned from my dad is that when you go out on a limb there\u2019s a risk it will break, but you\u2019ll get a whole new perspective on the world. And if you\u2019re really lucky, it can feel like flying.'"}, "time": 1742562787.6366491}
