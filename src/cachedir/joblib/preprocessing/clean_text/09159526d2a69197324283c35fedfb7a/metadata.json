We held our breath, waiting to see if he could walk, but Sherman spent all day pressed against the side of our little brown barn, head hanging, looking as if he\u2019d been led there for execution. On the outside, the neglected donkey looked better than he had a few evenings ago, when he shuffled off a trailer, lame and sick with matted fur. But now he needed to move, to walk, in order to survive. Whether he was frightened, or in pain, or just confused, we couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he isn\u2019t dead,\u201d a friend who raises sheep in upstate New York messaged after seeing a photo of Sherman. \u201cI have seen farmers here put down animals in far better shape. \u201d My wife, two girls and I left Sherman in peace, keeping an eye on him but trusting that for now, what he needed most after his liberation from years in a mucky stall and the   of his hoof trimming and   shearing was time to rest. Or so we hoped. Donkeys on deathwatch were way out of our very limited field of experience. We weren\u2019t animal people when we moved to Lancaster County, even though we\u2019d landed ourselves amongst Amish and Mennonite neighbors whose lives revolved around their herds. For the first three years we didn\u2019t even have a cat, and took one in only because she turned up at the back door. We edged our way into bigger creatures after Katie and Amos Stoltzfus, our closest Amish friends, told my   wife that sheep milk was easiest on the human stomach. We borrowed a pair of Katie\u2019s ewes for a few months, and then decided to start a little flock of our own. From sheep we had to progress to a pair of fainting goats, Chili Dog and Awesome Blossom, after discovering that the Falmouth Goat Race, one of America\u2019s weirdest and funnest throwback festivals, was almost in our backyard. So until Sherman arrived, our version of a farm was pretty much a   operation. Goats, dairy sheep and barn cats mostly look out for themselves, requiring little more than hay in winter and a regular squirt in the mouth of deworming paste. I had more trouble managing myself than them, like when I gave in to temptation and bought Lawrence, an adorable little Oberhasli goat whose poor ears had been deformed by frostbite. Only after I got home did I discover that they\u2019re famously strong jumpers who love to rocket over fences. Sure enough, we were soon being woken at 5 in the morning by neighbors pounding on the back door after swerving to avoid the furry doofus in the middle of the road. It was hard to stay mad at Lawrence, though, because his breakouts seemed less about freedom and more about friendship. Whenever I shuffled out to haul him in, he\u2019d come trotting right up as if wondering where I\u2019d been all morning. But sweet as he was, I was worried about mixing Lawrence with Sherman. I wanted to surround Sherman with the comfort of a herd as soon as possible, but I couldn\u2019t tell if Lawrence would be perfect for the job or a disaster. His friendliness can freak out kids and other animals, especially when he forgets he\u2019s got two giant bone spears on his head. His bounding welcome can look like an attack, especially to other males. Chili Dog, our other billy goat, has learned to mostly ignore him, but I had my doubts about an   donkey. I kept Sherman on his own all day, thinking he\u2019d settle in more easily and begin to explore his new home, but by nightfall he still hadn\u2019t budged. I decided to bring the other animals back from the pasture, hoping they\u2019d be in such a hurry to get into the barn that they\u2019d barely notice the stranger. Maybe they\u2019d smell the new presence in their midst overnight and be adjusted to it by sunrise. It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but the sheep were down with it. When I opened the gate, they breezed straight past Sherman and into the stalls with Lawrence galumphing along behind. Suddenly Lawrence stopped: head high, on alert. He pivoted toward Sherman, who was now cornered against the barn wall, and began sniffing him from head to tail. Sherman remained frozen, even when the points of Lawrence\u2019s horns were right in his face. Lawrence\u2019s next move won my forgiveness for all his escapes: Instead of joining the other animals inside, he lay down at Sherman\u2019s feet. When I came out the next morning, Lawrence was still by Sherman\u2019s side. It was more than just heartwarming if Lawrence\u2019s friendship could get Sherman to move and eat, it could keep him alive. I put out some hay and Lawrence, that chowhound, bolted for breakfast. Sherman took a few tentative steps to follow. He didn\u2019t eat, probably because the sheep were charging around the feeder like sharks attacking chum, but wherever Lawrence went, Sherman was close behind. The rest of the day, they were inseparable. By evening, Sherman was joining the rest of the gang at the hay feeder. Over the next few days our   friend, Tanya, stopped by repeatedly to check Sherman\u2019s progress. She fed him   deworming paste, and brought over an equine dentist who pulled Sherman\u2019s rotten teeth and estimated by their growth that he was only 8, shockingly young for a donkey who seemed 80. But his feet, at least, were looking hopeful. \u201cHe\u2019s moving well,\u201d Tanya said. \u201cA lot better than I expected. \u201d But when we tried to lead Sherman out for a walk, he refused to leave the grass. Getting Sherman to step confidently onto hard surfaces was essential to my plan for his recovery. Tanya, who is as close to a donkey whisperer as you\u2019ll ever find, knew that for Sherman to heal, he needed a job, a sense of purpose. I wanted to turn him into a runner. Maybe one day, I could even lead him to the starting line of a pack burro race. Legend has it that the sport was born in the Gold Rush, when prospectors ran alongside their pack animals to register their claims. A few Colorado miners in the 1940s began racing their burros from Leadville to Fairplay along mountain trails that were 13, 000 feet high and 30 miles long. Other towns got in on the action until, at the peak of burro mania in the 1980s, a top racer could live off nothing but prize money from a dozen races in three states. Recently   has been on the rise, partly because it attracts athletes craving a test as demanding as an Ironman triathlon. \u201cTo me, the really interesting challenge is working with a large animal that can run any second, any day, any week, faster than any human on earth,\u201d says Hal Walter, a sub 2:40 marathoner who left roadrunning to become a   winner of the World Championship Pack Burro Race in Fairplay, Colo. Training Sherman to race with me could be the perfect thing to help him heal and learn to trust again. The rules of burro racing are simple: You have to be accompanied by a donkey, which you cannot ride. You can use any kind of donkey (or burro, since they\u2019re the same thing) but mules are a   hybrid and therefore forbidden. It\u2019s a lot like running with any other buddy, assuming you\u2019ve got the kind of friends who occasionally freeze in their tracks, bolt for the hills, and kick you in the face. \u201cHe won\u2019t set foot on anything hard, though,\u201d I told Tanya. \u201cHe won\u2019t even step on gravel in the driveway. \u201d \u201cThat might be his brain, not his feet,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no idea what kind of life he\u2019s had. There could be a lot of trauma between those ears that needs to be unpacked. Let\u2019s try something. Go get that goat he likes. \u201d I fetched Lawrence and snapped a leash on his collar. Lawrence is always up for an adventure, especially when it might involve a treat, so he walked eagerly at my side. \u201cBring him out here to the road,\u201d Tanya called, \u201cand let\u2019s see if Sherman follows. \u201d As Lawrence and I approached the pasture gate, Sherman\u2019s head jerked up. He began to follow, quick and anxious. Suddenly, he broke into a canter and ran past us. He stopped right in front of the gate, blocking it so we couldn\u2019t get past and out to the road. Check mate. He gazed off innocently, as if he\u2019d ended up there by accident. \u201cShermie, you rock star!\u201d Tanya shouted. \u201cAll messed up but wicked smart. Dude, he\u2019s like the \u2018Good Will Hunting\u2019 of donkeys. \u201d She quieted down and gazed at Sherman, thinking. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d I asked her. \u201cDo you think I can turn Sherman into a racing donkey?\u201d \u201cNow that,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be amazing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628451.3572614}
