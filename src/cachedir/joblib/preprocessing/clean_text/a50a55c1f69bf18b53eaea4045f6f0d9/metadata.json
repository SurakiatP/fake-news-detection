The audience at the event was rough on the first daughter when she spoke favorably about her father, but she powered through to present the Trump family\u2019s viewpoint on the world stage. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of my father\u2019s advocacy \u2014  long before he came to the presidency but during the campaign, including in the primaries, he\u2019s been a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive,\u201d she said. She also added during the panel that her father always treated women and men equally, and that \u201cthere was no difference\u201d between the way he treated her and the way he treated her brothers Donald, Jr. and Eric. \u201cAs a daughter, I can speak on a very personal level,\u201d she added. \u201cI grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do he provided that for us. \u201d And she praised her father for empowering women in his administration. \u201cThe team basically going through the vetting and hiring process  \u2014   six out of eight of those people are women,\u201d Ivanka Trump said. During the campaign, in Pennsylvania, Ivanka appeared alongside her father to roll out the  \u2019s childcare and maternity leave policy platforms. Ivanka Trump told Breitbart News at the event in Aston, Pennsylvania, in September 2016, in an exclusive interview: One of the major elements is allowing for the cost of child care to be tax deductible for up to four children, and it\u2019s based on the average cost of child care in that person\u2019s state. If you don\u2019t pay taxes, then there\u2019s an expansion of the existing Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014  so you get an additional refund for that. This is not only for child care but also for dependent care. Women are predominantly caregivers so that\u2019s why this is most beneficial for women, but it\u2019s also about helping American families. She also said there would be the creation of Dependent Care Savings Accounts to help with childcare: Secondly, there is the creation of a Dependent Care Savings Account (DCSA) \u2014  which is effectively like a Healthcare Savings Account (HSA) \u2014  to allow people to save   dollars, make contributions, and if you\u2019re a low income person the government will actually match up to 50 percent of the first $1, 000 contributed with a cap of $2, 000 per year. It rolls over, it can be used for school choice, and it\u2019s sort of an expansion of the school choice program in that this money can be used towards that, it can be used for adult daycare if you\u2019re caring for an adult dependent, or for   enrichment activities so it\u2019s a great way to incentivize people to save. All of this and more, she added then in that September 2016 interview with Breitbart News, was part of a \u201cfresh perspective\u201d a Trump presidency would bring to the table. \u201cOne of the great promises of a Trump presidency is bringing new solutions, fresh perspective to the table in a way that, unfortunately, we haven\u2019t had the benefit of for a very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is one more example of that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628531.7350917}
