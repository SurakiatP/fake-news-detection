K. to sing along?\u201d The answer, from Sheree Marlowe, the new chief diversity officer at Clark University, is an unequivocal \u201cno. \u201d The exchange was included in Ms. Marlowe\u2019s presentation to recently arriving   students focusing on subtle \u201cmicroaggressions,\u201d part of a new campus vocabulary that also includes \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings. \u201d Microaggressions, Ms. Marlowe said, are comments, snubs or insults that communicate derogatory or negative messages that might not be intended to cause harm but are targeted at people based on their membership in a marginalized group. Among her other tips: Don\u2019t ask an Asian student you don\u2019t know for help on your math homework or randomly ask a black student if he plays basketball. Both questions make assumptions based on stereotypes. And don\u2019t say \u201cyou guys. \u201d It could be interpreted as leaving out women, said Ms. Marlowe, who realized it was offensive only when someone confronted her for saying it during a presentation. Clark, a private liberal arts college that has long prided itself on diversity and inclusion, is far from the only university stepping up discussions of racism and diversity in orientation programs this year. Once devoted to ice cream socials, tutorials on campus technology systems and advice on choosing classes, orientation for new students is changing significantly, with the issue taking on renewed urgency this year as universities increasingly try to address recent racial and ethnic tensions on campuses as well as an onslaught of sexual assault complaints. In addition to diversity sessions, many campuses train students on exactly what constitutes sexual consent as well as how to intervene when they see fellow students drinking excessively or poised to engage in nonconsensual sexual behavior. A bystander intervention presentation for arriving freshmen at Wesleyan University last Thursday  \u2014   \u201cWe Speak We Stand\u201d  \u2014   featured students acting out fictional episodes of campus sexual violence, harassment and problematic drinking, with examples of how to intervene. \u201cEach of you has the power to bring to light sexual violence in our community,\u201d one student told the group. Fresh on the minds of university officials are last year\u2019s highly publicized episodes involving racist taunts at the University of Missouri  \u2014   which appear to have contributed to a precipitous decline in enrollment there this fall. \u201cThat closes your doors,\u201d said Archie Ervin, the vice president for institute diversity at Georgia Institute of Technology and president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. \u201cIf you have sustained enrollment drops and disproportionately   students such as    the state legislature can\u2019t make up the gap. \u201d At the University of   officials have put together a diversity presentation as a pilot program this year for 1, 000 freshmen  \u2014   whom some colleges refer to with the   term   students. That program, expected to cost $150, 000 to $200, 000, follows incidents on campus last year. In one, a racist note was slipped under a black student\u2019s door, prompting Patrick Sims, the university\u2019s vice provost for diversity and climate, to post an emotional video on YouTube titled \u201cEnough Is Enough. \u201d Lori Berquam, the university\u2019s dean of students, said in an interview that the sessions would try to address the fact that some students in Wisconsin, a predominantly white state, had little exposure to people of other races until they got to Madison. \u201cIt would not be   for a student to join us from the state of Wisconsin having had zero people of color in their high school,\u201d Dr. Berquam said. In August, the University of Wisconsin system, which includes the Madison flagship and 25 other campuses, said it would ask the State Legislature for $6 million in funding to improve what it called the \u201cuniversity experience\u201d for students. The request includes money for Fluent, a program described as a systemwide cultural training for faculty and staff members and students. But that budget request has provoked controversy. \u201cIf only the taxpayers and   families had a safe space that might protect them from wasteful U. W. System spending on political correctness,\u201d State Senator Stephen L. Nass, a Republican, said in a statement issued by his office, urging his fellow lawmakers to vote against the appropriation. Mr. Nass\u2019s objection to spending money on diversity training reflects a rising resistance to what is considered campus political correctness. At some universities, alumni and students have objected to a variety of campus measures, including diversity training \u201csafe spaces,\u201d places where students from marginalized groups can gather to discuss their experiences and \u201ctrigger warnings,\u201d disclaimers about possibly upsetting material in lesson plans. Some graduates have curtailed donations, and students have suggested that diversity training smacks of some sort of Communist   program. The backlash was exemplified recently in a widely publicized letter sent to new freshmen at the University of Chicago by the dean of students, John Ellison. He warned that the university did not \u201csupport   trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own. \u201d Still, the push to respond to complaints about subtle cultural insensitivity, as well as more overt racist behavior, continues on campuses across the country. About 75 chief diversity officers have been hired by colleges and universities in the past 18 months, according to Dr. Ervin\u2019s organization. Ms. Marlowe, a lawyer who most recently was diversity officer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was also recruited by two other colleges this year before settling at Clark, a manicured campus of about 3, 000 students an hour west of Boston in this heavily   city. Her   presentation on Aug. 27 aimed to help students identify microaggressions and to teach them how to intervene when they observe one. Microaggressions can be verbal, nonverbal or environmental, she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s an environmental microaggression?\u201d Ms. Marlowe asked the auditorium of about 525 new students. She gave an example. \u201cOn your first day of class, you enter the chemistry building and all of the pictures on the wall are scientists who are white and male,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a female, or you just don\u2019t identify as a white male, that space automatically shows that you\u2019re not represented. \u201d A nonverbal microaggression could be when a white woman clutches her purse as a black or Latino person approaches. Another subset of microaggression is known as the microinvalidation, which includes comments suggesting that race plays a minor role in life\u2019s outcomes, like \u201cEveryone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough. \u201d For Clark students like Noelia Martinez, a Massachusetts resident who was born in Puerto Rico to Dominican parents, the session was an epiphany. \u201cIt helped me understand what I\u2019ve been going through all of my life, basically,\u201d she said, describing how she had endured stinging comments such as \u201cYou\u2019re a really good student for a Hispanic. \u201d But Ms. Martinez, a sophomore transfer student, also realized that she, too, was guilty of microaggressions, because she frequently uses the phrase \u201cyou guys,\u201d she said. \u201cThis helped me see that I\u2019m a microaggressor, too. \u201d The presentation elicited a lively    session, during which students asked about the N word, discrimination against white people and men, and the definition of \u201cAsian. \u201d Ms. Marlowe said she questioned the validity of the concept of reverse racism, arguing that racism is a system in which a dominant race benefits from the oppression of others. But some students appeared slightly confused. \u201cWhen you use the term \u2018 \u2019 as a white woman, are you saying that you can choose your race?\u201d one white male student asked. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an example,\u201d Ms. Marlowe said. \u201cI went to a conference. I was talking to this man. I thought he was black. I was talking about diversity and social justice. \u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m Cuban,\u2019\u201d Ms. Marlowe told the crowd. \u201cI assumed he was black because he was the same skin complexion as me, and the same type of hair. \u201d But, Ms. Marlowe said, while it is sometimes difficult to identify a person\u2019s racial or ethnic background based on appearance, she does not believe that gives license to people like Rachel A. Dolezal, the white woman who claimed to be   while working for the N. A. A. C. P. in Spokane, Wash. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re black if you\u2019re not, historically. \u201d The student still seemed confused. \u201cMaybe we can unpack it afterward,\u201d Ms. Marlowe told the student. \u201cYou want to come see me afterward?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628407.5278447}
