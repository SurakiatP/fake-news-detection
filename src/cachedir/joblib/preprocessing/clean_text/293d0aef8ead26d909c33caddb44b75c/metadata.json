According to experts , the position of the South Pole has shifted and is not located precisely at Antarctica, the North Pole is also believed to be \u2018racing\u2019 across the Arctic Ocean. Earth\u2019s magnetic field appears to be collapsing which could severely damage our climate and WIPE OUT power grids across the world. \\nOur planet\u2019s magnetic field exists because Earth has a massive \u2018ball of iron\u2019 at its core which is surrounded by an outer layer of molten metal.\\nAs the earth\u2019s magnetic field varies over time, the positions of the north and south magnetic poles gradually change. The magnetic declination at a given location also changes over time. As it turns out a lot has changed in the last couple of hundred years, and to see what we are taking about visit NOAA and take a look at Historical Magnetic Declination .\\n\\nInterestingly, according to previous studies, Earth\u2019s magnetic field \u2013 which shields our planet from blasts of deadly solar radiation has dangerously weakened in the last couple of years.\\nAccording to reports from the European Space Agency , the biggest weak spots seen in the magnetic field are located in the western hemisphere.\\nExperts are unsure why the magnetic field is weakening but one of the MOST LIKELY reasons is that our planets magnetic poles are getting ready to flip said Rune Floberghagen, the ESA\u2019s Swarm mission manager.\\nResearchers have concluded that the magnetic field had diminished at a rate of around five percent per century. However, new studies who that the magnetic field is weakening at an accelerated rate of five percent per decade \u2013meaning that it is deteriorating five times faster than previously believed.\\nIf we take a look at the animation of secular variation in geomagnetic total intensity for the last 400 years, we will see that the magnetic field began weakening in 1600 .\\nAnimation of secular variation in geomagnetic total intensity for the last 400 years: \\nFurthermore, the magnetic field weakened a staggering 10 percent from the 1800\u2019s to 2000.\\nOk so\u2026 what would happen if it really flips? According to experts, if the pole switch does happen the entire planet and everything on it will become exposed to solar winds which could punch giant holes into the ozone layer which in turn could have a devastating effect on mankind. If the planet\u2019s Magnetosphere starts collapsing power grids could collapse, the weather would abruptly change and humans would have serious health risks.\\nAccording to reports from the European Space Agency, as of 2014 the magnetic field is continuing to weaken rapidly . With the help of SWARM, scientists have obtained unprecedented insights into the complex workings of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Reports show that the general trend of the magnetic field is weakening and the most dramatic declines are present over the Western Hemisphere.\\n\\nThe latest measurements also confirm the movement of magnetic North towards Siberia. It is believed that the magnetic field is speeding away at a rate of about 40 miles per year.\\nBut what is most terrifying is perhaps a study that warns that magnetic reversals lead to extinction events. The highlights of the study indicate :\\nGeomagnetic field reversal substantially weakens the protection for the atmosphere. Solar wind energizes more oxygen ions to escape when geomagnetic field is weakened. Oxygen escape may explain the drop of atmospheric level during mass extinction. The causal relation between reversal and mass extinction should be \u201cmany-to-one\u201d. The simulated oxygen escape rate based on knowledge of Mars support our hypothesis. Furthermore, it is believed that magnetic reversals can be responsible for floods of biblical proportions as you can see in the video below:\\n\\nSource: EWAO \\nRelated: The White House Just Issued An Executive Order officially Preparing For The \u201cEvent?\u201d \u2014 Geomagnetic \u201cCollapse\u201d and Storms 1 Day Later New Shocking Evidence Points to Pole Shift Inuit Elders tell NASA Earth Axis Shifted Ancient Huts May Reveal Clues to Earth\u2019s Magnetic Pole Reversals The Sun\u2019s Mysterious Tilt Gets A Surprising Explanation Astronomers point to Planet Nine Mysterious Planet Nine Might Explain Tilt in Solar System '"}, "time": 1742564534.4872985}
