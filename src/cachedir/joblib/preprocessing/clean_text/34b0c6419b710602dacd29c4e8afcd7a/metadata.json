There were no barriers to keep people off the street, and they swarmed forward, tossing flowers onto the hearse. A gently chaotic decorum prevailed: Riding with the windows down, people in the limousines accompanying the hearse  \u2014   including members of the Ali family, the actor Will Smith and the mayor, Greg Fischer  \u2014   slapped hands with the spectators as they passed. The procession, more celebratory than somber, past his pink boyhood home and the museum and conference center that bear his name, wove 19 miles through the city to Cave Hill Cemetery, where Ali, who died last week at age 74, was buried in a private service. \u201cMuhammad wants young people to know that adversity can make you stronger,\u201d his wife, Lonnie, said later at a memorial service packed with dignitaries, taking stock of his bouts in and out of the ring. \u201cIt cannot rob you of the power to reach your dreams. \u201d She added, \u201cIt is far more difficult to sacrifice oneself in the name of peace than to take up arms in the name of violence. \u201d At a time of controversy over police shootings of young black people, Lonnie Ali recalled that Muhammad Ali got into boxing at the age of 12, after his bicycle was stolen. A white police officer taking the report suggested he learn to fight if he wanted to confront the person who took it. \u201cAmerica must never forget, when a cop and an inner city kid talk to each other, miracles can happen,\u201d she said. President Bill Clinton alluded to Ali\u2019s long fight with Parkinson\u2019s disease, recalling the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta when Ali, with trembling arms from the ailment, lit the torch to open the games. \u201cBesides being a lot of fun to be around and being a universal soldier for our common humanity, I will always think of him as a truly free man of faith, and being a man of faith, he realized he\u2019d never be in full control of his life,\u2019\u2019 Clinton said. \u201cSomething like Parkinson\u2019s could come along. But being free, he realized that life was still open to choices. It\u2019s the choices that Muhammad Ali made that brought us all here today in honor and love. \u201d Before they spoke, a diverse group of religious leaders at a memorial service later offered prayers, remembrances of Ali and, at times, pointed political remarks. The Rev. Kevin Cosby of St. Stephen Church in Louisville took note of the racial pride Ali instilled in African Americans, particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s. \u201cHe dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cHe dared to affirm the beauty of blackness, he dared to affirm the power and the capacity of  . He dared to love America\u2019s most unloved race. \u201d Drawing rousing cheers, Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine and a liberal activist, declared, in what appeared to be a reference to   rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail, \u201cWe will not allow politicians to put down Muslims, to blame Muslims for a few people. \u201d Long before the remarks, and eulogies by other speakers, including President Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal, and Bryant Gumbel, the motorcade offered a chance for Ali to be cheered and honored in the city where he grew up and never seemed to forget. Some of Ali\u2019s opponents joined in. On Broadway in downtown Louisville, people were startled to see Larry Holmes, who beat Ali in February 1980, being led along the sidewalk outside the Brown Hotel with a young man at his elbow. Mr. Holmes smiled and said little as he shook hands and handed out signed picture cards.   lined up eight and 10 deep along both sides of Broadway stretching for blocks. Office workers streamed from their desks to stand vigil as the procession neared and passed. The motorcade, which included more than a dozen vehicles, headed into the largely   neighborhood where Ali spent his formative years. There, in the parking lot of the Liquor Zone, nearly everyone seemed to have a story about either meeting Ali, or being inspired by him. Robert Mitchem, known as \u201cFroot Loop\u201d because people mistakenly think he likes that cereal, set up a shirt stand with two friends early in the morning. Mitchem wanted to be ready for the     chance to commemorate the city\u2019s most famous son, and make a few bucks at it. \u201cFruit\u201d or \u201cFruity,\u201d as Mitchem is also known, had an array of different colored   with Ali\u2019s picture and his most famous catchphrases, like \u201cFloat like a Butterfly, sting like a bee. \u201d \u201cI hope to sell all of them, and when I die, I hope someone is going to have my name on a shirt, too,\u201d he said with a chuckle. At $15, the shirts, which Mitchem makes with a silk screen and heat press in the basement of his home, were a relative bargain, and word in the neighborhood was out. First a handful and then a torrent of customers came to buy the shirts. Then they opened lawn chairs, bottles of water and other, stronger beverages and awaited the   heavyweight champion. \u201cHe was a dignitary from the sports world who traveled the globe, but he never forgot where he came from,\u201d said Wayne Simon, 72, who remembers Ali visiting their alma mater, Central High School, after he won a gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. Despite the searing sun and rising temperatures, the several hundred people assembled in and around the parking lot celebrated Ali anew. Donald \u201cDoc\u201d Burress, 63, remembers as a kid crowding around his family\u2019s    television to watch Ali knock out Sonny Liston. \u201cWhat he did for Louisville, he was our spokesman,\u201d Burress said, his daughter and two grandchildren sitting by his side. \u201cHe was bigger than Churchill Downs,\u201d the famed horse racing track that hosts the Kentucky Derby. Thalisa Price, who wore a leather vest with her nickname, \u201cMs. Lovely,\u201d stitched on the back, wanted to buy an Ali shirt before leaving for Memphis on Saturday with her motorcycle club, the Naptown Riders. \u201cI\u2019m going to wear this shirt to let people know we\u2019re from Louisville,\u201d she said. Eventually, the police closed traffic on Broadway and helicopters circled above the big intersection. The crowds on every corner swelled further. One fan who held a pair a red boxing gloves yelled, \u201cCome on, Champ, take your time. We ain\u2019t gonna see you no more. \u201d A few minutes later, the motorcade arrived and, as in downtown, Ali\u2019s fans rushed into the street. The procession passed, heading toward the boxer\u2019s childhood home on Grand Avenue. People started folding their lawn chairs and heading back to their own homes. Mitchem, though, still had work to do. Having sold more than 10 dozen shirts, he was going to rush home and print some more. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sent chills through me because it was like pure love. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561809.2866}
