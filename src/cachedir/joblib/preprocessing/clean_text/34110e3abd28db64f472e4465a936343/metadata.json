This is not a product of the administration,\u201d the Speaker told MSNBC. The draft order \u201cis not a White House document,\u201d added White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday, adding, \u201cI have no idea where it came from. \u201d Despite the denials from the White House and Speaker Ryan, NYT, citing unnamed Trump administration officials, maintains that the debunked document is legit and suggests President Trump is poised to lift the Barack   ban on   \u201cblack site\u201d prisons overseas used to hold terrorism suspects. The alleged draft order \u201craised the prospect of reviving C. I. A. \u201cblack site\u201d prisons like those where terrorism suspects were once detained and tortured  \u2014   has the potential to further fracture a national security team already divided over one of the most controversial policies of the    era,\u201d reports the Times. NYT adds: The White House disclaimed the document, which was leaked to The New York Times and other news organizations, but three [Trump] administration officials said the White House had circulated it among National Security Council staff members for review on Tuesday morning. And many of its proposals  \u2014   which also include halting transfers out of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison and sending new detainees there, which President Barack Obama refused to do  \u2014   echo years of Republican national security policy and President Trump\u2019s own speeches. But Mr. Trump\u2019s most extreme campaign proposal for terrorism suspects  \u2014   bringing back torture, which the draft order does not call for but hovers over in its direction to review reinstating a C. I. A. interrogation program  \u2014   has been disavowed by senior members of his team  \u2026     Although NYT implies that President Trump is trying to bring back torture, it acknowledges, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s order says no detainee should be tortured or otherwise subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment \u2018as prescribed by U. S. law. \u2019\u201d The debunked document is littered with edits, typos, and revisions, misstating that the   attacks occurred a decade later. \u201cOur Nation remains engaged in a global armed conflict with ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other associated international jihadist Islamist terrorist groups,\u201d states the document. \u201cThis conflict is not of our choosing, but was declared against us by the jihadist terrorist organizations groups that have plotted and carried out mass attacks against the United States, its citizens, and its allies beginning well before the atrocities of September 11, 2011, and continuing to this day. \u201d NYT eventually acknowledged the errors, reporting, \u201cIt contained   phrases and typos. It said that the Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2011, rather than a decade earlier. It was clearly not meant for public consumption. \u201d Nevertheless, the Times, citing BuzzFeed, doubled down on its assertion that the debunked document suggests President Trump is trying to bring back   \u201cblack site\u201d prisons. \u201cA draft executive order reviving   detention and interrogation policies that circulated on Wednesday is a revised version of the \u2018most comprehensive\u2019 executive action on the topic proposed for the first 100 days of a Mitt Romney White House,\u201d reports BuzzFeed, citing an unnamed source. \u201cThe original text of the document was prepared in September 2012 by   candidate Romney\u2019s legal and policy advisers as a potential executive order, according to a source familiar with the document who provided it to BuzzFeed News and metadata accessible in the document,\u201d it adds.'"}, "time": 1742564264.6825583}
