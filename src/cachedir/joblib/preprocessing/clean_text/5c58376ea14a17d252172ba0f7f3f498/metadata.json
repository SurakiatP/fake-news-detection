For whatever reason (trolling?), the Washington Post recently asked the quitting snow grifter to write an op-ed piece on the significance of Hillary Clinton being picked as the first woman president should she win the Nov. 8 election. Palin was among a number of women invited to write pieces reflecting, in some personal way, on the meaning and significance of the election of the first woman as president. \\n\u201cObviously, a Clinton victory is not assured,\u201d cautioned Michael Larabee, the op-ed editor for the Washington Post . \u201cBut we\u2019re hoping to gather the essays in advance so we can share them quickly if she is elected.\u201d \\nThis is when the verbal diarrhea really hit the floor. She took her word salad game to new heights : \\nMedia mocks Trump\u2019s \u201crigged election\u201d warning to its own peril. \\nMore evidence in my inbox, this time from the Washington Post requesting I write an op-ed commemorating their coronation of Hillary \u2013 10 days from now. This is hilarious! \\nGood ol\u2019 reliable WaPo \u2013 continuing its embarrassing fail that\u2019s reminiscent of their forced correction after irresponsibly, absurdly claiming I joined Al Jazera; announcing to the world their goal was to not mention my name in print for an entire month (oh, what a blessed month that was!) and relentlessly suggesting my (and other Conservatives) irrelevancy in national discourse \u2013 assuming I\u2019d participate in their in-the-tank shenanigans for the Globalists. \\nNo, Mr. WaPo Editor, can\u2019t say I\u2019m interested in writing for you. But I\u2019d love a copy of your pre-printed post-election edition shipped to me in Alaska. Your bold \u201cClinton Defeats Trump\u201d headline will be framed right next to another old rag we\u2019re all familiar with\u2026 \\nThere has to be a statute of limitation on the victim card, which Sarah has been using for 8 years. Ever since she lost, it\u2019s been one aggrevieved statement after another. Now she is doing double duty: Falsely claiming the Washington Post is \u201ccoronating\u201d Hillary (they weren\u2019t) and falsely claiming they are out to get her (they aren\u2019t). \\nFeatured image via screen capture Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563564.2689266}
