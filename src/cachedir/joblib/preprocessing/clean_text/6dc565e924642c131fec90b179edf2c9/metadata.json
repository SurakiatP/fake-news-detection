Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything. Likewise with AMC\u2019s \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d set in the 1980s at the advent of the   revolution. When the series began two years ago, it was another   chasing a trend  \u2014   in this case, the   antihero. Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace) a mysterious,   drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy) a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an   Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth. But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost   in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination. And \u201cHalt\u201d would have been as well, had it not rebooted  itself. The outstanding second season latched on to a much more powerful idea. The 1980s, it said, were not the decade of a mechanical revolution but a cultural one. The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the   change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live. Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9) and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis) an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer. For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.) This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a   industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component  \u2014   its chat rooms  \u2014   was the future of the future. Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s   process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate   trades  \u2014   shades of Craigslist or eBay.) The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and   world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist. \u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish) a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor. Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a   firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth? \u201d) Joe\u2019s   as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty,   elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print. Joe 3. 0 is also a prelude to the fatuous moguls of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d to which \u201cHalt\u201d is a temporal and tonal bookend. Where \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d is a gleeful satire about business people feigning idealism  \u2014   all that   about changing the world  \u2014   \u201cHalt\u201d is an empathetic drama about idealists trying to fake their way into business. The new season begins to give you some sense of how we got from there to here. We see the same scrambles to get   advantage, the pilgrimages up and down Sand Hill Road seeking venture capital. But where \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d trades in decacorns (  valued at over $10 billion) it\u2019s jarring in \u201cHalt\u201d to see deals done for six figures  \u2014   not even Dr. Evil money. The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.) But any   period piece can recreate bygone days. \u201cHalt\u201d lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change. The real product in its tech business isn\u2019t hardware or software  \u2014   it\u2019s tomorrow, and \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d makes its past future feel dewy and new.'"}, "time": 1742561731.2159042}
