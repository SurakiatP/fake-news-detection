[\u201cWhen you look at the sculptures we have in the park and city in Stockholm, you see men on horses and other men,\u201d choreographer Anna K\u00e4llblad told SVT. \u201cStatues of women tend to be naked, and quite small. \u201d  The group \u2018galloped\u2019 past the Royal Palace, Humleg\u00e5rden, Royal Garden, and Gustav Adolf\u2019s Square, pausing at statues, where participants \u201csnorted\u201d kicked, and flicked their hair in an attempt to mimic equine behaviour. Hoping that \u2018City Horses\u2019 could start a debate about men and women in public space, artist Helena Bystr\u00f6m said the \u201cfeminist dance gallop\u201d acted as a necessary \u201ccounterweight to the great hordes of men who take up room in the city in different ways\u201d. Statues of men from Swedish history on horseback are outdated, and their presence overpowers Stockholm with \u201cthe male gaze and the idea of male power\u201d according to K\u00e4llblad. \u201cOur performance is a fun way to confront it,\u201d the choreographer told Svenska Dagbladet, describing the group as \u201cliving sculptures\u201d. \u201cHorses are a symbol of power, but at the same time they represent equestrianism and dance   \u2014   both female activities which are often marginalised. \u201cAnd just like the female body, horses can symbolise both the restrained and the wild,\u201d said K\u00e4llblad, remarking that \u201c\u2018City Horses\u2019 poses viewers the question of how women can occupy the public domain without being objectified. \u201d The idea that men occupy public spaces at the expense of women is a key theme of feminism in Sweden. Its environment minister announced in March that the country should reduce the number of cars on the road because male drivers outnumber women. \u201cCars are driven largely by men so by giving a lot of space to cars we\u2019re giving a lot of space to men  \u2014   at the expense of women,\u201d she explained.'"}, "time": 1742628507.7887337}
