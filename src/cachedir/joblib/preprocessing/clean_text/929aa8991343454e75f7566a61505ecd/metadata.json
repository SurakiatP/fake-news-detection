Ambassador John Bolton said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to hear National Security Adviser Mike Flynn\u2019s statement that Iran has been \u201cput on notice\u201d for its ballistic missile launches and other provocations. [\u201cI think it\u2019s the first time in eight years that anybody has really said to Iran what needs to be said,\u201d Bolton told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.   \u201cI think it demonstrates a couple of things: Number one, that the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal, agreed to in the summer of 2015, is in deep trouble. I think that\u2019s what being put officially \u2018on notice\u2019 means. Because this latest ballistic missile launch by the Iranians was a violation of the agreement, although the wording is weak and ambiguous, thanks to John Kerry, there\u2019s no doubt this is unacceptable behavior by Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also sends the political signal to America\u2019s allies, as well, that any notion that we will simply continue to accept this deal as written is something they need to dismiss,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s the kind of   that helps clarify the situation with friends and adversaries alike. \u201d \u201cThis deal was a strategic mistake when it was made. It\u2019s not gotten any better with age,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be unambiguous when a mistake like this is made. Even though Iran has benefited from the deal  \u2014   the release of sanctions, unfreezing of $150 billion of their assets  \u2014   it\u2019s just an example of how bad the deal was for the United States. Iran gets the goodies up front, and its obligations only came down the road. \u201d  \u201cBut nonetheless, because I think they\u2019re already in violation of the deal, and I think there\u2019s evidence to show that, we need to get on with the business of looking and talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel when he arrives in a couple of weeks and our friends in the Arab world who see the Iranian nuclear threat as a direct threat to them, not just a threat to us,\u201d he advised. Marlow turned to President Trump\u2019s executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from seven   nations and asked if Bolton thought the rollout of this order has been \u201c . \u201d \u201cWell,   is a very diplomatic way to put it,\u201d Bolton told Marlow. \u201cYou have a future at the State Department if you want one at some point. \u201d \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a compliment, actually,\u201d Bolton said with a laugh. On a more serious note, he said things were left out of the executive order that he thinks should have been included, \u201cfor example, making it clear that green card holders were not subject to it. \u201d \u201cOther exceptions were put in. This one was not,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe all know the Trump administration wants to give refugee status to, like Iraqis, former interpreters who helped us out during the Iraq conflict. I think that added to the confusion and the publicity. \u201d \u201cBut honestly, this is going to be controversial even if those steps had been corrected. What I don\u2019t understand is why the White House wasn\u2019t more prepared for the fury of opposition that met it. It\u2019s not like this wasn\u2019t an issue during the campaign. It\u2019s not like it wasn\u2019t highlighted,\u201d he said.  \u201cLook, it\u2019s a bump in the road. I\u2019ve been through transitions coming in and going out through the government. The first couple of months at the White House always have rocky periods. The real consequence here is that they learn from it, and I\u2019m comfortable that they will,\u201d said Bolton. He agreed with Marlow\u2019s suggestion that despite all the hysteria around the supposedly draconian executive order, it did not go far enough in certain ways. \u201cIt\u2019s very limited, and I think, in fact, if people read the executive order, they\u2019ll see that with respect to these seven nations that are affected by it, that the same seven nations that, as you said a moment ago, were tagged by the Obama administration to effectively be eliminated from the visa waiver program. So that was a step in the direction Trump took. Trump just went further,\u201d he observed.  \u201cBut the key point was that these seven governments, for a variety of reasons, cannot supply the United States with adequate information about people claiming to be citizens of those countries who want visas to come into the United States. Let\u2019s take a couple of examples: Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Syria. These are places where the government has just collapsed. It\u2019s just collapsed. There is no effective government. We have no confidence that the information we\u2019re getting is correct. Other governments like Iran, I wouldn\u2019t trust as far as I could throw them anyway, even though they\u2019re functioning in their territory,\u201d Bolton said.  \u201cThe point is to give the secretary of Homeland Security time to figure out whether these problems will be corrected or whether other steps need to be taken. People complain we should have put Saudi Arabia on the list. Actually, we get a lot of information from Saudi Arabia about visa applicants that we can corroborate and check into. Is it perfect? Of course not, but the opponents of the executive order, I think to be fair, cannot have it both ways. It\u2019s too broad, which is what most of them claim and simultaneously claim it\u2019s not broad enough, which really is hypocritical,\u201d he said. On the subject of Iran, Bolton described the threat it poses as \u201cenormous,\u201d amply justifying the Trump administration\u2019s putting them \u201con notice. \u201d \u201cThis cruise missile story is definitely very troubling because of its implications,\u201d he said, referring to Iran\u2019s recent missile test. \u201cIt was reported that the test had failed, but here\u2019s the significant fact: it failed at the reentry stage  \u2014   that is to say, as the warhead part of the missile, the nose cone and what\u2019s under it, was coming back into the atmosphere. \u201d \u201cWhat is significant about that? When you launch weather and communications satellites, you don\u2019t care what happens on   as long as the satellite is in orbit. What happens to the rest of the missile, it burns up in the atmosphere. You don\u2019t care,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe only reason you care about   vehicles is when you\u2019re delivering nuclear weapons because obviously, you can put the weapon into space, but if you can\u2019t bring it down over the target, you\u2019ve wasted a lot of effort. So the fact that Iran is at the point where it can launch ballistic missiles  \u2014   and we know they\u2019ve got   ballistic missiles now. \u201d \u201cThat they\u2019re testing ICBM kinds of missiles, capable of hitting the United States at a certain point, and they\u2019re testing the   capability, tells you exactly what this missile program is all about. So the argument that ballistic missiles aren\u2019t intended for nuclear weapons is just another Iranian lie. That\u2019s the only purpose of this program,\u201d Bolton said.
