Trump hit upon a   strategy for entering the field of   education. He poured his own money into Trump University, which began as a   business advising customers on how to make money in real estate, but left a long trail of customers alleging they were defrauded. Their lawsuits have cast a shadow over Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. But Mr. Trump also lent his name, and his credibility, to a seminar business he did not own, which was branded the Trump Institute. Its operators rented out hotel ballrooms across the country and invited people to pay up to $2, 000 to come hear Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201c  secrets and strategies. \u201d And its customers had ample reason to ask whether they, too, had been deceived. As with Trump University, the Trump Institute promised falsely that its teachers would be handpicked by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump did little, interviews show, besides appear in an infomercial  \u2014   one that promised customers access to his vast accumulated knowledge. \u201cI put all of my concepts that have worked so well for me, new and old, into our seminar,\u201d he said in the 2005 video, adding, \u201cI\u2019m teaching what I\u2019ve learned. \u201d Reality fell far short. In fact, the institute was run by a couple who had run afoul of regulators in dozens of states and had been dogged by accusations of deceptive business practices and fraud for decades. Similar complaints soon emerged about the Trump Institute. Yet there was an even more fundamental deceit to the business, unreported until now: Extensive portions of the materials that students received after paying their seminar fees, supposedly containing Mr. Trump\u2019s special wisdom, had been plagiarized from an obscure real estate manual published a decade earlier. Together, the exaggerated claims about his own role, the checkered pasts of the people with whom he went into business and the theft of intellectual property at the venture\u2019s heart all illustrate the fiction underpinning so many of Mr. Trump\u2019s licensing businesses: Putting his name on products and services  \u2014   and collecting fees  \u2014   was often where his actual involvement began and ended. \u201cThat Trump Institute, what criminals they are,\u201d said Carol Minto of West Haven, Conn. a retired court reporter who attended one seminar in 2009 and agreed to spend $1, 997. 94 to attend another before having second thoughts. She wound up requiring the help of two states\u2019 attorneys general in getting a refund. \u201cThey wanted to steal my money,\u201d she said. The institute was another example of the Trump brand\u2019s being accused of luring vulnerable customers with false promises of profit and success. Others, besides Trump University, include multilevel marketing ventures that sold vitamins and telecommunications services, and a vanity publisher that faced hundreds of consumer complaints. Mr. Trump\u2019s infomercial performance suggested he was closely overseeing the Trump Institute. \u201cPeople are loving it,\u201d he said in the program, titled \u201cThe Donald Trump Way to Wealth\u201d and staged like a talk show in front of a wildly enthusiastic audience. \u201cPeople are really doing well with it, and they\u2019re loving it. \u201d His name, picture and aphorisms like \u201cI am the American Dream, supersized version\u201d were all over the course materials. Yet while he owned 93 percent of Trump University, the Trump Institute was owned and operated by Irene and Mike Milin, a couple who had been marketing    courses since the 1980s. A Trump executive, Michael Sexton, told The Sacramento Bee in 2006 that there was a simple reason for going into business with the Milins: Their company was \u201cthe best in the business. \u201d Yet the Milins\u2019 reputation was actually pockmarked with lawsuits and regulatory actions  \u2014   a dismal track record that Mr. Trump and his aides could have unearthed with a modicum of due diligence. The Milins were known for running   ads that screamed \u201cFREE MONEY!\u201d and offered tutorials on how to obtain government grants and loans. They were also notorious for being frequent targets of state regulators. In 1993, the Texas attorney general accused their company, then called Information Seminars International, of taking customers\u2019 money and running. People who bought a $499 \u201cMilin Method\u201d package were promised financing to resell real estate purchased at government auctions, officials said, but when customers sought to follow up with the company, the Milins had vanished. In 2001, operating as National Grants Conference, the Milins settled with Florida authorities after being accused of violating the state\u2019s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. And in 2006, the Vermont attorney general sued the Milins for consumer fraud, ultimately fining them $65, 000 and allowing customers to seek more than $325, 000 in refunds. The regulatory woes continued after the Milins rebranded their seminar business with the name of the country\u2019s   real estate developer: In 2007, 33 state attorneys general signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the Milins of deceptive trade practices. A year later, their company sought bankruptcy protection, owing $2. 1 million to creditors. The venture continued for a few years. Alan Garten, Mr. Trump\u2019s   counsel, said that executives were unaware of the Milins\u2019 history when their business relationship began but that he could not recall when they became aware of the couple\u2019s   with regulators. Operating as the Trump Institute, the Milins pursued familiar tactics  \u2014   and attracted familiar complaints, eventually earning an F from the Better Business Bureau. Seminar attendees who later sought assistance from supposed experts over a Trump Institute   phone line complained of being told to ignore what they had been taught in the seminars because it was outdated or useless advice. \u201cThe \u2018advisers\u2019 refused to listen to us when we referred to the methods taught in the seminars,\u201d Fred and Zofia Besel, a retired couple from New York, wrote in 2009, seeking a refund in a letter that wound up with the Florida attorney general\u2019s office. Unbeknownst to customers at the time, though, even the printed materials handed out to seminar attendees were based on a lie. The Trump Institute copyrighted its publication, each page emblazoned with \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Road Map to Success,\u201d and it distributed the materials to those who attended the seminars. Yet much of the handbook\u2019s contents were lifted without attribution from an obscure   guide published by Success magazine in 1995 called \u201cReal Estate Mastery System. \u201d At least 20 pages of the Trump Institute book were copied entirely or in large part from \u201cReal Estate Mastery System. \u201d Even some of its hypothetical scenarios  \u2014   \u201cSeller A is asking $80, 000 for a   residence\u201d  \u2014   were repeated verbatim. Asked about the plagiarism, which was discovered by the Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d American Bridge, the editor of the Trump Institute publication, Susan G. Parker, denied responsibility and suggested that a lawyer for the Milins, who provided her with background material for the book, might have been to blame. The lawyer, Peter Hoppenfeld, who no longer represents the Milins, said Ms. Parker was most likely at fault but acknowledged forwarding her information from the Milins\u2019 office. Reached at her home in Boca Raton, Fla. Irene Milin told a reporter, \u201cI\u2019m very busy,\u201d and hung up. She did not answer subsequent calls or respond to a voice mail message. Mr. Garten said Mr. Trump was \u201cobviously\u201d not aware of the plagiarism. But even while playing down Mr. Trump\u2019s link to the Trump Institute, calling it a \u201c  licensing deal,\u201d Mr. Garten expressed pride in the venture. \u201cI stand by the curriculum that was taught at both Trump University and Trump Institute,\u201d he said. Ms. Parker, a lawyer and legal writer in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. said that far from being handpicked by Mr. Trump, she had been hired to write the book after responding to a Craigslist ad. She said she never spoke to Mr. Trump, let alone received guidance from him on what to write. She said she drew on her own knowledge of real estate and a   of Mr. Trump\u2019s books. Ms. Parker said she did venture to one of the Trump Institute seminars  \u2014   and was appalled: The speakers came off like   salesmen, she said, and their advice was nothing but banalities. \u201cIt was like I was in sleaze America,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all smoke and mirrors. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628591.4649043}
