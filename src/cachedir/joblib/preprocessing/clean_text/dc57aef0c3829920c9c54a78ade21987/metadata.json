[\u201cThere is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe\u201d said Mr Wilders, who leads in the polls ahead of the March 15 parliamentary vote, to kick off his campaign on Saturday.  \u201cAnd that should change\u201d the Party for Freedom (PVV) figurehead said, emphasising that \u201cnot all are scum\u201d as he attempted to take a stroll through a market. But despite Wilders making clear his remarks referred only to Moroccans who \u201cmake the streets unsafe\u201d both the headline and first paragraph of the Observer\u2019s report of the exchange make the claim that the   Prime Minister called all migrants from the North African country \u201cscum\u201d. Entitled \u201c  leader Geert Wilders calls Moroccan migrants \u2018scum\u2019\u201d the Observer article begins: \u2018The Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders sparked outrage on Saturday when he launched his election campaign with a stinging attack on the country\u2019s Moroccan population. The   MP called them \u201cscum\u201d and said he wanted to make the Netherlands \u201cours again\u2019 It\u2019s not revealed until the third paragraph, in which the   newspaper quotes the populist politician in full, that Mr Wilders specifically singled out criminal migrants in his speech. Sky\u2019s coverage of Wilders\u2019 remarks is similarly misleading. Under a headline which declares that \u201c  Dutch MP Geert Wilders attacks \u2018Moroccan scum\u2019\u201d Sky News uses the piece\u2019s lede to tell readers: \u201cThe MP begins his election campaign by blaming the \u201cMoroccan scum\u201d for \u201cmaking the streets of Holland unsafe. \u201cDutch MP Geert Wilders has launched his campaign for Holland\u2019s top job with an attack on the country\u2019s Moroccans\u201d begins the article in a clear implication that the PVV figure attacked everyone living in Holland who hails from the North African nation. Britain\u2019s public service broadcaster makes the same inference, its headline blaring: \u201cDutch populist Geert Wilders talks of Moroccan \u2018scum\u2019\u201d. The populist politician, who has promised to shut mosques and bring an end to mass immigration from Muslim countries if elected, was speaking in his party\u2019s   stronghold of Spijkenisse, just south of Rotterdam. \u201cIf you want to regain your country, if you want to make the Netherlands for the people of the Netherlands, your own home again, than you can only vote [for the PVV],\u201d Wilders told supporters and the press. \u201cPlease, make the Netherlands ours again. \u201d De Volkskrant reported in 2013 that Moroccan criminals were convicted four times more than Dutch suspects. According to the country\u2019s 2011 census, there were more than 167, 000   people in Holland, a figure that does not take into account second or   Moroccans. A report commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Interior found that most of the Moroccan youth involved in criminal activities were born in Holland. According to the Gatestone Institute, 65 per cent all Moroccan male youths between the ages of and 12 and 23 have been detained by police at least once, with one third of this group having been detained five or more times. Mr. Wilder\u2019s comments come as he rides high in the polls at the Netherlands approaches election day. Although other Dutch political parties have vowed to not enter into a coalition with Mr. Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party, present polling suggests he should lead the largest party on March 16th, which may force others to soften their stance.'"}, "time": 1742562455.7219234}
