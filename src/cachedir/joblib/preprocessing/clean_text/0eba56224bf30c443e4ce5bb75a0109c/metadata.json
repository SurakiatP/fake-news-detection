Tacitly acknowledging that the current structure was rife with conflicts, he ordered a complete rethinking of it. \u201cWe want to make the antidoping system independent from sports organizations,\u201d the I. O. C. \u2019s president, Thomas Bach, said at a meeting of global sports officials in Switzerland. \u201cThe antidoping system has some deficiencies. \u201d A New York Times investigation this month found that the World   Agency, the global watchdog for sports doping, was hampered by politics and possible conflicts of interest. For years, the agency\u2019s leadership failed to pursue allegations of widespread cheating in Russia. Many within WADA had varying views on the organization\u2019s core purpose, some seeing it as more of a passive coordinator than a proactive policing authority. The organization is jointly funded by national governments and sports organizations, including the I. O. C. Its decision makers are government and Olympic officials, people who might not be inclined to reveal doping transgressions that could mar the integrity of the Games or discredit athletes from their countries. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn to people and say, \u2018These are the rules obey them,\u2019\u201d the agency\u2019s current president, Craig Reedie, told The Times. Mr. Reedie, who is also an I. O. C. vice president, said WADA had not investigated   tips from inside Russia because the agency did not have explicit authority to do so until 2015. Mr. Bach, designating WADA as the leader in the global antidoping effort, said, \u201cEverybody has to understand better who is doing what and who is responsible for what. \u201d Mr. Bach called on WADA to strengthen its investigative abilities. Last week, in the wake of the Times report, WADA announced that it was hiring a director of intelligence and investigations, G\u00fcnter Younger, who currently leads the cybercrime unit in a division of the German criminal police. Mr. Bach said an Olympic summit meeting set for Oct. 8 would focus broadly on how to improve the antidoping system, and he called on WADA to convene an international meeting on the topic next year. Mr. Bach also expressed support for last week\u2019s decision by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the ruling body of track and field, to bar Russian track and field athletes from the Rio Olympics. He openly questioned the integrity of athletes from Russia and Kenya, another country where antidoping efforts have been found lacking. But Mr. Bach suggested amending a key detail of the ruling against Russian athletes while emphasizing that specific sports federations had supreme control. The I. A. A. F. said Friday that only Russian track and field athletes who had been living outside the country and subjected to rigorous drug testing could petition to compete in Rio  \u2014   and for a neutral team, not for Russia. Mr. Bach said, however, that Russian athletes who cleared that high hurdle could possibly compete under the Russian flag, and he defended the integrity of Russian Olympic officials. \u201cThe Russian Olympic Committee is not suspended,\u201d he said, calling the organization \u201dvery helpful in clearing up the difficult situation in Russia. \u201d After the announcement, the I. A. A. F. reiterated its belief that any Russian athletes who were cleared to compete \u201con an exceptional basis\u201d should not compete on behalf of Russia. The organization said it planned to work with Olympic officials \u201cto ensure the decision is respected and implemented in full. \u201d Russia has been accused of a     doping program extending across sports, although most investigations have been limited to track and field. Russian sports officials have apologized for doping problems but denied state involvement. In a statement on Tuesday, the Russian sports ministry expressed support for the I. O. C. \u2019s decision. As recently as this month, WADA said, Russian sports officials helped athletes evade drug testing, and federal customs agents and members of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service tampered with doping samples and intimidated drug testers. Responding to an outcry from athletes wanting broader inquiries, Mr. Bach on Tuesday called on the 27 other organizations overseeing summer Olympic sports  \u2014   from gymnastics to weight lifting  \u2014   to individually scrutinize athletes from Russia and Kenya and assess their ability to compete in Rio in six weeks. The allegations against Russia and Kenya, he said, \u201cput very serious doubts on the presumption of innocence for athletes coming from these countries. \u201d The I. A. A. F. noted on Tuesday that a majority of athletes from Kenya competed in track and field. The organization said that Kenya\u2019s runners were subject to rigorous testing and that their doping samples had been examined in Qatar and Stockholm in recent months. (Africa\u2019s only   testing lab was decertified this year.) \u201cThis does not mean we can guarantee that all Kenyan athletes are clean,\u201d an I. A. A. F. spokeswoman said. \u201cWe cannot give such guarantees for any country\u2019s athletes. But we can be confident that an effective testing regime is in place. \u201d Any athlete who may take issue with a sports federation\u2019s decision can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, Mr. Bach noted. He said he had learned that Russian athletes or the Russian Olympic Committee would probably file an appeal regarding the track and field decision. \u201cThat is the good right of everybody,\u201d he said. WADA disciplined the national antidoping programs in Russia and Kenya in the wake of news media reports that called their integrity into question. For a country to be declared noncompliant by WADA means little, but depriving a nation\u2019s antidoping operation of WADA\u2019s endorsement is a strong signal to the I. O. C. and sports federations. Russia\u2019s sports ministry said Tuesday that its track and field athletes were prepared to undergo a minimum of three extra drug tests before the Olympics. But last week, Rune Andersen, a former WADA official and the current chairman of the I. A. A. F. committee that is monitoring Russia, expressed skepticism about athletes\u2019 ability to prove definitively that they were untainted by a possible   doping program. The former antidoping lab director in Russia has described a sophisticated system whereby athletes on drugs avoided testing positive. \u201cTwo or five or 100 negative tests do not mean an athlete is clean,\u201d Mr. Andersen said. \u201cHistory has shown that is not the case. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563285.719388}
