That\u2019s a curse in this culture. \u201d What worried me just as much was the   realization: Whatever my wife and I tried to do to shape our son\u2019s masculine identity would compete against such cultural norms as a postured indifference to school, which can lead to lower grades, graduation rates and academic motivation a sports and gaming culture that exalt alpha domination (and aggressive male reflexes) and a   John Wayne ethos that breeds alienation and, too often, depression. All of the dread and loathing I\u2019d always felt about the limiting script of traditional masculine norms came flooding back. I was faced with one of my biggest fears about parenthood: having a son. The common wisdom, as research verifies, is that most men want sons. That\u2019s starting to shift. Some men, like me, fear becoming fathers to sons. At the website for the NPR radio show \u201cOn Being,\u201d the writer Courtney E. Martin observes of many younger   and       \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a fascinating trend: They seem to disproportionately desire having a girl instead of a boy. \u201d An informal Facebook survey she took yielded these results: \u201cI wanted a girl mainly because I felt it was harder to be a boy in today\u2019s society. If I have a boy I will embrace the challenge of raising a boy  \u2026    who can learn the power of vulnerability even as male culture tries to make him see it as weakness. But, frankly, I hope that when I have a second child, it\u2019ll be another girl. \u2019\u201d This was emblematic of a lot of the responses, which revealed that men felt more confident, or \u201cbetter equipped,\u201d   \u201ca strong, confident daughter. \u201d Ms. Martin says that her own husband was relieved to have daughters instead of sons. He says: \u201c\u2018I haven\u2019t felt like I fit into a lot of the social norms around masculinity  \u2026    . I\u2019m much more interested in the challenge of helping a girl or young woman transcend sexist conditions. It feels more possible and more important, in some ways. \u201d These sentiments ripple well beyond this small pool of men. Consider, for instance, such blog pieces as \u201cMen Need Daughters More Than They Need Sons\u201d or \u201cEvery Guy Thinks He Wants Boys, But Every Guy Should Want Daughters. \u201d Or: In a 2010 study, economists from the California Institute of Technology, the London School of Economics and New York University discovered, among other things, that adoptive American parents preferred girls to boys by nearly a third. The data was based on more than 800 adoptions that occurred between June 2004 and August 2009. The researchers suggested that this preference for girls might occur because adoptive parents \u201cfear dysfunctional social behavior in adopted children and perceive girls as \u2018less risky\u2019 than boys in that respect. \u201d Adoptive parents are even willing to pay an average of $16, 000 more in finalization costs for a girl than a boy.   couples and single women showed an even greater proclivity for adopting girls.  These preferences weren\u2019t limited to adopting parents. An article in Slate cites a study from the journal Reproductive Biomedicine Online which found that white couples preferentially select females through the increasingly common procedure preimplantation genetic diagnosis 70 percent of the time. (Patients using in vitro fertilization often use this procedure to vet their embryos for genetic abnormalities.) The article also says many fertility doctors observe that 80 percent of patients who are choosing their baby\u2019s gender prefer girls. What few of us seem to realize: The     behavior, which increasingly invites cringing, doesn\u2019t originate with them. In \u201cA New Psychology of Women: Gender, Culture, and Ethnicity,\u201d Hilary M. Lips writes: \u201c  \u2026    parents tend to touch infant boys less often and more roughly than infant daughters and that daughters are handled more gently and protectively. .. \u201d Research also shows that parents treat sons differently after they\u2019ve suffered injuries than they do daughters, and another study, \u201cGender and Age Differences in   Emotion Talk,\u201d reveals that mothers use more emotional language with   daughters than they do with comparably aged sons. This imbalanced,     is part of our legacy because children ape the attitudes of the parent whose gender matches their own. In a Time magazine article about this study, Harriet Tenenbaum, a   observes, \u201cMost parents say they want boys to be more expressive but don\u2019t know [they] are speaking differently to them  \u2026    . These are learned stereotypes and we are reinforcing them as a society. \u201d The good news for boys is that men with a high emotional intelligence quotient don\u2019t hand down these values. The bad news: Pressure from an unexpected corner makes such men   their desire to embrace boys, not to mention their own emotional sensitivity. A blogger on Vice, Chelsea G. Summers, thrills at how \u201cmisandry\u201d  \u2014   hatred of men  \u2014   has become \u201cchic. \u201d She gushes that, in addition to a political agenda, this blanket antipathy promises some \u201cgreat pop culture. \u201d This has manifested itself, among other ways, through blogs and online essays and tweets that pillory and mock the growing trend of men crying  \u2014   which, I know from my own and other men\u2019s experience, can be the single act that most liberates and heals a painful past that devalues masculine sensitivity. Paradoxically, for some men, the   feminism they embrace   them into muting the very sensitivity and empathy that opened their eyes to women\u2019s plight. Is it any wonder that some of us want little, if anything, to do with raising boys? The subtext bombarding us from many sides ultimately encourages us to abandon them, even as they founder beneath the chop of a changing world for which they lack the buoyancy. Yet men like me abdicate our responsibility by letting other men  \u2014   the ones who don\u2019t always encourage the broader, deeper humanity within males  \u2014   raise boys. And we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to heal old wounds. Of course we should empower our daughters, because gross inequality still exists. And, despite the callous, increasingly callow, pushback, we should empower boys  \u2014   with the same emotional literacy skill set and expansive worldview we teach our daughters. It\u2019s what they, and we, ultimately need. Recently, I sent Macallah, now 5, to his room after he ignored my repeated requests to stop yelling and throwing his toys. More than even his dismissal, what bothered me was what many people refer to as \u201cboy energy. \u201d It\u2019s a reactive, sometimes destructive, force that unnerved me even as a child. Then I heard the voice of my wife, Liz, in my head: \u201cHe only wants your attention. Boys don\u2019t always know how to ask for what they want. \u201d I found Macallah in his room, repeating the same behavior. I took a deep breath. \u201cWere you upset because I wasn\u2019t paying attention to you?\u201d I asked. Head and eyes downcast, he nodded. I bent down and hugged him, then looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you learn to tell Mama and me what you need  \u2014   sometimes that means telling us what you\u2019re feeling inside, understand?\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou do it,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me what you really wanted. \u201d He shrugged, still looking down. \u201cYou to pay attention to me,\u201d he said. He threw his arms around my waist, leaning his head into me. I didn\u2019t need words to know what filled my young son: He felt wanted.'"}, "time": 1742564126.5673592}
