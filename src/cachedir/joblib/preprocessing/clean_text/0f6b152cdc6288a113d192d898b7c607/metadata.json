Carlson began the interview by claiming that Weinstein has relocated his family for their safety. Weinstein claimed that he has not returned to campus because the administration has yet to acknowledge the danger that their handling of the protests has put Weinstein and his family in. He also suggested that returning to campus may not be safe at this moment. Weinstein claimed that he has received tremendous support from the public outside of the college, but lamented the fact that only one of his colleagues had publicly condemned the witch hunt. \u201cNot leaving meant that you were not an ally,\u201d Weinstein said, referencing the backlash he received to his refusal to participate in the \u201cDay of Absence. \u201d \u201cOn a college campus, people should be equally free to be on campus, irrespective of their skin color,\u201d Weinstein added.
