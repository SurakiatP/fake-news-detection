He is less widely known as a collector of photography  \u2014   and yet the   owns close to 8, 000 pieces dating from 1910 to the present. Highlights from that collection are now being shown here at Tate Modern. For the next six months (through May 7) \u201cThe Radical Eye\u201d presents 191 works from the 1920s to the 1950s by a hit parade of photographers including Andr\u00e9 Kertesz, Edward Steichen, Man Ray, Irving Penn and Dorothea Lange. (Parts of the collection have been shown at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta in   and at the Pinchuk Art Centre in Ukraine in 2007.) Mr. John and David Furnish, his husband and the collection\u2019s   are in talks with Tate over which works they will make available to the national collections as a \u201cgift or promised gift,\u201d said Simon Baker, senior curator of photography at Tate Modern. \u201cThis is undoubtedly one of the world\u2019s most important collections of photography,\u201d said Phillip Prodger, head of photographs at the National Portrait Gallery, who is not involved in the exhibition. \u201cIt contains many of the very finest examples of the most famous photographs in the world, particularly in that modern period between the wars. \u201d Mr. John began collecting photographs in 1990, shortly after coming out of rehab for alcohol addiction, he said in an interview published in the show\u2019s catalog. While staying with friends in southern France, he attended a photography festival met a gallerist from Los Angeles who had brought photographs with him. \u201cI\u2019d never really noticed photography as an art form before,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI looked at them and thought, oh my God, these are so beautiful. I bought about 12 on the spot. \u201d The timing \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been better,\u201d Mr. John said. \u201cPhotographs were very undervalued then. \u201d He began by buying early   photographs, including some that had caught his eye as a child, and hunted for vintage prints. In 1993, he paid $193, 895 for a print of Man Ray\u2019s \u201cGlass Tears\u201d (1932) the most expensive photograph sold at auction at the time. \u201cWhen he found his sobriety, he saw life with new eyes,\u201d said Newell Harbin, the director of Mr. John\u2019s collection since 2012. \u201cHe realized, going back to when he was a child and looking at posters of these famous photographs, that this was his moment, and that he could really start from there. \u201d \u201cThe Radical Eye\u201d is like a crash course in photography: it includes nearly every major photographer from the period, and presents their works thematically rather than chronologically. Most of the pictures are in gilded,   or painted wooden frames made for Mr. John in Atlanta, where he has a home. A room of portraits at the start features photographs by Man Ray of Pablo Picasso, Constantin Brancusi, and the Surrealist poet Andr\u00e9 Breton, among others there are a total of 25 Man Ray works in the show. The same gallery contains a wall of Irving Penn \u201ccorner portraits\u201d  \u2014   in which famous figures like Spencer Tracy, Joe Louis, Duke Ellington and Salvador Dal\u00ed were photographed squeezed into the corner of a room. Elsewhere in the show are significant works like Paul Strand\u2019s \u201cWall Street, New York\u201d (1915) and Dorothea Lange\u2019s \u201cMigrant Mother\u201d (1936). But the exhibition also contains many   gems, such as an image of a winding staircase taken around 1928 by Werner Mantz, or the Surrealist stills of Josef Breitenbach. \u201cThe really amazing thing about this collection is the provenance of some of the key works,\u201d said Shoair Mavlian, the Tate assistant curator who organized the show together with Mr. Baker and Ms. Harbin. Ms. Mavlian said that the tiny image of Kertesz\u2019s \u201cUnderwater Swimmer\u201d was the very first contact print made by the artist in 1917, and the 1932 Herbert Bayer photomontage \u201cHumanly Impossible ( )\u201d was the first print that Bayer painted and which \u201cevery subsequent reproduction was made from. \u201d Ms. Harbin, who was previously manager of the photography collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, said Mr. John collected from all periods, including contemporary, and had recently acquired works by Christopher Williams and Sally Mann. \u201cIt has to speak to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just get that photographer because it has to tick a box. \u201d Mr. Prodger of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s said Mr. John was \u201cvery uncompromising in his collecting, and always sought out those examples that thrill when you see them. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredible not just that he has a print of such and such,\u201d he added, \u201cbut he has the print. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563763.7136056}
