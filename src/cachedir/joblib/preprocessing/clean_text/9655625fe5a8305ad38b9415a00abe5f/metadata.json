Consumers face a dizzying array of entertainment choices that include streaming video such as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Netflix cable channels and apps from outlets like HBO and Showtime YouTube and as many as 28, 000 podcasts. With them all offering uncountable hours of addictive programming, how is a listener or viewer supposed to keep up? For some, the answer is speed watching or speed listening  \u2014   taking in the content at accelerated speeds, sometimes two times as fast as normal. While speed viewing does save time  \u2014   devotees say it can save hours over the season of a series  \u2014   others raise concerns that it undermines the rhythm of a production and can dilute some creative elements. Jan Rezab said in an article in Forbes last year that his viewing eventually progressed from 1. 2 times to two times as fast. \u201cAs you continue to speed watch, higher speeds get easier and easier to comprehend,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve been speed watching for the last 2 years, and I now feel comfortable watching at 2x the normal viewing speed. \u201d He watches some even faster. Be prepared to jump through a few hoops if you want to speed up your content, though. While some players make it easy to change your playback speed, others make it more difficult. On YouTube, it lives under settings. On Apple\u2019s native podcast app, it\u2019s right next to the play button, and other podcast players have a similar function. Audible, the major audiobook app, offers the option as well. Netflix, Hulu and HBO, however, don\u2019t offer higher speeds on their players, but there are workarounds available. It\u2019s possible to speed up online video through a Google Chrome extension, and an   media player called VLC will play many formats of digital media. Some   boxes like TiVo allow   playback of recorded programs. It\u2019s not clear how widely the practice has been adopted. In an informal poll on Twitter, David Chen, a host and producer of the movie and television podcast \u201cSlashfilmcast,\u201d asked, \u201cDo you ever listen to podcasts or watch   at a faster speed than intended?\u201d Of 1, 505 responses, 79 percent chose the response \u201cNo, it\u2019s an abomination,\u201d while 16 percent said they did so for podcasts, and a total of 5 percent said they did so for films, television and podcasts. On a recent episode of the podcast, Mr. Chen and his   Jeff Cannata and Devindra Hardawar, took up the question of speed viewing. A listener asked, \u201cIn this increasingly     world, I wonder, how much of a crime against culture I am committing by speeding through these shows?\u201d The podcast hosts seemed aghast. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d Mr. Cannata, said, adding that the practice \u201ccheapens your entertainment. \u201d Mr. Hardawar said speed viewing did not allow time to soak in what was happening. \u201cI feel like you are not even actually watching it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re consuming it. You\u2019re not actually like absorbing it or letting it work on you in a creative way. So yeah, this is bad. This is bad. \u201d Speed viewing waters down the emotional impacts of a movie, Peter Markham, senior    at the American Film Institute Conservatory in Los Angeles, said in an interview last week. \u201cIf you were watching a play by Pinter, for example, the pause could carry the greatest meaning,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine watching a movie at twice the speed. \u201d Renan L. Borelli, 31, who is director of audience growth and engagement at MTV News and who has a   commute from Park Slope in Brooklyn to the West Village in Manhattan, is a big fan of podcasts. He listens to as many as three or four a day and subscribes to about 30. Mr. Borelli estimated he could save about five to 10 minutes per podcast. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a couple of minutes, it\u2019s a help,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he has \u201cmany gigabytes\u201d of podcasts stored on his phone. Nicholas Quah, who writes Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts, said in an email that it was unclear how widespread speed listening was, but that anecdotally, it appeared to be \u201can established behavior\u201d among   listeners. He said he saw no harm in it. He wrote, \u201cSpeed listening might be more offensive to folks who make highly produced, preciously crafted and   podcasts (vs. a loose conversational one, like the Slate gabfests) but what we\u2019re actually confronting here is that tension in the relationship between artist and consumer: Which is more important, the artist intent or the consumer\u2019s preference?\u201d Mr. Chen, of \u201cSlashfilmcast,\u201d said in an email that speed listening was a consumer\u2019s way of saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care how you wanted me to experience this work you\u2019ve created. I just care about the information exchanged. \u201d Lost are elements of dramatic or comedic timing and intentional silences, he said. \u201cIt becomes a fundamentally different experience that disregards what the creator intended\u201d at an accelerated speed, he wrote. He said the practice was like trying to eat twice as many meals as normal to avoid missing any culinary treats. \u201cSure, you might actually be consuming more, but you\u2019re probably having a worse, more grotesque experience,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd you\u2019re certainly not doing it in a way that the chef intended. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564309.3462596}
