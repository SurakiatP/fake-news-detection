Reports of the drugs\u2019 causing jawbones to rot and thighbones to snap in two have shaken many osteoporosis patients so much that they say they would rather take their chances with the disease. Use of the most commonly prescribed osteoporosis drugs fell by 50 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a recent paper, and doctors say the trend is continuing. Last month, three professional groups  \u2014   the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the National Bone Health Alliance  \u2014   put out an urgent call for doctors to be more aggressive in treating patients at high risk, and for patients to be more aware of the need for treatment. It followed a flurry of recent articles in medical journals documenting and bemoaning patients\u2019 abandonment of traditional osteoporosis drugs. But osteoporosis experts are afraid their efforts will do little to change minds. \u201cNinety percent of patients, when you talk to them about starting one of these drugs, won\u2019t go on,\u201d said Dr. Paul D. Miller, medical director of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, a medical practice in Lakewood. \u201cNinety percent who are on the drugs want to come off. The fear factor is huge. \u201d Half of those who start taking the drugs stop within a year. Even patients who just broke a hip, which makes another hip fracture extremely likely, are refusing them. In 2011, only 20 percent of patients discharged from a hospital with a broken hip had a prescription for one of the drugs, compared with 50 percent in 2002. There is little question that fractures caused by fragile bones are a real problem, particularly for women. A    woman has a 50 percent chance of having an osteoporotic fracture in her remaining years. The drugs, meant to be started when bone density falls very low and the chance of a fracture soars, can reduce that risk by half, studies show. But to many, it matters little that the drugs\u2019 frightening side effects are extremely rare. Estimates are that 10 to 40 in 100, 000 osteoporosis patients taking the drugs  \u2014   including alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate and zoledronate  \u2014   have sustained broken thighbones. Fewer than one in 100, 000 have had the jawbone problem. \u201cYou only need to treat 50 people to prevent a fracture, but you need to treat 40, 000 to see an atypical fracture,\u201d said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, a professor of medicine at Tufts University who has no association with the makers of the drugs. Lawsuits over the rare side effects resulted in large jury awards and drew widespread attention. And after reports of these problems began to surface, the Food and Drug Administration requested that the drugs\u2019 labels include a warning about the association. Doctors had hoped that a new class of medications might avoid the rare side effects, but their hopes were dashed when Amgen announced the same problems in a clinical trial of a drug called romosozumab: a sudden shattering of a thigh bone in one patient and an area of jawbone that inexplicably rotted in two. \u201cThis was the new miracle drug,\u201d Dr. Rosen said. \u201cIt means these effects might occur with any of the newer drugs for osteoporosis. \u201d Some patients say that even though their doctors have explained the relative risks to them, the specter of those side effects frightens them. That is what happened with Mildred Canipe, 79, who lives in Charlotte, N. C. She had a spine fracture two years ago and now lives with continual back pain. She worries about another spine fracture or, even worse, a fractured hip. But she resists taking osteoporosis drugs, she said, because she tends to have side effects with almost any drug, and that makes her think that if anyone will suffer an atypical fracture from the medicine, it is she. \u201cOf course I am worried about my bones,\u201d Mrs. Canipe said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be? But I am between a rock and a hard place. \u201d She is right to worry about a hip fracture, doctors say. Those injuries are often the start of a downward spiral for older adults. Many never walk normally again. Many end up in nursing homes, unable to care for themselves. \u201cYou see someone go from being a mobile elderly person to someone gripping a walker, afraid to move,\u201d said Joan A. McGowan, who directs the division of musculoskeletal diseases at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. \u201cAnd the less they walk, the more frail they become. \u201d Dr. McGowan has no associations with makers of osteoporosis drugs. The pain from spine fractures may improve, but physical disfigurement does not. Many patients with osteoporosis have multiple fractures of their spines. They become hunched and have trouble breathing. Their posture makes it hard for their hearts to pump blood, Dr. McGowan said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty. \u201d Yet it is an uphill battle trying to persuade people to take the drugs, said Dr. Steven T. Harris, an osteoporosis specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cI have that discussion all day every day with my patients,\u201d he said. One issue, Dr. Harris said, is the relentless promotion of diet and exercise for patients with fragile bones, which, he said, is insufficient to protect them from fractures. It gives people a false sense that they can control their risk. Another, said Dr. Ethel S. Siris, an osteoporosis expert at Columbia, is that with the drugs off patent, there is no longer an aggressive advertising push to make people aware of them. Their cost ranges from less than $10 a month for alendronate pills to about $1, 200 for a    infusion of zoledronate. Doctors who have seen one of the rare patients who have an atypical fracture are shaken by the experience and have to remind themselves of the power of the data showing that the drugs\u2019 benefits far outweigh their risks. Dr. Elaine Carlson, who until her recent retirement practiced internal medicine in Kennebunk, Me. had a patient who sustained two such fractures. The patient, 89, who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy, said her left leg had broken suddenly when she was walking across her kitchen floor. A surgeon put in a rod and three screws, and it healed. Then, she said, her right thigh began to hurt six months later. She called Dr. Carlson\u2019s office and was talking to her nurse practitioner when suddenly her right leg broke. She saw three doctors and had two operations before it healed, but she still cannot walk normally and can no longer do the gardening she loves. \u201cI hobble around on a cane,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a cripple. \u201d She called the drug she took for osteoporosis \u201cthat wretched, dreadful stuff. \u201d Having that happen to her patient was \u201cvery tough, very tough,\u201d Dr. Carlson said. And when the next osteoporosis patient came to her office? \u201cYeah, you do hesitate,\u201d she said. \u201cYour job is \u2018do no harm. \u2019\u201d But Dr. Carlson said she had continued to prescribe the drugs. \u201cYou do have to stick with the science,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628358.6950283}
