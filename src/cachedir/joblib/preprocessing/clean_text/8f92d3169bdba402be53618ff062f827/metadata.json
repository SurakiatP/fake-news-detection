The media never mentioned the fact that the Millers were involved in the Occupy Movement and it never informs the public that they were Vegas police informants . \\nWhat\\'s worse is that this attempt to smear patriots for standing against the illegal and unconstitutional acts of the DC government and their willing accomplices in the Bureau of Land Management, FBI, and corrupt politicians, both in DC and local, is the fact that this was already dealt with once as Constitutional Sheriff Richard Mack was wrongly connected to the Millers. \\nDeb Jordan adds , \"Las Vegas Metro Police and the Clark County Sheriff\\'s Department cannot produce any report of violence or destruction of property during the Bundy Civil Rights Protest, except in those instances where the Bureau of Land Management were the perpetrators.\" \\n\"Sheriff Douglas Gillespie, the then Sheriff of Clarke County said at the time, there was no direct link to the couple\\'s killing spree and Cliven Bundy \u2013 noting that the two had arrived in Las Vegas in January of 2014 and that they had their own agenda for starting a revolution,\" she added. \"Gillespie made clear he had seen NO evidence that the Miller\\'s had come to Nevada seeking out Cliven Bundy.\" \\nNevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore also took time to call out this injustice . \\n\"This mailer is completely unacceptable she said, and somebody needs to be held accountable for putting this false narrative in Nevada mailboxes,\" she said. \"Clearly the Bundy\\'s Civil Rights were being violated by a United States Government \u2013 Terrorist Organization \u2013 known as the BLM, and we all saw it happening with our own eyes. I was not the only elected official at that protest and what I want to know is, where the hell are they now?\" \\nFiore also said : \\nThe level of propaganda being allowed by the Democratic Party must come to an end. We have men whose lives are on the line here in Nevada, and poisoning the jury pool with a downright lie must be dealt with. Not only do we have a case here that is already out of balance because it is being overseen by Judge Gloria Navarro, a left winger who was recommended by Harry Reid and appointed by Barack Obama, and Steven Myhre a Liberal Prosecutor who could obviously care less about fairness and truth, now we add to that more unfairness by allowing a left-wing propaganda machine to send out the message, that Cliven Bundy is directly responsible for the death of two of our Metro Police officers. \\nThis case should be awarded a change in venue in the fairness of law, and my peers should stop being cowards and get back to representing the truth about this case. \\nCliven Bundy held a peaceful protest on his own property and even though the Federal Government was not invited, they came anyway. \\nThey literally beat up on his family, set trained snipers on hillsides overlooking his ranch, came at them with stun guns and dogs, tried to restrict them to a first amendment area, killed and buried their cattle on public lands \u2013 in mass graves, threatened everyone who came to a lawful protest with lethal force, had armed helicopters and drones flying all over the place, and now they honestly want the American people to believe the Bundy\\'s were the bad guys \u2014 come on \u2026 \\nThe Government has stacked the odds against these men, and I am telling you right now; \\nI will not stand by and watch them be railroaded by a bunch of left-wing extremist and sent to prison for crimes they did not commit. \\nThis case should not only be moved out of the State of Nevada, it should be dismissed altogether. \\nI have no regrets for doing the right thing here when it comes to the Bundy\\'s \u2014 As hard as it is, I would rather lose every single race for office, before I would lose one nights sleep knowing I had betrayed them .\" \\nFiore is correct. The men in Nevada were more peaceful than the agents who surrounded them. So, what are you going to do America? Will you sit quietly by at your keyboard and rage at the machine, or will you take action? \\nYou can contact the responsible party here: Address : 6233 Dean Martin Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89118'"}, "time": 1742562630.8347979}
