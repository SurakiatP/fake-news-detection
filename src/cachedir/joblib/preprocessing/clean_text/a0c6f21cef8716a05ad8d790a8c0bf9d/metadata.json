[According to the organization\u2019s website:  Donald Trump made a number of very specific pledges. Three in particular were to secure the border, cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities, and begin removing the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants currently in the United States. The goal of this project is to continue building public support for these proposals, and help to ensure that the job gets done. Wilkerson told Marlow, \u201cIt floored my family that our son was tortured and murdered. Then you get this extra layer that it was someone who was in this country illegally. I remember asking a detective, \u2018Where are his parents?\u2019 and they said, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t ask him. \u2019\u201d Wilkerson said that was her first introduction to the concept of sanctuary cities. \u201cI thought to myself, how odd. I can be pulled over, you or I, any day of the week, and asked where we\u2019re going or where we\u2019ve been, and you answer those questions, and you\u2019re free to go. It was absolutely stunning to me that you couldn\u2019t ask that question in a sanctuary city. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
