Clinton held a brief four-minute press conference with reporters in Iowa Friday, where she has been campaigning. \\n\u201cI have now seen Director Comey\u2019s letter to Congress,\u201d Clinton said to open her remarks. \u201cWe are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election in our lifetimes \u2026 so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.\u201d https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/792142514471907329 \\n\u201cThe director himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it\u2019s imperative that the Bureau explain this issue and question, whatever it is, without any delay.\u201d \\nClinton said the recent announcement from Comey came as a complete surprise to her and her staff, and that she only learned about it thanks to \u201cthis letter sent to Republican members of the House.\u201d \\nWhile Clinton\u2019s rhetoric implies that Comey only contacted Republicans, that\u2019s not the case. While only Republicans are listed at the top of Comey\u2019s letter (because they hold all House committee chairmanships) Comey\u2019s letter was also copied to the Democratic ranking members of each committee. \\nClinton also dismissed as a \u201crumor\u201d reports that the email investigation was reopened due to discoveries made during a separate investigation of former Democratic representative Anthony Weiner. Weiner is the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, though she announced her separation from him following revelations last month that Weiner sexted with an underage girl. That sexting triggered an FBI investigation of its own, which has now circled all the way back to Clinton. \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard these rumors,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to believe. That\u2019s why it is incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they\u2019re talking about, because right now your guess is as good as mine, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good enough.\u201d \\nShe then wrapped her conference by once again slamming Comey for supposedly only contacting Republicans. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, they need to share whatever facts they have with the American people.\u201d \\n  The Daily Caller Foundation  '"}, "time": 1742562014.4620347}
