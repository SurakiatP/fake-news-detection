Trump\u2019s election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media, the banks and the government.   Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word: globalism. It is a word that conjures many images, none of them good: shuttered factories, unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that, believers say, controls the economy and the media. Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the  . They say it carries multiple meanings  \u2014   from benign to sinister  \u2014   and often serves as a \u201cdog whistle\u201d for racist,   and antigovernment conspiracy theorists. \u201cGlobalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the United States,\u201d said Ryan Lenz, the editor of Hatewatch, a blog published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cIt is the enemy, ultimately. \u201d Globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization, the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions, environmental organizations and opponents of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But for the far right, the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism, xenophobia and   according to Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the   League. Lauren Southern, a host on the   Canadian media site Rebel Media, explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in September. She said the word meant rule by autocrats  \u2014   such as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and the United Nations  \u2014   who value \u201cthe false flag of diversity\u201d and \u201cunchecked immigration from the third world. \u201d \u201cGlobalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition, disdain national culture, laugh at religion and generally despise the West while holding a creepy affection for the third world,\u201d she added. \u201cThey want open borders, cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions, and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it. \u201d Breitbart News, the   website run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s newly appointed chief White House strategist, frequently attacked globalism and   \u201cglobalist elites\u201d during Mr. Bannon\u2019s tenure there. But no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than Alex Jones, a   radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his Infowars media empire. He has been called \u201cthe most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among his claims: the Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Conn. was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an inside job. Mr. Jones posted his own definition of globalism to YouTube in 2014. In his trademark shout, he described it as a \u201cglobal digital panopticon control system\u201d engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites. He called it \u201cthe total form of slavery. \u201d The host, who has enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump, hailed the Republican as a \u201cGeorge  \u201d historical figure. Mr. Trump, who appeared on his show last year, has in turn heaped praise upon Mr. Jones. \u201cYour reputation is amazing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. And I think we\u2019ll be speaking a lot. \u201d So what is Mr. Trump talking about when he talks about globalism? His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, provided a definition in an email before the election last week:   groups in the United States began to refer to globalism at the end of the Cold War, when it replaced communism as an idea that was an   danger to the nation, Mr. Pitcavage said. They have also referred to it as the New World Order, and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere. The shape of that conspiracy had distinctly   overtones, in part because many of communism\u2019s foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to Judaism, Mr. Pitcavage said. Members of the far right became fixated on prominent Jews like the businessman and philanthropist George Soros. Those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former President George Bush celebrated the end of the Cold War in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a \u201cnew world order. \u201d His use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot. \u201cIt was very easy for them, especially because he was the one who said it, to take that ball and run with it,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said. \u201cFrom that point on, the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory. \u201d The term\u2019s multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool, and Mr. Trump\u2019s and his allies\u2019 frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience. \u201c  is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right\u201d from the mainstream to the extreme, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Professor Levin called globalism \u201cthe defining folklore and narrative for the racist right\u201d but said it had also \u201cbecome a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the United States is perceived to be in. \u201d Globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, for example, when he told  a rally in Florida in October that his opponent for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, had sat at the heart of a   conspiracy with international bankers \u201cto plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty. \u201d The   League criticized the speech for \u201cevoking classic   themes. \u201d Conspiratorial talk has continued after the election. Mr. Trump referred to a plot against him again last Thursday, when he complained on Twitter that   protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters. Lou Dobbs, a Trump ally and host on Fox Business News, later accused Mr. Soros of \u201cinciting riots. \u201d Many on the far right have celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy. Last Friday, Mr. Jones claimed on YouTube that Mr. Trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon. Ms. Hicks, the Trump campaign\u2019s spokeswoman, did not reply to an email seeking comment late Sunday night. Mr. Jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important: the coming destruction of \u201cthe globalists that hijacked the country,\u201d primarily the news media and international business people. Soon they would be destroyed once and for all, he suggested. \u201cThis is America battling back to restore humanity and to break the chains,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not gonna be any d\u00e9tente. We know you\u2019re scum, and we\u2019re just here to let you know you\u2019re scum. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561703.4660904}
