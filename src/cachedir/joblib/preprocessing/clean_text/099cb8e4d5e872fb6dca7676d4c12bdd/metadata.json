He was 92. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced his death. Mr. Hiller, who for a time was one of Hollywood\u2019s most commercially potent directors, piloted nearly 70 feature films, television movies and series episodes in a wide range of genres, from the Holocaust drama \u201cThe Man in the Glass Booth\u201d (1975) to the screwball comedy \u201cThe  \u201d (1979). He made two hit films from Neil Simon scripts  \u2014   \u201c   \u201d (1970) and \u201cPlaza Suite\u201d (1971)  \u2014   and two with the popular comic team of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder: \u201cSilver Streak\u201d (1976) and \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\u201d (1989). But Mr. Hiller\u2019s greatest commercial success was \u201cLove Story\u201d (1970) which grossed an imposing $106 million when it was released in 1970, the equivalent of about $665 million today. Based on a screenplay by Erich Segal, a Yale classics scholar (who turned it into a   novel that sold more than five million copies) the film portrayed the tragic romance of a wealthy Harvard law student (Ryan O\u2019Neal) and a Radcliffe music major (Ali MacGraw) the product of a     family. In a time of bruising social upheaval, \u201cLove Story\u201d offered a strong, simple palliative, turning audiences   (though some found it sappy) and catapulting the careers of Mr. O\u2019Neal and Ms. MacGraw. Writing about the movie after the novel was published, the critic Roger Ebert was as admiring of one as he was withering about the other. \u201cThe film of \u2018Love Story\u2019 is infinitely better than the book,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think it has something to do with the quiet taste of Arthur Hiller, its director, who has put in all the things that Segal thought he was being clever to leave out. Things like color, character, personality, detail and background. \u201d Mr. Hiller\u2019s emphatic, uncomplicated direction brought home the themes of class and generational reconciliation embedded in Mr. Segal\u2019s story, while Francis Lai\u2019s score took care of the sentiment. The Canadian critic Robert Fulford, writing in The National Post, saw the movie as a product of its time: \u201cIts plot is a checklist of 1970 obsessions: furious generational conflict, a rich and guilty old man symbolizing the Establishment, and death claiming the young and the beautiful. It\u2019s a Vietnam film in which Vietnam remains offscreen. \u201d Characteristically, Mr. Hiller brought in the production ahead of schedule and under budget, earning his sole Oscar nomination in the process. (Franklin J. Schaffner won the Oscar for \u201cPatton,\u201d that year\u2019s   winner.) \u201cLove Story\u201d earned six other Academy Award nominations, including for best actor (Mr. O\u2019Neal) and best actress (Ms. MacGraw). Mr. Lai\u2019s score won an Oscar. Mr. Hiller\u2019s personal favorite among his films, he often said, was \u201cThe Americanization of Emily,\u201d a 1964 feature set in wartime London about the tentative love affair between a young war widow (Julie Andrews) and an American naval officer (James Garner) as   approaches. Written by Paddy Chayefsky, the film strikes an unusual, precarious balance between social comedy and psychological drama, and drew on Mr. Hiller\u2019s wartime experience as a navigator for the Royal Canadian Air Force, based in Britain. Mr. Hiller teamed with Mr. Chayefsky again in 1971 for \u201cThe Hospital,\u201d a   satire starring George C. Scott and Diana Rigg, set in a dysfunctional New York medical center. \u201cIt isn\u2019t simply that he obtains excellent performances from his stars,\u201d the critic Vincent Canby wrote of Mr. Hiller in The New York Times, \u201cbut he has perfectly cast the film down to roles that are so small, they depend  \u2014   I suspect  \u2014   as much on natural mannerism as on acting talent. \u201d Gentle and   and famous in later years for his nimbus of long, silver hair, Mr. Hiller was much liked in the film industry. He was president of the Directors Guild of America from 1989 to 1993 and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1993 to 1997. In 2002, he received the Academy\u2019s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his philanthropic work. Mr. Hiller was born on Nov. 13, 1923, in Edmonton, Alberta, one of three children of Harry Hiller and the former Rose Garfin, Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father ran a secondhand musical instrument store in Edmonton. His first contact with show business came through his parents, who formed a community theater in Edmonton to present plays in Yiddish. He helped his parents build and paint sets, and made his acting debut at age 11. After high school, Arthur joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and navigated bombers over enemy territory in Europe during World War II. Returning from the war, he enrolled at the University of Toronto, where he studied law and psychology. The lure of the performing life proved irresistible, however, and one day Mr. Hiller walked into the Toronto offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and asked a receptionist where to apply for work. \u201cThree weeks later I was directing talk shows,\u201d he was quoted by Robert J. Emery in the 2002 book \u201cThe Directors: Take Two. \u201d Mr. Hiller began in radio but soon graduated to the new medium of television, where he specialized in the risky,   work of directing live drama. In 1956 he accepted a job and moved to the United States, where he joined an impressive group of young directors  \u2014   including John Frankenheimer, Arthur Penn and Sidney Lumet  \u2014   working on the CBS series \u201cPlayhouse 90. \u201d As live television evolved into filmed programming in the late 1950s, Mr. Hiller became a regular contributor to such series as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cAlfred Hitchcock Presents\u201d and \u201cRoute 66. \u201d His first theatrical film was the 1957 teenage romance \u201cThe Careless Years,\u201d based on a script written under a pseudonym by John Howard Lawson and Mitch Lindemann, who were both blacklisted at the time. The tight shooting schedules and tighter budgets of television had taught Mr. Hiller the importance of careful preparation, and his reputation as a fast,   filmmaker spread quickly. By the   he was well established in Hollywood as a director of light comedies like \u201cPromise Her Anything\u201d (1965) with Warren Beatty and Leslie Caron, and \u201cPenelope\u201d (1966) with Natalie Wood. He went on to direct Alan Arkin in the sentimental comedy \u201cPopi\u201d (1969) and again in \u201cThe \u201d an extravagant farce written by Andrew Bergman. Mr. Arkin played a New York dentist and Peter Falk a loony government agent who enlists him in a plot to assassinate a South American dictator. Then came the Neil Simon films and the Richard Pryor comedies. In between were weightier projects, like the musical \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d (1972) a troubled production on which he replaced Peter Glenville as director \u201cThe Man in the Glass Booth\u201d (1975) for the American Film Theater subscription series, in which Maximilian Schell played a rich Jewish industrialist living in Manhattan who is arrested as a war criminal and \u201cMaking Love\u201d (1982) one of the first Hollywood films to present a love affair between two men (Michael Ontkean and Harry Hamlin) in a positive light. Mr. Hiller is survived by his daughter, Erica Hiller Carpenter his son, Henryk and five grandchildren. His wife, Gwen Hiller, a social worker and librarian, died in June, also at 92. She was born in Edmonton 10 days before her husband. Their family has noted that when they were schoolmates, he proposed to her when they were 8 years old. Their marriage lasted 68 years.'"}, "time": 1742562408.246117}
