He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling\u201d on the jukebox. But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governor\u2019s mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their    daughter, Chelsea. The morning after the election, Hillary Clinton worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help. \u201cThe world changed. There was a tectonic shift,\u201d said Thomas F. McLarty III, a friend of Mr. Clinton\u2019s who served as his White House chief of staff. Mr. Clinton was of little use as he fixated on voters\u2019 rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Mrs. Clinton glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelsea\u2019s college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve. \u201cIt was up to her to just keep holding things up,\u201d said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s who moved to Arkansas to work for Mr. Clinton in the 1970s. Hillary Clinton\u2019s relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband. But Mrs. Clinton can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed, and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result  \u2014   from serving on the corporate board of Walmart while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1. 35 million mortgage personally secured by a top   for the family\u2019s home in Chappaqua, N. Y. Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this election cycle, given voters\u2019 anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them \u201ca lot\u2019\u2019 that Mrs. Clinton gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June. Donald J. Trump has called Mrs. Clinton \u201ctotally owned by Wall Street. \u201d Mr. Trump, whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but \u201cRepublicans can say, \u2018This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance,\u2019\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Even some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service. But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s practicality and the    cycles that have characterized her life with Bill Clinton. At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shoulders than in the difficult   period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden. \u201cHillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job,\u201d said James B. Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer who offered Mrs. Clinton investment advice in the 1970s. The Clintons\u2019 unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and    schemes as companies like Tyson and Walmart minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South. A generation of Ivy   young people like Mr. Clinton had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, a worrier by nature, Mr. Clinton, consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future. \u201cHe was never interested in money, ever,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cShe is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college. \u201d People close to Mrs. Clinton don\u2019t begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cI really think it\u2019s much simpler than that,\u201d adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office. It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rock\u2019s Hillcrest section, and Mrs. Clinton largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 election loss. She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant   . She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway and chased after the family\u2019s cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence. The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112, 000 home, which was down the hill from the city\u2019s   mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close that it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons\u2019 grassy backyard. Friends described the d\u00e9cor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cThat couch just jumped out at me,\u201d said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Mr. Clinton, describing a   Victorian chaise that Mr. Clinton\u2019s mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. \u201cIt was in some bright, violent color. \u201d And with no parents or   in Little Rock, Mrs. Clinton turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governor\u2019s mansion while Mr. Clinton was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her. A neighbor, Manuel J. Lozano, recalled: Hillary \u201cwas running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help. \u201d Mr. Clinton had turned down    job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve \u201cof counsel\u201d for $55, 000 a year at the Wright, Lindsey  Jennings law firm, where Mr. Clinton\u2019s longtime adviser Bruce R. Lindsey was a partner. But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Mr. Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters. \u201cHe had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost,\u201d Mrs. Pietrafesa recalled, \u201cand every one of those visits was a     or   ordeal. \u201d Mrs. Clinton had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years, she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Mr. Clinton crisscrossed the state, friends said. She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governor\u2019s wife. \u201cThe whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat,\u201d Jerry C. Jones, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s colleague at the firm, remembered. Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm  \u2014   a practice known for representing the business and political elite  \u2014   had she not been concerned about her family\u2019s finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Mrs. Clinton as an \u201coddity\u201d there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and   clothes. (Mrs. Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.) \u201cI\u2019m not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer,\u201d said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Mrs. Clinton. But she did the work because \u201cshe had the earning capacity that he didn\u2019t have as governor. \u201d Growing up in the    suburb of Park Ridge, Ill. Hillary Rodham  \u2014   whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose   father preached frugality  \u2014   babysat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things. \u201cHer mother came from nothing and her father was   so there\u2019s always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living,\u201d said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide. There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Mr. Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted that his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed. By the time she was a student at Wellesley College, Mrs. Clinton and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living,\u201d she declared. When she moved to Fayetteville, Ark. and later married Mr. Clinton in 1975, the Yale   couple lived happily earning about $18, 000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Mr. Clinton planned his run for the governor\u2019s office and the couple worried about starting a family, Mrs. Clinton grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg. \u201cShe had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision maker,\u201d her best friend, Diane D. Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era. Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful  \u2014   and many of the Clintons\u2019 contemporaries were getting rich. \u201cThe smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful,\u201d said William K. Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of   City. Mrs. Clinton began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life. Mr. Blair, the Clintons\u2019 close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market, and urged Mrs. Clinton to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1, 000, she made nearly $100, 000 trading cattle futures in a   period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the Clinton presidency. It still trails her occasionally: Mr. Trump raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being \u201ccrooked. \u201d \u201cLook at her cattle futures! \u2019\u2019 he called out to the crowd. Also in 1978, another friend, James B. McDougal, persuaded Mrs. Clinton to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Mr. Clinton was in the White House. The deals were certainly tempting, given the couple\u2019s income at the time. In 1978, Mr. Clinton became one of the youngest, and lowest paid, governors, in the country, earning $33, 519. 14 his first year in office. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51, 173. Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Mrs. Clinton told her broker she wanted out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take the stress,\u201d she said at a campaign stop in June. She would, however, continue to shoulder her family\u2019s financial worries. Not long after Mr. Clinton won   in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governor\u2019s mansion, where they once again had free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governor\u2019s term to four years, and the Clintons\u2019 finances appeared more stable. Mrs. Clinton went on to join the board of Walmart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Mr. Clinton was running for president, they reported $297, 177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot. \u201cWhen we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman,\u201d Mr. Clinton has said. The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Mrs. Clinton wrote a book, \u201cIt Takes a Village,\u2019\u2019 for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. \u201cHRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks),\u201d Mrs. Blair wrote at the time. Still, the couple\u2019s earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Mr. Clinton\u2019s relationship with a White House intern, which led to the president\u2019s impeachment by the House of Representatives. When the Clintons left the White House after the 2000 election  \u2014   the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years  \u2014   they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Mrs. Clinton described her family\u2019s situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: \u201cDead broke. \u201d Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton campaign   who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House. But this time, the home  \u2014   a $1. 7 million,   Dutch Colonial in Chappaqua, a rich suburb  \u2014   was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Mrs. Clinton did not have to call the   every time the old pipes clogged or run to a neighbor\u2019s house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street. And now it was Mrs. Clinton, eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign.'"}, "time": 1742628426.5530071}
