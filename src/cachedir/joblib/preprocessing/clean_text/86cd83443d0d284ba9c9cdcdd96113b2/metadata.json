You\u2019re welcome.\u201d \\nAfter a spate of crowd disturbances at the ground, Hammers fans had complained of a return to the dark days of the early eighties, where only \u2018unpredictable\u2019 circular coins could be deployed as missiles at games. \\nWest Ham fan Simon Williams congratulated the Royal Mint on the technological advances which have seen multiple \u2018stabilising\u2019 edges introduced. \\nHe told us, \u201cI\u2019m reasonably confident that with this new coin I could pick out the skull of an opposition player, or supporter for that matter, from way up in the gods. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re quite weighty \u2013 I had become accustomed to launching 20p\u2019s, but they only leave flesh wounds \u2013 these babies could do serious brain damage. \\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s difficult to inflict brain damage upon Millwall fans, but it will be fun trying! \\nWest Ham vice-chair Karen Brady hoped the temptation to start launching whole pounds could see match day takings increase significantly. \\n\u201cListen, if they want to start targeting the directors\u2019 seats then please, by all means, do so. \\n\u201cIn fact, I\u2019d like to see all denominations of our fabled currency \u2018go coin\u2019. \\n\u201cIf someone could chuck us a \u00a350 we\u2019d happily throw Andy Carroll back at them in retaliation.\u201d Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!
