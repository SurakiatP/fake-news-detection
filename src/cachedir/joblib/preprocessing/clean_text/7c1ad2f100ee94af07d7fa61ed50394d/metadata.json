The temperature was well below freezing and for hours the police sprayed the crowd water cannons, fired many rounds of flash bang grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas, and used the LRAD acoustic weapon to disperse dissidents. \\nHere\u2019s a video of the assault, from TYT . \\nDuring the assault, at least one elder was left in critical condition and it is reported that 13-year old girl suffered serious injuries when shot with a rubber bullet. \\nThis is happening in America, to Americans, by American police, which makes it quite newsworthy to Americans. \\nWe know without question, without even having to ask, that any crackdown on \u2018fake news\u2019 will not in any way apply to mainstream, corporate news sources such as the major newspapers and the major cable news networks. \\nA scan of \u2018real news\u2019 sources the morning after this major confrontation between police and resistors at Standing Rock reveals that stories like this, stories of resistance to corporate rule and government authoritarianism. \\nThese Sources Did Not Report On This: \\nCNN.com \u2013 Although the homepage of CNN features around a hundred stories, as of the time of this post, there was no mention whatsoever about the Standing Rock confrontation last night. \\nMSNBC.com \u2013 No mention whatsoever of this event on this mainstream news site. The top 6 posts at the time this article was written were all about Donald Trump, his cabinet picks, and how his administration was going to be terrible. \\nCBS News \u2013 No coverage of this story on the CBS News homepage. \\nDrudgeReport.com \u2013 This story has not been aggregated on the Drudge Report. \\nThese Sources Did Report on This: \\nFoxNews.com \u2013 The confrontation did make it the homepage of Fox, but not as a headline story. A short video was included, and the coverage was short and to the point.'"}, "time": 1742562621.1403787}
