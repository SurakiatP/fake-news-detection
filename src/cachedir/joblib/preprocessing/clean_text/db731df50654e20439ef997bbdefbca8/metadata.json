Kellyanne Conway is on MSNBC now falsely saying Hillary Clinton is \"under FBI investigation.\" This is what Jim Comey has wrought. \\n\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) October 29, 2016 \\nAre we back to that whole \u201croutine security review\u201d talking point, or is Clinton not under investigation? Because the letter Comey sent to FBI employees Friday gave that impression pretty strongly: \\nThis morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them. \\nOf course, we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. \\n\u2014 #NeverTrump Rob G (@NYYFan63) October 29, 2016 @brianefallon Sounds like you didn\u2019t get the FBI memo. \\n\u2014 DC Dude (@DCDude1776) October 29, 2016 . @brianefallon She\\'s right!
