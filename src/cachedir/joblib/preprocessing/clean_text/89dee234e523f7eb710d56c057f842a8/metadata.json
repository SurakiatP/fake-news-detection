The Auckland Council-commissioned Transit Cloud has been created as part of a project to breathe new life into traditionally working class New Lynn. \\nThe aerial component \u2013 four aluminium mesh cloud forms \u2013 hangs more than 8m over a lane linking New Lynn\u2019s shiny new railway and bus station with the town\u2019s library and shopping mall. \\nThe clouds allude to the sky, but two of the forms are being viewed very differently by locals. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s a cock and balls,\u201d said Phil Wellman, of Blockhouse Bay. \\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s rude?\u201d said Henderson mother Janine Waters, walking her two young children in a pram. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely that. What else could it be,\u201d she said. Another woman, who did not want to be named, called the forms \u201cmasculine\u201d. \\nFrances Toohey, who works at Pita Pit by the lane, said the sculpture was very phallic. Customers had been commenting a lot, she said. \u201cWhat the hell is that? It\u2019s certainly not a cloud. It looks like a penis,\u201d said Joy Dale, of Mt Roskill. She said the sculpture was a waste of ratepayers\u2019 money and the council would be better spending the money on more security and patrols in the area. \\nSculptor Gregor Kregar, who with his artist wife Sara Hughes and architect Davor Popadich created the work, said there was never any intention of creating a large phallic image in the sky . \\nTransit Cloud, he said, was connected to 30,000 tinted ceramic dots in the laneway floor, acknowledging the local portage history and modern transport focus of the precinct. The forms above resembled clouds and liquid matter, like raindrops. \\n\u201cArt is out there to stir reaction,\u201d said Kregar. He was confident people would embrace the work after 50m of neon lights are connected in each form. The sculptor gave the Herald images of the clouds lit up in his New Lynn studio to show how the finished work would look at night. \\nMr. Popadich was surprised by the public response to the sculpture, saying it had a joyful and fun aspect . Council arts and culture manager Kaye Glamuzina said art was always controversial and interpretation subjective. \\nFrom Kregar\u2019s website : \\n\u201c I utilize familiar subject matter such as human figure, body parts , television sets, bottles, inorganic rubbish and animals. I am interested in how the familiar subject can be represented in a way that displaces the original meaning and imbues the subject with new and unfamiliar meanings. My work deals with issues of ambiguity and the uncanny yet it is strongly connected to the social, economical and political environment I live in.\u201d \\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of his other work, shall we? \\nThis exhibition brings together what appear to be two very different groups of work; Gnomes and Geometric constructions. They do not appear, at first glance, to have any relationship to one another, yet conceptually and historically their paths cross at many points. The gnomes are caught in an existence between the happy and helpful gnome and the frozen mystical being. Practising this alchemy of the everyday, the gnomes are turned from the familiar into sublime, the trivial into a precious and valuable, achieving the noble levels of human perception, emotion and appreciation of the world . Wall \u201cart\u201d next to oversized gnomes. \\nSculptor Gregor Kregar is known for his works that challenge the traditional meaning of his subjects . Often representing works in a way that displaces traditional interpretations, Kregar imbues his subjects in new and unfamiliar environments or surroundings. In Reflective Synthesis two oversized gnomes dominate the gallery space in Kregar\u2019s exploration of the trivial everyday aesthetic of his subject, in relation to its mystical and scientific history. \\nHope the taxpayers are happy with this most recent purchase! \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742563320.4914396}
