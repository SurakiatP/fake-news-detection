There\u2019s no mother ship hovering above the earth, waiting to carry you away, and no demon shooting light from beneath, signaling to pull you below. It\u2019s a light pillar  \u2014   or a few of them  \u2014   a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky. It\u2019s all just an icy illusion. And now, during winter, when nights are long and cold, you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right. If you\u2019re lucky enough to spot a light pillar, what you\u2019re seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals. \u201cIt\u2019s not an upward beam of light,\u201d said Les Cowley, a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics, or the way light travels through the atmosphere. \u201cAlthough they look pretty, they\u2019re also a sign that someone, somewhere could do better with their lighting. You might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it. \u201d Light pillars occur when   clouds  \u2014   normally miles high in the atmosphere  \u2014   cling closer to the Earth\u2019s surface, just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it. These thin clouds contain millions of flat, hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air Each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward, reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes  \u2014   as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source. Together, the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights, which allows you to see the light as a column if they all were at the same level, you\u2019d see only a spot of light. The pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source. To find a good source  \u2014   one bright, close to the ground, and just far enough away  \u2014   your best bet is to travel a few miles outside your city or town on a dark night. The weather doesn\u2019t have to be frigid, but it helps. Light pillars are frequently spotted in Scandinavia, upstate New York, Canada and other cold spots in the winter. But Dr. Cowley said that this week he received a photo of light pillars from about 30 miles outside of a town in Iran  \u2014   perhaps because the desert can get cold at night. If leaving the city is not an option, look up at streetlights on a freezing cold night. You may spot the sparkly, ghostly blur of diamond dust. This illusion is created by the same flat ice crystals that produce light pillars, but this time, they\u2019re so low to the ground you can feel them prickling your skin. \u201cWhen that happens, you see other nearby halos, and it\u2019s quite a spectacular sight,\u201d Dr. Cowley said.'"}, "time": 1742562292.6912906}
