Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, lashed out against the Black Lives Matter movement on Sunday, accusing it of ignoring    crime, inspiring violence against the police and promoting racism. \u201cWhen you say black lives matter, that\u2019s inherently racist,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. Asian lives matter. Hispanic lives matter. That\u2019s   and it\u2019s racist. \u201d His comments came as the country grappled with pain, confusion and anger after last week\u2019s two fatal shootings of   men by the police and the killing of five police officers in Dallas, the deadliest assault on American law enforcement since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. As members of the Black Lives Matter movement and other concerned citizens pushed forward on Sunday with protests over police shootings, politicians, law enforcement officials and   leaders took to the airwaves, most of them with messages of hope, unity and understanding. Mr. Giuliani, a longtime promoter of aggressive policing, struck a different chord, saying the Black Lives Matter movement had targeted police officers. \u201cThey sing rap songs about killing police officers, and they talk about killing police officers, and they yell it out at their rallies and the police officers hear it,\u201d he said. Mr. Giuliani said the movement unfairly focused on killings at the hands of the police when it should be focusing on murders committed by civilians in black neighborhoods. \u201cWhen there are 60 shootings in Chicago over the Fourth of July and 14 murders, and Black Lives Matter is nonexistent,\u201d he said, \u201cand then there\u2019s one police murder of very questionable circumstances and we hear from Black Lives Matter, we wonder: Do black lives matter, or only the very few black lives that are killed by white policemen?\u201d Terrence Cunningham, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, who appeared on the same show, was quick to dismiss Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make that connection,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s Black Lives Matter that put a target on those police officers,\u201d Mr. Cunningham continued, adding, \u201cUnfortunately, I think, you know, people have really polarized this issue. If we really want to work towards solutions, we need to work together. \u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who also appeared on the show, suggested that Mr. Giuliani was partly to blame for the rift. \u201cHe actually presided over one of the most discredited areas and periods of policing in the City of New York,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is, in fact, responsible for a lot of the tension that exists between police officers and people in   communities. \u201d They were not the only ones to point fingers. In an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who is considered a potential running mate for Donald J. Trump, criticized Hillary Clinton for saying on Friday that white people needed to start listening to \u201clegitimate cries\u201d from  . Mr. Flynn said that Mrs. Clinton was \u201ctotally irresponsible when she talked about white people being to blame. \u201d William J. Bratton, the New York police commissioner, who appeared on Sunday on multiple shows, was among the many who emphasized unity. \u201cThis is a shared responsibility, trying to bridge these differences that are becoming quite evident through many of these videos,\u201d Mr. Bratton said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201d \u201cWe have come a long way we have come a very long way. And I can speak for New York, but quite clearly events this past week show we have really almost just begun the journey. \u201d Separately on Sunday, as Mr. Trump has faced skepticism from some Republicans over his stances on abortion and other social issues, General Flynn, a Democrat, indicated a willingness to break from his party affiliation. During his appearance on \u201cThis Week,\u201d he voiced support for abortion rights and brushed aside the issue of   marriage on the grounds that it was less important than matters like education and immigration.'"}, "time": 1742564468.202028}
