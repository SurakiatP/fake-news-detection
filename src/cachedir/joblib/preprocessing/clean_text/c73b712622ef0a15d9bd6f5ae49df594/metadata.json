It\u2019s like reading the news lit by lightning. \u201d As of Monday evening, tickets for the event were still on sale through Vivid Seats. All The President\u2019s Men? is the latest production to tackle Trump and his administration using the theater stage. On Monday, documentary filmmaker and   activist Michael Moore announced he will mount a   Broadway show, titled The Terms of My Surrender, that he hopes will be able to \u201cbring down\u201d the president.
