That\u2019s less diversity than you\u2019ll find in Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet thus far. Of The Times\u2019s newly named White House team, all six are white, as is most everyone in the Washington bureau. Traveling to other departments, Metro has only three Latinos among its 42 reporters, in a city with the second largest Hispanic population in the country. Sports has one Asian man, two Hispanics and no   among its 21 reporters, yet blacks are plentiful among the teams they cover and the audience they serve. In the Styles section, every writer is white, while American culture is anything but. The executive editor, Dean Baquet, is  . The other editors on his masthead are white. The staff with the most diversity? The news assistants, who mostly do administrative jobs and get paid the least. The Times can be relentless in questioning the diversity at other institutions it has written about the white ranks of the technology sector, public schools, police departments, Oscar nominees, law firms, legislatures, the major leagues and the Ivy League. Fixing its own problems comes less easily. The newsroom\u2019s blinding whiteness hit me when I walked in the door six months ago. It\u2019s hardly a new problem here, but it\u2019s one that persists even as the country grows more diverse and The Times grows more global. The head of that global expansion, Lydia Polgreen, was one of The Times\u2019s     editors until she left last week to lead The Huffington Post. Her departure hit the whole newsroom hard, but it was especially a blow to many minority journalists here. In the past three months, I have interviewed people across the newsroom about the issue of race (and to some degree gender, which I\u2019ll address in a future column). I\u2019ve spoken with journalists of all racial and ethnic identities, in jobs high and low: white men and black women, editors and reporters, department heads and news assistants. It left me believing there is a level of frustration bordering on anger that would be institutionally reckless not to address. Many journalists hoped a new era was beginning two and a half years ago, when Baquet became the first   to oversee the newsroom. But whatever progress has been made is only beginning to show up on a scorecard. Overall, newsroom diversity is at 22 percent, up slightly but below newsrooms in most big metropolitan areas. And of those who head departments here, only three are people of color. I asked Baquet what he believes minorities in the newsroom would say about his senior team\u2019s dedication to diversity. \u201cI think they\u2019d say we have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not diverse enough. But I think they\u2019d say I have a commitment to it and that it\u2019s gotten better in the past year. \u201d He added, \u201cMy effort to diversify has been intense and persistent. \u201d By that, Baquet particularly means the handful of prominent black journalists he\u2019s helped attract or promote, stars like Nikole   Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham, all coveted by The Times\u2019s competitors. Their writing styles offer a refreshing break from The Times\u2019s rather institutional voice, which  \u2014   as one black editor put it to me  \u2014   is older, white, male, Ivy League and authoritative. \u201cThat\u2019s who The Times is at a dinner party,\u201d she said. Many of those I spoke with, including Latinos and Asians, said the arrival of a few stars can take the focus away from the real issue of bringing in and retaining diversity across the room. In other words, while big names are rightfully celebrated, they can give the appearance of more diversity than there really is. What\u2019s more, just because an   is at the helm, it doesn\u2019t mean all is well in the newsroom he runs. \u201cWe can\u2019t look to Dean as proof that everything is O. K. and we also can\u2019t look solely to him for solutions,\u201d said Nikita Stewart, a Metro staff reporter. When you ask managers about the issue individually, everyone genuinely seems to care. Collectively, however, not much changes. They begin by saying this is an industrywide problem, not just a New York Times problem. That is true, unquestionably. On the other hand, it\u2019s also true that data from the American Society of News Editors shows that The Times is less diverse than large papers like The Washington Post (31 percent) The Los Angeles Times (34 percent) and The Miami Herald (41 percent). The Times is more diverse than The Boston Globe (17 percent) and The Philadelphia Inquirer (14 percent). Given The Times\u2019s ambitions across global cultures and languages, it would seem that instead of being a lagger, it would insist on being a leader  \u2014   and make that an explicit goal. I see no sign that this is happening. Nor do I get the impression from many journalists of color I spoke with that they believe progress is on the horizon. \u201cThere\u2019s always a reason for such little diversity in newsrooms. Over the course of time, the reasons always change, but the underrepresentation never does,\u201d said   who writes for the Times Magazine, one of the few notably diverse staffs in the building. Ernesto Londo\u00f1o, who sits on The Times\u2019s editorial board  \u2014   and on an Opinion staff lacking both gender and racial diversity  \u2014   believes the problem lies in a failure of editors to step outside their    circles. \u201cIt takes a concerted effort to break out of that habit and tap talent pools that are more diverse,\u201d Londo\u00f1o said. Which means that unless the pattern breaks, the whiter the newsroom is, the whiter it will stay. Mark Thompson, The Times chief executive officer, told a group of top leaders across the corporate and news sides last spring that managers could face dismissal if they failed to diversify their staffs. Baquet, who was at the meeting, didn\u2019t sound that militant in our conversation, saying that his editors feel the most pressure through a stringent expectation to bring forth a diverse applicant pool for every job opening. No one has been punished, he says. I can tell diversity isn\u2019t a priority here by looking at what is. Think digital transition or global expansion or subscriber growth or visual innovation. Those are mandates that really power up the engines. Diversity is not at that level, at least yet. This issue has challenged most every newsroom manager, myself included. The newsroom I came from, The Washington Post, is quite diverse, but its leadership is heavily white and male. At The Times, on the other hand, people of color seem shut out of all sorts of coveted jobs: the top digital strategists, the top managers, the precious ranks of cultural critics, the White House press corps, the opinion columnists, the national politics jobs  \u2014   all are overwhelmingly white. It is possible to change this. But The Times will need more humility, introspection and openness than has been its habit in the past. Note: This column explores The Times\u2019s diversity crisis, primarily through race. Future columns will address the struggles to fix this issue, news coverage, the widening gender gap, and the limited geographic, religious and ideological diversity.
