The only other place where a singularity occurs in the Universe and all the known laws of physics are temporarily abandoned is at the event horizon of a black hole \u2013 which scientists cannot explain.\\nScroll Down For Video Below What is odd about black holes is that the even horizon is two-dimensional in an otherwise completely three-dimensional universe. This means that there is something that we are unable to perceive and the theory, which was first suggested in 2014 and is now under serious scrutinisation, claims that our Universe is the result of a singularity of a huge black hole.\\nIn simpler terms, there is a possibility that our three-dimensional Universe is surrounding the event horizon of a four-dimensional Universe. A 2014 study from the Perimeter Institute and University of Waterloo stated: \u201cIn this scenario, our Universe burst into being when a star in a four-dimensional universe collapsed into a black hole.\\nRe-visiting the theory recently, Ethan Siegel, a professor of physics and astronomy at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, explained how a black hole could have formed in another universe which led matter to \u201cfall\u201d into our Universe.\\nDr Siegel wrote for Forbes: \u201cAs the black hole first formed, from a star\u2019s core imploding and collapsing, the event horizon first came to be, then rapidly expanded and continued to grow in area as more and more matter continued to fall in.\\n\u201cIf you were to put a coordinate grid down on this two-dimensional wrapping, you would find that it originated where the gridlines were very close together, then expanded rapidly as the black hole formed, and then expanded more and more slowly as matter fell in at a much lower rate.\\n\u201cThis matches, at least conceptually, what we observe for the expansion rate of our three-dimensional Universe.\u201d\\n'"}, "time": 1742562061.4875762}
