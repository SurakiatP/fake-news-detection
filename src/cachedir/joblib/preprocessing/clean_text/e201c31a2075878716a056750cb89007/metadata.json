In a formal ceremony at the Dusit Palace in Bangkok, the prince, crowned as King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, 64, accepted the invitation to take the throne offered by the National Assembly president. Afterward, Prime Minister Prayuth   said in a televised speech that the new monarch would be declared king retroactively to the day his father passed away. He also will be known as King Rama X of the Chakri dynasty. \u201cThe heir to the throne graciously accepted the invitation,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cA kingdom should not be without a monarch on the throne. The commencement of the new reign is therefore effective as of 13 October 2016. \u201d The crown prince had declined to take the throne immediately after his father\u2019s death, saying he needed time to grieve. Thailand\u2019s royal succession is an elaborate process that can extend for many months. King Bhumibol\u2019s cremation will take place about a year after his death. King Vajiralongkorn\u2019s coronation will take place at some point after that. King Bhumibol was revered by many Thais who saw him as an advocate of the common people and a promoter of economic development. The official   mourning period for the public has ended, but even now many people still wear black clothing or a black ribbon to honor him. The country is sharply divided but the military, which has held power since a 2014 coup, remains firmly in control. King Bhumibol was a unifying figure and many Thais have been anxious about what kind of leadership they can expect from King Vajiralongkorn, who has lived primarily in Germany for years. \u201cAlthough we all know that to be parted from the person we love and respect is suffering,\u201d the prime minister said, \u201calthough the loss and sadness are an undeniable crisis, we should turn this crisis into an opportunity and turn grief into the strength of the land. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562083.0397723}
