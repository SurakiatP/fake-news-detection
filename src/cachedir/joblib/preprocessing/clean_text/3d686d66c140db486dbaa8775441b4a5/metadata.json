This historically divisive election year has prompted Oldenburg, a 29-year-old public relations specialist who lives in New York City, to make a new dating rule: no Donald Trump supporters. \\n\u201cTalking about politics on a first date is a big no-no,\u201d she said. \u201cBut given the state of affairs and how awful things have been, I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to try and determine if I\u2019m on the same page as whomever I\u2019m dating at the time.\u201d \\nShe added: \u201cJust because Donald Trump\u2019s comments have been so repulsive and disgusting that I don\u2019t even want to be on a date with somebody who supports that person.\u201d \\nTrump and his demagogic presidential campaign have proven to be a major friction point in friendships, family relationships and even some marriages, as Americans grapple with one of the ugliest, most polarizing elections in American history.'"}, "time": 1742561977.0211086}
