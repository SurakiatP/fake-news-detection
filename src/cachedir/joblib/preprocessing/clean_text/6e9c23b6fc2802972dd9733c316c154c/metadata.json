[Shortly after   Trump announced that he will be handing over complete control of his companies to his sons, one journalist asked whether or not he will be releasing his tax returns. \u201cDoes Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise, and, if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?\u201d the reporter asked.   \u201cI had no dealings with Russia, I have no deals in Russia,\u201d said   Trump, \u201cI have no deals that could happen in Russia because we\u2019ve stayed away and I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. \u201d \u201cI have no loans with Russia and I thought that was important, I certified that, so I have no deals, I have no loans, I have no deals. We could make deals in Russia very easily if I wanted to, I just don\u2019t want to because I think that would be a conflict of interest. So I have no loans, no deals, and no current pending deals with Russia. \u201d The reporter further pressed Trump as to whether or not he would release his tax returns. The   replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not releasing tax returns because you know they\u2019re under audit,\u201d to which the reporter retorted that the last six presidents have released their tax returns. \u201cYou know the only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters,\u201d said Trump gesturing to the room. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the American public is concerned about them?\u201d asked the reporter. \u201cNo I don\u2019t think they\u2019re concerned, I won,\u201d replied the  . \u201cI don\u2019t think they care at all, I don\u2019t think they care, I think you care,\u201d said Trump to cheers from the crowd. \u201cFirst of all, you learn very little from a tax return. What you should do is go down to the federal elections and take a look at the numbers and actually people have learned a lot about my company and now they realized my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We\u2019re in many many countries and I\u2019m very proud of it. \u201d Watch the full exchange from the livestream below.
