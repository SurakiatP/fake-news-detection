[The fear is even more widespread among women, the study published by German legal expenses insurance group ROLAND found.  Of the female respondents, 74 per cent said they sometimes feel unsafe in crowded places, and nine per cent felt permanently threatened and scared. The authors state: \u201cA large part of the population doesn\u2019t feel safe anymore when visiting crowded places. The fear of becoming the victim of a terrorist attack with a high number of casualties is considerable. \u201cA total of 45 per cent of respondents feel uneasy when visiting crowded locations like stations, festivals or even in the downtowns. \u201cThree percent of the population feel permanently unsafe when visiting a public place along with many other people. \u201d The poll, of 1, 458 citizens over    was conducted in October, before the Islamic State truck attack on the Berlin Christmas market in which Tunisia migrant murdered 12 people. The truck rampage was Germany\u2019s worst terror atrocity since the 1980s, but followed 21 months of Islamist suicide bombings, shootings, and axe attacks. The terrorist killers responsible have included numerous \u201crefugees\u201d from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Algeria, as well as several German citizens of Turkish descent indoctrinated in radical Islam. Around seven of the plots and attacks are thought to have been linked to Islamic State. Germany appears to have become a target of Islamist aggression since the beginning of the migrant crisis in the summer of 2015, with some blaming Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open borders mass migration policy. Several serious plots have been foiled by security forces. In February last year, three Algerians said to have \u201clived in refugee shelters\u201d were arrested for plotting to attack Berlin. The men had links to Islamic State, and the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s office said they were aware of a \u201cconcrete\u201d plan to target the German capital.'"}, "time": 1742562127.0740962}
