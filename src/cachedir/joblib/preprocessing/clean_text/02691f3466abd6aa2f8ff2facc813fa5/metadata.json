{"duration": 0.17266416549682617, "input_args": {"text": "'On the morning they finished shooting the pilot for \u201cWestworld,\u201d the married showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy commandeered a golf cart and went for a drive around Sweetwater, the Old West town they built for the show on Gene Autry\u2019s former ranch studio in Santa Clarita, Calif. \u201cThe sun filtered through everything, and it was this beautiful moment,\u201d Ms. Joy recalled recently. \u201cFor once, there was nowhere to rush, the pages were shot. We rode through that town together, and we were done with this massive endeavor. \u201d In fact, they were just getting started. Still to come were nine more episodes of this audacious   western production delays that would cast doubt on the show\u2019s future and, as its Sunday, Oct. 2, premiere date was finally announced, the pressure of reviving HBO\u2019s drama slate as \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d another   epic with lots of violence and naked people, enters its twilight. Based on the 1973 Michael Crichton film, \u201cWestworld\u201d is about a dark Disneyland where the wealthy can wallow in incredibly lifelike Old West fantasy, shooting or sleeping with whomever they choose. The objects of their depredations are humanoid robot \u201chosts\u201d who believe themselves to be actual gunslingers, brothel madams and ranchers\u2019 daughters. That is until flickers of memory and insight threaten to reveal that the hosts were actually built by   scientists, a programmer explains, to \u201cgratify the desires of the people who pay to visit your world. \u201d Myriad awakenings, reckonings and complex existential conflicts ensue. The series is the result of a longtime fascination with the film by J. J. Abrams, a creator of \u201cLost,\u201d the director of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d and the executive producer who hired Mr. Nolan and Ms. Joy to reimagine the story. A show of imposing sweep, thorny philosophical quandaries and an impressive cast including Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright and Evan Rachel Wood, it is also HBO\u2019s most visually ambitious offering since \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d a global hit that remains the network\u2019s last successful drama, even though it debuted in 2011. HBO doesn\u2019t expect \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d  ratings (the most recent season finale drew 8. 9 million viewers) but it hopes \u201cWestworld\u201d can end a   slide defined by   curiosities like \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d and expensive failures like \u201cVinyl,\u201d the 1970s music business show that was canceled in June after its first season. While     like this summer\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of\u201d have done well for HBO, \u201cwhat we need is an ongoing drama series,\u201d said Casey Bloys, the network\u2019s president for programming. Up to now, however, \u201cWestworld\u201d has been cast as an ongoing drama of another kind, dogged by delays and the occasional   casting notice. HBO originally said \u201cWestworld\u201d would debut in 2015, and a production shutdown last November, in particular, raised speculation that the showrunners had bitten off more than they could chew. While this was at least temporarily true  \u2014   the producers realized they needed to stop shooting to focus on finishing the scripts  \u2014   the metanarrative of \u201cWestworld\u201d as a troubled production threatened to overtake the actual storytelling. (HBO never considered pulling the plug, Mr. Bloys said.) \u201cBecause there\u2019s so much mystery surrounding the show and because it seems so ambitious, it\u2019s probably easy for people to assume it\u2019s just a disaster,\u201d said Ms. Wood, who plays an increasingly skeptical host named Delores. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. \u201d Early reviews have been mostly raves, praising the transportive quality and sophisticated themes about human nature and consciousness. And the performances, especially from Ms. Wood, Mr. Hopkins as the possibly malevolent mastermind Dr. Robert Ford and Ms. Newton as the madam Maeve, are nuanced and layered. \u201cThe show has taken a premise that could be seen as sort of primitive and simply about revenge and explored it on an emotionally complex level,\u201d Mr. Abrams said. He had been pondering a \u201cWestworld\u201d reboot off and on since discussing the concept more than 20 years ago with Crichton, who died in 2008. But Mr. Nolan, who goes by Jonah, and Ms. Joy weren\u2019t interested in taking on big television projects in 2013, when Mr. Abrams proposed reimagining it as a cable drama. Mr. Nolan, who had worked on films like \u201cInterstellar,\u201d \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d and \u201cMemento\u201d with his brother Christopher before creating the CBS series \u201cPerson of Interest,\u201d hoped to direct feature films. Ms. Joy, who wrote for shows like \u201cBurn Notice\u201d and \u201cPushing Daisies,\u201d was developing a movie version of \u201cBattlestar Galactica. \u201d Ultimately, they were drawn in by the chance to explore issues surrounding artificial intelligence and \u201cthe idea that humans are getting ever better at immersing themselves in their narrative fictions,\u201d Mr. Nolan said. While the movie \u201cWestworld\u201d was a campy predecessor to the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies as well as Crichton\u2019s more successful \u201cJurassic Park\u201d  \u2014   with Yul Brynner\u2019s   gunfighter in the inexorable predator role later filled by terminators and velociraptors  \u2014   the series takes its cues from headier   like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cEx Machina. \u201d It flips the main perspective of Crichton\u2019s story, and thus viewers\u2019 sympathies, from the human guests to the robot hosts. And it poses provocative questions about the depths to which humans will sink when there aren\u2019t consequences. In \u201cWestworld,\u201d generally it\u2019s the people, not the robots, who are the monsters an early scene finds an Old West bro shooting an android cowboy in the back of the head for sport and exclaiming, \u201cNow that\u2019s a [expletive] vacation!\u201d In the most explicit inversion of the source material, Brynner\u2019s mechanical outlaw is now a veteran Westworld tourist with a taste for cruelty and a mysterious agenda. He is played by Ed Harris in his first substantial series television role. \u201cIt was Jonah and Lisa\u2019s commitment and passion for their idea that kind of sold me on it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re using the future of artificial intelligence to explore the nature of what makes us who we are. \u201d Other actors were drawn by expansive roles  \u2014   \u201cI got be to a cowboy and a robot at the same time!\u201c Ms. Wood recalled with glee  \u2014   that gave primacy to characters most westerns leave on the margins, like the madam or the frontier girl next door. \u201cIf this wasn\u2019t an empowering role for women, it was going to be a major problem,\u201d Ms. Newton said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m nude for so much of the film. \u201d Ah yes, the nudity. As suggested by the trailers, it is abundant, and it became a flash point during the production when a \u201cWestworld\u201d casting notice informed   extras that they may be required \u201cto perform    touching\u201d or \u201cpose on all fours while others who are fully nude ride on your back,\u201d among other indignities. HBO disavowed the notice, saying it was never requested by the producers. (  the actors guild, protested at the time, but a spokeswoman confirmed that it received no complaints from members about the shoot.) In general, the nudity is more clinical than titillating, mostly relegated to the gloomy laboratories as well as the trailers. \u201cThe sex and violence is easy to market, but it\u2019s not the stuff that\u2019s very interesting,\u201d Mr. Abrams said. Given the uproar over sexual violence on HBO shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the most controversial scene in the pilot is likely to be an implied rape that happens offscreen. But those involved with \u201cWestworld\u201d defend it as a key, and   part of the narrative. \u201cThe cost of such actions is something these guys take incredibly seriously,\u201d Ms. Newton said. Ms. Joy and Mr. Nolan met at the premiere for \u201cMemento,\u201d the 2001 indie thriller Christopher Nolan wrote and directed based on Jonah\u2019s short story. Though they consulted on each other\u2019s work for years, Mr. Nolan and Ms. Joy had never officially worked together before \u201cWestworld,\u201d the development of which happened to coincide with another collaboration: their first child. (They\u2019re currently expecting their second.) They have sketched out several seasons\u2019 worth of story, but HBO has committed only to the one. \u201cComing off of \u2018Vinyl,\u2019 I think the one thing we\u2019re going to do is take our time in making a decision\u201d about renewing \u201cWestworld,\u201d Mr. Bloys said. That means it will be some time before anyone knows whether the show can in fact be the network\u2019s next flagship series, even as everyone involved swats away the inevitable \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d comparisons. But HBO executives do want enough viewers, positive reviews and cultural buzz for \u201cWestworld\u201d to justify a price tag that, while they won\u2019t divulge it, can\u2019t be cheap, considering the decorated cast and breathtaking scope on display. \u201cIs it the next big HBO thing? I don\u2019t think it benefits any show to work under those expectations,\u201d Mr. Bloys said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting into really interesting themes that are relevant today, so hopefully it catches on. \u201d Mr. Nolan added: \u201cWe have a dark, strange, hopefully compelling story we\u2019re telling here. You never know what people are going to make of it until they do, but we\u2019re incredibly excited to put it in front of an audience. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561803.4965217}
