Damone Hudson was crossing the Great Miami River in downtown Dayton, OH with his bus when he spotted a woman standing on the other side of the bridge\u2019s railing. RTA bus surveillance video shows Hudson stopping to urge the woman to get away from the edge. \u201cHey miss, why don\u2019t you come back on this side of the rail for me?\u201d Damone said as he got off the bus. He then told the woman, \u201cMa\u2019am, you look like you\u2019re having a bad day, you know. Can I give you a hug?\u201d Hudson stayed with the woman and talked to her until authorities arrived. Once they arrived, the woman got off the ledge and Hudson went back to his route. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going through something,\u201d he told Fox 45. \u201cEven if you are, just reach out and try to touch someone, even if it\u2019s in a small way. \u201d RTA will recognize Hudson for his good work at the upcoming RTA Board meeting on March 17.
