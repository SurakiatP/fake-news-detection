He even called the presidential debates \u201crigged.\u201d \\nNow, I guess his ego is so YUGE because he wants the election cancelled, and the presidency awarded to him without voting. \\nHe said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio Thursday: \u201cAnd just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? What are we having it for? \u2018Her policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference.\u201d \\nHe\u2019s against voter fraud, but he\u2019s OK with just yanking the election away from us? That is insane. That is not how a democratic election works, Trumpy. Taking the vote away from the people like that would make Trump our first dictator. \\nTrump may have been trying to make a joke out of it, but with his talk of rigged elections, that comment is just plain scary. \\nOn Thursday, Trump appeared on Bill O\u2019 Reilly\u2019s show. When asked if the polls would be rigged on election day, Trump said he believes they will be. When asked about his trailing in the national polls, Trump said : \u201cI\u2019m winning in certain polls and then in other polls, the dirty polls we call them, I was losing by numbers that were ridiculous. I think we\u2019re winning, but Bill, you look at some of these polls it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d \\nJust last week, Trump\u2019s poor Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway was faced with the undesirable job of defending Trump\u2019s idiocy. After one of the other times he whined about the election being rigged, she said : \u201cHis entire campaign is built about the little guy being the victim, the forgotten man and forgotten woman being the victim of the rigged corrupt system. Let\u2019s keep the focus there. That\u2019s who he\u2019s fighting for. I know so many in the media like to just dismiss the crowd sizes. Let me tell you something, you go out on the road with Donald Trump, this election doesn\u2019t feel over.\u201d \\nWhen he refers to himself in the third person, it makes him sound even creepier. \\nCheck out this clip   \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .
