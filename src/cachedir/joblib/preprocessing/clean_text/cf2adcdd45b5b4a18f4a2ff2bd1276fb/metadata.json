This statement is an acknowledgment directly from the NRA, after years of warning their members that a Democratic president is going to take away their guns. This debunks the ludicrous \u201cObama conspiracy\u201d to repeal the Second Amendment and confiscate guns, once and for all. \\nThe article was featured in NRA magazine, \u201cAmerica\u2019s 1 st Freedom\u201d on June 9 th , in which the author admits that \u201cCongress writes the laws, not the president\u201d and therefore the president does not have the power to repeal the right to bear arms. The piece was written after the author took issue with Obama\u2019s \u201crude\u201d response to a gun store owner named Rhune, on \u201cgun control,\u201d which is below as follows: \\n\u201cFirst of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks\u2019 guns is just not true. And I don\u2019t care how many times the NRA says it,\u201d declared Obama. \\n\u201cI\u2019m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I\u2019ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.\u201d \\nThe author\u2019s response proves that the NRA has known all along that Dems will not take their guns and now they have publicly admitted it: \\n\u201cCongress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms \u2014 from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama\u2019s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a \u201cpen and phone\u201d to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent.\u201d \\nAlthough neither Clinton or Obama have ever claimed they are going to take away guns from law-abiding gun owners, this has been the NRA\u2019s campaign against Democrats for years. The NRA has basically just admitted to blatantly manipulating their members through scare tactics \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t stopped them from reviving this tired old conspiracy theory and applying it to Hillary Clinton, who, for the record, does not want to take your guns. \\nIndeed, even in the doubtful scenario that Congress and the president agreed to repeal guns, the Supreme Court would veto this as unconstitutional. NRA members need to acknowledge once and for all that a democratic president is not going to seize their firearms and stop listening to the organization that clearly does not have their best interests in mind.'"}, "time": 1742562305.2849529}
