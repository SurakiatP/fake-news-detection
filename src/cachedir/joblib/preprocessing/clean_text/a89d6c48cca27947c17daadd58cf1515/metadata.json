Then living in an apartment in Manhattan, the couple (she\u2019s an accountant, he\u2019s a founder of Thinkmodo, which creates viral video campaigns) were in need of more space for their two toddlers. After their real estate agent, Arthur L. Scinta, an associate broker with Houlihan Lawrence, advised them to move quickly, they went to see the house the very next day. By 5 p. m. they had submitted an offer for the full asking price of $942, 000. The sellers wanted to give it more time. After several days, the couple raised their offer to $999, 000. The sellers wanted another week. \u201cWe asked them to give us a number they would take it off the market for,\u201d Ms. Krivickova said. \u201cThey said no. \u201d The couple really wanted the house. They huddled with Mr. Scinta, who analyzed recent sales prices of similar properties to help them strike a balance between a strong offer and an overzealous offer, which, if it exceeded the bank\u2019s appraisal, could cause problems with financing. Finally, on a Monday morning, they submitted their highest offer: $1, 087, 000, a full 15 percent premium. Mr. Scinta heard back that afternoon. \u201cArthur called and told us there were nine other offers,\u201d Ms. Krivickova said. \u201cBut we got it  \u2014   by three or four grand. \u201d And fortunately, the bank appraisal came in on the nose. The family moved in last December a third child is expected to arrive in August. They are delighted with their new home. But as for the angst involved in buying it? \u201cIt was awful,\u201d Ms. Krivickova said. The bidding wars  that have become the norm in New York City are now also common in select suburbs within easy commuting distance. Buyers priced out of the city are heading for the \u2019burbs, driving up demand and creating a more fraught buying process in   towns that have long enjoyed reputations for good school systems, lively downtowns and ready access to the city. \u201cThe city is this pot of water that\u2019s spilling over on the sides, and that excess demand is going to the suburbs,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a New York appraisal and research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s all being driven by the lack of affordability. \u201d Across Westchester, northern New Jersey, parts of Long Island and lower Fairfield County, Conn. the competition is fiercest for    homes toward the lower end of the price scale  \u2014   under $1 million in some markets, under $2 million in others  \u2014   in places within a   rail commute to the city. Walking distance to a lively downtown, a train station or both heightens the appeal.   homes in good condition in these markets often draw multiple offers within days of coming on the market. An analysis of   sales this year conducted by Miller Samuel showed the highest percentages of Westchester properties (23 percent to 44 percent) selling at or above asking price  \u2014   signs of likely bidding wars  \u2014   in places like Larchmont, Irvington, Bronxville, White Plains and Pelham. The average premium ranged from 1. 7 percent to 4 percent, actually lower than a year ago at the same time, when buyers were paying more like 5 percent or 6 percent over the asking price. Fairfield County and Long Island could not claim the same intensity in sales activity in the first quarter, Mr. Miller said. In Fairfield County, Stamford, Norwalk, Greenwich, Fairfield, Westport and Darien, 2 percent to 13 percent of properties sold at or over the asking price. On Long Island, Garden City, Huntington, Levittown, Port Washington, Franklin Square and Manhasset showed signs of bidding wars on 1 percent to 3 percent of transactions. Mr. Miller said he suspects bidding wars may have been more prevalent in those towns a couple of years ago, while now, \u201cWestchester is center stage. \u201d Mr. Miller\u2019s firm does not cover New Jersey. But there, \u201cthe housing market is looking better than it has in a very long time,\u201d said Jeffrey Otteau, the president of the Otteau Valuation Group in East Brunswick, N. J. Among the briskest markets are Hoboken, Glen Ridge, Maplewood, Montclair and South Orange, judging by their very low levels of inventory, he added. Generally speaking, buyers are not lining up for luxury properties.   homes  \u2014   upward of $2 million or $3 million, depending on the location  \u2014   are still going begging across the metropolitan area, agents said. Demand for these homes is weakest in affluent suburbs without a train station. \u201cThe reason is clear: The   jobs in the region are now disproportionately located in Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Otteau said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s where you\u2019re going, there\u2019s just not enough hours in the day to involve a car in that commute. \u201d At the same time, the luxury market in   towns is also slow, as they vie for fewer Wall Street bonus dollars and compete with a growing preference for urban living. Said Mr. Otteau, \u201cBecause of the dramatic improvement in urban life in the last 20 years, it\u2019s no longer a given that when you\u2019re ready to raise a family, you need to go out and buy a house in the suburbs. \u201d But many buyers who would prefer to stay in New York City simply can\u2019t afford to. In Pelham, \u201calmost all of our buyers are coming from the city, increasingly from Brooklyn,\u201d Mr. Scinta said. \u201cThey are being priced out in terms of the additional space they need. They\u2019ve outgrown their apartments and can\u2019t afford to move up to the   apartment. \u201d In their search for a home, Anil and Smita Abraham, who are moving from the Washington, D. C. area for Mr. Abraham\u2019s financial services job in New York, have hit many of the market hot spots, like Greenwich, Conn. and numerous places in lower Westchester. But on a Sunday in   the Abrahams and their two children, ages 6 and 4, were concentrating on open houses in Pelham. \u201cPelham is our top choice, I would say,\u201d Ms. Abraham said. \u201cWe really loved Greenwich, but it\u2019s too far to commute. \u201d They were among a dozen or so buyers checking out a   Georgian colonial that had been listed for $1. 465 million the previous Thursday. The couple were smitten with the updated house, particularly because of its ample bedroom space  \u2014   room for visiting grandparents  \u2014   and large basement playroom. Although the open house wasn\u2019t busy, the listing agent, Caroline Baccellieri, an associate broker with McClellan Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, already had two offers in hand before it began. By that night, she had two more  \u2014   including one from the Abrahams. But the sellers took one of the earlier offers. \u201cIt came in at over asking the day the house went on the market,\u201d Ms. Baccellieri said. \u201cWe felt like they were going to see it through and there weren\u2019t going to be any problems. \u201d Earlier this month, the Abrahams were in negotiations for another house in Pelham, but weren\u2019t certain they would reach a deal. With the spring season slowing and fewer properties coming on the market now, Mr. Abraham said they would buy elsewhere in lower Westchester if need be. Mike and Wendy Buzzeo of Jersey City were outbid three times as they searched recently for a home in Montclair, Maplewood and South Orange, N. J. During a crowded open house at a   Queen Anne Victorian in Montclair last month, the Buzzeos, who have two sons, ages 1 and 3, said, based on their previous experiences, they suspected the list price of $539, 000 was set deliberately low to spark a bidding war. \u201cWe figure you have to add at least $100, 000 to the list price to get an idea of what the house is really going for, and usually it\u2019s more than $100, 000,\u201d said Mr. Buzzeo, the head of international marketing for FXCM, an online brokerage firm. Betsy Ceccio of Keller Williams in Montclair, who had the listing along with her business partner, Joyce Slous, disputed the notion that homes were being underpriced to spark a frenzy. But she acknowledged that many homes were selling above their list prices, especially in the $500, 000 to $900, 000 range. Even with older bathrooms in need of updating, the Victorian, which is within walking distance of downtown and a train station, wound up netting 13 offers, all over asking, and several a full 20 percent higher, well beyond what the sellers expected, Ms. Ceccio said. \u201cBuyers were waiting and waiting for inventory to open up, and they\u2019re looking at the school calendar and thinking they need to get settled before the school year starts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe clock is ticking. \u201d The Buzzeos were not among the bidders on that house, but Ms. Buzzeo, the director of digital marketing for MetLife, later said that they had made an offer that had been accepted on a house in Maplewood. The dearth of   inventory relative to demand is sometimes sparking bidding wars in towns where they are usually few and far between. In Weston, Conn. for example, which has no train station or downtown, and where sales have been sluggish this year, JoAnn and Doug Cohen found themselves in an unexpected bidding war earlier this spring for a     listed for $635, 000. Having sold a large house in Westport two years ago, the Cohens, who have an    daughter, had been renting in Weston while they looked for a modestly sized house priced under $850, 000. \u201cI didn\u2019t want another large house,\u201d said Ms. Cohen, who works for an accounting services firm. (Her husband is a talent scout for a recruiting firm.) \u201cWe\u2019re on a     \u2014   we\u2019re going to move to a different area when our daughter graduates from high school. \u201d The   was the nicest house they had seen others in their price range had tended to need a lot of work. (The median sales price in Weston from February through May averaged around $780, 000.) This one had an open floor plan with lots of natural light, a newer kitchen and a flat   yard on a   . \u201cThere just aren\u2019t a whole lot of these out there,\u201d said Gabrielle DiBianco, the agent with the Higgins Group who represented the Cohens. Still, the Cohens were surprised when they made an offer under the asking price and were told they were competing with two others. They raised their bid enough to secure the house, and closed earlier this month. At the same time, in some of the rail towns on Long Island, houses sell so quickly that some agents aren\u2019t even bothering with open houses, said Maggie Keats, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Manhasset and Port Washington. \u201cThey have sufficient traffic by appointment,\u201d she said. Calling Manhasset and Port Washington \u201cthe \u2018it\u2019 markets\u201d for buyers moving from the city, Ms. Keats said the towns were benefiting from highly rated school districts, a quick commute to Penn Station, \u201ctrue\u201d downtowns and waterfront access. \u201cIn both of these communities, some of the movement you see is people within the community, whether up or down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a huge amount of turnover, and we do not get a great amount of inventory. So when something new comes on, there\u2019s high demand. \u201d In Garden City, properties in good condition for under $1 million routinely draw multiple bids, as buyers are waiting in the wings, according to Stephanie Cullum, an associate broker and manager at Coach Realtors. In 23 years of selling real estate, Ms. Cullum said, she had never seen   buyers as determined to get a home as they were at the beginning of the spring market. \u201cA lot of them have bid on something and lost it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get out to see homes right when they come on. \u201d In her opinion, not only the high prices in the city are driving demand rising rents on Long Island are as well. \u201c  are asking $2, 900 to $4, 500 a month,\u201d she said, referring to Garden City. \u201cYou could get a nice mortgage for that. \u201d Not all buyers are motivated solely by budget considerations, of course. George and Brooke Antonopoulos have spent most of this year looking for a home in Darien, Conn. They\u2019ve lived in Manhattan for 10 years, but as they consider having a family, they are looking for more square footage for their money, along with the lifestyle they grew up with: \u201cyards and barbecues,\u201d said Ms. Antonopoulos, who works in accounting. They have made offers on two houses so far neither worked out \u201cfor various reasons,\u201d said Mr. Antonopoulos, who works for a hedge fund. But they\u2019re not frazzled. They don\u2019t have to stand in line for a good property under $1. 5 million, like so many other   Darien buyers. Given their budget of up to $4 million, the Antonopouloses say, the market, in their case, is tilting in their favor.'"}, "time": 1742563396.284797}
