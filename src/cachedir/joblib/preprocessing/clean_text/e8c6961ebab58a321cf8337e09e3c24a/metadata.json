Most days, Michael Harrison, a former mine electrician and \u201cbuggy man\u201d who once drove trucks 700 feet underground, can be found hunched over a silver laptop, designing websites for clients like the Pikeville tourism board. Mr. Harrison, 36, is one of 10 former mine workers employed at BitSource, an internet   founded by two Pikeville businessmen determined to prove a point: that with training and encouragement, Kentucky miners can learn to code. \u201cWe told them, \u2018Quit thinking of yourselves as unemployed coal workers you\u2019re technology workers,\u2019\u201d said Rusty Justice, a founder of BitSource. He called his pep talks \u201creimagination training. \u201d Nearly 13, 000 coal jobs  \u2014   and countless more in related industries  \u2014   have disappeared in Kentucky since President Obama took office coal employment is at its lowest level since 1898. In Washington, Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a feud over whether Mr. Obama\u2019s aggressive environmental regulations amount to a \u201cwar on coal. \u201d On the presidential campaign trail, Donald J. Trump is vowing to \u201cput our miners back to work. \u201d But across central Appalachia, and especially here in eastern Kentucky, elected officials, business leaders, environmentalists and community advocates are looking beyond politics to wrestle with a question essential to the region\u2019s survival: What comes after coal? The founders of BitSource are not the only ones thinking creatively there are nascent efforts in craft agriculture and energy efficiency as well. These initiatives will not cure central Appalachia\u2019s economic woes at BitSource, Mr. Harrison was among 1, 000   miners who applied for 10 jobs. Rather, said Lora Smith, who oversees grants in central Appalachia for the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation, they represent lurching steps into what one local writer called \u201ca terrifying liberation\u201d for a region rich in natural resources whose people have deep ties to the land. It is \u201cterrifying,\u201d Ms. Smith said, \u201cbecause people are out of work, but it\u2019s also this liberation, to reimagine what this place can be. \u201d If Pikeville, population 6, 900, offers a glimpse into coal country\u2019s uncertain future, Benham, Ky. with 500 mostly elderly residents, is a window into its past. Benham was built a century ago as a coal mining camp by a subsidiary of International Harvester, which mined the nearby hillsides, extracting coal to make steel. Today, the signs of coal\u2019s decline are everywhere. The old company store is a mining museum. The brick schoolhouse, on a hillside overlooking the historic town, is an inn, said to be haunted. Abandoned houses lay crumbling in the hollows. Yet on a spring afternoon, something unusual  \u2014   construction work  \u2014   was going on. It was part of a project to retrofit old company houses like one owned by Pearl Cope, 83, a retired mine company receptionist whose home is so energy inefficient she pays up to $650 a month for heat during the winter. Carl Shoupe, 69, a retired miner and member of the local power board, organized the project with help from Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a progressive advocacy group. Mr. Shoupe, a onetime union organizer, is no fan of the coal industry. Badly injured in the mines, he sports a goatee to cover scars on his chin and wears an orthopedic shoe with a   lift to compensate for a mangled left leg. He got into environmental advocacy about a decade ago, after giving up alcohol and finding God. \u201cI got to looking around, when all this mountaintop removal and strip mining and tearing up of our beautiful mountains was going on, and I started praying about it,\u201d he said. To Mr. Shoupe, the retrofitting is a small step on the daunting path toward what environmentalists call a \u201cjust transition\u201d  \u2014   economic growth that does not harm people\u2019s health or the land. To Joshua Bates, 21, who spent the afternoon blowing insulation into Mrs. Cope\u2019s basement, it means a job in the region he calls home. \u201cA lot of people have left,\u201d Mr. Bates said sadly. \u201cEighty percent of my friends are gone. \u201d The road to Hippo, Ky. snakes through a hollow in Floyd County that runs across Brush Creek, not far from where Todd Howard\u2019s ancestors settled after the Revolutionary War. Mr. Howard, 36, a   Kentuckian, grew up here, dodging coal trucks on his bike and watching miners tromp off to work toting their lunch buckets. When he was 19, he joined his father\u2019s business, helping mining companies navigate the cumbersome permit bureaucracy. But by 2009, with fewer permits being handed out, the company closed. \u201cThat sort of catapulted me into this farming thing,\u201d he said. His path into farming began in February 2010, when he persuaded his wife that they should put a greenhouse in their backyard, and planted 42 varieties of heirloom tomatoes.    Kentuckians are increasingly turning to farming \u201cout of necessity,\u201d said Martin Richards, who runs Kentucky\u2019s Community Farm Alliance. His group works with eight farmers\u2019 markets in eastern Kentucky, including one Mr. Howard helped found with another   Kentuckian, Nathan Hall Mr. Richards says twice as many farmers participate as did five years ago. In 2014, Congress allowed certain states, including Kentucky, to begin farming industrial hemp after a ban of 60 years. Mr. Hall, 33, a Yale M. B. A. student who also studies environmental management (and briefly worked as a miner) was already exploring the idea of growing hemp, first cultivated in Kentucky in 1775. Today, with grants from companies like Patagonia, the clothing manufacturer, he and Mr. Howard are growing hemp on six sites in four counties  \u2014   including five acres of reclaimed surface mine  \u2014   and have big dreams to scale up. People here often say there will be no silver bullets, but rather \u201cone thousand silver BBs\u201d to replace lost coal jobs. Mr. Hall offers a variation: \u201cWe want to be a part of the silver buckshot,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s going to hopefully transform this region. \u201d Reimagining central Appalachia will take more than putting unemployed miners back to work. It will also require giving young people a reason to stay. In 2013, Representative Harold Rogers, a Republican who has been eastern Kentucky\u2019s congressman for 35 years, and Steve Beshear, the governor at the time and a Democrat, became founders of SOAR, Shaping Our Appalachian Region, an initiative intended to promote innovation. They were tired of solutions that came from Washington. \u201cWe decided that whatever we did would have to be sprung from within,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. SOAR convened its first Innovation Summit here in December 2013, in the middle of a blizzard 1, 700 people showed up. That inspired Mr. Justice of BitSource and his business partner, M. Lynn Parrish, whose engineering and excavation company has lost 70 percent of its customers in the coal downturn. They founded BitSource, with help from a federal grant, in an effort to diversify. About an hour away in Whitesburg, the leaders of Appalshop, an arts organization that grew out of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty, were also rethinking the group\u2019s future in a   economy. Ada Smith, 29, is among a new generation taking over she is the daughter of an Appalshop founder, Herb E. Smith, 64, a filmmaker and miner\u2019s son who has spent the past   documenting union fights, mine disasters, polluted land and water, and wrenching cycles of boom and bust. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed in this transition,\u201d said Ms. Smith, who returned home after college, \u201care people in the region who want to stay  \u2014   and figure it out. \u201d That rethinking led Appalshop to create a   digital marketing venture, Mountain Tech Media. It was unveiled in March at a party where a gourmet moonshiner, an early client, served   drinks. The company, a   cooperative, has two   employees on a team of 12, its chief executive, Jeremy McQueen, 30, said. The hope is to hire local young people over time. On a bright Monday in June, SOAR held its third Innovation Summit here. It looked like a convention of   and suits. Lunch was served outside while a bluegrass band played. There were two sandwich options: pulled pork and vegan wraps. Old coal country tensions flared. While Mr. Rogers was speaking, Ada and Herb Smith helped unfurl a banner opposing the construction of a $444 million prison. Mr. Rogers says it will bring 300 jobs, but Mr. Smith calls it \u201cthe wrong answer to the region\u2019s economic problems. \u201d Mr. Parrish, who has known Mr. Smith for decades (their wives were college sorority sisters) was furious. \u201cWe\u2019re all there trying to do solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was not the venue to do that in. \u201d Even so, Mr. Justice and Mr. McQueen made plans to get together, to talk about ways their fledgling tech companies might collaborate. The encounter spoke volumes about the current political moment here. As Mr. Justice said: \u201cCats and dogs are sleeping together in the mountains now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562718.7431872}
