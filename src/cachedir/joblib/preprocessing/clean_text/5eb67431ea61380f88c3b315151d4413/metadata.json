Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: \u201cJustice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us.\u201d \\nKhavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that \u201cevery instance of \u2018illegal alien\u2019 I wrote was changed to \u2018undocumented immigrant\u2019\u201d by his editors. \u201cBut I considered it a part of my opinion to not use\u201d the latter term, which he finds \u201cpolitically correct and also inaccurate.\u201d \\nWhen Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the \u201cillegal\u201d edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. \\nThe AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using \u201cillegal\u201d to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d just a year earlier . \\nBut AP Style also frowns upon \u201cundocumented\u201d\u2013the term used in Khavich\u2019s published column\u2013because the term is \u201cnot precise.\u201d Khavich notes that federal law uses the term \u201calien.\u201d \\nHis editor was \u201cnot happy\u201d after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day. \\n{snip} \\n\u201cAt the slightest questioning of their \u2018unbiased editing,\u2019 they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative,\u201d he wrote in The Tab. \\n\u201cI was writing articles that very strongly challenged narratives,\u201d he told The Fix. \u201cI am sure that it was a termination was based on political bias.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628528.620935}
