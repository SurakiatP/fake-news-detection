A democrat being in power is the natural order of things. I think it may actually be a part of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory. First the protozoa, then the fish, then the ape, then the Neanderthal Republican, and finally, the enlightened progressive Democrat. That\u2019s how it goes \u2013 right? \\nIt is amusing that the same people and party, who claim that everything in America is somehow rigged, think it ridiculous when the Republican nominee claims that of this election \u2013 and that Republican voters are the ones this time being \u201cdisenfranchised.\u201d \\nIn August of this year, the Washington Post claimed that Exxon Mobil is \u201crigging the system\u201d against green energy. Of course they are. After all, they are the poster-corporation of evil \u201cbig oil.\u201d \u201cAs recently as last year, it continued to fund organizations that play down the risks of carbon pollution,\u201d writes the Post. \\nSo \u201crigged\u201d is the system that the AGs of the communist states of New York and Massachusetts, \u201care investigating whether ExxonMobil violated state laws by knowingly misleading their residents and shareholders about climate change.\u201d \\nBig Oil \u2013 Climate Change \u2013 Rigged \u2013 Check. \\nIn 2015, Director of the University of Cambridge Master of Finance program, Simon Taylor wrote that, \u201cBank executive pay appears rigged against women.\u201d He found that female bank execs\u2019 \u201cpay packages typically have a much lower level of incentive compensation,\u201d netting women much less than male counterparts. \\nThat same year, the NewStatesman.com wrote that, \u201cWomen can\u2019t have it all \u2013 because the game is rigged.\u201d The author is upset that women have to \u201cchoose\u201d between having a high-powered career and spending time raising a family. Yeah \u2013 I know. If the system wasn\u2019t so \u201crigged,\u201d women could have it all \u2013 a model family and equal pay \u2013 unless, of course, if they work for the Clinton Foundation. \\nWomen \u2013 Equal Pay \u2013 Rigged \u2013 Check \\nNaturally, the system is \u201crigged\u201d against the poor and the middle class. The working class warrior, Elizabeth Warren , who is worth almost $15 million, said in an interview with CNN : \u201cLet's just be real clear - the game is rigged and it's rigged in favor of those who have money and who have power,\u201d like Elizabeth Warren. \\nMiddle Class \u2013 Poor \u2013 Workers of the World Unite - Rigged \u2013 Check \\nThere are many more examples of the democrats and liberals in general (redundant) whining of this ethereal system being rigged against every constituent group under their umbrella , that I would be remiss to not mention the seminal complaint of all the left. The system has been and will always be rigged against blacks \u2013 particularly the justice system. \\nEverywhere in America, according to the left, are examples of a rigged justice system, where blacks, minding their own business, are rounded up, arrested, and summarily shot. So rigged is the system , that \u201cGeorge Washington University law professor Paul Butler, who is a former federal prosecutor, has suggested the remedy ought to be widespread jury nullification. \u2018It is, in fact, the moral responsibility of black jurors to emancipate some guilty black outlaws.\u2019\u201d \\nBlacks \u2013 Social Justice \u2013 Rigged \u2013 Check \\nWith all this \u201crigging\u201d going on, maybe the only fair thing to do is allow Hillary and her minions to do whatever they must to win, thus righting some of the wrongs of the rigged system. It should be our moral responsibility to emancipate some guilty democrat outlaws. \\nDemocrats lying and cheating on camera \u2013 Dead People Voting \u2013 Illegals Voting \u2013 Election not Rigged \u2013 Check. shares\""}, "time": 1742563492.525219}
