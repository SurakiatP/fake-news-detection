Trump\u2019s newly installed campaign chief sought to assure members of the Republican National Committee on Thursday night that Mr. Trump recognized the need to reshape his persona and that his campaign would begin working with the political establishment that he has scorned to great effect. Addressing about 100 committee members at the spring meeting here, many of them deeply skeptical about Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the campaign chief, Paul Manafort, bluntly suggested the candidate\u2019s incendiary style amounted to an act. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important for you to understand: That he gets it, and that the part he\u2019s been playing is evolving,\u201d Mr. Manafort said, suggesting that Mr. Trump was about to begin a more professional phase of his campaign. \u201cThe negatives are going to come down, the image is going to change, but Clinton is still going to be crooked Hillary,\u201d he added. Mr. Manafort\u2019s comments, which included a PowerPoint presentation, came during a   reception at the beachside hotel resort here. They were made behind closed doors, which were guarded by security. But a person in attendance taped the speech and shared the recording with The New York Times. Mr. Manafort, a longtime Republican strategist and lobbyist who in recent weeks has taken over control of much of the organization from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, offered an olive branch to the party officials at the start of his remarks. \u201cIs Donald Trump running against the Republican National Committee?\u201d asked Mr. Manafort, referring to the candidate\u2019s unrelenting assault on what he calls the \u201ccrooked\u201d nominating process. \u201cThe answer is he is not. \u201d But Mr. Manafort went further than simply placating committee members: He also openly said that Mr. Trump wanted to coordinate with the very forces he has spent much of his campaign attacking. \u201cHe gave us the mandate to bring together a team of professionals that could finish the job for him, but could also then begin to link in with the establishment institutions that are part of our party, what you represent, what the state parties represent,\u201d he said, also alluding to think tanks and members of Congress. \u201cWe\u2019ve started all those conversations,\u201d said Manafort, adding of Mr. Trump, \u201cHe cares about the united team. \u201d The remarks suggest Mr. Trump is conducting something of an   campaign simultaneously, railing against what he calls a \u201ccorrupt\u201d process in public to win over   Republicans while sending Mr. Manafort to assure party stalwarts of his true intentions. Mr. Manafort largely ignored Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump\u2019s most formidable remaining Republican opponent, alluding to him only to echo remarks he made earlier this week about how a contested convention might leave the party fractured. Mr. Manafort said he agreed with Mr. Cruz. \u201cI don\u2019t want a fractured convention, we want this thing to bed early,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in Cleveland fighting for a nomination that\u2019s already been decided. \u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s continual attacks on the nomination process, Mr. Manafort said he was largely focused on \u201ctransparency\u201d and had no genuine desire to undermine the   rules. \u201cHe is winning he\u2019s not interested in changing the rules,\u201d he said. Mr. Manafort acknowledged Mr. Trump\u2019s deep unpopularity  \u2014   his \u201cnegatives,\u201d he called them  \u2014   but invoked Ronald Reagan\u2019s initial polling deficit in 1980 to claim Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies were not permanent. Mr. Reagan\u2019s unfavorability in 1980, however, was never as high as that of Mr. Trump now. \u201cFixing personality negatives is a lot easier than fixing character negatives,\u201d said Mr. Manafort, claiming that Hillary Clinton suffered from negative. \u201cYou can\u2019t change somebody\u2019s character. But you can change the way somebody presents themselves. \u201d And that, Mr. Manafort said, was in the works. Mr. Trump intends to deliver a foreign policy address at the National Press Club in Washington next week, Mr. Manafort said, and that he would also hold similar events to address his \u201cgender gap. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll start to see more depth to the person, the real person,\u201d Mr. Manafort continued, referring to more Trump appearances in \u201cformal settings. \u201d Looking ahead to the fall, Mr. Manafort was joined by Rick Wiley, the campaign\u2019s new political director, to help lay out an audacious case for how Mr. Trump could defeat Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Manafort, citing \u201cthe unique magic of Trump,\u201d said the candidate could be in a \u201cvery competitive situation in states that by the end of September you say goodbye to the presidential candidate. He singled out Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. The three states last voted for a Republican presidential nominee in 1988. As the Republicans ate oysters in a dim, stuffy conference room overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wiley walked them through a slide show that predicted victory for Mr. Trump not just in swing states with large Hispanic populations like Nevada, Colorado and Florida, but in states that Republicans have not captured since the 1980s: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Connecticut. And in other solidly Democratic states, like Illinois and New Jersey, he said Mr. Trump could force Mrs. Clinton to spend money defending herself. \u201cCan we win Illinois?\u201d Mr. Manafort asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But what we can do is make Hillary Clinton go to Illinois, make her spend money there, make her spend money in the Northeast. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562198.5747952}
