Two states that the Democratic presidential nominee must win are North Carolina and Florida, which her campaign describes as checkmate states. She must carry the swing states to ensure the accumulation of electoral votes needed to be elected to the presidency.\\nThe CNN polls in October indicated that Clinton had an 18 point lead over Donald Trump among early voters.\\nCBS reports the percentages of Florida\u2019s Republicans who cast early votes break down as follows; 11 percent registered since 2012, 83 percent voted in the last presidential election, and six percent did not vote four years ago. Among registered Democrats the numbers were similar.\\nEarly voting, in person or by mail, is underway in 37 states. Experts predict that more than 46 million people will have voted before next Tuesday, November 8.\\nAs of November 2, at 12:56 a.m. EDT, The New York Times daily prediction is that Clinton has an 88 percent chance over Trump\u2019s 12 percent to win. Hers are down 1 percent and his are up 1. from the day before.\\nHowever, the paper indicates that the ROP candidate could win, although it is as unlikely as a professional football kicker missing a 35-yard field goal.\\nWritten by Cathy Milne\\nSources:\\nThe New York Times: Election Forecast; Who Will Be President?\\n760 AM Radio: Early voting: More good signs for Clinton in key states\\nTwitter Feed CNN : 17% of early GOP Voters Chose Clinton\\nImage Courtesy of WEBN-TV\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons License    #CMJournalist , clinton , Donald Trump , north carolina'"}, "time": 1742564120.5770094}
