[The study by the Media Research Center (MRC) found that the evening newscasts on the \u201cBig Three\u201d TV networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, were overwhelmingly hostile to Trump.  In its study, the MRC found that over the president\u2019s first 30 days in office, the networks dedicated 16 hours of coverage to President Trump, 54 percent of its total news coverage. MRC found up to 674 negative statements aimed at Trump while only a tiny 88 statements were deemed positive. \u201cOur measure of media tone excludes soundbites from identified partisans, focusing instead on tallying the evaluative statements made by reporters and the   talking heads (experts and average citizens) included in their stories,\u201d MRC noted. \u201cIn their coverage of Trump\u2019s first month, the networks crowded their stories with quotes from citizens angry about many of his policies, while providing relatively little airtime to Trump supporters. The MRC also noted that \u201canchors and reporters often injected their own   editorial tone into the coverage. \u201d The study also noted that the president\u2019s call for a temporary moratorium on travel from seven   nations drew the most negative coverage. Other negative coverage centered on Trump\u2019s border policies, his economic plans, the battle over his cabinet picks, as well as Trump\u2019s \u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d with Russia. \u201cFurther highlighting the hostile tone of these newscasts, nearly an hour of coverage (56 minutes) was given over to   protests on various topics, with nearly   (82 out of 442) of the Trump stories or briefs aired during these 30 days including at least some discussion of an   protest,\u201d the MRC concluded.
