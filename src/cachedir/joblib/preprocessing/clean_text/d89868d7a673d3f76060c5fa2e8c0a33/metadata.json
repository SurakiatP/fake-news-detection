Runkles was interviewed Wednesday on CBS This Morning, and her story has been featured at media outlets such as the New York Times, the New York Post, and Cosmopolitan.  The school\u2019s principal, David Hobbs, released a statement regarding the situation of the teen, who has a 4. 0 gradepoit average and was president of the Student Council when she discovered she was pregnant in January. \u201cMaddi is being disciplined, not because she\u2019s pregnant, but because she was immoral,\u201d Hobbs said in a statement posted on the school\u2019s website, explaining that students at the school sign a   pledge that states they will protect their bodies \u201cby abstaining from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. \u201d \u201cHeritage is also pleased that she has chosen to not abort her son,\u201d he continued. \u201cHowever, her immorality is the original choice she made that began this situation. \u201d In an interview with Breitbart News, Runkles said that while other students at Heritage Academy have broken some of the other rules of the pledge, \u201cThey\u2019ve never suffered a punishment as severe as mine. \u201d Hobbs, she said, initially decided he would tell the entire school that she had broken the rule about   sex. She was also stripped of her leadership positions and informed she would not be permitted to complete her senior year at school, but would finish her classes at home. Runkles said she decided, however, that she wanted to publicly confess to the school herself about her pregnancy. She made her confession with her father at her side. \u201cI decided I wanted to confess what I did and ask for forgiveness from my school,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut the other kids who had broken other rules  \u2014   even when they were caught  \u2014   they still lied about what they had done. It just seems unfair. I tried to make it right, but was still shot down. \u201d Subsequently, Runkles\u2019 parents and about 25 classmates and other parents appealed to Hobbs, asking that she be permitted to remain in school and graduate with her classmates. Ultimately  \u2014   after several days of suspension  \u2014   she was told she could return to school to complete her classes, but would still be prohibited from graduating with her class. \u201cA wise man told me that discipline is not the absence of love, but the application of love,\u201d Hobbs says in his statement. \u201cWe love Maddi Runkles. The best way to love her right now is to hold her accountable for her immorality that began this situation. \u201d Runkles\u2019s situation was brought to light by   organization Students for Life of America (SFLA) which asserts the teen is being unfairly punished, since she already admitted her mistake, confessed it before the school, and accepted relinquishing her leadership roles. SFLA says Christians who claim to be   should offer support to a teen who admits her error and accepts the consequences of going through with her pregnancy instead of having an abortion. \u201cDisciplining Maddi is not the issue,\u201d states SFLA president Kristan Hawkins. \u201cHer discipline was decided, communicated, and executed. For the most part, this was done so with care for the family\u2019s privacy and with fair response to the pledge broken (i. e. \u2018abstaining from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs\u2019). \u201d Hawkins continues: However, my primary and continued complaint is that the disciplinary actions of the administration has extended far beyond accountability for the broken pledge regarding premarital sex. That accountability was served justly and humbly in Maddi\u2019s confession, her suspension, and her removal from leadership positions. What was initially a punitive and learning moment has transformed into a public lesson (before this even was announced to the media). By banning Maddi from walking at graduation, the administration and board collectively decided on a disciplinary measure of an obviously public nature. From what we\u2019ve learned thus far, no other student in the school\u2019s history has been banned from walking at graduation for failing to abstain \u201cfrom sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. \u201d Maddi is the only student, past or present, banned from walking at graduation. In a class of only 15 students, her absence will be obvious and can only be explained in that her immorality is visible (unlike the errs of past and present students). In his statement, Hobbs does not address how the board handles the violations of other students, but states, \u201cEach Heritage family deserves confidentiality. \u201d He indicates that the Runkles family chose \u201cto make her behavior a public matter,\u201d and that he would have preferred to handle Maddi\u2019s \u201cdisciplinary situation\u201d privately. Neither Heritage Academy nor Hobbs returned Breitbart News\u2019s request for an interview or comment. Runkles\u2019s story has launched a debate about how   Christian churches handle the situation of unplanned pregnancies among single women. A study posted in November of 2015 at   found that more than 40 percent of women who had an abortion regularly attended church. Vice president of LifeWay Research Scott McConnell said the results suggest a church culture that is lacking grace. Among those women who have had an abortion:   (65 percent) say church members judge single women who are pregnant. A majority (54 percent) thinks churches oversimplify decisions about pregnancy options. Fewer than half (41 percent) believe churches are prepared to help with decisions about unwanted pregnancies. \u201cWomen are perceiving judgment from the church, and that\u2019s probably partly because there are clear teachings in the Bible including about how and why we make judgments,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHowever, if they don\u2019t start experiencing something different than what they\u2019ve seen in the past, these numbers aren\u2019t going to change. \u201d The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List)  \u2014   a national   organization  \u2014   states Runkles\u2019s decision to have her baby \u201cdeserves compassion and support. \u201d \u201cThe decision to choose life is not always easy, and certainly not always popular with a culture that promotes convenience over personal responsibility,\u201d the group says. \u201cMaddi made a courageous choice to love and protect her unborn son and she deserves compassion and support, especially from fellow Christians. \u201d \u201cWe urge Heritage Academy to reconsider their decision not to allow Maddi, a 4. 0 student, to walk with her peers at graduation,\u201d SBA List continues. \u201cThis extended punishment  \u2014   doled out months after Maddi told her school she was pregnant and asked for compassion  \u2014   sends a terrible message about the Christian community\u2019s response to teen pregnancy and unexpected pregnancy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562103.1155136}
