Porter (@KevinTPorter) January 26, 2017,  @JerrySeinfeld @Acura This is worse than the finale of \u201dSeinfeld\u201d which I still don\u2019t like.  \u2014   Benjamin Siemon (@BenjaminJS) January 26, 2017,  @JerrySeinfeld Now I see why Larry David wrote all the jokes.  \u2014   Tyler Conway (@jtylerconway) January 26, 2017,  @JerrySeinfeld @Acura Perhaps poor taste to use a legitimate movement for a pun about a white guy,  \u2014   no salt nate (@natestradingus) January 26, 2017,  @JerrySeinfeld @Acura i love you man but this is disrespectful.  \u2014   Travon Free (@Travon) January 26, 2017,  Seinfeld has not deleted the tweet or issued an apology in the way most celebrities would after offending potential audience members. And it\u2019s likely due to the fact that the    star is no fan of what he calls \u201cpolitically correct nonsense. \u201d In 2014, Seinfeld slammed the idea of creating comedy strictly through the lens of race, gender, or one\u2019s sexual preference. \u201cIt\u2019s more about PC nonsense than \u2018Are you making us laugh or not? \u2019\u201d he said. A year later, Seinfeld doubled down on his   remarks, noting that contemporary college students carelessly use the terms \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist. \u201d \u201cThey just want to use these words,\u201d Seinfeld told radio host Colin Cowhard. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s racist. That\u2019s sexist. That\u2019s prejudice.\u2019 They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re fucking talking about. \u201d Seinfeld\u2019s Comedians, in which the comic riding in a car and sitting in diners sharing a cup of coffee with his famous friends, debuted in July 2012. Seinfeld recently signed a deal to bring the the comedy series to streaming giant Netflix. The 9th season of  Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee premiered on January 5.
