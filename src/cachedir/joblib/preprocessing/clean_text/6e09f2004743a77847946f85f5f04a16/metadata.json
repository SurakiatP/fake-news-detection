He went on to say that \u00e2\\x80\\x9cfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nA local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of \u00e2\\x82\u0179300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. \\nWhen the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. \\nThe parents\u00e2\\x80\\x99 lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son\u00e2\\x80\\x99s \u00e2\\x80\\x9cbodily safety.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nDenying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that \u00e2\\x80\\x9cnobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nHeumann himself, however, is a former member of the Alternative for Germany party, an anti-immigrant political group, and was a participant in setting up the \u00e2\\x80\\x98Dugida,\u00e2\\x80\\x99 a Dusseldorf-based branch of the far-right PEGIDA movement. \\nFeminism is the complaint of a woman who doesn\u2019t have a man to tell her what to do. \\nThe entire goal of feminism is to force an end to feminism. That is why feminists are pushing for Islamization. They want to be told what to do. The immediate goal of their demonstrations is to get manhandled. It is a weird psycho-sexual thing that men couldn\u2019t ever understand and women are unconscious of so incapable of explaining. But I assure you it is there. \\nThey don\u2019t care about race, because women are incapable of processing philosophical or ideological concepts. The only fact they are able to process \u2013 and this is on an emotional, subconscious level \u2013 is that their men refused to be men, and have told them to go be men, and that this is causing them extreme distress and blocking their ability to produce children. \\nThis is what feminism is \u2013 women don\u2019t say what they actually want, they express themselves in a way where you\u2019re supposed to interpret their emotional state. When Femen riots naked, what they want is to be physically dominated by men \u2013 i.e. raped. \\nSo they are replacing us with Moslems to fix their current state, which is feminism. \\nI told you people this.'"}, "time": 1742562754.494401}
