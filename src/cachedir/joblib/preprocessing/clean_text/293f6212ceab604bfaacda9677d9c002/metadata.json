[Milo is currently nominated to become the university\u2019s rector. According to the campaign team who nominated Milo, other candidates have been allowed to stage similar live events.  \u201cDear   I am writing on behalf of the Milo for Rector Campaign. We are enquiring to find out if we would be able to book a room in the QMU to host a livestream QA with Milo and the students of Glasgow University,\u201d wrote Glasgow\u2019s \u201cMilo Squad\u201d to the Queen Margaret Union. \u201cWe are aware that some other candidates such as Aamer Anwar have held similar meetings and would appreciate if our campaign could receive similar treatment. \u201d \u201cWe believe that it is important that students are able to question all candidates in order to make an informed decision,\u201d they continued. \u201cWe would aim to have the room on Sunday if possible, but we are overall flexible with our dates. We look forward to hearing from you. \u201d The campaign team\u2019s inquiry was quickly shot down by Queen Margaret Union\u2019s Vice President Katrina Denholm, however, who claimed that Milo\u2019s conservative beliefs were \u201cdeplorable\u201d and broke the union\u2019s constitution. \u201cThe Board of Management of the Queen Margaret Union has found some of the comments made by Mr Yiannopoulos regarding during his campaign to be completely deplorable, and to allow such opinions to be voiced within our Union would be in breach of our Constitution: section VII, Equality and Diversity,\u201d Denholm replied. \u201cTherefore we will not be allowing use of any space in our building for this purpose. \u201d Milo was one of twelve names put forward for the \u201cprestigious position,\u201d according to The Independent, and his candidacy has already prompted several protests from   students. \u201cThe current rector is exiled NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden,\u201d The Independent reported. \u201cOther candidates nominated this year include human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar, former Liberal Democrat MP Vince Cable, PissPigGranddad, an American internet celebrity fighting with the People\u2019s Defence Unit in Syria, and Lady Hazel Cosgrove, the first woman to be appointed a Senator of the College of Justice. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
