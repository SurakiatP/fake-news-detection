The changes will take effect within a few weeks, Kevin Systrom, a founder and the chief executive of Instagram, said in a blog post. The ability to remove comments will be an   to previous efforts: About three months ago, Instagram announced that it would allow users to filter out abusive words from their comments, and the platform has been experimenting with comment removal on   accounts since this summer. The crackdown on unwelcome comments reflects the large and persistent problem of abuse found in all corners of the web. Across social media, comments are often a breeding ground for bullying and trolling: Four in 10 internet users have experienced online bullying, with comment sections and social media sites being among the most common venues, according to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center. \u201cComments are where the majority of conversation happens on Instagram,\u201d Mr. Systrom wrote. \u201cWhile comments are largely positive, they\u2019re not always kind or welcome. \u201d In an effort to encourage positivity, he said, Instagram will allow users to tap a heart icon to \u201clike\u201d individual comments. People using private accounts will also soon be able to remove certain followers to ensure that their content stays private. \u201cIn the past, once you approved a follower, there was no simple way to undo that decision without blocking them,\u201d Mr. Systrom said, adding: \u201cThe person will not be notified that you removed them as a follower. \u201d Mr. Systrom also reiterated that Instagram had recently enabled tools allowing users to anonymously report people who may be at risk for suicide or self harm. One of the new tools, giving users an avenue to seek help for someone displaying possible suicidal behavior, mirrors efforts made by Facebook earlier this year. Mr. Systrom said that Instagram has installed teams that work around the clock to monitor those reports. The move by Instagram is the latest step in a slow but steady march by social publishers, including Facebook and Twitter, to curb online abuse and make life on the platforms safer  \u2014   or at least free of trolls  \u2014   for users. In addition to   efforts made by Facebook this summer, Twitter said in November that it would roll out new tools to protect users from hate speech and abuse. And on Monday, a coalition of companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, said that they had teamed up to stop the spread of terrorism propaganda around the web.'"}, "time": 1742562066.5694177}
