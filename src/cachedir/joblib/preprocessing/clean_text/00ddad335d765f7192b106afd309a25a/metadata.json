Alan Schulkin, a Democratic Elections Commissioner in NYC then explains on video how voter fraud can be committed when people wear burkas inside polling locations on Election Day.\\nThe video starts with the undercover PV journalist talking to Alan Schulkin, the Democratic Elections Commissioner in NYC in which the journalist says, \u201cNot only just voter ID because of voting twice, but people can cover their faces, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\\nAlan Schulkin responds, \u201cWell the Muslims can do that too. You don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\\nThe PV journalist then proceeds to test out the information that Alan Schulkin gave to her. An election official then questions the journalist dressed in full burka.\\n\u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going?\u201d The journalist responds, \u201cNo.\u201d\\nThe official then asks the PV journalist for her address in which she responds \u201c254 Park Avenue South.\u201d\\nThe election official then gives the PV journalist a number in line. The video cuts back to Alan Schulkin and the PV journalist\u2019s conversation in which the PV journalist says, \u201cEspecially, all those burkas someone could claim, oh it\u2019s my religion, but then you don\u2019t know if they are pretending or not.\u201d\\nAlan Schulkin responds \u201cExactly!\u201d\\nThe journalist then proceeds to vote under the name \u201cHuma Abedin,\u201d after talking to an election official who greets her with \u201cGood morning, last name?\u201d\\nThe PV journalist responds, \u201cAbedin\u201d\\nWhat follows is shocking, \u201cSince we don\u2019t have your name in the book. You can fill out an affidavit ballot. Ok?\u201d the official says.\\nThe official then asks the PV journalist if she is \u201cDemocrat or Republican?\u201d The journalist responds troll-fully \u201cHuma Abedin is a registered Democrat.\u201d\\nThe election official then responds \u201cI don\u2019t have your name in the book but you can vote with a paper ballot.\u201d\\nThe segment then cuts back to Alan Schulkin in which he makes a racist comment about Muslims.\\n\u201cThey detonate bombs in public schools which we\u2019re using that could disrupt the whole election.\u201d\\nThe PV journalist responds \u201cYeah but they could do it wearing a burka. But then no one could say oh wait let me see your voter ID because they don\u2019t have ID because they don\u2019t want to discriminate because they are wearing a burka.\u201d\\nSchulkin responds again agreeing with the journalist \u201cexactly\u201d he says.\\nShe then continues to explain. \u201cBut no one can do that because your going to offend them, but then it\u2019s like, hey now, I\u2019m not a Muslim but I can go in there you know?\u201d\\nThe video then cuts back to the election official speaking to the PV journalist \u201cBut your names not in the book, for some reason it\u2019s not here, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t vote by paper ballot. You just can\u2019t vote by machine.\u201d the election official repeats.\\n\u201cOkay so I can vote today by paper ballot?\u201d the PV journalist responds.\\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the election official responds.\\nThe journalist then reiterates that she is voting as Huma Abedin to the official who still hasn\u2019t caught on.\\n\u201cSo I can vote today as Huma Abedin, but just with a paper ballot?\u2019\\nThe election official then responds \u201cWhatever you want if that\u2019s you. If that\u2019s the name you voted with last election, and you haven\u2019t changed your name?\u201d\\n\u201cOkay Ill be back. I\u2019m going to go call my husband Anthony.\u201d The PV journalist then walks away and is told to \u201ccome back later\u201d by the election official.\\nThe video ends with a final cut back to Alan Schulkin in which he makes the statement, \u201cYour vote isn\u2019t really counting because they can go in there with a burka on and you don\u2019t know if they are a voter.\u201d He adds, \u201cyour vote gets discounted because they come in there with a burka on and they can vote. People think it\u2019s a liberal thing to do, but I take my vote very seriously and I don\u2019t want ten other people coming in negating my vote by voting for the other candidate when they\u2019re not even registered voters.\u201d\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe post Project Veritas Undercover Journalist in Full Burka Is Offered Huma Abedin\u2019s Ballot appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742561808.9568307}
