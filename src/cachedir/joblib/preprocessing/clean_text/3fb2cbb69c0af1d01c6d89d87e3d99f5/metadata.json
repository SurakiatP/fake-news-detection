[Just four percent of normal heterosexual Americans said they would be \u201cvery open\u201d to dating a \u201ctransgender person,\u201d and only a third would be willing to tell their parents about the relationship, according to the survey by YouGov. com.   The four percent number comes from a sample which excluded the one or two percent of heterosexual Americans who say they\u2019ve had relations within the last 12 months with a woman or a man who is trying to change sex.  The February survey of 2, 191 adults also showed that transgender people are often unwelcome in the much smaller gay and lesbian communities, which together comprised only 5 percent of the survey. Only eight percent of lesbians and just 10 percent of the gay men say they did have sex with a transsexual in the prior 12 months. Just   percent of gay men who have not had a relationship with a transsexual said they would be \u201cvery open\u201d to dating a transgender man, and only 47 percent of them would be willing to tell their parents, said the survey. Almost   of lesbians said they are \u201cvery open\u201d to a relationship with a man who is living as a woman. The poll forcefully underlined the sexual unattractiveness  \u2014   and the painful social isolation  \u2014   facing most men and women who try to switch their sex, despite the glamorous coverage from many major media outlets, even including fashion and style magazines.   The sexual rejection, however, was accompanied by sympathy from many Americans. For example, the survey showed that 66 percent of sexually normal people were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d open to friendship with a person trying to change sex. Only 29 percent said they would oppose a friendship, according to YouGov, which declined to say who funded the expensive survey.  The survey\u2019s results match complaints by many of the few people who are trying to live as members of the other sex. \u201cThe disappointing but unsurprising results [of the survey] reveal a sad truth about the transgender rights movement: Cultural acceptance has tended to lag behind formal recognition,\u201d said Samantha Allen, a reporter at The Daily Beast who is living as a woman. The commonplace rejection of transsexuals is frequently described or shown on YouTube. For example, the British Mirror newspaper videotaped the rejection of three American transsexuals in 2015: Hoping on finding a boyfriend, [Claire] reveals that she doesn\u2019t like telling people the truth and is desperate for an [expensive genital surgery] operation. She says: \u201cIn a lot of ways, I don\u2019t like telling a guy. Once I tell him all respect goes out of the window. \u201cStraight guys just can\u2019t get over you having the male parts. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve had or get the surgery, I think it will change a lot for me because right now if I meet a straight guy and he doesn\u2019t know  \u2014   we can\u2019t get physical if I don\u2019t tell him. \u201cAnd then if he finds out, things just get so complicated, I can\u2019t even begin to explain. \u201d Many people who are trying to change their sex also blame their exclusion on unfair social attitudes that need to be changed by civic pressure or government action. \u201cWe, as a society, have not created a space for men to openly express their desire to be with trans women,\u201d Allen said, echoing the progressive claim that heterosexual males\u2019 sexual preferences can be swayed by civic endorsement of transsexuality. The demand that male and female heterosexuals learn to sexually desire transsexuals reflects a key demand of the \u201ctransgender ideology\u201d  \u2014   that government should pressure ordinary Americans to fully accept other people\u2019s claim about their maleness or femaleness, regardless of biology.  This political ideology was pushed by officials working for former President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Justice. \u201cTransgender men are men  \u2014   they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women  \u2014   they live, work and study as women,\u201d Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s civic regulation division, claimed in a May 2016 press conference. The ideology is built on the political claim that people can easily change their \u201cgender identity\u201d and so become members of the opposite legal sex  \u2014   even without biological changes. That political claim is based on two more claims  \u2014   that a person\u2019s \u201cgender\u201d can be different from that person\u2019s sex, and that peoples\u2019 sex (and sexual preference) is \u201csocially constructed\u201d by social rules, not by biology, according to progressives. This transgender ideology has some sympathy from roughly   of Americans, but Obama has admitted twice that his push for \u201ctransgender rights\u201d hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 race. Also, far fewer than one percent of Americans try to live as members of the opposite sex. In contrast, conservatives cite science and human experience when arguing that \u201cgender\u201d does not exist, and that a person\u2019s sex is determined by their biology, which also deeply impacts their character across a wide range of masculine, feminine and   characteristics. For example, say conservatives, young female \u201ctomboys\u201d are still girls, regardless of their appearance or behavior. In February, President Donald Trump boosted the conservative argument by ditching an   rule which directed schools officials to enforce the \u201cgender identity\u201d claims of \u201ctransgender\u201d children on normal children, regardless of the children\u2019s\u2019 privacy or their parents\u2019 wishes. Since Obama\u2019s departure, the push by transsexuals for sexual acceptance consists of social pressure, often via Hollywood, and often aimed at lesbians.  This push is especially   among some transsexual men who wish to sleep with lesbians. But many lesbians decline to sleep with men who have intact male genitalia, even if the men say they\u2019re women. Sexual activists scornfully describe this rejection by lesbians as  \u201cthe cotton ceiling\u201d As one   transsexual argued on Youtube:  So the cotton ceiling is a term that was coined basically referring to the idea that a transwoman\u2019s identity as a woman would be respected within the lesbian community up until the point when a romantic or sexual relationship was being considered, at which point the lesbian would say \u201cSorry, not interested in transwomen,\u201d which means that it you don\u2019t regarded transwomen as women, regardless of their operative status [intact male genitalia] you don\u2019t actually think of transwomen as women at all   \u2026     At the end of the day, if your reason for not dating any transgender person is because of their   that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not transphobic  \u2014   because you are.  \u201cYou can unlearn your own prejudices [against sex with transsexuals] \u2014   it just takes time and effort,\u201d said Riley Dennis, a biological male who is living as a woman while preferring to sleep with women. Denis argues that a person\u2019s \u201cgenital preferences\u201d for   genitalia should be stigmatized like sexism because it prevents lesbians from dating people who claim to be women while still keeping male genitalia. \u201cSome women have penises,\u201d Denis claims.  But the heterosexual rejection of transsexuality is deep. When Bruce Jenner renamed himself \u201cCaitlyn,\u201d the popularity of the female name fell more than 400 places, right off the list of the top 1, 000 favorite names. The burden of trying to change sex  \u2014   drugs, hormones, surgery, social exclusion, money, unemployment and much else  \u2014   is so great that many people reverse their transgender attempt and try to live as a normal person, even after being mutilated by   surgery.    Nationally, the claim that government should enforce the gender ideology is having a large impact on civic society\u2019s rules for helping males and females preserve their complementary, equal and overlapping private and public lives. For example, the   push has attacked the nation\u2019s   social rules for   bathrooms and shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys,   curricula and university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.
