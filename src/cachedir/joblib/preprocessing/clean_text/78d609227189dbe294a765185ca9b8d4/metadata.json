Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the Middle East into their battlefield. Rather than fighting directly, they wield and in that way worsen the region\u2019s direst problems: dictatorship, militia violence and religious extremism. The history of their rivalry tracks  \u2014   and helps to explain  \u2014   the Middle East\u2019s disintegration, particularly the   sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate. It is a story in which the United States has been a supporting but constant player, most recently by backing the Saudi war in Yemen, which kills hundreds of civilians. These dynamics, scholars warn, point toward a future of civil wars, divided societies and unstable governments. F. Gregory Gause III, an international relations scholar at Texas A  M University, struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way. Central Africa could be similar, he suggested, referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that, driven by meddling regional powers, killed five million. But in the Middle East, it is just getting started. Saudi Arabia, a young country pieced together only in the 1930s, has built its legitimacy on religion. By promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at Mecca and Medina, it could justify its royal family\u2019s grip on power. Iran\u2019s revolution, in 1979, threatened that legitimacy. Iranians toppled their authoritarian government, installing Islamists who claimed to represent \u201ca revolution for the entire Islamic world,\u201d said Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The revolutionaries encouraged all Muslims, especially Saudis, to overthrow their rulers as well. But because Iran is mostly Shiite, they \u201chad the greatest influence with, and tended to reach out to, Shia groups,\u201d Dr. Pollack said. Some Saudi Shiites, who make up about 10 percent of the population, protested in solidarity or even set up offices in Tehran  \u2014   stoking Saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism. This was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry, which would encompass the whole region. \u201cThe Saudis have looked at Iran as a domestic threat from the   from 1979,\u201d Dr. Gause said. Seeing the threat as intolerable, they began looking for a way to strike back. They found that way the next year, when Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq invaded Iran, hoping to seize   territory. Saudi Arabia, Dr. Pollack said, \u201cbacked the Iraqis to the hilt because they want the Iranian revolution stopped. \u201d The war, over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks, killed perhaps a million people. It set a pattern of   struggle through proxies, and of sucking in the United States, whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals. The conflict\u2019s toll exhausted Iran\u2019s zeal for sowing revolution abroad, but gave it a new mission: to overturn the     regional order that Tehran saw as an existential threat. That sense of insecurity would later drive Iran\u2019s meddling abroad, said Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs. The 1990s provided a pause in the regional rivalry, but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force. Saudi Arabia, wishing to contain Iran\u2019s reach to the region\u2019s minority Shiite populations, sought to harden   rifts. Government programs promoted \u201c  incitement in schools, Islamic universities, and the media,\u201d Toby Matthiesen, an Oxford University scholar, wrote in a brief for the Carnegie Endowment. These policies, Dr. Matthiesen warned, cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the Islamic State. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, a Saudi ally. The United States, after expelling the Iraqis, established military bases in the region to defend its allies from Iraq. This further tilted the regional power balance against Iran, which saw the American forces as a threat. Iraq\u2019s humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up, particularly in poorer communities that happened to be Shiite Arab. In response, Dr. Gause said, \u201cSaddam\u2019s regime became explicitly sectarian,\u201d widening   divides to deter future uprisings. That allowed Iran, still worried about Iraq, to cultivate allies among Iraq\u2019s increasingly disenfranchised Shiites, including militias that had risen up. Though it was not obvious at the time, Iraq had become a powder keg, one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later. The 2003   invasion, by toppling an Iraqi government that had been hostile to both Saudi Arabia and Iran, upended the region\u2019s power balance. Iran, convinced that the United States and Saudi Arabia would install a pliant Iraqi government  \u2014   and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on Iran in the 1980s  \u2014   raced to fill the postwar vacuum. Its leverage with Shiite groups, which are Iraq\u2019s largest demographic group, allowed it to influence Baghdad politics. Iran also wielded Shiite militias to control Iraqi streets and undermine the   occupation. But sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum, hastening the country\u2019s slide into civil war. Saudi Arabia sought to match Iran\u2019s reach but, after years of oppressing its own Shiite population, struggled to make inroads with those in Iraq. \u201cThe problem for the Saudis is that their natural allies in Iraq,\u201d Dr. Gause said, referring to Sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism, \u201cwanted to kill them. \u201d This was the first sign that Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategy for containing Iran, by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the region\u2019s Sunni majority, had backfired. As Sunni governments collapsed and Sunni militias turned to jihadism, Riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies. As their competition in Iraq heated up, Saudi Arabia and Iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state: Lebanon. Lebanon provided the perfect opening: a frail democracy recovering from civil war, with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion. Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited those dynamics, waging a new kind of proxy struggle \u201cnot on conventional military battlefields,\u201d Dr. Gause said, but \u201cwithin the domestic politics of weakened institutional structures. \u201d Iran, for instance, supported Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political movement, which it had earlier cultivated to use against Israel. Riyadh, in turn, funneled money to political allies such as the Sunni prime minister, Rafik Hariri. By competing along Lebanon\u2019s religious lines, they helped drive the Lebanese government\u2019s frequent breakdowns, as parties relied on foreign backers who wanted to oppose one another more than build a functioning state. With Iran promoting Hezbollah as the nation\u2019s defender and Saudi Arabia backing the Lebanese military, neither had a full mandate, and Lebanon struggled to maintain order. As the foreign powers escalated their antagonism, Lebanon\u2019s dysfunction spiraled into violence. In 2005, after Mr. Hariri called for the withdrawal of   Syrian troops, he was assassinated. (Hezbollah has long been suspected.) Another political crisis, in 2008, culminated with Hezbollah overpowering Sunni militias to seize much of Beirut. Saudi Arabia requested United States air cover, according to a WikiLeaks cable, for a   force to retake the city. Though the intervention never materialized, the episode was a dress rehearsal for the turmoil that would soon come to the wider region. When the Arab Spring toppled governments across the Middle East, many of them Saudi allies, Riyadh feared that Iran would again fill the vacuums. So it rushed to close them, at times with force. It promised billions in aid to Jordan, Yemen, Egypt and others, often urging those governments to crack down. After   protesters rose up in Bahrain, a Saudi ally whose Sunni king rules over a majority Shiite population, Saudi Arabia sent 1, 200 troops. In Egypt, Saudi Arabia tacitly supported a 2013 military takeover, seeing the military as a more reliable ally than the elected Islamist government it replaced. As Libya fell into civil war, it backed a   general who was driving to consolidate control. Though Iran has little influence in either country, Saudi Arabia\u2019s fear of losing ground to Iran made it fight harder to retain influence wherever it could, analysts believe. Syria, an Iranian ally, reversed the usual dynamic. Saudi Arabia and other   Sunni states steered money and arms to rebels, including Sunni Islamists. Iran intervened in turn, sending officers and later Hezbollah to fight on behalf of Syria\u2019s government, whose leaders mostly follow a sect of Shiism. Their interventions, civil war scholars say, helped lock Syria in the   stalemate that has killed over 400, 000. The United States has struggled to restore the region\u2019s balance. President Obama has urged Iran and Saudi Arabia \u201cto find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,\u201d he told The Atlantic. But Dr. Lynch called this plan for \u201ca   equilibrium\u201d between the Mideast powers \u201c . \u201d The nuclear agreement with Iran, instead of calming Saudi nerves, hit on fears that \u201cthe United States wants to abandon them in order to ally with Iran,\u201d Dr. Lynch said, calling the belief \u201ccrazy\u201d but widespread. Mr. Pollack said he often heard Sunni Arab leaders express this as a metaphor. \u201cThey would say, \u2018What is wrong with you people? You have this good, loving, loyal wife in us, and this crazy mistress in Iran. You don\u2019t understand how bad she is for you, and yet you endlessly run off to her the moment that she winks at you,\u2019\u201d he recounted. The White House looked for other ways to reassure Saudi leaders, facilitating arms sales and overlooking Saudi actions in Egypt and Bahrain. Then came Yemen. A rebel group with loose ties to Iran ousted the   president, deepening Riyadh\u2019s fears. Saudi Arabia launched a bombing campaign that inflicted horror on civilians but accomplished little else. The assault receives heavy American support, though the United States has few interests in Yemen other than counterterrorism and sometimes criticizes the campaign. In exchange, Riyadh acquiesced to the Iran deal and began to follow Washington\u2019s lead on Syria. But the underlying proxy war remained. Asked when the   struggle might cool, Mr. Pollack said he doubted that it would: \u201cWhere we\u2019re headed with the Middle East is the current trend extrapolated, with more failed and failing governments. \u201d In Yemen, this is already \u201creorganizing Yemeni society along sectarian lines and rearranging people\u2019s relationships to one another on a   basis,\u201d Farea   an analyst, wrote in a Carnegie Endowment paper, which cited similar trends across the region. Continued crises will risk sucking in the United States again, Mr. Lynch said, adding that no American president was likely to persuade Saudi Arabia or Iran to stay out of regional conflicts that it saw as potentially existential threats.   Donald J. Trump will enter office having echoed Saudi Arabia\u2019s view of the region. Iran \u201ctook over Iraq,\u201d he said at a rally in January. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have Yemen. They\u2019re going to have Syria. They\u2019re going to have everything. \u201d Mentioning both the   and Hillary Clinton, Dr. Gause said he doubted that any administration could reset the Middle East\u2019s power struggles. \u201cI do not think that the fundamental problem of the region,\u201d he said, \u201cis something that either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton could do that much about. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561716.1127882}
