Going back decades, residents along the coastline between Long Beach and Newport Beach have reported a powerful stench that wafts into the region every so often and lingers for an hour or longer. Depending on who is asked, it happens as frequently as multiple times a month or a handful of times a year. But it is unmistakable, residents say  \u2014   bad enough to make heads throb and stomachs queasy. (Officials said there have been no known serious illnesses linked to the odor.) \u201cIt\u2019s more than a smell,\u201d said Ellery A. Deaton, a City Council member in Seal Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s noxious. When it happens I need to run around and close my windows. \u201d The odor is commonly described as \u201c\u201d but its origin remains a stubborn mystery. Over the years, City Council, fire department and air quality officials have tried unsuccessfully to get to the bottom of it. As a result, a number of theories have flourished. Gina   a schools official who lives in Huntington Beach, said she believes it\u2019s natural gas. That\u2019s despite assurances from the Southern California Gas Company, which has investigated complaints and ruled out the possibility of a leak. Ms.   talked about the area\u2019s layout of gas lines, the trajectory of the smell\u2019s spread and her sense in the odor of a hint of mercaptan  \u2014   a natural gas additive. \u201dThe smell that I smell,\u201d she said, \u201cis the natural gas smell. \u201d Other residents wonder about offshore oil platforms, or perhaps the shipping vessels arriving into the nearby ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. \u201cMy theory, which is based mainly on the process of elimination, is that it is oil tankers off the coast releasing pressure,\u201d Ms. Deaton said. Arley M. Baker, a spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles, was skeptical of that idea. The ships abide by fairly strict clean air rules. What\u2019s more, Mr. Baker said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a function on a ship that would discharge a foul smell. \u201d Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, said the agency had investigated complaints multiple times, but has been unable to establish a cause. \u201cOdors can be very difficult to track down,\u201d he said. For the moment, the mystery seems bound to linger. Capt. Chris Coates of the Costa Mesa Fire Department said emergency dispatch has been getting calls about the smell for more than a decade. He is as perplexed as anyone, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mystique to the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows. \u201d \u2022 The Department of Justice opened a civil rights inquiry into the Orange County district attorney\u2019s office.

[The New York Times] The National Park Service said Thursday that a female mountain lion had been killed trying to cross Highway 118 in Los Angeles. The    mountain lion known as   left behind three offspring. Without their mother, they were unlikely to have the hunting skills to survive, wildlife officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s your worst nightmare in that kind of scenario,\u201d said Tanya Diamond, a wildlife ecologist.   was the 13th known mountain lion to be killed in and around the Santa Monica Mountains since 2002, when the park service began studying animals there. Untold others have been hit across the state. Ecologists say roadkill accidents are made more likely as the animal\u2019s habitat is increasingly squeezed by urban sprawl. From February 2015 to February 2016, roughly 6, 000 vehicle accidents in California involved wildlife, according to one study. The collisions have added urgency to efforts in California to create   wildlife corridors across highways that allow mountain lions, deer, foxes and other animals to cross safely between habitats in search of sustenance and mating opportunities. Caltrans has been working with wildlife advocates to advance a number of projects. One of most ambitious involves a proposed wildlife bridge in Los Angeles County that would allow animals to cross the formidable 101 freeway between the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains. At an estimated cost of more than $30 million, the Liberty Canyon wildlife corridor would be the nation\u2019s largest such crossing, advocates say. In Northern California, another project involves digging two tunnels beneath Highway 17 in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where researchers say hundreds of animals have been hit in the last eight years. Ms. Diamond, whose group Pathways for Wildlife has provided research on the Highway 17 project, said state officials were increasingly getting behind such efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time because I think now a lot of these ideas are coming to fruition,\u201d she said.
