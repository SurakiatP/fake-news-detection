[The new agents will be part of the \u201cChicago Crime Guns Strike Force. \u201d  According to CNN, \u201cATF headquarters in Washington sent out a bulletin to field offices around the country Wednesday looking for agents to volunteer for permanent transfer to the Chicago area. \u201d An unidentified official said \u201cit\u2019s unusual to ask for permanent relocation in reaction to a specific problem. \u201d Normal practice is for the agency to request a surge of agents \u201cfor 30 to 60 days. \u201d January 2017 saw a surge in shootings and violence that easily surpassed the violence witnessed in January 2016.
