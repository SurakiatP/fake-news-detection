Mike Pence of Indiana said explicitly that Donald J. Trump no longer wanted to impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. In a round of television interviews in which he was asked to clarify once and for all where the campaign stands on the proposal, Mr. Pence, who opposed the ban before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, declared the idea dead. The reversal is a significant one for the Trump campaign, which was accused of promoting a policy that was discriminatory and probably unconstitutional when Mr. Trump unveiled it in the name of national security last year. Asked on CNN about why he will not condemn the Muslim ban now, Mr. Pence said, \u201cBecause that\u2019s not Donald Trump\u2019s position now. \u201d In recent months, Mr. Trump has changed how he has talked about the ban, saying that \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants should be focused on people coming from countries that have been compromised by terrorists. But that idea led to more confusion, because it was not clear if it was an expansion of the Muslim ban or a shift away from it. Mr. Pence appeared to imply in August that he would be open to broadening the ban to other religions, but the emphasis was placed on geography. \u201cThat\u2019s what Donald Trump and I are calling for now, is to have a temporary suspension of immigration from countries or territories compromised by terrorism, and I believe that\u2019s an appropriate action given the horrendous, horrendous violence that we see,\u201d Mr. Pence told Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin talk radio host, at the time. Historians have compared Mr. Trump\u2019s Muslim ban to some of the darkest moments in American history, likening it to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the use of internment camps for   during World War II. The timing of Mr. Pence\u2019s latest remarks may not be a coincidence. Polls have shown a majority of Americans oppose the concept of barring Muslims, while Republicans remain divided about it. The retreat on Thursday was the latest example of the Trump campaign changing a position as the election approaches. Mr. Trump recently softened his position on immigration, forgoing his calls for mass deportation in favor of a focus on \u201ccriminal aliens. \u201d Mr. Pence was also one of the first members of the campaign to publicly acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, paving the way for Mr. Trump to finally end his false conspiracy theory about Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace last month. During the   debate this week, Mr. Pence brushed off many of Mr. Trump\u2019s startling comments from the campaign, disregarding some as reflecting a lack of political polish and denying that others were ever said. But critics of Mr. Trump are not letting his campaign off the hook for the Muslim ban so easily. \u201cGovernor Pence\u2019s flagrant attempts to mislead voters on his running mate\u2019s positions aren\u2019t fooling anyone,\u201d said Zara Rahim, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign. \u201cNot only has Trump proposed an unconstitutional immigration ban on an entire religion, but he\u2019s suggested creating a database that tracks Muslims in this country. \u201d She added, \u201cPence has not disavowed anything, he\u2019s just lied to the American people once again. \u201d Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on   Relations, said that Mr. Trump could not simply turn the page on the Muslim ban. \u201cWhatever the Trump campaign claims is the current version of its Muslim ban, the original absolutist language of a \u2018total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u2019  \u2014   along with other bigoted statements  \u2014   reflect a systematic and toxic use of Islamophobia that has had a tremendously harmful impact on the lives of ordinary American Muslims and on the unity of our nation,\u201d Mr. Awad said. Despite efforts to quietly backtrack on the proposal, the Trump campaign has continued to face questions about the ban because the news release from last December announcing the proposal has not been removed from Mr. Trump\u2019s website. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on,\u201d the release said. But in a separate interview on MSNBC on Thursday, Mr. Pence made clear that the Muslim ban was no longer on the table. Such a proposal, he seemed to suggest, would be absurd. \u201cSo not a ban on all Muslims?\u201d Joe Scarborough, the host of \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d asked Mr. Pence. \u201cOf course not,\u201d Mr. Pence replied.'"}, "time": 1742563180.7070312}
