[Hawking made the prediction in an upcoming documentary titled Expedition New Earth, which the BBC has teased with Hawking\u2019s comments.  \u201cProfessor Stephen Hawking thinks the human species will have to populate a new planet within 100 years if it is to survive,\u201d reiterated the BBC in a statement. \u201cWith climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious. \u201d Hawking has become known for his futurist predictions, in 2014 he also claimed that \u201cthe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. \u201d Michael Guillen Ph. D. a former science editor for ABC News, disputed Hawking\u2019s prediction in an article for Fox News, claiming that the author has \u201cbecome a    celebrity, who\u2019s flung off the chains of academic rigor to make sensational pronouncements. \u201d \u201cDoes Stephen really expect to be taken seriously? I doubt it,\u201d Guillen proclaimed. \u201cDespite everything, he is too smart for that. My impression is he\u2019s become the Donald Trump of science, given to saying outrageous things for the fun of it and to attract attention. \u201d \u201cApart from being spectacularly unscientific, his prophecy is also wrongheaded,\u201d he continued. \u201cHawking says we ought to escape to Mars. Interestingly, some scientists think   once lived on the Red Planet. But a global catastrophe produced what we see today, a moribund world lacking a thick,   atmosphere  \u2014   wanting for greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, to keep warm. \u201d Guillen added that \u201cWinter temperatures can dip below minus 195 degrees Fahrenheit and summer temperatures barely reach 70 degrees,\u201d before declaring that \u201cfor the adventure, I\u2019d go to Mars this minute. But for refuge? !\u201d \u201cNo thanks, Stephen. I\u2019m not giving up on Earth,\u201d he concluded. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
