[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nAccording to a Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) addendum to this MoFA \u201curgent action\u201d report, the FBI was able to recover all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s once secret emails from the computer shared by her campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin and sexual deviant husband Anthony Weiner\u2014 both of whom are now under the protection of the FBI as \u201ccooperating witnesses\u201d against Hillary Clinton.\\nTo exactly how all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret emails and documents ended up on the Abedin-Weiner laptop computer, the SVR explains, was due to its use of the Outlook and IMAP email protocols that will sync any folder, on any device, they are told to monitor and can be told to make local copies of emails \u2014which simply means that Abedin used the laptop computer she shared with her disgraced husband to back up every communication Hillary Clinton ever made\u2014and that numbered 650,000 copies of emails, documents and other communications .\\nUnbeknownst, however, to both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, and everyone else aiding their criminality, this report continues, is that when the US Congress ordered all of these secret emails turned over to them, Clinton, in turn, ordered them all destroyed \u2014but with her, and those aiding her, failing to realize that when these emails were \u201cbleached\u201d (a computer program used to destroy hard drives) from her secret private server they did so with it offline, meaning that it wasn\u2019t able to \u201cbacktrack\u201d to the Abedin-Weiner laptop to destroy all of the backups emails, documents and communications discovered by the FBI .\\nThough the exact contents of these now discovered Hillary Clinton secret emails it is not fully \u201cknown/understood\u201d by the SVR, this report notes, the FBI agents who have been documenting their contents have become so horrified by what they\u2019re discovering they are now reporting to the American press that Hillary Clinton is the \u201cantichrist personified\u201d .\\nEven worse, this report continues, with new Wikileaks showing that not only is Hillary Clinton and her criminal money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, being investigated by the FBI, nearly every other US intelligence and tax agency have, likewise, begun investigations too .\\nThus leading, this report gravely explains, to a complete breakdown in the rule of law in the United States as the main investigators into Hillary Clinton\u2019s crimes are all now known to be her supporters who have received tens-of-millions of dollars in \u201cgifts/bribes\u201d to protect her \u2014and that led former CIA agent and American diplomat Dr. Steve Pieczenik to personally notify President Putin this past week that the US intelligence community has now launched a counter-coup against Hillary Clinton .\\n\\nThis report concludes by noting that not only did Dr. Pieczenik take the extraordinary \u201cmeasure/step\u201d of informing President Putin of this US intelligence community counter-coup, he also posted his warning to YouTube for all of the American people to see too\u2014but that in spite of its extraordinarily being viewed by over 2.5 million of these peoples in less than 24 hours , the Hillary Clinton supporting global tech giant Google has suppressed this fact from its main trends\u2014 giving the top place, instead, to a video mocking Americans that has only 1.6 million views , and that stunningly doesn\u2019t include Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s warning video at all .\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628386.061102}
