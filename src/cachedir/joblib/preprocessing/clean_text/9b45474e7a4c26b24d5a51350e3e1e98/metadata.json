Barely six weeks later, Crystal Stroup\u2019s college career was suddenly and violently derailed. In October 2015, after a small   at their apartment, her friends got worried because Ms. Stroup had had too much to drink. They enlisted the   male student from downstairs to look after her while they went out for food. The next morning, Ms. Stroup woke up disoriented and in pain. Large bruises in the shape of hand prints were emerging on her upper arm and thigh. She struggled to go to class, where she told a friend, \u201cI\u2019ve been raped. \u201d Kansas State University had been warned about the man, Jared Gihring. Another student, Sara Weckhorst, said she had complained to university officials more than a year earlier that he had raped her while she was passed out drunk at a fraternity house. On Jan. 3, Mr. Gihring, 22, pleaded not guilty to charges of raping both women. A lawyer for Mr. Gihring, Brenda Jordan, did not respond to requests for comment. But it was only after Mr. Gihring\u2019s arrest by the police here in July  \u2014   more than two years after Ms. Weckhorst first complained  \u2014   that Kansas State took action to expel him. Whether or not Ms. Stroup\u2019s alleged rape was foreseeable  \u2014   one of the issues posed by a lawsuit she filed against the university  \u2014   her case raises disturbing questions about repeat offenses on campus, and whether universities do enough to prevent them. For several years, researchers have been fiercely debating how many campus rapes are committed by serial offenders. A 2002 study based on surveys of 1, 882 college men and published in Violence and Victims, an academic journal, found that as many as 63 percent of those who admitted to behaviors that fit the definition of rape or attempted rape said they had engaged in those behaviors more than once. But in 2015, a study of 1, 642 men at two different colleges was published in JAMA Pediatrics and found that while a larger number of men admitted to behaviors that constituted rape, a smaller percentage of them, closer to 25 percent, were repeat offenders. The difference could affect how universities approach rape investigations and prevention. For example, repeat cases raise questions of whether universities should be faster to remove students from campus after accusations. \u201cThere are repeat offenders who seek out victims and will do this time and time again with impunity because there is no punishment,\u201d said Annie E. Clark, a   of End Rape on Campus, a nonprofit organization that works to assist those who have been raped and to prevent campus sexual violence. She added, \u201cWhatever the number is, it\u2019s way, way too high. \u201d A few recent cases, and the lawsuits they have spawned  \u2014   like the one at Kansas State  \u2014   have again put a spotlight on repeat campus rapes, and the questions they leave about whether something could have been done. Many university administrators say they are hampered in sexual assault investigations by women who are reluctant to identify their assailants or press charges. They also say that assaults frequently occur during parties at which students were drinking, leaving their memories clouded and the truth of what happened elusive. At Kansas State, the federal government is now involved, investigating the university\u2019s handling of the 2014 complaint by Ms. Weckhorst. The university is facing lawsuits by Ms. Weckhorst and another Kansas State student, Tessa Farmer, who also alleges she reported a rape that was not properly investigated, as well as the case brought by Ms. Stroup, now 19, who joined Ms. Weckhorst\u2019s lawsuit in November. At Indiana University, a former student, John P. Enochs, pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor battery, the result of a plea bargain. He had initially faced two counts of rape. A lawsuit filed against the university in June by one of his accusers, identified as Jane Doe 62, says Mr. Enochs raped her while she was passed out from drinking at his fraternity house. The suit says the university ignored Mr. Enochs\u2019s history of sexual assault, failing to take steps to protect her from rape. Nearly two years before Jane Doe 62 said she was raped, Mr. Enochs had been accused of sexual assault by another student. That woman supplied his name to university police, but initially declined to press charges. In a statement by its spokeswoman, Margie   the university said its policy \u201cprovides for prompt response, a fair, impartial and robust investigation, and adjudication process when responding to reports of alleged sexual assault. \u201d But, she added, \u201cour ability to do so is also reliant on the involvement and cooperation of those who may have been harmed. \u201d Stanford University is fighting a lawsuit by a student who says she was sexually assaulted in 2014 by a man who had done the same to another student as early as 2011 and physically or sexually assaulted two other students. Nonetheless, the lawsuit says, the university permitted him to remain on campus through his 2014 graduation. The university  \u2014   roiled last year by the Brock Turner sexual assault case and more recently by an article in The New York Times about its handling of sexual assault accusations against a football player  \u2014   says in its court papers in the lawsuit that the first woman did not identify the man for nearly a year, then initially declined to participate in an investigation. \u201cWe have sympathy for the plaintiff in this case, but we will be vigorously defending the lawsuit as we believe that Stanford has acted with appropriate diligence and compassion within the constraints of privacy laws,\u201d said a university spokeswoman, Lisa Lapin. Denise Cordova, the director of the office that investigates sexual assault accusations at the University of Nevada, Reno, said most students do not provide the name of the person they say assaulted them. \u201cI think, from my perspective,\u201d she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t always have the information about the person who has done this. \u201d That was not the situation, however, at Kansas State. Danielle   a former Kansas State University sexual assault investigator, said she urged the college to be more aggressive in handling sexual assault complaints, ultimately reporting the university to the United States Education Department. \u201cIt makes me feel terrible that we might have been able to prevent it,\u201d she said. She and others at Kansas State say the problem was that the university had taken the position that it was not responsible for investigating accusations of rape in fraternity houses because they are off campus. In her complaint to the Education Department, Ms.   said she was ordered to \u201cstall\u201d investigating a rape accusation at a fraternity house because the university did not want to be responsible. Also, the departing president of the university\u2019s Interfraternity Council, Zach Lowry, said the university referred sexual assault complaints involving fraternities to his organization without investigation. \u201cWhen we get these, they\u2019re pretty disturbing,\u201d said Mr. Lowry, a senior political science major from Stockton, Kan. \u201cWhen we give them to our judicial board, they\u2019re students. They\u2019re not trained to handle investigations. \u201d Officials at Kansas State declined requests for interviews, but, in a statement, the university said its protocol was to \u201caddress misconduct and safety concerns expeditiously and it always has been. \u201d It added that \u201cthe blanket statement that   does not investigate   incidents is simply inaccurate. \u201d But Ms. Stroup believes her rape could have been prevented if the university had heeded warnings from Ms. Weckhorst, of Doylestown, Pa. On April 26, 2014, when she was a    freshman, Ms. Weckhorst had joined friends at Pillsbury Crossing, a recreation area near Kansas State\u2019s campus that is known for its picturesque waterfalls and a shallow swimming area. After drinking as many as 13 shots of liquor, she said, she recalled little of what happened that day after 4 p. m. When she woke up hours later, she said, she was in a room filled with beds, completely naked, intoxicated and confused. As she lay face up on a mattress, a man she did not know was having sexual intercourse with her. \u201cWhen Sara was able to get the male off her, she got up from the mattress and at that time the male made a statement that he wasn\u2019t the first guy she\u2019d had sex with that day,\u201d the police report said. The man told Ms. Weckhorst that she also had sex twice that day with another man  \u2014   once in the bed of a truck at Pillsbury Crossing and again when he drove her to the Sigma Nu fraternity house, according to the police report. Word of what had happened at Pillsbury Crossing circulated on the social media app Yik Yak, according to Ms. Weckhorst\u2019s lawsuit. Ms. Weckhorst filed a complaint with an investigator for the university, naming Mr. Gihring and the other man, both Sigma Nu pledges. But the university employee told her that because the reported events occurred off campus, Kansas State would not take any action, according to her lawsuit. After the semester ended, she and her parents met with university officials on campus. \u201cThis will continue to affect our daughter for the rest of her life,\u201d her mother said during the meeting. Nothing \u201cwill ever   what has been done by this facility of higher education. \u201d Mr. Gihring, of Newton, Kan. eventually moved to University Crossing, an apartment complex within view of the university\u2019s football stadium. Ms. Stroup arrived at Kansas State from Clay Center, Kan. for her freshman year in August 2015. She also moved into University Crossing, in an apartment near Mr. Gihring. The lawsuit she filed in November says that, after the small gathering at their apartment on Oct. 6, 2015, her roommates left Mr. Gihring to watch over her while they went for food. \u201cOnce alone in the apartment, J. G. went into Crystal\u2019s bedroom and raped her,\u201d the complaint says, referring to Ms. Stroup. On the advice of her lawyer, Cari Simon, Ms. Stroup would not discuss details of that night because she may be called to testify in the criminal trial against Mr. Gihring, scheduled for May. Ms. Stroup said she had been under immense stress, partly because it was impossible to avoid Mr. Gihring on campus and at her apartment complex. Ultimately it affected her grades and forced her to drop out of school, she said. She now works in a nursing home kitchen, not exactly the health care career she had hoped for. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to pick up the pieces and start over again,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742564029.5603044}
