[And it\u2019s only a matter of time before the other parties get behind the idea now that Labour\u2019s draft programme for   says Norway \u201cshould consider introducing a third gender category\u201d according to a member of the programme committee.  \u201cPeople who define themselves as neither male nor female would have the opportunity of being legally recorded as a third gender\u201d Mani Hussaini, who also leads the   Workers Youth League, told NRK. \u201cFor example in a person\u2019s passport it would say they were not male or female but instead belong in a third gender category. \u201cI believe all people should have the opportunity to live out their identity and then have to adapt the laws to reality and not vice versa,\u201d he explained. Asserting that there\u2019s a \u201cbroad mood\u201d in favour of the proposal, Hussaini told the public broadcaster he\u2019s confident that other parties will back the option for Norwegians to legally \u2018become\u2019 a third gender. \u201cI feel that [people who claim to be neither male nor female are] a movement. When the country\u2019s largest party backs [creating a third gender option] I expect we\u2019ll see all the other parties following suit. \u201d Health spokesman for Centre, part of the   coalition which governed Norway until 2013, said her party isn\u2019t ready to support the creation of another gender category. Kjersti Toppe told NRK: \u201cIt is an issue, but to amend the law to introduce a third gender would affect us all. It\u2019s a proposal that Centre are nowhere near ready to consider. \u201d Left party politician Kjetil Kjenseth said it\u2019s \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before a third gender is written into law, asserting that \u201csupport is high among younger representatives of several parties\u201d. Proposed by the Left party, but supported by just the Greens and the Socialist Left Party, Norway\u2019s parliament overwhelmingly voted against the introduction of a third gender category last April. Explaining his support for the policy, Kjenseth told NRK: \u201c[The introduction of a third gender] doesn\u2019t mean much for the rest of us, but would greatly benefit those who don\u2019t find their gender expressed in the categories of male and female. \u201cThis applies not only to transgender people but also a great number of heterosexuals who have alternating gender expression. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562025.8840473}
