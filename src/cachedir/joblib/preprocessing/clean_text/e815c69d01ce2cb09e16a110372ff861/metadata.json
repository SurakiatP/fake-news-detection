Her communications adviser Jennifer Palmieri wrote in an email: \u201cTeam \u2014 wanted to let you know that Cheryl is working with State to get agreement on release of the 55k pages of emails she have to State. The hope would be that we are able to say tonight to the press that we are working with State to get emails released soon.\u201d \\n\u201cNot sure where those discussions will land, but hope is either State agrees to release on >> timely basis or we pledge to release them ourselves in ten days/week. Assume you all would agree this is right move?\u201d \\nIn reply, her media adviser, former senior adviser to Barack Obama in both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the White House, Jim Margolis, wrote to John Podesta asking: \u201cIf there is a release of the 55K, are there others that are not being released?\u201d To which Podesta replied: \u201cDefinitely.\u201d The revelation shows how worried the Clinton team were of the inflammable nature of the email affair which has dogged her campaign for nearly a year.
