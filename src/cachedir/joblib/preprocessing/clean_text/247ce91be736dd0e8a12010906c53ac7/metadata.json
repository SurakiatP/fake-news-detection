Fine, then Arizona Democrats will sue their state GOP\u2019s sorry ass\u2026 And they\u2019ve got a good chance of winning. \\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 was a huge win for the Republican Party. Since high voter turnout \u2014 especially high minority voter turnout \u2014 creates victories for Democrats, it makes sense for the GOP to keep as many people from voting as they possibly can. There\u2019s just one thing the party of Donald Trump forgot: Voters still do have some rights, and the GOP doesn\u2019t get to do whatever the hell it wants. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s calls for \u201cpoll watchers\u201d to prevent nonexistent \u201cvoter fraud\u201d may land the Republican Party in some serious hot water. AZ Central reports the Democratic Party of Arizona filed a lawsuit and seeks a court order banning Mein Trumpf\u2019s bands of brown shirts from the polling places. \\n\u2018The suit filed in federal court in Phoenix Monday seeks an order blocking volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The suit says the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump\u2019s campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing \u201ccitizen journalists\u201d and \u201cpoll watchers\u201d to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8.\u2019 \\nAnd despite the demise of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, they\u2019ve still got some ammo. Last week, Rachel Maddow talked about something the GOP forgot about: That pesky old legal consent decree. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee (RNC) employed similar \u201cpoll watcher\u201d tactics during a tight governor race in New Jersey. Their \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d employed heavy-handed tactics in minority districts and won the race for their candidate by a razor thin margin. \\nUnfortunately, the GOP\u2019s short-term win backfired and had long-term consequences: a 35-year consent decree that puts strong limits on their \u201cpoll watching\u201d activities. These legal restrictions don\u2019t expire until next year. Naturally, Donald Trump\u2019s renewed call for \u201cpoll watchers\u201d has triggered concerns on the part of DNC lawyers at the national level. Now, they\u2019re demanding that the courts extend the consent decree through 2025. Watch: Rachel Maddow explains how Trump\u2019s call for \u201cpoll watchers\u201d is causing legal trouble for the RNC. \\nOf course, Tim Sifert, the state\u2019s GOP spokesman, insists these poll watchers aren\u2019t trying to intimidate voters. They\u2019re just helping \u201cmonitor\u201d polling places since \u2014 thanks to SCOTUS \u2014 we no longer have as many actual monitors for U.S. elections. But, as POLITICO points out, there\u2019s a huge difference between having impartial observers around to provide advice and support for voters and poll workers and having \u201cpoll watchers\u201d spreading misinformation and scaring voters. \\n\u2018Trump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. Voter suppression has changed since the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs in two distinct stages: one before the election, and one at the polling locations themselves.\u2019 \\nThe POLITICO article explains how the GOP tries to scare people into not voting in two stages. Stage 1: Before an election, Republicans try to keep people from casting their ballots with false \u2014 and sometimes scary \u2014 information. In 2008, mailers went out telling Democratic voters in Virginia that Election Day had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods in Milwaukee (2004) and Philadelphia (2008) got plastered with flyers warning that people with unpaid child support and parking tickets might get arrested when they show up to vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called \u201cpoll watchers\u201d \u2014 often with fake badges and IDs that make them look like they\u2019re in positions of authority \u2014 single out non-white voters with demands for ID and questions about their citizenship. They also often scare off eligible voters by taking photos and video footage (which sounds innocuous unless you happen to be among the roughly 7.5 million people being stalked each year). \\nAnd, let\u2019s not forget \u2014 here\u2019s what \u201cpoll watchers\u201d looked like during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era.
