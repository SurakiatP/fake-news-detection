One Sunday in 1984, my father did something unexpected, at least for a white man in Georgia. He drove us past the little rural church we usually attended and kept going 40 miles south, all the way to Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist  \u2014   home parish of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and an epicenter of the American civil rights movement. Reading Michael Eric Dyson\u2019s \u201cTears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America,\u201d I was often reminded of that morning, when I was first exposed to the righteous anger, wry humor and unflinching honesty of a black pastor, determined to guide and teach his flock. While Dyson is best known as a writer and sociologist, he is also an ordained Baptist minister, and his new book draws both its impassioned style and its moral urgency from his years in the pulpit. At a time when one video after another has forced us to acknowledge that unarmed   are regularly killed by the police, Dyson desperately wants his readers to confront the sources of that violence in our nation\u2019s longstanding culture of white supremacy. But he also knows how many political arguments and sociological studies have fallen on deaf ears. And so rather than a treatise, \u201cTears We Cannot Stop\u201d is a fiery sermon, and an unabashedly emotional, personal appeal. \u201cWhat I need to say\u201d to white America, Dyson writes, can only be said in \u201ca plea, a cry, a sermon, from my heart to yours. \u201d The result is one of the most frank and searing discussions of race I have ever read. This is a book that will anger some readers, especially those who reject Dyson\u2019s central premise: that if we want true racial equality in America, whites themselves must destroy the enduring myths of white supremacy. Even sympathetic readers might mistake this extraordinary work for merely a catalog of white sins. But such a reading fails to account for the actual experience of Dyson\u2019s sermon, in which a black preacher speaks to his white congregants in the most tender, intimate terms, even as he preaches against a culture of \u201cwhiteness\u201d that \u201cgrows more shameless, more cruel, more uncaring by the day. \u201d Dyson is all too familiar with the claims of innocence and the kneejerk defensiveness that will surely greet this book, and yet he sets out to conquer such denial not only with the difficult truth but also, astonishingly, with love. \u201cBeloved,\u201d he writes, in the voice of one ministering to the sick, \u201cyour white innocence is a burden to you, a burden to the nation, a burden to our progress. It is time to let it go, to let it die in the place of the black bodies it wills into nonbeing. \u201d Many white readers may wince, as I did, to hear their own indifference to black suffering named with such precision, and some, desperate not to face their involvement in America\u2019s systems of racial oppression, might abandon this book altogether. But that would be to miss an essential lesson. For again and again Dyson makes it clear that more than white guilt, he seeks action, and more than condemnation, he wants change. He wants readers to wake from their sleep of ignorance about \u201cwhat it means to be black in America. \u201d Reading his praise for James Baldwin, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that the same is true of Dyson himself: \u201cHis words drip with the searing eloquence of an evangelist of race determined to get to the brutal bottom of America\u2019s original sin. \u201d If there is a criticism here, it is that Dyson gathers steam slowly, and his opening \u201cHymns of Praise\u201d to   artists give little indication of the moral power to come. But this is a small quibble with a deeply serious, urgent book, which should take its place in the tradition of Baldwin\u2019s \u201cThe Fire Next Time\u201d and King\u2019s \u201cWhy We Can\u2019t Wait. \u201d The comparison might at first seem hyperbolic, but like those books, \u201cTears We Cannot Stop\u201d is a lament, originating from within the grieving heart of black America, aimed directly at white readers who are often too frightened, or indifferent, or ashamed, to look a man like Michael Eric Dyson in the eyes. I can only hope that others will read and be changed by this book. It ends with a desperate plea for white Americans to rise up in defense of, and in solidarity with, our   brothers and sisters. In response, I say simply: Amen.'"}, "time": 1742562283.2297568}
