[Congressman Massie ( ) spoke to Breitbart News on President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days, saying the president is off to a great start, and calling the nomination of Neil Gorsuch a defining moment for the Trump presidency.  He told Breitbart News: I\u2019m excited for the wins that we got already, which includes Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch being confirmed and that\u2019s going to last for decades. Neil Gorsuch was worth the entire election, everything else is a bonus. As for other stuff he scores big points for rolling back the regulatory state. In my district two big deals are the EPA\u2019s Waters of the US rule, and the Social Security gun grab. I\u2019m excited about those things. Massie explained that he loves using the Congressional Review Act to repeal regulations. He explained, \u201cI lost track of how many we\u2019ve done, and it was only used once successfully before Trump. and that was an OSHA rule with President George W. Bush that Bush was able to rescind a rule created during the Clinton era. I\u2019m excited about all of those and more. but I\u2019m particularly excited about the Social Security gun ban. \u201d The Kentucky congressman would love to see a comprehensive infrastructure plan. Massie said: I would love for us to make progress on infrastructure. I am one of the most conservative members of Congress, and I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I believe it\u2019s vital to our country. it\u2019s one of the few things our country should spend money on. I believe that there\u2019s a constitutional and a federal nexus for it so I\u2019d like to figure out how to address the nation\u2019s infrastructure needs. Trump spoke to that on the campaign, and I think that a lot of Republicans and Democrats agree that we need this. So I believe that Trump can get the six votes he needs in the Senate to pass an infrastructure plan. We know he can get 218 in the House. I\u2019m really excited he chose Elaine Chao to be Transportation Secretary. Massie cheered Trump nominating Scott Garrett to run the   Bank. He said: He couldn\u2019t pick a better person than Scott Garrett to run the   Bank. Obviously I want to eliminate the   Bank, but if there\u2019s going to be someone to run, then Scott should run it. He\u2019s the best person he can choose. It\u2019s not in the win column, but it\u2019s something for Congress to do, not the president. We should elect more people in Congress to get rid of the   Bank. Looking forward, Congressman Massie believes that tax reform can do some great work if it cuts Americans\u2019 tax burden and does not add to the deficit. He said: In spite of the caution, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in tax reform. I think what we should do instead of swallowing the entire apple whole, we should take several bites at it. I agree in large part with Stephen Moore and Larry Kudlow in their Wall Street Journal   that we should take it slow and rack up some wins and realize that tax reform does not have to be revenue neutral. Revenue neutral means that someone\u2019s taxes are going down and somebody\u2019s taxes are going up. \u201cI would like us to see a real tax cut along with tax reform and we can accomplish that without increasing the deficit. We can make up the difference by cutting spending, especially in a lot of ways that works with Trump\u2019s narrative. We spent a $100 billion in Afghanistan rebuilding their infrastructure  \u2026    . I would like to see Trump bring that money back. That\u2019s a great opportunity right there,\u201d Massie concluded.'"}, "time": 1742562286.014053}
