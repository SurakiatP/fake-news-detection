[Most famous among the executive orders: Obama\u2019s unconstitutional shielding of illegal aliens from deportation in 2012, carving out exemptions for illegal aliens who arrived in the U. S. as minors. It granted a form of legal status and work permits to some 1. 4 million illegals who signed up \u2014  and an \u201cadvance parole\u201d that would let them claim U. S. citizenship, completely absent of Congressional oversight, let alone approval.  Trump transition officials also asked to see any illegal aliens\u2019 records who had been changed to ensure federal workers were not altering them to help the illegals stay in the U. S. according to Reuters. The illegal aliens who signed up for amnesty freely gave the government their addresses, identities, and admission that they\u2019re in the country illegally, meaning they could be the first in line when the deportations begin under a Trump administration. \u201cFour years ago I pointed out the fundamental problem with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: Anyone who signed up for DACA would be adding their names to a list of   illegal aliens. Should a future administration decide that it would start enforcing the law, the DACA program would provide list of prime candidates for deportation,\u201d writes John Miano at the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). \u201cAt the time, this was so obvious that I was surprised anyone would be stupid enough to sign up for DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans). Yet apparently hundreds of thousands of people did so anyway. \u201d Roughly one million of the illegal aliens who signed up for Obama\u2019s amnesty are from Mexico, CIS added. There may be as many as thirty million illegal aliens living in America in defiance of U. S. law. Any and every illegal alien in the U. S. is subject to deportation, Trump said in a major policy speech given in Phoenix, Arizona, roughly two months before his election win. There will be \u201czero tolerance\u201d for illegal immigration under a Trump administration. \u201cAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation  \u2014   that is what it means to have laws and to have a country,\u201d Trump said. The Trump transition team also requested that the Department of Homeland Security \u201d assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction,\u201d and look into expanding detention capabilities for illegal aliens and aerial surveillance of the U. S.  border: In response to the transition team request, U. S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U. S.  border, and about the same distance along the U. S.  border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters  \u2026     One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1, 200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration  \u2026     Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11. 37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing. The meeting between transition team and DHS officials took place Dec. 5, Reuters said.'"}, "time": 1742564151.0294213}
