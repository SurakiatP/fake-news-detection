Their tolerance of Mr. Trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . But on one point, all sides agree: They have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. And Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations are making the Republicans\u2019 control of the Senate, perhaps even the House, more tenuous. Many Republicans, even those whose contempt for Mr. Trump matches their ill will for President Obama, still view the choice between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. They believe that Mr. Trump, guided by a   Congress, will break their way more than Mrs. Clinton ever would. For others, the vacancy on the Supreme Court  \u2014   and its potential to reshape the high court\u2019s rulings for years  \u2014   overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee\u2019s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. \u201cThe Supreme Court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, where Mr. Trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly Republican state. Congressional Republicans who are up for    \u2014   especially the handful like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire who still face primaries  \u2014   have made a basic calculation. They have criticized Mr. Trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. And party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and Mr. Trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. Alienating Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. Their fears at this point appear justified. A poll conducted the last week of July by CBS News found that support for Mr. Trump among Republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. So the leaders largely responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks with feigned indifference. \u201cRepublican elected officials are in a tough spot,\u201d said Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor of The Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. \u201cThey are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. Some Republicans are reluctant to attack Donald Trump because they\u2019d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. \u201d Mr. Trump pointedly declined on Tuesday to endorse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nation\u2019s   elected Republican, and verged on outright opposition to Mr. McCain and Ms. Ayotte, just hours after Mr. Obama challenged Republicans to denounce their nominee. Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have put Republicans into an untenable position: Criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for    \u2014   but sitting idly as Mr. Trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. \u201cIf you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?\u201d Mr. Obama asked during a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement, and Ms. Ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, \u201cI call it like I see it,\u201d in reference to her defense of a fallen Army captain whose family Mr. Trump had derided. While many Republicans are hoping for ticket splitters  \u2014   those who might vote Democrat for president but Republican on the rest of the ticket  \u2014   the parsing is all the more difficult. Many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. \u201cIn 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cIt was not like Passover, where the door was marked, \u2018This one should be spared.\u2019 No, the Angel of Death came in and said no \u2018Let\u2019s kill them all.\u2019 \u201d It is not just a question of individual desires to win    \u2014   although that certainly drives many of the statements about Mr. Trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. Republicans believe they need to maintain the House and the Senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. \u201cThe speaker\u2019s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican operative who once worked for former Speaker John A. Boehner. \u201cThe political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. \u201d Republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the Washington establishment. This was the lesson Senator Ted Cruz of Texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the Republican convention last month for declining to get behind Mr. Trump, and accounts for some of the heat that Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a founder of the Never Trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. Then, there is the vehement opposition to Mrs. Clinton, especially how they view her role in the Benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among Republicans. \u201cI happen to think that lying to the American people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of Donald Trump,\u201d said Mr. Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. He added: \u201cNothing united Republicans more than Hillary Clinton. \u201d Some still may pull away. On Tuesday, Representative Richard Hanna, Republican of New York, said he would endorse Mrs. Clinton for president, calling Mr. Trump \u201cunfit to serve. \u201d But Mr. Hanna is not representative of the broader Republican conference. \u201cHe came to Congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,\u201d Mr. Gonzales said. \u201cHe would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . But since he\u2019s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what\u2019s on his mind. \u201d But if Mr. Trump falls in the polls and Republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, Mr. Hanna might not be alone.'"}, "time": 1742563164.7577047}
