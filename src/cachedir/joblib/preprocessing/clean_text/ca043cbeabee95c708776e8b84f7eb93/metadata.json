He reminded the crowd that he once served as a career prosecutor in the Justice Department, a department that was \u201cblind\u201d and \u201cindependent,\u201d and he believed that nobody was above the law. \u201cI miss President Obama right now,\u201d Perez said, claiming that Obama understood the importance of the department\u2019s independence. Perez insisted that Trump\u2019s actions were \u201cunprecedented and unconscionable\u201d and accused him of acting worse than former President Richard Nixon.

In response, the crowd shouted, \u201cWorse! Worse! Worse!\u201d He called for members of Congress to oppose confirmation of a new FBI director without first appointing a special prosecutor. \u201cWe must continue this effort that the facts come out, I am not afraid of the facts, I can handle the truth, the American people need to have the truth of what happened!\u201d he shouted.
