PETERSBURG, Russia  \u2014   When a global governing body for sports barred Russia\u2019s track and field team from the 2016 Summer Olympics on Friday over a   doping scandal, it was greeted in Russia, as is so often the case here these days, with a deep sense of victimhood. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called the decision \u201cunjust, of course. \u201d Russia, Mr. Putin said, is strengthening antidoping controls and athletes should bear personal responsibility for using   drugs. But punishing the whole team, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit any norms of civilized behavior. \u201d Outside Russia, sporting officials viewed the unanimous decision as a long overdue restoration of some fairness in competitions. After all, in some sporting events Russian athletes had been trouncing competitors for years before it turned out they were using   drugs. But here, the decision only added support for a narrative in Russia\u2019s political culture of grievances that revolves around perceived slights and   conspiracies taking place in the outside world, particularly in Western countries. \u201cOnly people who are lazy don\u2019t kick Russia in sports these days,\u201d Dmitry Svishchev, the chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports, culture and youth affairs, told   a sporting news agency, in response to the ban. \u201cUnfortunately, there is such a tendency now. \u201d The ban is the latest setback in Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts to shed Russia\u2019s pariah status on geopolitical issues like the Ukraine crisis and the war in Syria. When the news broke, Mr. Putin was seeking to win allies among European politicians Friday at an economic forum, where he recited in a speech a long list of grievances against Russia, including the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Russia, he said, expected an \u201cera of benevolence,\u201d but was  . In 2014, the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia annexed Crimea in March of that year and intervened in the war in the east of Ukraine, the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. The sense of   humiliation over the   period has been felt in sports, too, and the Olympic ban prompted some Russians to uncork their anger. The chairman of the Russian Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Aleksei Pushkov, wrote on Twitter that \u201cthe Rio Games ban for our track and field team is an act of political revenge against Russia for its independent foreign policy. \u201d The decision caps a glum week for Russian sports, during which soccer hooligans rioted in Marseille, France, after Russia and England played to a draw. Videos showed fans streaming through the streets, wielding the weapons of choice of soccer hooligans  \u2014   beer bottles and folding chairs  \u2014   in running melees that left property smashed and dozens injured. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything scary in the fighting of fans,\u201d Igor Lebedev, a member of Parliament who is also on the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, said in a post on Twitter. \u201cOn the contrary, good job boys. Stand strong!\u201d Also on Twitter, the spokesman for the Investigative Committee, a powerful law enforcement agency, responded to the assertion of a Marseille prosecutor that the Russians were apparently trained fighters. \u201cA normal man, as a man should be, surprises them,\u201d wrote the spokesman, Vladimir Markin. \u201cThey are used to seeing \u2018men\u2019 at gay parades. \u201d Officials also found themselves on the defensive when it emerged that a prominent extreme rightist, Aleksandr Shprygin, who has been photographed raising his hand in a Nazi salute, led a formal Russian fan club, the Union of Supporters, to France. Groups that monitor hate speech regard Mr. Shprygin as someone who has played a leading role in introducing   ideals into Russia\u2019s soccer hooligan culture. The global governing body for track and field, the International Association of Athletics Federations, announced the Olympics ban on Friday, ruling in a unanimous vote that Russia had not done enough to restore global confidence in its athletes\u2019 integrity. Speaking before the announcement, Mr. Putin said the allegations of doping against his country\u2019s athletes were part of a politically motivated \u201c  policy\u201d by the West. There should be \u201cno collective punishment,\u201d of athletes, Mr. Putin said of the allegations that Russia\u2019s athletes engaged in the extensive use of   drugs. Sports doping is a global problem, he said, and Russia has been unfairly singled out. \u201cSports area cannot be politicized,\u201d Mr. Putin said Friday. \u201cThis cannot be a foundation for building   policy. \u201d Mr. Putin denied   of doping, one of the pivotal accusations against Russia. \u201cThere have never been and cannot be any support for violations in sports, in particular, in the field of doping, at the state level in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have cooperated and will cooperate with all international organizations that work in this field. \u201d After the announcement, Mr. Putin added \u201cI hope that we find some solution here, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean we will become insulted and say we won\u2019t fight against doping. It\u2019s the other way around, we will strengthen the fight against doping. \u201d Russia\u2019s sports ministry, which has alternatively stonewalled investigators and conceded that abuses had taken place but said they had been addressed, issued a statement saying it would appeal the decision and expressed disappointment. \u201cThe Russian side has done everything to restore trust of the international sports community in our athletes,\u201d it said. A laboratory in Britain now tests the urine of Russian athletes. \u201cEvery Russian athlete undergoes three additional tests. \u201d A Russian champion   Yelena Isinbayeva, 34, said that she would sue the I. A. A. F. for \u201ca breach of human rights\u201d for barring her from the Olympics, and that the ban was particularly painful as the 2016 Games would be the last for her. Russian commentators said the sporting scandal could be seen as a microcosm of Russia\u2019s broader struggles in the world today. \u201cOfficials share this view of Russian society, a society on the defensive,\u201d Sergei Markov, a former lawmaker with the ruling United Russia party, said of the soccer riots in Marseille. \u201cWhy should we trust the French authorities that these Russian hooligans are more guilty than the British hooligans? No. If we believe we are under attack, then we believe that Russian soccer hooligans are under attack. They had a right to defend themselves. \u201cPartly, they fought for Crimea on the Marseille streets,\u201d Mr. Markov said.'"}, "time": 1742563407.3367755}
