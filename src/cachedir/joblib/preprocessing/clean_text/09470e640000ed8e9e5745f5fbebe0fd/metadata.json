Image Credit: Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty Images \\nQueen cites a recent Al-Jazeera editorial written by French sociologist and media critic Ali Saad. \\nIn the article, Saad takes exception with much of the media for not pointing out Dylan\\'s pro-Israel political stance when reporting the news of his Nobel award. \\nSaad writes: \\n\u201c....media outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with Dylan\\'s pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed.\u201d \\nSaad also cites Dylan\\'s early \\'80s song \u201cNeighborhood Bully,\u201d whose lyrics supposedly express support of Israel metaphorically, as proof that Dylan has held that point of view for decades. \\nNaturally, since the majority of ultra-progressives tend to view Israel as an \u201coccupying force\u201d with an aggressive military, Saad sees it as unbecoming of an anti-war icon to pledge allegiance to such a state.

The musician still hasn\\'t responded to the Nobel organization\\'s attempts to contact and congratulate him. \\nAs Ultimate Classic Rock writes: \\n\"Bob Dylan\u2018s decision to not acknowledge having won the Nobel Prize for Literature, unsurprisingly, isn\u2019t sitting too well with the Swedish Academy, the body that awards the prize. Calling it \\'an unprecedented situation,\\' an academy member has lashed out at Dylan for ignoring their attempts to contact him. \\n\\'It\u2019s impolite and arrogant,\\' Per Wastberg, a Swedish writer said on SVT public television, as reported by The Guardian. \\n\\'Yesterday, we reported that Dylan has rebuffed every attempt by the committee to contact him, either directly or through someone described as his \u201cclosest collaborator.\u201d He even removed the acknowledgement of the prize from his website. They are remaining optimistic that Dylan will attend the ceremony on Dec. 10, at which point he will be given an 18-carat gold medal and a check for approximately $900,000. As of now, Dylan\u2019s current tour is scheduled to conclude on November 23.\" \\nBut should any of it\u2014 Dylan\\'s \u201cZionism,\u201d his public indifference to having received what\\'s considered one of the great humanitarian honors in the world\u2014 surprise anyone? \\nDylan has a long history of defying expectations, from when he abandoned folk music for electric rock \\'n roll, becoming a \u201cJudas\u201d to millions of folk fans, to when he converted to Christianity in the \\'70s and wrote gospel tunes. He even famously once beat up a stalker in 1971.
