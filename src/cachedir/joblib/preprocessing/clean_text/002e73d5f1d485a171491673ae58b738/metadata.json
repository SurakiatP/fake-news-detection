The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval. \u201cFox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a   Playboy   cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,\u201d Ms. Tantaros\u2019s suit says. Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation. Mr. Ailes, the network\u2019s founding chairman and guiding force for two decades, resigned last month after a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. Mr. Ailes has denied all allegations of harassment. In April, the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms. Tantaros had concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract dispute her lawyer, Judd Burstein, said the book dispute was a pretext that Fox was using to silence her. During arbitration, Mr. Burstein said, Fox News offered to pay her a sum \u201cin the seven figures\u201d if she renounced claims against Mr. Ailes and others at the network, including the host Bill O\u2019Reilly. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome advances from Mr. O\u2019Reilly, whom she had regarded as a friend and adviser. \u201cAiles did not act alone,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cHe may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation and retaliation. \u201d Ms. Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as \u201csock puppets\u201d that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity department. Ms. Tantaros joined Fox as a contributor in 2010, and a year later was named   of \u201cThe Five,\u201d which aired at 5 p. m. She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives that she could not wear pants on the air because \u201cRoger wants to see your legs. \u201d The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug. 12, 2014, Mr. Ailes called her into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have children. \u201cAiles then started complaining about marriage in general, and also made   jokes about being married,\u201d the lawsuit states. It describes Mr. Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences of 10 Fox News personalities. He asked Ms. Tantaros to turn around \u201cso I can get a good look at you,\u201d the lawsuit charges, adding that Ms. Tantaros refused. Soon after, she was moved from \u201cThe Five\u201d to a   show, \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d that aired at midday. Mr. Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and February 2015, the lawsuit charges, and when she continued to rebuff him, she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department. In the February meeting, she said, Mr. Ailes talked about how she would look in a bikini, and accused her of ending a   relationship because she had been merely using the man. The episode brought her to tears, the lawsuit states. She said the sole interview arranged by the publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog controlled by Fox, who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult to work with. In April 2015, the lawsuit states, Ms. Tantaros met with Bill Shine, then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr. Ailes. She said that she told him about the meetings with Mr. Ailes and asked if he had told the head of publicity for Fox News, Irena Briganti, to go after her. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Shine \u201ctold Tantaros that Briganti is like a rabid dog on a chain that we can\u2019t control. Sometimes that dog gets off the chain. \u201d Then, pointing to a picture of Mr. Ailes on a magazine cover, the lawsuit charges, Mr. Shine told her that \u201cthis powerful man has faith in Irena Briganti\u201d and that Ms. Tantaros \u201cneeds to let this one go. \u201d Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, has said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes harassing her. Mr. Shine was named   of Fox News after Mr. Ailes departed.'"}, "time": 1742561621.1546977}
