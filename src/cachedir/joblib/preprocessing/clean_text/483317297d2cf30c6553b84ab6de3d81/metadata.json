C.  \u2014     Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson admitted that the Iraq war failed to achieve it\u2019s objectives. The nominee made his remarks during his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday. [Tillerson was asked by Sen. Rand Paul,  . if he supported Trump\u2019s assessment of the Iraq war that it was a failure.  \u201cI think in that regard the decision to go into Iraq and change the leadership in Iraq upon reflection was perhaps not  \u2014   did not achieve those objectives, we do not have a more stable region in the world and our national security has not been enhanced or is still certainly under threat today,\u201d Tillerson responded. He called the war \u201cwell intended\u201d but ultimately unsuccessful. Paul said he was concerned that Congress and the Executive branch were too eager to tackle \u201cterrible evil people\u201d overseas without acting in American interests. The Kentucky senator also raised concerns that the United States would invade Iran, despite the failures in Iraq. Tillerson replied that it was important for a proper balance of American values and American interests when pursuing military force overseas. He also recommended that the United States be \u201cclear\u201d about the threat posed by Iran, specifically their efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon and their support for terrorism. \u201cWe have to disrupt that,\u201d he concluded. Tillerson also compared the failures in Iraq to the failures in Libya. He then warned about acting in Syria for the same reasons. \u201cIn the case of Libya, I think that was the failing in the decision to change the regime there, no one had a clear plan or view of what would come next,\u201d he said about the military actions taken by President Obama that were backed by Hillary Clinton. He added that his job was to make sure that America didn\u2019t have to go to war. \u201cIf confirmed as Secretary of State, my job is to make sure we never get there,\u201d Tillerson stated.'"}, "time": 1742562529.628758}
