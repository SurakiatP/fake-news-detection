A minister who was hired by the Georgia Department of Public Health was recently fired because of his faith, and sermon contents. Dr. Eric Walsh, a Seventh-day Adventist lay minister, is suing the State of Georgia Department of Public Health for religious discrimination. \\nA very simple question should cross your mind as you read this report, should my pastor\u2019s sermons be approved by the Government or God? \\nThe state of Georgia inquired that the pastor relinquish his sermons to the government, according to federal court documents. \\n\u201cPlease produce a copy of your sermon notes and/or transcripts,\u201d Attorney General Samuel Olens wrote to attorneys representing Dr. Eric Walsh. \\nDr. Walsh refuses to comply with the request because in May 2014, when Walsh was hired by the District Health Director; another government official asked him to submit copies of his sermons for review. He complied, and two days later he was fired. \\nHis attorneys said the government was curious about sermons Dr. Walsh delivered on health, marriage, sexuality, world religions, science, and creationism. He also preached on what the Bible says regarding homosexuality. \\nSince the event, Dr. Walsh has filed a federal lawsuit charging state officials with engaging in religious discrimination. \\n\u201cHe was fired for something he said in a sermon,\u201d attorney Jeremy Dys told me. \u201cIf the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.\u201d \\nDr. Walsh has assembled a powerhouse legal team comprised of Parks, Chesin & Walbert along with First Liberty Institute, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent religious liberty law firms.
