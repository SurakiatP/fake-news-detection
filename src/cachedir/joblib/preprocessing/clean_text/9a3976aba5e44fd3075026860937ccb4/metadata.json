Let\u2019s turn it over to Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, for today\u2019s introduction. It will be many months before any grapes are ready to pick but winemakers in the Napa and Sonoma valleys are already fretting that they will not have enough workers for the harvest. \u201cI\u2019m   about it this year,\u201d said Nico Cueva, winemaker at Kosta Browne, a   winemaker in Sonoma County. \u201cOur industry is based on immigration. \u201d More than   of California farmworkers are undocumented immigrants and the Trump Administration\u2019s threatened crackdown is scaring many of them away, winemakers say. The labor crunch is hurting all types of agricultural businesses in California but the upscale vineyards of Napa and Sonoma have particular needs. Unlike the industrial grows of the central coast, where grapes are often mechanically harvested, grapes in Napa and Sonoma are almost always handpicked. Winemakers say this helps avoid bruising the fruit, among other advantages. Another factor, says Mr. Cueva: California\u2019s cannabis industry has been poaching some workers and   marijuana and grapes are harvested at around the same time. Austin Peterson, winemaker at Ovid, a boutique winery on the hills overlooking Napa Valley, says winemakers have already had trouble finding workers to prune the vines this year. \u201cThere\u2019s already a shortage of labor  \u2014   more than in recent memory,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone in agriculture is hopeful that immigration reform comes soon. \u201d The shortage has overtaken water concerns as the No. 1 problem for vineyards, says David E. Block, the chairman of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis. At elite wineries the optimum harvest window can sometimes be as short as six or 12 hours  \u2014   even less if unfavorable weather arrives around harvest time. So having crews available is crucial to the quality of the grapes. Could the labor shortage hurt the quality of this year\u2019s top California wines? \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s gotten bad enough to where people are thinking it will compromise the quality of the harvest,\u201d Mr. Block said. \u201cBut everyone is racing to get a crew ready to pick. \u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, will step aside from an inquiry into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

[The Mercury News] Before Indianapolis, the heart of American auto racing was in Los Angeles. It was this week in 1910 that the inaugural race was held at the Los Angeles Motordrome, the world\u2019s first wooden plank track built for automobile racing. Until then, races commonly happened in the dirt and across big distances. At the Motordrome, erected near the beach in Playa del Rey, fans had a view of all the   action on a   circular track. Crowds of more than 10, 000 people came to see the early stars of the sport push the limits of the big machines at more than 90 miles an hour around the banked track, essentially a   version of a bicycle velodrome. The racers included characters like the   Barney Oldfield, the millionaire playboy Caleb Bragg, and a native son, \u201cTerrible\u201d Teddy Tetzlaff. \u201cIt was a crazy, great time,\u201d said Harold Osmer, a racing historian. \u201cThey called it the days of chain drive, wooden spokes and   . \u201d The Motordrome burned down after three years, but by then a number of other board tracks had been constructed to cater to Angelenos\u2019 growing racing obsession. Later, around the 1930s, said Mr. Osmer, the sport\u2019s center of gravity began to shift to Indiana, home of the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But auto racing in Southern California never died  \u2014   it rather became just one of a menu of entertainment options as the region developed. There are still plenty of tracks  \u2014   in Fontana, Bakersfield, and Ventura, among other places. The Long Beach Grand Prix takes place on a street circuit this weekend. Attendance at past contests has surpassed 180, 000, making it the single largest event of the year in Long Beach. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.
