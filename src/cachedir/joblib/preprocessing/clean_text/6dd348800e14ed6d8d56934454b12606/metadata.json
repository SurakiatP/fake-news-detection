Caine, a       said \u201cpolitics is always chaotic. \u201d \u201cIn politics you\u2019re always going into areas you\u2019ve never been before, so you\u2019re going to get lost and then you\u2019re going to find your way, and then it\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he said of Europe\u2019s historic vote. Caine is currently promoting his last film Going in Style, which follows three lifelong friends who rob a bank after it stops paying out their pensions. \u201cI\u2019m playing Brian Reader, who when he did that robbery was 73,\u201d Caine said. \u201cI knew I was going to get a phone call, I said to my wife \u2018here\u2019s my next part, I think\u2019. \u201d And if you were wondering, don\u2019t expect the    star to stop acting anytime soon. \u201cPeople always say \u2018are you going to retire?\u2019 and of course the movie business retires you,\u201d Caine said, adding \u201cYou get paid a fortune for kissing the most beautiful women in the world, not a bad job is it?\u201d Caine isn\u2019t the only British celebrity to have revealed he voted for Brexit. Last month, Roger Daltrey, founder and lead singer of the English rock band The Who, reiterated his support for Britain\u2019s independence from the European Union. \u201cWe are getting out, and when the dust settles I think that it\u2019ll be seen that it\u2019s the right thing for this country to have done, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Daltrey told NME.
