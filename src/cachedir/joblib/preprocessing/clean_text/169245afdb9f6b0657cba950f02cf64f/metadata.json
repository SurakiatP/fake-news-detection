Gelobeter has since been blocked indefinitely from Wikipedia.  A course description for Gelobter\u2019s course on environmental justice activism at UC Berkeley posted on Wikipedia argued that the first few months of the Trump administration have been uniquely \u201c  sexist, and racist. \u201d This semester represents a unique moment in history  \u2026    the first few months of a historically unique U. S. President whose agenda has been explicitly   sexist, and racist. This course will use this moment in two ways: \u2022 First, as a learning opportunity for students to engage with critical issues as they emerge on the social, economic, policy, and political landscape \u2022 Second, to be of service by documenting key developments and creating a neutral source of information about them. The post was ultimately removed, as Wikipedia prevents unsourced negative claims about living people. A Wikipedia editor said that the line about the Trump administration was a \u201cblatant BLP [Biography of Living Person] violation,\u201d which means that commentary on a living person does not come from a \u201cneutral point of view. \u201d As part of Gelobter\u2019s course, students created Wikipedia articles that advanced an   agenda, containing   critiques of Trump\u2019s EPA policy among others. Wikipedia edit projects are now common in the social justice sectors of academia. Feminists at Oberlin, Bucknell, and Temple University hosted Wikipedia    events during the   academic year. Commenting on this trend, Wikipedia user \u201cJytdog\u201d argued that academia does not have the right to take over articles for the purpose of education. \u201cWikipedia is the commons and governed by community policies and guidelines. Just like companies don\u2019t have the right to dump things into public waters, classes don\u2019t have the right to take over space in the commons for classwork. Can you see that?\u201d he wrote.
