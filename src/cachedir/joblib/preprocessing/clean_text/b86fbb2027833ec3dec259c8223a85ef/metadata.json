The only group the    father of three has ever belonged to, however, is Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally, particularly its injunction \u201cThou shalt not kill. \u201d Yet, in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union, when Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K. G. B. the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values. The Justice Ministry, in a preliminary adminstrative strike last month, put the headquarters of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia, an office complex near St. Petersburg, on a list of the bodies banned \u201cin connection with the carrying out of extremist activities. \u201d Whether it stays there will depend on Russia\u2019s Supreme Court, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170, 000 Russian members from spreading \u201cextremist\u201d texts. Extremism, as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since, has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody, as it has been against some of those involved in recent   protests in Moscow and scores of other cities. Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special   unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law. In the case of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the group\u2019s absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Mr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported   activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russia\u2019s   version of the K. G. B. the Federal Security Service, or F. S. B. \u201cI have absolutely no interest in politics,\u201d he said during a recent Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a   village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president. \u201cFrom the Russian state\u2019s perspective, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are completely separate,\u201d said Geraldine Fagan, the author of \u201cBelieving in Russia  \u2014   Religious Policy After Communism. \u201d She added, \u201cThey don\u2019t get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation. \u201d \u201cThe idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of  \u2014   and also indifferent to  \u2014   the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services,\u201d she said. That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, \u201call adds up to a big conspiracy theory\u201d for the increasingly assertive F. S. B. For Mr. Sivak, it has added up to a long legal nightmare. His troubles began, he said, when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010. Accused of \u201cinciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens,\u201d he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder, Vyacheslav Stepanov, 40. The prosecutor\u2019s case, heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad, a center of the Russian Orthodox Church, produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u201cTheir disregard for the state,\u201d a report prepared for the prosecution said, \u201cerodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security. \u201d In a ruling last year, the court found the two men not guilty, and their ordeal seemed over  \u2014   until Mr. Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of \u201cterrorists and extremists. \u201d He and Mr. Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month. \u201cThere is a big wave of repression breaking,\u201d Mr. Stepanov said. In response to written questions, the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cadministrative center\u201d near St. Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism. As a result, it added, the center should be \u201cliquidated,\u201d along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures. For the denomination\u2019s leaders in Russia, the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment, previously driven mostly by local officials, drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era. Vasily Kalin, the chairman of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 Russian arm, recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child. \u201cIt is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate,\u201d he said. \u201cNever did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia. \u201d In Russia, as in many countries, the    proselytizing of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses often causes irritation, and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians. The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions. But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance. \u201cI cannot imagine that anyone really thinks they are a threat,\u201d said Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis, which monitors extremism in Russia. \u201cBut they are seen as a good target. They are pacifists, so they cannot be radicalized, no matter what you do to them. They can be used to send a message. \u201d That message, it would seem, is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program  \u2014   or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference, never mind hostility, to the Kremlin\u2019s drive to make Russia a great power again. \u201cA big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target,\u201d Ms. Fagan said. \u201cThey don\u2019t vote, so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them. \u201d Attacking Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm, if proclaimed publicly and insistently, can be punished under the   law, which was passed after Russia\u2019s second war in Chechnya and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism, the law prohibited \u201cincitement of racial, national or religious strife, and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence. \u201d But the reference to violence was later deleted, opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique, true path to religious or political salvation. Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law: The slogan \u201cOrthodoxy or Death!\u201d  \u2014   a rallying cry embraced by some   believers  \u2014   has been banned as an illegal extremist text. To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions, Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran, as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture, from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith. The main impetus for the current crackdown, however, appears to come from the security services, not the Orthodox Church. Roman Lunkin, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, a Moscow research group, described it as \u201cpart of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizations\u201d that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States. \u201cThey are controlled from outside Russia, and this is very suspicious for our secret services,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like having an organization that they do not and cannot control. \u201d Artyom Grigoryan, a former Jehovah\u2019s Witness who used to work at the group\u2019s Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church, said the organization had \u201cmany positive elements,\u201d like its ban on excessive drinking, smoking and other unhealthy habits. All the same, he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion. \u201cLook at it from the view of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is an organization that is run from America, that gets financing from abroad, and whose members don\u2019t serve in the army and don\u2019t vote. \u201d Estranged from his parents, who are still members and view his departure as sinful, he said Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses broke up families and \u201cin the logic of the state, it presents a threat. \u201d He added, \u201cI am not saying this is real or not, but it needs to be checked by objective experts. \u201d Mr. Sivak, now preparing for yet another trial, said that he had always tried to follow the law and that he respected the state, but could not put its interests above the commands of his faith. \u201cThey say I am a terrorist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all I ever wanted to do was to get people to pay attention to the Bible. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561625.5481653}
