[The rape in September led one local mayor to suggest a curfew for residents of a local  \u2019 center. Bort Koelewijn, mayor of the northeastern town of Kampen, told a local television station last month that such a restriction should be considered to prevent similar attacks in the future.  The    rapist was not identified Thursday, in line with Dutch privacy guidelines. Prosecutors said in a statement last month that he lived in an  \u2019 center. Dutch media reported that he was originally from Eritrea.'"}, "time": 1742628522.2214146}
