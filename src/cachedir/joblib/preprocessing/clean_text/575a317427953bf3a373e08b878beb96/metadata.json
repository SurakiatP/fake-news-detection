The revelations came after the arrivals of Muslim \u201cchild\u201d economic freeloaders from Calais \u2013 who apparently are much older than the teenage years they had claimed. UK Express (h/t Terry D) Britain was once again divided over the issue with Conservative MP David Davies suggesting they should be made to undergo dental tests to establish their age. His comments were met with fury by the British Dental Association (BDA) which said tests were \u201cinvasive\u201d \u2013 a statement which was backed by the Home Office. But, speaking to Express Online a social worker who asked not to be named has revealed the REAL struggles faced by those in the industry. According to the specialist THREE professionals are assigned to the first meeting with a migrant who claims to be a child. And senior child protection officers are at their wits\u2019 end. He said: \u201cSo a social worker is assigned the case. The social worker attends the assessment and because the asylum seeker is claiming to be under 17 (to come under the children\u2019s Act) an appropriate adult is also in attendance and so is an interpreter. \u201cUsually they enter the room and they see this asylum seeker is well over 17. It is that obvious. \u201cAfter they have done the process three times all three social workers have to come to a consensus on the estimated age of the asylum seeker \u2013 so let\u2019s says all three say this asylum seeker is well over 17 or 18 years old. You would think that would be the end of the process, but not so. \u201cThey tell their managers of their decisions and then the manager tells them \u2018If that\u2019s your decision then okay but the asylum seeker will now be assigned a solicitor to challenge your opinion and you are likely to be cross examined in court\u2019. After this phase of the investigation is complete, if a social worker chooses to challenge the age, they are reportedly met with anger and abuse. Many, he claims, have received calls calling them \u201cracist\u201d and have had complaints made against them. Those put in this position have said they \u201ccannot afford\u201d to fight it. One said: \u201cI just sign and say he\u2019s under 17 years because it\u2019s not worth the hassle.\u201d Social workers and child protection experts have called the system \u201cbroken\u201d in Britain. Aid workers in Calais recently admitted to the press child migrants ARE lying about their age to get to the front of the queue to Britain \u2013 and are shredding their real documents.
