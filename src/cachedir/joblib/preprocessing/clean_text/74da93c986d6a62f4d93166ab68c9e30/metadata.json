Beyonc\u00e9, with her towering album and short film \u201cLemonade,\u201d rewrote the playbook (again) in April. Adele\u2019s album \u201c25\u201d has soared since its release about a year ago, selling more than 10 million copies in the United States alone. The two artists will square off in the top categories at the Grammy Awards in February. But in a lacerating speech on Friday, Madonna  \u2014   the   female touring artist of all time, who in March wrapped up a tour that took in $170 million  \u2014   resisted the notion that all was well and fair for women entertainers, particularly as they get older. Accepting a Woman of the Year award at the Billboard Women in Music 2016 event, the    musician brought a hush over the crowd as she spoke in deeply personal terms. In the speech, Madonna said she had faced sexism, misogyny and \u201cconstant bullying and relentless abuse\u201d over the more than 30 years of her career. She spoke about being raped on a rooftop with a \u201cknife digging into my throat\u201d when she first moved to New York many years ago, an experience she first discussed publicly in 2013. She also took pride in her ability to persevere in an industry that she said did not look kindly on older women singers. \u201cPeople say that I\u2019m so controversial,\u201d she said to the crowd. \u201cBut I think the most controversial thing that I\u2019ve done is to stick around. \u201d In the world of music, she said, \u201cto age is a sin. \u201d \u201cYou will be criticized, you will be vilified, and you will definitely not be played on the radio,\u201d she added. (Beyonc\u00e9 is 35 years old Adele is 28.) In substance, the speech was not, of course, entirely new for Madonna. She has challenged sexual norms through her music, image and writing since the start of her career, pushing for, as Camille Paglia  \u2014   a cultural critic who has both supported and rebuked Madonna over the years  \u2014   wrote in 1990, \u201cyoung women to be fully female and sexual while still exercising total control over their lives. \u201d Candor has always been one of Madonna\u2019s hallmarks. In recent years, she has become something of a warrior against age discrimination, publicly rebelling, with few subtleties, against the notion that age should slow her down. But the speech on Friday was a strikingly blunt statement for the entertainer, who, if only briefly, had no intention of entertaining. And it came as debates over gender equality and latent sexism contributed to a national dialogue that grew more emotional amid America\u2019s presidential election  \u2014   a contest between a man and woman that served, in part, as a referendum on those issues. Madonna herself appeared at a surprise concert in Washington Square Park in New York in support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign the night before the election. In her speech at the Billboard event, Madonna seemed to make a tacit reference to the election\u2019s outcome. \u201cWomen have been so oppressed for so long, they believe what men have to say about them,\u201d she said, according to Billboard. \u201cThey believe they have to back a man to get the job done. \u201d In an interview before the event, she was more direct: \u201cHillary Clinton lost the election, and it\u2019s really important to make a stand and speak my mind about the importance of women and women empowering themselves,\u201d she said. On Friday, in her speech, Madonna spoke about the rules of \u201cthe game\u201d  \u2014   the established ideas that she said women are pushed to abide by. \u201cYou are allowed to be pretty and cute and sexy, but don\u2019t act too smart. Don\u2019t have an opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are allowed to be objectified by men and dress like a slut, but don\u2019t own your sluttiness and do not  \u2014   do not, I repeat  \u2014   share your own sexual fantasies with the world. \u201d Another unspoken rule for women, she said, even more important than satisfying the expectations of the men in their lives, was to \u201cbe what women feel comfortable with you being around other men. \u201d Toward the end of her speech, she mentioned other groundbreaking musicians, including Prince and David Bowie, both of whom died this year. \u201cBut I\u2019m still standing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m one of the lucky ones. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561844.1747367}
