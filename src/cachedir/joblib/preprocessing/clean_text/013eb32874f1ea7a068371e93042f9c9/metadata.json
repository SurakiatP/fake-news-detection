Trump spoke by telephone with Taiwan\u2019s president on Friday, a striking break with nearly four decades of diplomatic practice that could precipitate a major rift with China even before Mr. Trump takes office. Mr. Trump\u2019s office said he had spoken with the Taiwanese president, Tsai   \u201cwho offered her congratulations. \u201d He is believed to be the first president or   who has spoken to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979, when the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People\u2019s Republic of China. In the statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s office said the two leaders had noted \u201cthe close economic, political, and security ties\u201d between Taiwan and the United States. Mr. Trump, it said, \u201calso congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s motives in taking the call, which lasted more than 10 minutes, were not clear. In a Twitter message late Friday, he said Ms. Tsai \u201cCALLED ME. \u201d But diplomats with ties to Taiwan said it was highly unlikely that the Taiwanese leader would have made the call without arranging it in advance. Ms. Tsai\u2019s office  confirmed that it had taken place, saying the two had discussed promoting economic development and \u201cstrengthening defense. \u201d Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency hailed the call as \u201chistoric. \u201d On Saturday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in his government\u2019s first official reaction, played down the call. Stressing the good relationship between the United States and China, he said, \u201cI also believe this will not change the One China policy upheld by the American government for many years. \u201d Mr. Wang, speaking to reporters in Beijing, characterized the call as initiated by the Taiwanese government. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a petty action by the Taiwan side. \u201d The   has shown little heed for the nuances of international diplomacy, holding a series of unscripted phone calls to foreign leaders that have roiled sensitive relationships with Britain, India and Pakistan. On Thursday, the White House urged Mr. Trump to use experts from the State Department to prepare him for these exchanges. The White House was not told about Mr. Trump\u2019s call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter. The   fallout from the   conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a   arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing. Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has adamantly opposed the attempts of any country to carry on official relations with it. On Nov. 14, Mr. Trump spoke with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, and a statement from the transition team said the two men had a \u201cclear sense of mutual respect. \u201d Initial reaction from China about Friday\u2019s telephone call was surprise verging on disbelief. \u201cThis is a big event, the first challenge the   has made to China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThis must be bad news for the Chinese leadership. \u201d Official   media have portrayed Mr. Trump in a positive light, casting him as a businessman China could get along with. He was favored among Chinese commentators during the election over Hillary Clinton, who was perceived as being too hard on China. Mr. Trump\u2019s exchange touched \u201cthe most sensitive spot\u201d for China\u2019s foreign policy, Mr. Shi said. The government, he said, would most likely interpret it as encouraging Ms. Tsai, the leader of the party that favors independence from the mainland, to continue to resist pressure from Beijing. Among diplomats in the United States, there was similar shock. \u201cThis is a change of historic proportions,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior director of Asian affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cThe real question is, what are the Chinese going to do?\u201d In a second Twitter message about the call Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \u201cInteresting how the U. S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u201d Ties between the United States and Taiwan are currently managed through   institutions. The American Institute in Taiwan issues visas and provides other basic consular services, and Taiwan has an equivalent institution with offices in several cities in the United States. These arrangements are the outgrowth of the One China policy that has governed relations between the United States and China since President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s historic meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of China, abrogating its ties with Taipei a year later. The call also raised questions of conflicts of interest. Newspapers in Taiwan reported last month that a Trump Organization representative had visited the country, expressing interest in perhaps developing a hotel project adjacent to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which is undergoing a major expansion. The mayor of Taoyuan, Cheng   was quoted as confirming that visit. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, Amanda Miller, said that the company had \u201cno plans for expansion into Taiwan,\u201d and that there had been no \u201cauthorized visits\u201d to the country to push a Trump development project. But Ms. Miller did not dispute that   Donoghue, a sales manager overseeing Asia for Trump Hotels, had visited Taiwan in October, a trip that Ms. Donoghue recorded on her Facebook page. Ms. Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the Taiwanese president came just as President Obama delivered a more subtle, but also aggressive, rebuff of China: He blocked, by executive order, an effort by Chinese investors to buy a semiconductor production firm called Aixtron. Mr. Obama took the action on national security grounds, after an intelligence review concluded that the technology could be used for \u201cmilitary applications\u201d and help provide an \u201coverall technical body of knowledge and experience\u201d to the Chinese. The decision is likely to accelerate tension with Beijing, as Chinese authorities make it extraordinarily difficult for American technology companies, including Google and Facebook, to gain access to the Chinese market, and Washington seeks to slow China\u2019s acquisition of critical technology. Mr. Trump has made little effort to avoid antagonizing China. He has characterized climate change as a \u201cChinese hoax,\u201d designed to undermine the American economy. He has said China\u2019s manipulation of its currency deepened a trade deficit with the United States. And he has threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, a proposal that critics said would set off a trade war. By happenstance, just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai, Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who designed the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, was in Beijing meeting with Mr. Xi. It was unclear if Mr. Kissinger, 93, was carrying any message from Mr. Trump, with whom he met again recently in his role as the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy sage. \u201cThe presidential election has taken place in the United States and we are now in the key moment. We, on the Chinese side, are watching the situation very closely. Now it is in the transition period,\u201d Mr. Xi told Mr. Kissinger in front of reporters. A small,   faction of Republicans has periodically urged a more confrontational approach to Beijing, and many of President George W. Bush\u2019s advisers were pressing such an approach in the first months of his presidency in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11 defused that move, and Iraq became the No. 1 enemy. After that, Mr. Bush needed China  \u2014   for North Korea diplomacy, counterterrorism and as an economic partner  \u2014   and any movement toward confrontation was quashed. For his part, Mr. Trump has shown little concern about ruffling feathers in his exchanges with leaders. He also spoke on Friday with the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who has called Mr. Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and been accused of ordering the extrajudicial killings of thousands of suspected drug dealers. On Saturday, Mr. Duterte said that Mr. Trump had wished him well in his antidrug campaign, though his account could not immediately be verified. This week, Mr. Trump appeared to accept an invitation from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit Pakistan, a country that Mr. Obama has steered clear of, largely over tensions between Washington and Islamabad over counterterrorism policy and nuclear proliferation. Lawmakers expressed alarm at the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling approach. \u201cWhat has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy   any plan. That\u2019s how wars start,\u201d Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s probably time we get a Secretary of State nominee on board. Preferably w experience. Like, really really soon. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628496.7460003}
