She told police her home had been graffitied with the letters, \u201cBLM.\u201d \\n\u201cSomething wasn\u2019t quite right,\u201d Millbury Police Chief Donald Desorcy said . \u201cI think that was pretty obvious and as a result of that investigation, the officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had.\u201d This is white supremacist Maria Daly, the wife of Boston cop Daniel Daly.She staged a fake robbery of her home, and tried to blame #BLM pic.twitter.com/vrdqg1cM6r \\n\u2014 Tariq Nasheed (@tariqnasheed) October 29, 2016 \\nCBS Boston reports Daly took to social media soon after the fabricated robbery, saying, \u201cWe woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping, but to see this hatred for no reason.\u201d \\n\u201cIf you would of [sic] asked me yesterday about this blue lives and black lives matter issue my response would of [sic] been very possitive [sic],\u201d the now private Facebook account continues. \u201cToday on the other hand I have so much anger and hate that I don\u2019t like myself. This is what we have to deal with these days and it makes me sick that this is what was on the side of my house.\u201d \\nDespite Daly\u2019s best efforts, the police were able to tell no robbery took place. @crystalhaynes The poor lady just needs some help.. \\n\u2014 Mark Scanlon (@markscanlon50) October 28, 2016 \\n\u201cBasically we came to the conclusion that it was all fabricated,\u201d said Desorcy. \u201cThere was no intruder, there was no burglary.\u201d \\nPolice concluded Daly fabricated the robbery due to financial difficulty. Daly confessed and returned the items she claimed were missing, which amounted to $10,000 in jewelry. \\nDesorcy told reporters, \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to sweep this under the rug,\u201d and that he felt sorry for the family. \\nDaly\u2019s husband Dan is not suspected of being involved in his wife\u2019s crime.
