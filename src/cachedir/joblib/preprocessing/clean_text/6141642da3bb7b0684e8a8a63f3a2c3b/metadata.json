[\u201cAwful to see my friend Ann Coulter forced to cancel her speech,\u201d wrote Milo on his official Facebook page. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Young America\u2019s Foundation would capitulate so close to victory. Ann can hardly be expected to show up without insurance, security or a venue, so I completely understand why she had to cancel. She is Ann Coulter, after all. \u201d  \u201cMy proposed Free Speech Week will proceed as planned later this year,\u201d he continued, before adding, \u201cI WILL BRING AN ARMY IF I HAVE TO. \u201d \u201cWe will ensure that Ann and others can speak and we will publicly, ritually humiliate UC Berkeley for its failure to meet its legal obligations until conservative speakers no longer fear violent mobs just for exercising their First Amendment rights,\u201d Milo concluded. \u201cBerkeley is going to become the free speech capital of the United States once again. I will make sure of it. \u201d Like Coulter, Milo\u2019s event at UC Berkeley earlier this year was derailed after a mob of violent   activists set fires, smashed windows, and assaulted attendees who were supposed to see him speak. Young America\u2019s Foundation pulled out of the Ann Coulter event on Tuesday, blaming the college\u2019s hostile environment towards conservatives. However, YAF and the UC Berkeley College Republicans are still in the process of suing the college, claiming that administrators put several limiting restrictions on the event in an effort to get it cancelled. The groups and their attorney Harmeet Dhillon referenced previous events featuring conservative speakers at the college which also faced similar scrutiny and restrictions, including Milo\u2019s as well as conservative commentator David Horowitz. During a press conference about the lawsuit on Monday, Dhillon branded UC Berkeley\u2019s policies on \u201cacceptable speech\u201d as \u201cinfinitely malleable\u201d before criticizing the Mayor of Berkeley, Jesse Arreguin, for appearing to sympathize with, be friendly to, and act softly on the   rioters who shut down Yiannopoulos\u2019 event earlier this year. \u201cIf the Mayor of Berkeley cannot maintain control of his city, the Governor should call the National Guard, because that\u2019s a serious public health issue,\u201d Dhillon proclaimed.
