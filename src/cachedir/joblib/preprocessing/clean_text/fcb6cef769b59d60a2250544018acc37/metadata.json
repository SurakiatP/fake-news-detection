The pilot, which airs on NBC on Tuesday, keeps the emotional gas pedal floored from the opening scene, scored to Sufjan Stevens\u2019s melancholy \u201cDeath With Dignity,\u201d to the end, set to Labi Siffre\u2019s anthemic \u201cWatch Me. \u201d And all the way in between, this   and shameless dramedy is a   theater of the verklempt. It presents, in one hour, birth, death, reunion, career crisis,        reconciliations. It wants to make you weep and it does not play fair. It will leave no button on your psychic control panel unmashed. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d belongs to a genre that used to be more common on   TV:   dramas, those    series about ordinary people with ordinary problems, like \u201cthirtysomething,\u201d \u201cOnce and Again\u201d and \u201cFriday Night Lights. \u201d \u201cParenthood,\u201d the most obvious comparison to \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d turned in its keys to the waterworks in 2015. Lately, family and love  \u2014   those tiny, enormous matters  \u2014   have been relegated to cable and streaming   like \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cCasual\u201d and \u201cTogetherness,\u201d leaving broadcast TV the histrionics of superheroes, lawyers and political fixers. \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d created by Dan Fogelman, does have a gimmick. It\u2019s built around four characters who share the same birthday. The first is Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) a nervous expectant dad whose wife, Rebecca (Mandy Moore) is on the verge of having triplets. The second is Kevin (Justin Hartley) a hunky actor who\u2019s landed a   role in a terrible sitcom that requires him to spend much of his time shirtless. Next is his sister, Kate (Chrissy Metz) who is fighting a serious weight problem with the help of a support group, in which she meets the cheerfully acerbic Toby (Chris Sullivan). And finally there\u2019s Randall (Sterling K. Brown) who has just tracked down the biological father who left him, as an infant, at a fire station, \u201cprobably because he couldn\u2019t think of something more clich\u00e9. \u201d As that line suggests, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is aware when it dips into the commonplace, but it\u2019s not above doing so when that tactic is effective. It deploys the pathetic fallacy promiscuously, dipping heartwarming scenes in honeyed light, and turning on the rain spigot during a fraught confrontation. Yet the first hour works its way efficiently through an   box of tissues with cleverly turned dialogue and   performances. Mr. Brown displays the tightly wound, complicated passion that just won him an Emmy for \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story. \u201d Gerald McRaney also gives a striking guest turn as a wry, wise obstetrician (which sounds hackneyed even as I type it, yet the character somehow works). The series\u2019s forebears worked best because of the dynamics among a large ensemble. The \u201cThis Is Us\u201d pilot, which is the only episode screened for critics, keeps the central characters mostly separate (though an elegant ending twist suggests that that will change, going ahead). Some of the story lines are weak. It\u2019s refreshing to see a broadcast series spotlight an overweight character who\u2019s not a sitcom dad with a hot wife, but Kate is characterized almost wholly in terms of her weight. The acting subplot, meanwhile, relies on   about vapid network TV that comes across as  . For all that, the opening episode delivers a gorgeous climax I ended it feeling happily, mistily manipulated, willing to let \u201cThis Is Us\u201d pull my strings for at least another episode. Maybe it\u2019s my    concussion talking. Maybe I just want there to be more room on network TV for this kind of   drama. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is not a great pilot it could easily become mired in its own sap. But it has enough engaging moments for me to want to see if the series can master the difference between a good cry and an easy one.'"}, "time": 1742561973.046481}
