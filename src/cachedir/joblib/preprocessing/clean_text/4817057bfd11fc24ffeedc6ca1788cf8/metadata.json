A crumbling, melancholy monument to China\u2019s imperial grandeur, so imposing that it inspired the stubborn myth that it is visible from the moon. One part of the Great Wall is even more visible now, but for very wrong reasons. Chinese preservationists, internet users and media commentators have been incensed this week after pictures showed that officials repaired part of the Great Wall in northeast China by slapping a white substance on top of the crumbling, weathered stones. A once unkempt, haunting    stretch of the wall now looks like a cement skateboarding lane dumped in the wilderness. The aesthetic impact was \u201cnot ideal,\u201d the head of the provincial cultural relics bureau, Ding Hui, conceded, according to The Beijing News. \u201cThe repairs really don\u2019t look good,\u201d he said. Online, in newspapers and in interviews, many people, including experts on preserving the Great Wall, went much further in condemning the repairs to the section, in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province. \u201cThis was vandalism done in the name of preservation,\u201d Liu Fusheng, a park officer from the county who first raised an outcry about the work, said in a telephone interview. \u201cEven the little kids here know that this repair of the Great Wall was botched. \u201d Newspapers also lamented. The Beijing News, widely read in the capital, put the ruination of the ruins on its front page. \u201cWhere is there still any feel of that most beautiful wild Great Wall?\u201d asked a commentary on a news website in central China. \u201cIt\u2019s just a road winding through the hills. \u201d The repairs to the 1.  section of the wall were undertaken two years ago but came to wide attention only on Wednesday, after a local newspaper, The Huashang Morning News, described what had been done in the name of preservation. Mr. Liu, who helped draw notice to the work, said officials commissioned the repairs because they were worried the wall would collapse entirely from erosion and tourists walking on top. But in their haste, they wiped out the gnarled features that people had come to treasure, including the crenelations and towers, Mr. Liu said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a head that\u2019s lost its nose and ears,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who has spent 15 years studying that section of the wall. Once the towers there had stone carvings, but they had fallen to the ground before the repairs, he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t restore the carvings back to where they belonged and just tossed them aside,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201cThey used new bricks to fill in the original spots, and that saved a lot of expense. \u201d Construction of that section of the wall started in 1381, part of the sprawling web of fortifications and protections that Ming dynasty emperors built to ward off and police marauding nomads from the steppes. But now city dwellers who come to marvel at the isolated section of the wall in Suizhong County leave wondering why they bothered to travel so far to see a strip of cement, one villager living nearby told The Huashang Morning News. Officials have sworn that they did not use cement but rather a mix of lime and sand. Mr. Liu said they used both. In an interview, Dong Yaohui, a vice chairman of the China Great Wall Society and an expert on preserving the wall, called the attempt an \u201cextremely rudimentary mistake. \u201d \u201cOur principle in repairing the Great Wall is to minimize interference,\u201d Mr. Dong said. \u201cIt\u2019s not important whether you used lime or cement. Repairing it like this has wiped out all the culture and history. \u201d He said the society, a   organization, had been investigating damage along the entire Great Wall in the hope of spurring more action and stronger rules to preserve it. \u201cThere\u2019s serious damage on many parts of the Great Wall,\u201d he said. Cultural preservation officials responsible for that part of the wall defended their efforts. They said that the section was in danger of falling down, that the higher authorities approved their plans and that, like emergency dental work, beauty was not their priority. But since the uproar, the officials have conceded that the results were less than satisfactory. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage declared that it was time  \u2014   two years after the repairs were done  \u2014   to get to the bottom of what had gone wrong. \u201cThere will be no indulgence or conniving,\u201d the administration said on its website. \u201cPreserving the Great Wall is a sacred and unshirkable duty of all cultural relics workers. \u201d One villager who worked on the repairs two years ago saw a silver lining to the topping. \u201cNow the top of the Great Wall has become a smooth pavement,\u201d the villager, Zhang Yuwu, told The Huashang Morning News. \u201cExcept when it rains or snows, it\u2019s a lot easier to walk on than before. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561896.3949041}
