The vote reverses a Labor Department rule that allows local governments to automatically enroll   workers in retirement plans unless they opt out. The   vote was a startling reversal for many Republicans, who have argued for much of their careers that overzealous federal regulators were trampling the rights of state and local governments. In this case, congressional Republicans protested that President Barack Obama\u2019s rules gave local regulators too much leeway. Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, a sponsor of the legislation, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that the Obama administration\u2019s rule was denying workers federal consumer protections. The White House has indicated that President Trump will sign the measure into law. New York City, Philadelphia and Seattle all have considered retirement plans taking advantage of the Labor Department rule  \u2014   what they call a \u201csafe harbor\u201d  \u2014   that Republicans seek to reverse. Five states have also passed legislation permitted by a similar Labor Department regulation, which gives the states the power to appoint private money managers who would oversee portable savings accounts for workers. The Senate is expected to soon take up a separate House resolution rolling back that state rule. The consequences of the Senate\u2019s votes could be significant. The Labor Department rules were designed to give around 13 million people in the five states access to retirement accounts, out of 55 million nationwide who lack   retirement programs. Among those affected most by the measure passed on Thursday will be small business owners and employees who have blanched at the cost of conventional 401( k) plans or pensions. In a joint statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, the City Council president, the city\u2019s public advocate and a council member said that they were \u201cdeeply disappointed that Congress has voted to overturn the Department of Labor rule providing a safe harbor for us to create retirement savings plans for private sector employees. \u201d \u201cThis vote does little more than block them  \u2014   the majority of whom are women and people of color  \u2014   from securing their futures,\u201d the statement said. Thursday\u2019s vote was only the latest regulation that Republicans have rolled back this year using the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which had hardly been used in the two decades before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Seven rollbacks have been signed into law by President Trump, with several others awaiting his signature. But in this case, Republicans were replacing local regulatory authority with federal control  \u2014   taking up a cause of investment banks that fear competition from state and local governments. The Obama Labor Department\u2019s rule actually gave states more autonomy in reaching contracts with   financial managers to handle the savings accounts. State governments could be administrative conduits, keeping records while passing on funding to private consultants, who would manage the money in place of state treasurers. \u201cToo many states have made questionable decisions when it comes to managing retirement funding,\u201d said Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee. Republicans maintained that   retirement savings accounts free of federal consumer protection rules had an unfair advantage over plans from   providers. Under the law that governs pensions, employers must show that they are managing their retirement programs on behalf of their workers, not the investment funds  \u2014   a provision some Republicans argued that state and city plans could skirt. In fact, many states that have passed legislation to take advantage of the Labor Department regulation have included a similar \u201cfiduciary responsibility\u201d requirement in their   programs. And Congress has acted to reverse an Obama administration regulation that demanded that retirement investment advisers make their clients\u2019 interests paramount. Senators in both parties lobbed comments on the issue on the Senate floor Wednesday. Critical of what he called the \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d that the rules might give cities and states over   retirement offerings, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said the Labor Department statutes spelled \u201cmore government at the expense of the private sector. \u201d \u201cThese retirement savings regulations are a classic case of the whole being worse than the sum of its parts,\u201d he said. Both of Oregon\u2019s senators, who are Democrats, spoke on behalf of the Labor Department rules, which would protect their state\u2019s \u201cOregonSaves\u201d retirement accounts, scheduled to open in July. \u201cI hear all the time in here about states\u2019 rights. I hear all the time about how states are the place for experimentation to see what works and what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said. \u201cThis Congressional Review Act proposal says the opposite. It says, \u2018Let\u2019s stomp out experiments by our municipalities. \u2019\u201d Some liberals see the fight over the House bills as a proxy battle that Republicans were eager to wage on behalf of the financial services industry. \u201cThey\u2019re ignoring the fact that the idea of the  . R. A. came out of the Heritage Foundation and Brookings,\u201d said Joshua Gotbaum, chairman of the board responsible for setting up Maryland\u2019s version of the plan, referring to a conservative research institution and the more liberal Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s supported by the Republican state treasurer of Utah and Indiana  \u2014   real    Republican states. \u201d \u201cThis is fundamentally a Republican idea,\u201d Mr. Gotbaum added. David John, a policy adviser at AARP and the deputy director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Retirement Security Project, wrote papers defending the  . R. A. concept while he was at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cThis is a problem that could be just as easily dealt with at the federal level. But it\u2019s not being dealt with. Rather than doing nothing, states are stepping in and recognizing that it\u2019s in their financial interests to act and build these systems,\u201d Mr. John said. \u201cWith the   plans, we\u2019re seeing for the first time hundreds of thousands of people who have access to these from the day they go to work to the day they retire,\u201d he added. Mr. Gotbaum expressed confidence in states\u2019 ability to defend their prerogatives. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lawsuit, and the lawsuit is going to decide this,\u201d he said of the next step for them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go ahead no matter what. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561710.8579495}
