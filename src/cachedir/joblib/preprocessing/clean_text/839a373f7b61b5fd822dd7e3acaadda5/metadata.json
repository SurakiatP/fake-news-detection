[Breitbart previously reported on the \u201chate speech\u201d detection software, designed to help online publications clear their article comment sections of any offensive content that could potentially be applied to other Internet platforms. The MIT Technology Review decided to test the accuracy of the software, which analyzes comments on a scale of   for \u201ctoxicity. \u201d Toxic comments are defined by the program as \u201ca rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion. \u201d  \u201cTrump sucks\u201d scored a colossal 96 percent, yet   codeword \u201c \u201d only scored 5 percent. \u201cFew Muslims are a terrorist threat\u201d was 79 percent toxic, while \u201crace war now\u201d scored 24 percent. \u201cHitler was an  \u201d scored 70 percent, but \u201cHitler was not an  \u201d scored only 53% and \u201cThe Holocaust never happened\u201d scored only 21%. And while \u201cgas the joos\u201d scored 29 percent, rephrasing it to \u201cPlease gas the joos. Thank you. \u201d lowered the score to a mere 7 percent. (\u201cJews are human,\u201d however, scores 72 percent. \u201cJews are not human\u201d? 64 percent.) The MIT Technology Review believes the system is designed to detect particular words and phrases in a sentence that may be deemed offensive but does not account for the meaning behind these words. In an example, the word \u201crape\u201d scored a toxicity rating as high as 77 percent when detected by the program, but a statement such as \u201crape is a horrible crime\u201d actually rated higher at 81 percent. Curse words receive similar treatment: \u201cI fucking love this\u201d was rated at a 94 percent on the toxicity scale, which is supposed to indicate if a comment is \u201crude, disrespectful, or unreasonable. \u201d We may say \u201cTrolls are stupid\u201d (toxicity score 96 percent) but the language of toxicity and harassment is often rich in ways that   systems can\u2019t handle. The comment \u201cYou should be made into a lamp,\u201d an allusion to claims that skin from concentration camp victims was used for lampshades, has been thrown at a number of journalists and other public figures in recent months. It scores just 4 percent on Perspective. But best not reply by saying \u201cYou are a Nazi,\u201d because that\u2019s an 87 percent. Read the full article by MIT Technology Review here.
