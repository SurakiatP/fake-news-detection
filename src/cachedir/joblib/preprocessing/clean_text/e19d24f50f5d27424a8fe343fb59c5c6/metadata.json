The DNC\u2019s lawyers asked a New Jersey federal judge to hold the Republican Party in contempt for violating a 35-year old consent decree to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and to issue an injunction to enforce the terms of the agreement, which will force Republicans to cease their efforts to suppress votes in minority communities during this year\u2019s general election. The DNC lawyers cited Donald Trump\u2019s frequent statements to supporters, as well as one of vice presidential nominee Mike Pence\u2019s speeches where he admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating \u201cballot integrity\u201d initiatives, which are explicitly banned under the agreement. \\nTrump\u2019s overt actions to call his supporters to watch polls in \u201ccertain areas\u201d are a classic attempt to concoct an illegal \u201cballot security program,\u201d which is why we exclusively predicted this lawsuit could happen three weeks ago. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) weighed in with an op-ed published in the Washington Post urging the party to take action. This week, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump also took it upon themselves to lodge a new FBI complaint , over Trump\u2019s voter suppression campaign which violates the same Voting Rights Act provisions covered by this recent DNC action which could land Republicans involved in the illegal campaigning \u2013 like Roger Stone \u2013 in criminal court. However, the Democratic Party\u2019s action is based on a legal decision, so it\u2019s going to be expedited in court, and is likely to yield a rapid order from the federal judge against the Republican party and Trump. \\nHere\u2019s a summary of what the DNC\u2019s lawyers filed in federal court today: (see below for complete document ) \\nDefendant Republican National Committee (\u201cRNC\u201d) has violated the Final Consent Decree\u2026 by supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be \u201crigged\u201d based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in \u201ccertain areas\u201d or \u201ccertain sections\u201d of key states. \\nUnsurprisingly, those \u201ccertain areas\u201d are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside. Notwithstanding that no evidence of such fraud actually exists, Trump has encouraged his supporters to do whatever it takes to stop it\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get everybody to go out and watch . . . and when [I] say \u2018watch,\u2019 you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d\u2014and has been actively organizing \u201celection observers\u201d to monitor polling stations in \u201ccertain areas.\u201d Trump has even encouraged his \u201cwatchers\u201d to act like vigilante law enforcement officers. \\nAlthough certain RNC officials have attempted to distance themselves from some of the Trump campaign\u2019s more recent statements, there is now ample evidence that Trump has enjoyed the direct and tacit support of the RNC in its \u201cballot security\u201d endeavors, including the RNC\u2019s collaboration on efforts to prevent this supposed \u201crigging\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d \\nIn a rally in Denver, Colorado, on August 3, 2016, Trump\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating with the Trump campaign on \u201cballot integrity\u201d initiatives, stating that \u201cthe Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very very closely with state governments and secretaries of states all over the country to ensure ballot integrity.\u201d \\nThe RNC\u2019s support of Trump\u2019s efforts to recruit \u201cwatchers\u201d who are intended to intimidate voters at their polling places violates this Court\u2019s Consent Decree as modified in 2009, which explicitly forbid the RNC from engaging in so-called \u201cballot security\u201d measures directly, indirectly, or through its agents or employees. The RNC\u2019s conduct also violates the Consent Decree under well settled law prohibiting defendants from evading court orders by acting in concert with third parties. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s master of dirty tricks, Roger Stone is specifically named in the complaint because is the very same political operative, whose minority voter intimidation tactics landed the Republican party in hot water for 35 years in the first place for rigging a close New Jersey gubernatorial election! (which was won by the GOP candidate) \\nRoger Stone, one of Trump\u2019s top advisors, has amplified Trump\u2019s message. Stone was a key advisor to the 1981 campaign of former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, in which a \u201cballot security\u201d force wearing black armbands engaged in widespread voter intimidation in Newark, Camden, Paterson and other minority neighborhoods in the State, leading to this very action and the Consent Decree that Stone is helping to violate today. \\nStone is currently running a website called \u201cStopTheSteal.org\u201d that is actively signing up Trump supporters to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fight \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d #StopTheSteal is a popular hashtag among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stone\u2019s group maintains an active Facebook presence. On October 23, 2016, Stone sent out a (now deleted) message via his Twitter feed deliberately designed to mislead Democratic voters by representing\u2014using Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s likeness and logo\u2014that supporters can \u201cVOTE the NEW way on Tues. Nov 8th\u201d by texting \u201cHILLARY to 8888,\u201d after which voters would apparently \u201creceive official confirmation. \\nEven worse, Roger Stone is trying to hide his voter suppression plan behind the facade of exit polling. DNC lawyers slammed the lunatic Republican political operative for his deception, and the court could order him to jail for contempt of court for his behavior. \\nStone is also using social media to promote the common plan that Trump supporters\u2014and particularly those who have agreed to engage in vigilante \u201cballot security\u201d efforts\u2014wear red shirts on Election Day. Further Stone is actively recruiting Trump supporters for \u201cexit polling,\u201d specifically targeting nine Democratic-leaning cities with large minority populations. This \u201cexit polling\u201d serves no legitimate purpose: Stone does not run a polling operation. Rather, the plain purpose of this plan is to intimidate minority voters. \\nIf Donald Trump does not cease his open calls for voter intimidation, the DNC\u2019s legal action could land him in contempt of court \u2013 and facing a jail term. \\nThe RNC is working in active concert with Trump, the Trump campaign, and [Roger] Stone to intimidate and harass minority voters in violation of this Court\u2019s Consent Decree. The Court should use its inherent contempt powers to remedy those violations , and enforce future compliance with the Consent Decree, with sanctions. \\nUpon a finding that the RNC has violated the Consent Decree, this Court should issue an order extending the Consent Decree for another eight years, according to the terms of the Decree. \\nRepublicans have spent a massive amount of time and money litigating to escape this Consent Decree just seven years ago, and obtained a new concession to limit it\u2019s term from infinite \u2013 which they agreed to in the 1980s \u2013 down to an eight year term which would\u2019ve expired next December. Now that the DNC has taken Trump and the Republican Party back to court, it\u2019s very likely that the terms of the decree will be extended for another eight years through 2025, which will take it through the next two Presidential election cycles. \\nDonald Trump has wasted the entire last month complaining about a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraging vigilante poll watchers to visit minority neighborhoods. Now, a federal judge will have to step in to keep his campaign from breaking election laws across the country, and the Republican party will pay the price for his ignorance of election law for years to come. \\n\u201cThe notion of widespread voter fraud in modern American politics is itself a fraud,\u201d said the DNC, \u201cEvery attempt to verify the presence of voter fraud has proven fruitless.\u201d \\nRead the full complaint here:'"}, "time": 1742563594.2857442}
