[On Monday, February 13, the Entertainment Software Association will open limited ticket sales to what is arguably the most important trade show in the gaming industry. E3 will welcome fifteen thousand fans to join developers, publicists, and members of the media in June. The first 1, 000 to purchase their tickets will gain access for $150. The remainder will need to pay $250 to gain entrance to the ESA\u2019s chaotic digital wonderland.  While E3 attendance has never been officially public, prior to 2007 the credentials needed for entry were relatively broad. 2007\u2019s   restructuring attempted to curtail the growing crowd but culled much of the event\u2019s excitement along with the vast majority of its attendees. This year\u2019s expo looks to capture the   enthusiasm of eager consumers while taking reasonable precautions not to flood the show floor to the point of obstruction. ESA Senior VP of Communications Rich Taylor called it \u201ca strategic decision\u201d for \u201ca changing industry,\u201d made possible \u201cthanks to our members and their vision and leadership. \u201d According to Taylor, they\u2019ve been listening: The feedback we heard was clear \u2014  they wanted to play the games inside the convention center. In addition, exhibitors inside the convention center wanted to have access to the fans. So this year we\u2019re bringing the two together. Is this a step in the right direction for the world\u2019s most famous industry event? Will it bring back some of the major publishers that have decided to host their own separate shows in the recent past? And, most importantly, will I see you at this year\u2019s E3?
