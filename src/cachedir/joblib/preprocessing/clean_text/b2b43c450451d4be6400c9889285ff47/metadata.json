Some readers were concerned that The Times did an inadequate job estimating how many people showed up when it described the number as more than a million worldwide. Estimating crowd sizes has long been a fraught topic. Large gatherings of people can be difficult to estimate in precise terms  \u2014   and no one will be happy with the outcome. There\u2019s even a group of scientists who specialize in \u201ccrowd estimates,\u201d as a Times piece comparing the sizes of the Washington women\u2019s march to Trump\u2019s inauguration noted. The Times used estimates compiled by the police, as well as figures from mayoral, public safety and homeland security offices. For greater accuracy in estimating the Washington numbers, editors asked Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still, crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain, to analyze aerial photographs and video. The Times incorporated all this material to reach its final estimate of \u201cmore than one million. \u201d Since march organizers have a vested interest in a high turnout, The Times only included their estimates parenthetically, through a link to a website reporting a total turnout of nearly five million: \u201c(March organizers offered a worldwide tally for the 673 \u2018sister\u2019 marches, but when asked, could not provide an explanation of how the tally had been calculated. )\u201d An editor who helped anchor the coverage in New York said: The marches here in the States drew foreign protesters, too, but some were denied entry on questionable grounds. That story did not appear in The Times\u2019s pages, and several readers noticed. The public editor\u2019s take: Not a huge story, but from what I\u2019ve read on other news sites, it seemed like a compelling one. Unfortunately, Times readers missed out.  Readers also noticed a story that is a repeated issue for The Times and one on which the public editor has written about previously. The public editor\u2019s take: I\u2019m with Schafran on this one, for the reasons she states. Then there were Trump\u2019s views on women during the presidential campaign, which came up again last weekend during the marches, such as his remarks about Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton, and that infamous recording in which he brags about groping women. The issue? That The Times did not   say that Trump\u2019s statements were misogynistic. \u201cMany participants,\u201d The Times wrote, \u201cbelieved Mr. Trump expressed misogynistic views during the presidential campaign. \u201d The public editor\u2019s take: Hmmm. I\u2019m generally reluctant to think that a journalist\u2019s work is achieved through labels, but it\u2019s hard to look at many of Trump\u2019s statements and not find them misogynistic. It depends on which statement we\u2019re referring to, but to say \u201csome\u201d of his statements about women are misogynistic is unequivocal. The issue of Trump and labels came up in a different context this week when The Times called one of his baseless claims a lie in a   headline: \u201cTrump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers. \u201d The majority of readers who wrote in wrote to applaud The Times for doing so. Some other readers, however, were warier, arguing that The Times would never be able to find its way inside Trump\u2019s mind. We went to the associate managing editor for standards, Phil Corbett, for his take on the issue. The public editor\u2019s take: These parameters make sense to me. My vote is for using the word \u201clie\u201d in a highly limited way, under specific circumstances and with   approval, as I\u2019ve written before. As some of our readers point out, the intent of the person called out for lying matters. It can\u2019t be just the routine stuff of the spin room. Shortly after the election, The Times ran an   piece by Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, in which he wrote, \u201cWhen you call us the Rust Belt, you demean our work and diminish who we are. \u201d A reader wrote in then to applaud. This week, Derck wrote in again when The Times ran a story on the front page with the headline: \u201cIn a Rust Belt Town, the Women\u2019s March Draws Shrugs and Cheers From Afar. \u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to give this up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know how much work is left to do but are you still going to be calling us Rust Belt when we may be the leader in alternative energy or something else in 2090?\u201d We shared Derck\u2019s letters with the national editor, Marc Lacey, who said: The public editor\u2019s take: Lacey\u2019s answer is spot on. Last Monday, the public editor criticized a story on dads taking care of their kids while the moms marched against Trump, arguing that it should have never run. The column drew some wry responses from fathers, which we decided to highlight here. Here\u2019s to dads.'"}, "time": 1742628553.8468342}
