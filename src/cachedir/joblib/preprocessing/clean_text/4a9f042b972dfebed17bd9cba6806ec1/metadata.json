Marco Rubio ( ) pushed the misleading Democratic Party talking point that the Republican Party platform was changed to \u201cnot provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. \u201d[Here is a transcript of the relevant section of the hearing:   RUBIO: My last question, you were on the foreign policy team and the Republican platform was changed to not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. Were you involved in that decision and do you know how the change was made?  SESSIONS: I was not active in the platform committee and did not participate in that, and I don\u2019t think I had direct involvement. RUBIO: Do you know who did or you have no recollection of a debate about that issue internally in the campaign? SESSIONS: I never watched the debate, if it occurred, on the platform committee. I think it did. So I don\u2019t recall that, Senator. I\u2019d have to think about that. Rubio was alluding to the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign had the Republican Party platform changed on the issue of Ukraine to allegedly aid Russian interests. The charge, which comes mostly from a Washington Post opinion piece, remains so unproven that even the   PolitiFact   fact checker failed to reach a judgement on the issue, allowing \u201cit\u2019s hard to use those news reports as evidence in this  . \u201d The entire issue revolved around one platform committee member, a Ted Cruz supporter, who wanted to use language calling for the U. S. to provide \u201clethal defensive weapons\u201d to the Ukrainian military. Instead the platform eventually called for \u201cappropriate assistance\u201d to Ukraine  \u2014   which leaves open the possibility of providing \u201clethal defensive weapons\u201d  \u2014   and called for \u201cgreater coordination with NATO defense planning. \u201d That was enough for the Washington Post\u2019s Josh Rogin to pen an opinion piece titled \u201cTrump campaign guts GOP\u2019s   stance on Ukraine. \u201d MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow used the tidbit to claim on television that \u201csomething weird\u201d happened regarding \u201cthat Ukraine and Russia thing\u201d on the platform. She claimed the Trump campaign \u201cjumped right up on that and they insisted that that plank only, that one, had to be taken out, that language could not stand. \u201d Writing at the Washington Examiner, media critic Byron York noted: Missing from all the talk is what the Republican platform actually said before it was allegedly \u201cgutted\u201d by Trump. What did the original draft of the platform say about Russia and Ukraine? Was it, in fact, changed? If so, how? As it turns out, a look at the original draft of the platform  \u2014   which has never been released publicly  \u2014   shows that it always had tough language on Russian aggression in Ukraine. And not only did that language stay in the final platform  \u2014   nothing was taken out  \u2014   it was actually strengthened, not weakened, as a result of events at the convention.   \u2026     Not only that, the later, final platform contained a few additional words on Russia and Ukraine that weren\u2019t in the original draft. To the first passage cited above, after \u201cfrom the Baltic to the Caucasus,\u201d the GOP platform committee added this: Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
