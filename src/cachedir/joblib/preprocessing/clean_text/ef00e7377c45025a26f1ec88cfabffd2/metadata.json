Now it has become a   proxy war between Pope Francis and the Vatican traditionalists who oppose him, with the battleground being a Renaissance palace flanked by Jimmy Choo and Herm\u00e8s storefronts on Via dei Condotti, Rome\u2019s most exclusive street. The palace is the headquarters of the Knights of Malta, the medieval Roman Catholic order. For months, an ugly, if quiet, spat over staffing simmered behind the order\u2019s walls before spilling across the Tiber River to the Vatican, setting off a    between the two camps. Francis and his lieutenants sent angry letters. The Knights ignored them, claiming sovereignty. This past week, the dispute finally blew up. Fed up, Francis took the extraordinary steps of demanding the resignation of the order\u2019s leader  \u2014   a decision the Knights officially accepted Saturday  \u2014   and announcing that a papal delegate would step in. Conservatives promptly denounced what they called an illegal annexation and ideological purging by a   pontiff, while liberal observers saw the whole episode as resulting from an act of subterfuge by the pope\u2019s most public critic within the Vatican hierarchy, Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American. A seemingly obscure   squabble had erupted into an unexpected shock to the church with ideological fault lines running to the top of the Vatican. \u201cThe Vatican is a thing built of tradition,\u201d said John Thavis, the author of \u201cThe Vatican Diaries\u201d and a veteran church analyst, \u201cand once those traditional parts start feuding with each other, that is a dangerous sign. \u201d Francis remains one of the world\u2019s most popular figures, but the spat with the Knights is a small indicator of how the political tensions rippling across the globe are alive in the Vatican, too. Only a year ago, Francis\u2019 calls to fight climate change and help migrants seemed to place him in the lead of a progressive global vanguard, in keeping with his push for a more welcoming church. Now, suddenly, he is more politically isolated. The election of President Trump and the rise of   populists in Europe have ushered in an angrier era  \u2014   and emboldened traditionalists inside the Vatican who sense that the   pope could be vulnerable. The Knights of Malta is a bastion of Catholic tradition. Founded in the 11th century by Amalfian merchants to help Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, it later became a military force, defending the faith during the Crusades and eventually holding off the armies of the Ottoman Empire from its fortress in Malta. The group, now with a wealthy and aristocratic membership of elite Catholics who parade in ornate raiment, has more recently specialized in aiding refugees and the poor in more than 100 countries. Until this past week, the order was led by the conservative and elaborately titled His Most Eminent Highness the Prince and Grand Master of the Order of Malta, Matthew Festing of Britain, a former Sotheby\u2019s representative who had taken a monastic oath.   tensions between Mr. Festing and the order\u2019s Grand Chancellor Albrecht von Boeselager of Germany, whose father participated in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, escalated in recent months amid accusations that Mr. Boeselager had knowingly overseen the distribution of condoms as head of the order\u2019s charitable arm. Into this volatile situation stepped Cardinal Burke. In 2014, Francis had demoted Cardinal Burke, a leader of the church\u2019s traditionalist movement, from his position on the Vatican\u2019s Supreme Court. The cardinal\u2019s supporters say Francis did this because of Cardinal Burke\u2019s opposition to the pope\u2019s tentative opening to the possibility of allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion. Cardinal Burke\u2019s exile was at least a cushy one, as the pope named him as the Knights\u2019 patron and liaison to the Vatican, where he would be out of the way. But the   cardinal has made his presence felt. During the summer, as tensions mounted inside the order, Michael Hichborn, the president of the Lepanto Institute, a conservative Catholic organization in Virginia, conducted what he called a \u201cshort investigation\u201d into the order\u2019s international aid arm, which Mr. Boeselager oversaw. Mr. Hichborn said he had discovered that the aid organization was promoting the use of condoms and other contraceptives in Africa and Myanmar, a violation of church rules. \u201cAs I was digging around I thought, \u2018Well, Cardinal Burke ought to know about this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hichborn said in an interview. In November, he sent a summary to Cardinal Burke\u2019s office and said he was told that the cardinal \u201cwould be working on something\u201d regarding the information. A few days later, Cardinal Burke relayed his concerns about Mr. Boeselager to Francis. According to supporters of the cardinal, the pope then instructed him to root out from the order elements of Freemasonry, Vatican shorthand for adherents of a secular moral view. But other people familiar with the events inside the order said the pope had also urged Cardinal Burke and the order\u2019s leadership to settle the dispute through dialogue. Instead, Mr. Festing and Cardinal Burke met Mr. Boeselager on Dec. 6 and requested his resignation, claiming, Mr. Boeselager said in a statement, \u201cthat this was in accordance with the wishes of the Holy See. \u201d Mr. Boeselager denied knowing about the condom distribution program and considered the move a coup and an attempt to tarnish him as a \u201cliberal Catholic. \u201d He argued that once he had discovered the program, he had informed the Vatican and it ended. He also refused to leave, setting off a disciplinary procedure that led to his suspension, and reached out to the Vatican for confirmation that the pope desired his removal. Mr. Boeselager declined to comment for this article. Francis was apparently not pleased about the firing and did not want the dispute to spill into the public, which it did when The Tablet, a Catholic publication in England, broke the news. The pope was already critical of the ornate dress favored by the Knights (red military jacket and gold epaulets) and by Cardinal Burke (a long train of billowing red silk known as a cappa magna). Francis also had a history of   with the Knights during his time as a cardinal in Argentina. So on Dec. 21, Francis wrote directly to Mr. Festing, conveying his decisions on what he called the \u201cpainful circumstances\u201d and making clear that those decisions had \u201cvalue, regardless of anything else to the contrary. \u201d Attached to his letter, signed simply \u201cFrancesco,\u201d were more letters from his    official, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, stating that \u201cHis Holiness asked for dialogue as the way to confront and resolve eventual problems\u201d and that \u201che never spoke, instead, of kicking someone out!\u201d Cardinal Parolin also wrote that the firing \u201cnot be attributed to the will of the pope. \u201d Critically, he noted that the Knights, because of the group\u2019s status as a lay religious order, fell under the pope\u2019s authority, and that the pope had formed a commission to investigate the firing of Mr. Boeselager. But Mr. Festing refused to comply with the papal commission, citing the order\u2019s status as a sovereign entity and raising questions about the integrity of a commission full of Mr. Boeselager\u2019s allies. \u201cI think maybe he was getting bad advice\u201d from Cardinal Burke, said one senior Vatican official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak by the Vatican. (Cardinal Burke and Mr. Festing declined to comment.) Others say Mr. Festing hardly needed to be egged on by Cardinal Burke, and note that despite having no territory, the order is, in fact, sovereign, issuing its own passports and stamps and conducting diplomatic missions. Either way, the Vatican was not thrilled. On Jan. 17, it issued an unusually tough statement supporting the commission and rejecting \u201cany attempt to discredit these members of the group and their work. \u201d The commission ultimately ruled that the pope did have authority over the Knights of Malta. On Tuesday, he exercised it. He called Mr. Festing to the Vatican and asked for him to step down, a move the Vatican announced the next day. The order followed with its own statement, saying Mr. Festing\u2019s resignation would become official once the order\u2019s counselors met on Via dei Condotti to formally accept it. On Saturday, they did just that, immediately reinstating Mr. Boeselager and promising to collaborate with the pope\u2019s delegate. This delighted the pope\u2019s supporters, who said it showed that conniving conservatives would not push him around. But supporters of Mr. Festing were horrified by the Vatican\u2019s de facto takeover. Supporters of Cardinal Burke complained that the pope, for all his talk of fostering debate, was intolerant of opposing views, especially more orthodox ones. \u201cIt sends a message to the rest of the Catholic world that if you try to stand for orthodoxy in the church, you are going to be sent away,\u201d Mr. Hichborn said. \u201cAnd the people pushing for heterodoxy will be put in power. \u201d What was not up for debate was that, in the Vatican, Francis gets his way. At the order\u2019s headquarters, a stately wooden mailbox hangs on the doorman\u2019s wall. The three top slots are reserved for the order\u2019s top three officials. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Boeselager\u2019s name had been erased. Mr. Festing\u2019s would soon be gone. The third slot belonged to the order\u2019s interim leader, Grand Commander Ludwig Hoffmann von Rumerstein. But only, a Vatican statement made clear, \u201cpending the appointment of the papal delegate. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563830.5561068}
