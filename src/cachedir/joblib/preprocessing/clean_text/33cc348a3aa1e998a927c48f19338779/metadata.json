[Last month, an Ossoff campaign worker told volunteer canvassers that if asked about their candidate\u2019s residence, they should say that \u201che lives three blocks from the district. \u201d  (Beginning at the 55 second mark in this YouTube video, the Ossoff campaign worker says, \u201cThis falls into the category of if you don\u2019t know, you can say I don\u2019t know. But, yeah, I mean, he lives three blocks away from the district. \u201d) Brent Scher, an intrepid reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, put that Ossoff campaign claim to the test on Monday, and discovered that the actual distance from Ossoff\u2019s residence to the Sixth Congressional District is three miles rather than three blocks: I set out to walk from Ossoff\u2019s current residence in the northwest corner of Emory University to a section of the sixth district (outlined in green in the below screenshot) that juts down into the fifth district on Buford Highway. It would have been a shorter trip, by the way, to Georgia\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, but that\u2019s not where Ossoff is running. I drew myself my own little map, knowing that my phone would be taxed by my attempt to put the entire quest on Facebook Live, and set out at 10:32 a. m. for the International Cafe, which I determined to be the closest landmark inside the sixth district. I documented the early parts of my journey in the above video, but eventually the treacherous conditions of the long walk were too much for my Motorola Droid Turbo to handle. Shortly after my attempts to Facebook Live crashed and burned, my entire phone followed suit. Scher says he arrived at the International Cafe, \u201cthe closest landmark inside the sixth district,\u201d after walking for about two hours. He took an Uber back to where he had parked his car to begin his walk. \u201cMy Uber from the International Cafe back to my car, which was parked by Ossoff\u2019s place, was 6. 55 miles and took 18 minutes and 45 seconds. My walk was about 3. 2 miles,\u201d Scher wrote. \u201cA lot longer than 3 blocks,\u201d Scher concluded. The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s election between Ossoff and Karen Handel, the Republican candidate, remains too close to call.'"}, "time": 1742628342.2696722}
