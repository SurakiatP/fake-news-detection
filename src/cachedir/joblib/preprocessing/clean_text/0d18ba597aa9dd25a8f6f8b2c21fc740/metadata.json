[\u201cOh, God. Can I just tell you? It\u2019s all been overblown,\u201d director Bill Condon said Friday in an interview with ScreenCrush.  Last week, Condon told Attitude magazine that the character LeFou (Josh Gad) \u201cwants to kiss Gaston (Luke Evans),\u201d in what \u201cis a nice, exclusively gay moment in a Disney movie. \u201d Now, the film director says his comments have been wildly exaggerated. \u201cBecause it\u2019s just this  \u2014   it\u2019s part of just what we had fun with,\u201d Condon said. \u201cI love the way it plays pure when people don\u2019t know and it comes as a nice surprise. \u201d Last Tuesday, Disney released a promotional clip online showing a flamboyant Gad singing his ode to Gaston: \u201cFor there\u2019s no man in town half as manly. Perfect, a pure paragon. \u201d Condon says he can only hope that audiences don\u2019t \u201cmake a big deal of it. \u201d \u201cWhy is it a big deal?\u201d Condon also commended Gad for being able to make \u201csomething really subtle and delicious out of\u201d the role. Disney\u2019s   Beauty and the Beast opens in theatres March 17. The film is directed by Condon and stars Dan Stevens, Emma Watson, Luke Evans, Ewan McGregor, and Josh Gad.
