Here\u2019s a look at what happened during the long runs of five of them. During the run of the revival, the cast went through: 93 pairs of boots and shoes 972 challahs 234  or so haircuts and beard trims 1 onstage marriage proposal (after a show, by Ben Rappaport, who plays Perchik Megan Kane said yes). Other than a misplaced exit, Adrianna Hicks has had very few mishaps as a swing who has covered  \u2014   or stepped in to play  \u2014   seven characters in the   musical \u201cThe Color Purple. \u201d Unlike an understudy, who usually covers one lead role, a swing steps in \u201cwhenever someone is out sick or on vacation, or someone can\u2019t make the train,\u201d as Ms. Hicks put it. Like all swings, Ms. Hicks, 27, is at the theater even when she\u2019s not scheduled to perform, in case something happens to an actor during the show. That\u2019s what occurred at a performance in May when Cynthia Erivo, the show\u2019s   star, left after the first act because of illness. \u201cSomebody runs upstairs and was like, \u2018Cynthia might be out, so just be prepared,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hicks recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018Nobody talk to me, I just need to focus.\u2019 They announced my name and said the performance would be continued by Adrianna. I remember walking out onstage and with the audience so responsive, loving that moment. \u201d Ms. Hicks said covering Ms. Erivo\u2019s leading role, Celie, which she has done over 25 times, was the most daunting part of being in the show, her Broadway debut. (She goes next into the Encores! production of \u201cBig River. \u201d) \u201cIn her voice there\u2019s such freedom, because she has it in her body physically,\u201d Ms. Hicks said of Ms. Erivo. \u201cWith me, I\u2019m still learning to get it there. \u201d As for that missed departure, Ms. Hicks said, \u201cFlaws have happened. \u201d \u201cI have exited off the wrong side of the stage because I\u2019m so set being another character for the entire week, and then, for one show, doing someone totally different,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThank God we just walk onstage and stand there at certain moments. \u201d The actor Gerry Vichi thinks \u201cSomething Rotten!\u201d might be his last show. He\u2019s 79. He\u2019s developed a hernia that will require an operation, which he put off until after the show closes. He says his memory is fine, but keeping up the     energy is a challenge. So what\u2019s next? \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll sit in my chair and drink Scotch and watch TV,\u201d said Mr. Vichi, who made his Broadway debut in 1981 in the Kander and Ebb musical \u201cWoman of the Year,\u201d with Lauren Bacall. \u201cWho knows? There\u2019s always baseball season. \u201d Mr. Vichi has been with \u201cSomething Rotten!\u201d for the show\u2019s entire run  \u2014   it opened in April 2015  \u2014   playing a comedic version of Shylock. (\u201cHe speaks a little more modern and he does like to loan money, but he doesn\u2019t look for a pound of flesh,\u201d he explained.) Between shows on a recent Wednesday, he got on the phone to talk about what he called \u201cprobably the most fun of any show I\u2019ve done. \u201d Following are edited excerpts from the conversation. \u201cSomething Rotten!\u201d had a good run. Congratulations. We had a nice run. If it weren\u2019t for Ben Brantley, maybe we would have run longer. Put him on the phone. I\u2019ll tell him. Has performing gotten more difficult as you\u2019ve gotten older?   that\u2019s fine. Keeping up the energy is a challenge, but it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s a joy to come to work every day. How many people can say that? Do you have any   rituals? I will often take members of the cast out to dinner. One night I took a bunch of the girls out. When we fellows get together, we pick a steakhouse, like Quality Meats, and we have a good time. When you say you take members out for dinner, does that mean you pay? I like to pay. I\u2019m a good tipper. Who wants to ask around  \u2014   who had the borscht? Who had the Caesar salad? Give me a break. How do you feel about the show\u2019s closing? There will be tears, but not from me. I don\u2019t have any illusions about being a star or a big shot. I just like to have fun.  Anything else you wanted to say before we close? Tell Ben Brantley I called. When the show wraps up, it will have had: 19 girls featured in the role of Matilda 64 kids employed in the production 1 fresh copy of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d torn up in every show 23, 880 balloons inflated (15 per show) 796 pounds of chocolate frosting shoveled into the face of Matilda\u2019s classmate Bruce, who takes a slice of Miss Trunchbull\u2019s chocolate cake and winds up forced to eat the whole thing. 51 actors have made their Broadway debuts in the show. THREE original Broadway cast members are still in it (Peter Gregus, Mark Lotito and Sara Schmidt). ONE actor has been in it since the   engagement at La Jolla Playhouse (Peter Gregus).  29. 8 pounds of gunpowder have been fired onstage. 31 babies were born to company members in the show (22 are girls). 120, 692 times \u201cOh What a Night\u201d has been said or sung onstage (26 per performance). 157, 828   (34 per performance).'"}, "time": 1742562206.8486826}
