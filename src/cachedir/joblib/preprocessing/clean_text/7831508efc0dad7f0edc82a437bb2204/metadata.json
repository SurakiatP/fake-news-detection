[The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday, in an article titled \u201cBay Area demonstrators may be paid to protest, by employers,\u201d that the \u201ccommon accusation lobbed at liberal protesters\u201d that \u201cthey\u2019re being paid to protest\u201d is at least partially based in fact.  According to the Chronicle, \u201can increasing number of companies have unveiled policies that allow employees to take paid time off work for political or civic activities, such as protesting, canvassing, voting, volunteering or even running for office. \u201d The progressive movement\u2019s vocal opposition to President Donald Trump has translated into employers (at least, those who can afford it) providing paid leave as a way to increase political engagement after what many of them took as a devastating loss. Adam Kleinberg, CEO of San Francisco marketing firm Traction, reportedly allows employees two paid \u201cDays of Action\u201d to participate in political rallies and protests annually. \u201cIt\u2019s not sufficient anymore to say we\u2019re a profit engine and we\u2019re making money and screw everything else. It\u2019s part of our responsibility to be engaged, to be active,\u201d William Morgan, CEO and founder of   startup Buoyant, told the Chronicle. His company reportedly offers about three to four weeks of paid time off to its workers, who are able to use the time for political activity or vacations. \u201cWe as individuals, we as companies exist in an ecosystem. We\u2019re only here because there\u2019s this environment around us. It can\u2019t just be a   relationship. \u201d The Chronicle notes that while the majority of these companies are on the smaller side, and tend to have more liberal workforces, larger companies like Facebook are looking to entertain similar policies. They reportedly told employees that they could use paid leave time to attend and participate in   May Day demonstrations. However, the Chronicle also notes that some companies who offer their employees paid leave for political action have experienced an intense backlash.'"}, "time": 1742562273.1949246}
