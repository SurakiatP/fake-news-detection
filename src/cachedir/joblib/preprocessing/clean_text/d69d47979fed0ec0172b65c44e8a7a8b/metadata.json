[Asked by TMZ \u201chow Trump is doing with racial injustice\u201d in America, the Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor replied: \u201cHe\u2019s not. \u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s a pig who\u2019s trying to make sure that he galvanizes as much fear as possible, particularly against black, brown immigrants, and Muslims,\u201d Williams told TMZ. Concerning Trump\u2019s law enforcement policy agenda, Williams cited a series of   shooting statistics. \u201cThere were more killings at the hands of police this February than January and February of last year, 211 murders at the hands of police this year so far,\u201d the actor said.  Williams has spoken out against Trump before. In September, the actor and activist appeared in Joss Whedon\u2019s \u201cImportant\u201d political PSA alongside Avengers stars Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson to urge people to vote for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Last year, the actor was the subject of a petition calling for his firing from Grey\u2019s Anatomy following his   acceptance speech at the BET Awards, during which he vilified police officers and accused white people of appropriating and then profiting from black culture. Williams also protested in Ferguson, Missouri after the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. He later said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \u201cthere\u2019s a complete double standard and a complete different experience that a certain element of this country has the privilege of being treated like human beings, and the rest of us are not treated like human beings, period. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742628417.655573}
