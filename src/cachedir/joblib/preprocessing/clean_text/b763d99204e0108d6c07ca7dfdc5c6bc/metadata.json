You know, the Constitution, with good reason, says that in order to declare war, you have to go to Congress. We want to hear what the president\u2019s plan is, and have the ability to debate it in front of the American people. \u201d He added, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s not to say that the president as    can\u2019t order a direct military operation, a finite operation in time, but within a very short period of time, the president\u2019s expected to come to Congress, present a plan, Congress really should declare war, or authorize the use of military force. \u201d Lee also stated that it was difficult to say whether the strike was a good idea at the time because \u201cThe president has access to information the rest of us don\u2019t have. So, it may well be proven out in time that he did the right thing. I just don\u2019t know. We just don\u2019t have all that information. \u201d When asked if he would support a presidential authorization of a   zone, Lee responded that \u201cI\u2019m not enthusiastic about the idea in the abstract, but if he came with the right plan, and I thought that plan could work, I\u2019d consider it, especially if he can tie it up with American national security. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564163.294973}
