[In the music business] it\u2019s obvious that we\u2019ve had to, you know, women and minorities have had to fight for, you know, trying to get equal opportunities for, for ages . . . . There\u2019s not enough diversity . . . . I\u2019m just an entertainer but, um, you know, I\u2019m a fan of Hillary [Clinton] . . . of course I\u2019m a fan of Hillary. Of course I would love to see a woman president.\u201d \\nCarey is very much in the news these days because Australian playboy billionaire James Packer recently broke off their engagement. Rumors have it that one of the reasons for the breakup was her \u201cinsane spending sprees\u201d. \\nAccording to an account in New York Post \u2018s \u201c Page Six \u201d on Oct. 27, 2016, the following are examples of Carey\u2019s \u201cover-the-top . . . frenzied spending that may have doomed her engagement to Packer\u201d: Sources say Carey \u201cregularly drops $10,000 to get her hair and makeup perfect \u2014 even if it\u2019s all going to last just a single day.\u201d Power 105\u2019s The Breakfast Club radio host Charlamagne Tha God, aka Lenard McKelvey, who knows the singer, told The Post : \u201cMariah is the last of the divas \u2014 she\u2019s got a very old-school approach to stardom. It\u2019s champagne-in-the-morning type stuff. She [once] shared some with the Breakfast Club staff at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, but she did not pour her own champagne \u2014 someone else poured it for her.\u201d In 2014, Carey \u2014 who once called overhead lighting \u201cabusive\u201d \u2014 showed up to a filmed radio interview on The Breakfast Club over an hour late, with her own lighting crew in tow. McKelvey told The Post : \u201cI remember thinking to myself, damn, what kind of disposable income she has where she has her own lighting director? That was the first and only time that that has ever happened on the radio show.\u201d Carey reportedly drops at least $45,000 a year on spa treatments for her dogs \u2014 Jack Russells named Cha Cha and Jill E. Beans \u2014 even flying them first class to LA in January, which cost over $2,000 per dog. A close friend of Packer told Woman\u2019s Day last month that Carey \u201cspends $100,000 a month ordering exotic flowers from around the world to where she happens to be.\u201d Carey has her own yacht, the Capri, which costs a cool $340,000 per week plus expenses to maintain, according to \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d . She would use a ferry to reach Packer\u2019s boat, the Arctic P, which is the seventh-largest privately owned vessel in the world. Carey\u2019s closet is \u201cthe stuff of legends, packed with more stilettos than the Barneys shoe department.\u201d She has a room just to store her shoes. In a recent Instagram showing off part of her vast footwear collection, she calls the room \u201calways my favorite room in the house\u201d. \\nBut Mariah Carey tells us that women can\u2019t get a fair deal in anything and, in the music business, women and minorities have to fight for equal opportunities. \\nIf you buy this delusional woman\u2019s music or go to her concerts, you\u2019re contributing to Mariah \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d Carey\u2019s obscene spending that pollutes the environment and squanders the world\u2019s resources. \\n~Eowyn'"}, "time": 1742564431.9438322}
