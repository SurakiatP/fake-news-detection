[The new rules come after years of fans and customers complaining that ESPN has become a bastion of   views delivered at the expense of sports, and to the utter exclusion of any conservative ideas.  While in some cases it appears the new rules do offer a little wiggle room for   talent, the rules seem to be aimed at tamping down the wild spouting on political topics its hosts have indulged for the last few years. It is also interesting that ESPN released these new guidelines right in the middle of the NCAA Championship game when fans were distracted by the tournament and might not have taken notice of the change. It is almost like the practice of dumping political news on a Friday evening in the hopes that it might make fewer waves because all the reporters have already gone home for the weekend. ESPN\u2019s vice president of global digital content, Patrick Stiegman, noted that the rise of social media and the many controversies that   talent recently stirred via Twitter and Facebook was a major reason for the new guidelines. \u201cWe have the convergence of a politically charged environment and all these new technologies coming together at once,\u201d Stiegman told ESPN\u2019s Jim Brady. \u201cBased on that, we wanted the policy to reflect the reality of the world today. There are people talking about politics in ways we have not seen before, and we\u2019re not immune from that. \u201d Brady, also ESPN\u2019s ombudsman, addressed complaints from fans that the network has become too political in a long article published last November. Brady made to investigate the claims that his network had become infected with liberal politics, and at that time concluded that was not the case. Despite Brady\u2019s obviously skewed \u201cinvestigation\u201d from November, it now appears that the network has accepted the charge that it has become too political. Some of the changes include a proscription against political advocacy, including the one that states, \u201cOriginal news reports should not include statements of support, opposition or partisanship related to any social issue, political position, candidate or office holder. \u201d The rules also both directly and indirectly mention social media, stating, \u201cWriters, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in \u2018hard\u2019 news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any   forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders. \u201d By \u201c  forum,\u201d the network means social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Indeed, later in the new policy, it directly notes that the new rules apply to \u201cESPN, Twitter, Facebook and other media. \u201d The new guidelines also inform hosts that any interviews with candidates will have to be cleared by executives so that \u201cbalance\u201d can be assessed. It also says that presentations must be balanced, stating \u201cThe presentation should be thoughtful and respectful. We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric. \u201d The new rules could act to temper the extreme liberalism in which hosts have routinely indulged. But, it remains to be seen if the network will stick to the policy if the   commentary goes on unabated. After all, it should be noted that the network had rules similar to these before and it neither calmed the   liberal outbursts nor did the rules form the basis for any punishment of violations of anyone spouting liberal political views.
