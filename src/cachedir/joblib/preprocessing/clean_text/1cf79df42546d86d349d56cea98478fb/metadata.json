[A mass email sent on Monday using DNC chairman Tom Perez\u2019s name as the sender praised the appropriations bill as a win for Democrats.  \u201cLate last night, Democratic leaders reached a deal to stop a   government shutdown, and it\u2019s a major victory for all of us who are resisting the Trump agenda,\u201d the email sent on Monday said. Those victories, the email claimed, include not cutting Planned Parenthood funding and not allowing \u201cone red cent for Donald\u2019s border wall. \u201d \u201cAnd it only happened because you made sure Republicans knew there\u2019d be hell to pay for backing Donald Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d the email said, adding that the Republicans\u2019 effort to do away with Obamacare and install \u201cTrumpcare\u201d is still in play. \u201cWe chalked up a big win yesterday, and that\u2019s great,\u201d the email said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t afford to rest on our laurels,\u201d the email concluded as it urged email recipients to make a donation to the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) said at a Capitol Hill press conference on Tuesday that there\u2019s a lot of \u201cconservative wins\u201d in the budget, and that includes no funding for Planned Parenthood. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is not funded,\u201d Ryan said, adding that the grants and reimbursements given to the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider through the federal Title X Family Planning Program to the tune of millions of dollars annually will be up to Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price. \u201cSo we think there are some really good wins,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI know there\u2019s a PR machine that the Democrats are pushing. I\u2019d say don\u2019t look at the press releases look at the bill. \u201d \u201cWhen you look at the bill, there\u2019s a lot of good conservative wins here,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut chief among them are the president\u2019s two highest priorities: support the military and get a down payment on border security. \u201d Ryan said the \u201cfight\u201d for funding the border wall will come this summer.'"}, "time": 1742563812.2090178}
