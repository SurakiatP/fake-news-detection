The choice is all yours, America. by Geoffrey Grider November 7, 2016 Crooked Hillary, Slick Willy, and the entire Clinton Crime Family organization represent the very worst of a corrupt system that has been allowed to operate for far too long. \\n\u201cWhen the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.\u201d Proverbs 29:2 (KJV) \\nOn November 8th , the American people will have the opportunity to do what the FBI and the Department of Justice refuse to do, deliver a guilty verdict against Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump\u2019s Argument For America: WikiLeaks: DNC and CNN colluded on questions for Trump, Cruz Newly released emails from WikiLeaks suggest that the Democratic National Committee colluded with CNN in devising questions in April to be asked of then-Republican primary candidate Donald Trump in an upcoming interview. In an email to DNC colleagues on April 25 with the headline \u201cTrump Questions for CNN,\u201d a DNC official with the email username asked for ideas for an interview to be conducted by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer.\u201dWolf Blitzer is interviewing Trump on Tues ahead of his foreign policy address on Wed. \u2026 Please send me thoughts by 10:30 AM tomorrow.\u201dThe sender of the email would seem to be DNC Research Director Lauren Dillon, who was identified in previous reports of DNC emails released by WikiLeaks in July. Stay abreast of the latest developments from nation\u2019 source Jill Stein agrees with Donald Trump, Crooked Hillary must be stopped \u201cGet ready for war with Russia\u201d if Hillary Clinton is elected president, said progressive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein.\u201cThis election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,\u201d Stein warned, explaining that Clinton\u2019s trigger-happy militarism \u201cis a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.\u201dWhile Stein explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are \u201carguably even more immediate and intense.\u201d, Stein blasted Clinton\u2019s \u201cwarmongering\u201d that \u201calmost singlehandedly\u201d brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president. source Hillary Loses The Left While Donald Trump has been consolidating his base of support, the opposite appears to be happening for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who seems to be hemorrhaging supporters from her progressive base.Clinton\u2019s long-running rift with the progressive left has been a vulnerability for her throughout her campaign \u2014 dating back to the Democratic primary.Yet, in the closing days of the 2016 campaign, the rift has been laid bare through a combination of WikiLeaks revelations, a series of high-profile endorsements for Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein from progressives like Marc Lamont Hill, Cornel West, and Susan Sarandon, as well as polling data that suggests Trump\u2019s broad populist messaging is resonating with Democrat-leaning voters.Contrary to the narrative perpetuated by corporate media, many prominent liberals are now expressing their belief that installing Hillary Clinton, a \u201c corporatist hawk ,\u201d in the White House is \u201c the true danger \u201d and would be \u201c more dangerous \u201d for progressive values, the well-being of the nation, and the stability of the world than would four years of a Donald Trump presidency. source Trey Gowdy Reaction to James Comey Final Conclusion on New Hillary Emails: \\nGeoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
