The release appears to be part of a deal that may have gained freedom for jailed Boko Haram terrorists. [A Nigerian government official told Al Jazeera the government was keeping the girls in the town of Banki, close to the   border. Few details surfaced on the status of the girls following their release Saturday.  \u201cAccording to sources, this may be a result of negotiations  \u2014   but there have also been some military operations of recent around that area, as well as other parts of northeast Nigeria,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahmed Idris reported from Nigeria\u2019s capital. \u201cWe were told that Boko Haram was trying to negotiate for the release of some of their top commanders in custody of the Nigerian security services,\u201d Idris reported. \u201cThere are also some reports suggesting that they want some ransom to be paid for some of these girls. \u201d Boko Haram, which roughly translates to \u201call Western education is forbidden,\u201d seeks to impose Islamic Sharia law in Nigeria\u2019s mainly Muslim north. In March, thousands of women in Nigeria took the streets of the northern capital Maiduguri to protest the government\u2019s inability to eradicate Boko Haram, which continues to commit mass abductions, rapes, and murders since the government claimed it had defeated the group in 2015. The women who organized in Maiduguri, the capital of northeastern Borno state, wanted to attract the attention of representatives of the U. N. Security Council, who were visiting the city at that time. The protests also targeted President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, who won the nation\u2019s presidency on a campaign promise to eliminate Boko Haram. Boko Haram jihadists also abuse boys by teaching them at an early age how to rape women while limiting the chances of them escaping. \u201cThey tell us to remember to hold the girl tight on both hands, pinned to the floor,\u201d a    boy identified as \u201cAhmed\u201d told reporters last year. \u201cThey said we shouldn\u2019t let a woman overpower us. \u201d On April 14, 2014, the terrorists seized 276 pupils from the Government Girls Secondary School in the town of Chibok, with 57 of them managing to escape in the immediate aftermath of the abduction. Since then, some of the schoolgirls have been released, while others managed to escape. Even with Saturday\u2019s release, that leaves about 100 girls still unaccounted for and the future of the girls is uncertain after years of trauma and many have borne children while in captivity.'"}, "time": 1742563875.9373279}
