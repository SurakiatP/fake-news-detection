Her eyes are serene but lively, her cheekbones and forehead elevated and her round chin narrow. Her look is distinctive, but not so much so that it distracts. In other words, Ms. Kwao has a face made for makeup  \u2014   to show off its transformative power and the skill of its artists. But she and other \u201c \u201d models like her are largely ignored by the beauty industry. \u201cBeauty brand work is nonexistent,\u201d said Ms. Kwao, who is originally from London. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to do a few editorials in the U. K. but I\u2019ve never even been on a casting for mainstream commercial work. When I try to understand it, I think people are scared to try something new. It\u2019s like, \u2018I have a formula, why change it? \u2019\u201d There\u2019s no size requirement to fit a lipstick, so why are there no curvy models in beauty? One view says the commodification of beauty is to blame. \u201cBeauty is about imagining where you may be in the future,\u201d said Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor at Cornell University who specializes in feminist media studies and consumer culture. \u201cImagining yourself looking like a celebrity or model. That promise of future reward creates need. \u201d Dr. Duffy points out that this idealized, aspirational woman will usually look one way  \u2014   patrician features, tall, typically white and thin. This fashionable ideal was born out of the classism and racism of the 1920s, she says, when American consumer culture and the modeling industry burgeoned simultaneously. While some elements of that ideal shifted over time, the body standard remains. \u201cPeople often cite the 1950s as a time when curviness was in, but that\u2019s not entirely true,\u201d said Elizabeth Wissinger, author of \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model\u201d and a professor of fashion studies at the City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center. \u201cYes, curvy bodies were popular, but the people had those achievable, accessible physiques, represented by movie stars like Marilyn Monroe. Fashion was still very separate and models were thin. \u201d Practical and business forces are at work, too. \u201c  models are obviously needed in fashion because there are   clothing lines,\u201d said Jennie Runk, a curvy model who gained popularity after a 2013 HM swimwear campaign. \u201cBut when you\u2019re thinking about images where bodies aren\u2019t involved, there\u2019s not much discussion of size diversity yet. \u201d Fashion companies may garner publicity and good will when they feature curvy models. Ostensibly, beauty companies would not get that same   boost, because bodies aren\u2019t involved in their advertising imagery. \u201cAlso, people just don\u2019t think to go to plus agencies or boards,\u201d Ms. Runk said. On an agency site, the first faces you\u2019ll see are those of \u201c \u201d models. If an agency does have a curve board, it\u2019s a few clicks away, leaving casting directors unlikely to see (and subsequently book) a curve model unless they\u2019re actually looking for one. There have been some exceptions. In the 1990s, the   model and TV personality Emme Aronson became a spokesmodel for Revlon cosmetics. Queen Latifah has been the face of CoverGirl\u2019s Queen Collection, a makeup line for dark skin tones, for more than a decade. In a partnership with the television drama \u201cEmpire,\u201d CoverGirl featured Gabourey Sidibe, one of the show\u2019s actresses. And four years ago, MAC did a collection with the musician Beth Ditto. \u201cThere is no formula,\u201d said James Gager, creative director and senior vice president, of MAC Cosmetics, speaking of how the company picks its collaborators. \u201cIf a model has confidence in who she is and how she carries herself, size is irrelevant. \u201d Even so, he added: \u201cPeople are accustomed to seeing beauty in a singular way, and it takes time to open up. I see MAC as part of this change. \u201d Gary Dakin, who ran Ford Model\u2019s plus board until 2012 and then opened his own agency, JAG Models, also acknowledged this: \u201cI know the casting directors are pushing for size diversity, and agents are pushing for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the disconnect here?\u201d The problem, as he sees it, is that the industry is celebrity driven. \u201cCompanies want that name, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hurt this cause more than anything. \u201d Beauty contracts are modeling\u2019s holy grail  \u2014   highly visible and lucrative. So they are reserved for a small pool of top actresses, pop stars and   models. Because the   category is still niche in the American market, it\u2019s harder for those models to reach household name status. But that is all beginning to change. \u201cInstagram has given the girls a voice,\u201d said Becca Thorpe, a former model who is now agent to Muse NYC\u2019s curvy models. \u201cI can push them in a new way. Companies get to know what a model is about and whether or not that persona aligns with their brand. If they\u2019re looking for different, bold and street, they\u2019re going to start looking at Instagram. \u201d The   Paloma Elsesser\u2019s unpretentious,   vibe is skillfully articulated through her Instagram account, which caught the attention of the makeup artist Pat McGrath. Last fall she chose Ms. Elsesser as a face for her makeup brand Pat McGrath Labs. \u201cThere is something exquisite in the mix of eccentricity and beauty,\u201d Ms. McGrath said. \u201cPaloma is an outspoken voice for body positivity and diversity within the beauty and fashion industry. Beauty brands are slowly starting to embrace diversity, but there is still much progress to be made before women of all colors, sizes and gender and sexual identities are equally represented. I am able to do this is because I am doing this [line] on my own terms. \u201d The model and lifestyle blogger Cl\u00e9mentine Desseaux also jostled the industry late last year when she posted an Instagram video of herself wearing Christian Louboutin red lipstick, looking windblown and unassuming in Paris. The video went viral, and though the relationship between brand and model was unofficial, the public saw possibility. \u201cEveryone was going crazy to see a bare face wearing red lipstick. It was unusual  \u2014   kind of a clash between this posh brand and something raw and natural,\u201d Ms. Desseaux said. Perhaps most promising is the growing mainstream appeal of curvy models. Ashley Graham, a model on the cover of this year\u2019s Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, introduced a nail polish collection in May with Sephora\u2019s Formula X. That month, she also Instagrammed some   photos with Revlon product (though no formal relationship exists at this point). Iskra Lawrence, known for her unretouched lingerie and swimwear campaigns with the lingerie retailer Aerie, is amassing a large following. Her fierce, sometimes cheeky   advocacy frequently goes viral, like a     selfie posted in May and captioned: \u201cI do this so I can eat what I want (in moderation). I haven\u2019t dieted, calorie counted or in 6 years weighed myself. \u201d That candor and relatability may yet land her a beauty contract. \u201cI\u2019m always working to increase my platform,\u201d Ms. Lawrence said. \u201cI think when curvy models do that, beauty brands will start to work with us, too. I\u2019m not afraid of showing my skin  \u2014   my dream is to do an unretouched beauty campaign. We can make change happen if we make enough noise. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563212.970069}
