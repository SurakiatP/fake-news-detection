{"duration": 0.1121525764465332, "input_args": {"text": "'Until the last mouse click of \u201cTo Build a Better Beta,\u201d Pied Piper has existed only in the abstract, with endless promise and limitless value. Richard\u2019s compression platform could be worth billions. It could be the next Facebook. It could change the world. Alternately, it could be utterly worthless, one of the countless failed   that pile up in Silicon Valley like E. T. cartridges in a New Mexico landfill. As Erlich Bachman, the father of such stillborn incubees as Aviato and Nip Alert, says, \u201cShuttering a company in the Valley like a rite of passage, like herpes simplex one. \u201d The metaphor gets more disgusting from there. Sunday night\u2019s episode opens with Richard feeling exposed. He has fought hard to get his idea off the ground, but there was a certain amount of comfort in not getting what he wanted. Action Jack\u2019s push for a clunky data storage appliance may have insulted his vision of an elegant compression engine with mass utility, but he could still hide behind the box. If Jack had prevailed, Richard could grouse forever about how his brilliant algorithm was squandered by a   businessman and no one could question it. Bringing the pure, uncompromised Pied Piper into the world is a dream that nonetheless puts Richard on the precipice of a true, lasting, fatal disaster. \u201cTo Build a Better Beta\u201d is about the release of the beta version of Pied Piper, which is an important period for any tech company to work out the kinks before an official launch. It\u2019s not one of the funnier episodes this season, because there\u2019s so much heavy lifting required from a plotting standpoint, but it touches smartly on themes of trust, friendship and the lies we tell our friends and ourselves. That\u2019s the benefit of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d constantly bogging down its characters with setbacks and   conflict: Their response clarifies who they are and brings their relationships into sharper focus. The good news for Richard is that almost everybody loves the platform, including one notoriously critical user who calls it the best beta he\u2019s seen in 15 years in the Valley. A beaming Jared enthuses, \u201cI don\u2019t want to count our chickens before they\u2019re hatched  \u2014   I mean, 3 percent of hatchlings are born mutated or dead  \u2014   but we may have a healthy brood on our hands. \u201d The bad news is that Monica, whose opinion he values the most, so dislikes it that she initially lies to him about ever trying it at all. Her reassurances are comforting: She passed on a 20 percent stake in Slack, which she still doesn\u2019t get (\u201cIs it email? Is it a chat room? \u201d) and besides, in this business, investing in people is wiser than investing in products. And yet her general complaint about Pied Piper feeling too \u201cengineered\u201d seems on point, given the distance between the   coding nerds on Richard\u2019s team and the ordinary flesh sacks who would actually be using the platform. \u201cTo Build a Better Beta\u201d makes a joke out of Dinesh and Gilfoyle\u2019s failure to fill out a   invite list. It stands to reason that users would find their software   too. The guys at Pied Piper know code, but they don\u2019t know people (or business or fashion or social cues or other   matters) which is in large part of what makes \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d so funny. Gilfoyle and Dinesh each have a cover for their personal dysfunction. Gilfoyle writes off the whole of humankind as inherently venal and untrustworthy: \u201cIt\u2019s a war of all against all. The history of humanity is a book written in blood. We\u2019re all just animals in a pit. \u201d (Jared\u2019s deadpan response, \u201cI feel very sad now,\u201d may be the funniest moment of the episode.) Dinesh merely makes up friends in the dim hope that no one will try to verify them. These cool dudes are too busy \u201csnowboarding in Tahoe\u201d to answer questions about the beta. (As ever, Jared is sympathetic, recalling all the escape plans he hatched with his imaginary friend, Harriet Tubman.) So underneath all the lies told in \u201cTo Build a Better Beta,\u201d there\u2019s a pitiful, childlike vulnerability. Monica doesn\u2019t want to hurt Richard\u2019s feelings when his confidence is at its most fragile. Gilfoyle and Dinesh don\u2019t want to admit that they\u2019re the only true friends each has. Only Jared seems comfortable in his own skin, which he\u2019s described as his \u201chome\u201d when he has no place to sleep. Now that they\u2019re finally releasing Pied Piper to an internet of faceless, unsympathetic, often hostile users, they\u2019ll be totally defenseless. The creators of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d surely know the feeling. Bytes \u2022 The unraveling of Bachmanity continues apace, with Erlich and Big Head scrambling to recover $6 million in funds their devious money manager has tucked away for tax purposes. The succession of disastrous meetings gives T. J. Miller an opportunity to hold court, which is always comedy gold. I particularly liked Erlich\u2019s upset mood over the poor recovery efforts on his missing tiki head. \u2022 The episode makes a subtle point about the total disregard Silicon Valley has for matters of privacy. Hooli finds out about the Pied Piper beta by spying on company email. Gilfoyle finds out about Hooli scamming an invite code through the \u201cGod view\u201d he installed in the platform. The show doesn\u2019t make them equivalent violations  \u2014   Hooli\u2019s is more nefarious, Pied Piper\u2019s more useful  \u2014   but it\u2019s taken as a matter of course that privacy concerns are a joke in the tech world. \u2022 Big Head has lost his entire $20 million settlement, but he gets to keep both of the cannonballs he rented. He\u2019s going to be O. K. \u2022   isn\u2019t my favorite character, but his presence as a Erlich\u2019s unwelcome tenant and tormentor this season has been good for a few stray laughs, none heartier than his prank phone call in the seconds before launch. \u201cErlich Bachman, this is your mom. You are not my baby. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562114.4176095}
