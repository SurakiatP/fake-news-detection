In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \\nFord\u2019s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \\nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford\u2019s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \\n\u201cOur investment\u2026reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,\u201d said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. \u201cWorking with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.\u201d \\nThe move comes at a delicate time for Ford. \\nThe United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. \\nThe union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn\u2019t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It\u2019s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven\u2019t decided what will go there,\u201d said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. \\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he\u2019s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. \\n\u201cHow does that help us?\u201d Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. \u201cMexico is becoming the new China.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742628522.9121087}
