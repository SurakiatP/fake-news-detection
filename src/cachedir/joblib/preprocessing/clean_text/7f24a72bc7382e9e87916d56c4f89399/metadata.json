[The joke occurred during a private conversation involving the House Republican leadership. The conversation was recorded. The exchange  \u2014   from the transcript alone, since the Post has not made the audio available  \u2014   is as follows:  McCarthy: The Russians hacked the DNC and got the opp [sic] research that they had on Trump. McCarthy: laughs, [Crosstalk] Ryan: The Russian\u2019s [sic] hacked the DNC  \u2026     McHenry:   \u2026    to get oppo  \u2026     Ryan:   \u2026    on Trump and like delivered it to  \u2026    to who? [Unintelligible] McCarthy: There\u2019s  \u2026    there\u2019s two people, I think, Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump  \u2026    [laughter]  \u2026    swear to God. Ryan: This is an off the record  \u2026    [laughter]  \u2026    NO LEAKS  \u2026    [laughter]  \u2026    alright?! [Laughter] Ryan: This is how we know we\u2019re a real family here. The full context of the conversation is unclear, but the House leadership appeared to be discussing the crisis in the Ukraine, and Russian efforts to spread disinformation there. The apparent target of the joke is Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) whom the Post describes uncharitably as \u201ca fervent defender of Putin and Russia. \u201d The Post\u2018s Adam Entous does not explain why he did not post the audio of the conversation, but two reasons seem possible: one, the laughter on the audio would underline the fact that McCarthy\u2019s comments were intended to be humorous two, the volume of different voices might reveal who had made, and leaked, the recording. Though it is obvious from the transcript alone that the remark is a joke, the Post treats it as a serious scoop, claiming in the first paragraph that McCarthy \u201cmade a politically explosive assertion in a private conversation on Capitol Hill with his fellow GOP leaders. \u201d Later, the Post adds: \u201cIt is difficult to tell from the recording the extent to which the remarks were meant to be taken literally. \u201d No, it is not.
