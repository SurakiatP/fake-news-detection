It is not at all clear how credible this is,\u201d de Blasio told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer on his weekly radio show. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly in a vigilant position.\u201d \\nHizzoner said the NYPD is planning an \u201cextraordinary\u201d police presence for Tuesday, when Americans go to the polls. \\n\u201cFor the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in New York City on Tuesday night,\u201d he said, quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating. \\nDonald Trump, the Republican nominee, will be at the New York Hilton Midtown on Sixth Avenue, while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic counterpart, will be at the Javits Convention Center across town on 11th Avenue. \\nPolice also will be heavily deployed for the New York City Marathon on Sunday, de Blasio said. \\nMeanwhile, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declined to confirm the threat Friday but also noted the high state of alert for Election Day. \\n\u201cWe have more state police, more National Guard, more soldiers on duty than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the bad news is New York is often a threat. The good news is we\u2019ve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it.\u201d \\nThe NYPD and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks. \\n\u201cWe are aware of the information. We have been working with the FBI through the Joint Terrorism Task Force and our Counterterrorism and Intelligence Bureaus,\u201d the NYPD said in a statement. \\n\u201cWe continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement,\u201d the department said. \\nThe Port Authority \u2014 which operates airports, tunnels and bridges in and around the Big Apple \u2014 said it too was prepared. \\n\u201cWe are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months,\u201d spokesman Steve Coleman told The Post. \\nThe FBI did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states, but said counterterrorism and Homeland Security authorities \u201cremain vigilant and well-postured\u201d to handle attacks. \\n\u201cThe FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety,\u201d an FBI official said. \\nFriday\u2019s threat followed a report by NBC News that the US government believes hackers from Russia or other countries may try to unleash cyberattacks to wreak havoc ahead of Election Day. \\nAn effort coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and including the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Department of Defense \u2014 is being conducted to avert attacks, NBC News reported.'"}, "time": 1742563121.0262337}
