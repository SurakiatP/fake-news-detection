Please share #BillClintonSon.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nTwitter also continues to allow Williams to post the \u00e2\\x80\\x9cBanished\u00e2\\x80\\x9d video on Danney Williams\u00e2\\x80\\x99 page, but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message: \u00e2\\x80\\x9cThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nThis young lad has bravely come out and confronted his evil father who won\u2019t even give him any money. The media has attacked him as a Trump plant. \\nDanney has been raising kids since he was 16. He needs money. His kids need money. But old grandpa Bill the rapist won\u2019t give a cent. \\nThe least Bill could do is dip into his quarter-billion dollar fortune and buy these Black grandkids some friggin bikes. I mean come on. \\nHere\u2019s the video. \\nI highly recommend this video. It is a fantastic voyage with great music. \\nMake sure to download it and reupload it for when this copy gets shoah\u2019d. \\nAlex Jones also interviewed him recently and his Vegas press conference was spectacular. \\nDanney Clinton should be running for President. At least he\u2019s a good person. He raises his own kids and takes them to church. \\nWhen Trump is in control and Bill and Hillary are in prison, Danney should be given control of the Clinton Foundation. And least then his kids can get bikes. \\nFollow Danney on Twitter and support him.'"}, "time": 1742562201.4611337}
