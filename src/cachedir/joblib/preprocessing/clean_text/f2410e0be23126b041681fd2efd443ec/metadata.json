But by positioning itself as a boutique house that would show the relatively modest collection some marketing love, bring to bear the expertise of its new team of   specialists  \u2014   and include an undisclosed guarantee for the Basquiat, \u201cUntitled (Devil\u2019s Head)\u201d  \u2014   Phillips won the consignment. (The piece sold for $3. 6 million on a low estimate of $3 million.) Phillips\u2019s forthright use of guarantees, as well as its roster of new specialists able to attract   material, succeeded in making the auction house a player this season. \u201cThey definitely stepped up their game,\u201d said Alex Rotter, who recently left Sotheby\u2019s to become chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s Americas. \u201cThey\u2019re building something that needs to be seriously considered in the   and contemporary art world. \u201d After the November sale, even the   art press offered Phillips kudos. \u201cThe company is gaining some traction in chipping some market share away from the auction giants,\u201d wrote the longtime art critic Judd Tully in Blouin Artinfo. Phillips was the only auction house whose contemporary and   total was up this season, over the equivalent sale last year (by 66 percent, to $111. 2 million from $67 million). Phillips\u2019s sale was also 92 percent successful and captured 17 percent of the market share for all contemporary evening sales in November, a 10 percent increase from a year ago. \u201cThat last sale was by far the best sale they\u2019ve had,\u201d said the art dealer Larry Gagosian. \u201cYou opened the catalog, and there were things you really wanted  \u2014   it did not look like a bunch of things dealers were trying to unload. The material looked fresh. \u201d The auction house, which is privately owned by the Russian luxury retail group Mercury, is investing and expanding rapidly in Asia on Sunday, it held its first full   sale in Hong Kong, which totaled $19. 6 million (the low estimate was $13. 8 million) and had a respectable 82 percent success rate. Phillips\u2019s watch department is now the world leader this month, it set an auction high with a Patek Philippe that brought $11 million, thanks to Phillips\u2019s partnering with the team of Aurel Bacs and Livia Russo, who formerly led Christie\u2019s international watch department. This helps the auction house broaden its client base, since watch collectors often also collect art. And Phillips\u2019s design and photographs departments are already competitive. To be sure, there was not a flurry of bidding throughout the November sale. Phillips\u2019s top lot  \u2014   Gerhard Richter\u2019s 1963 painting \u201cD\u00fcsenj\u00e4ger,\u201d consigned by the Microsoft   Paul Allen  \u2014   sold on a   bid of $25. 5 million with fees to its   guarantor, based in Asia. (The buyer received about $1. 6 million from Phillips for serving as the guarantor.) But the auction house also sold its first work by the Abstract Expressionist painter Clyfford Still after multiple bids  \u2014   albeit to the guarantor. \u201cThere was quite a bit of bidding on quite a few lots at the sale,\u201d said Edward Dolman, who became chairman and chief executive officer of Phillips in 2014, \u201cbut the air remains thin right at the top end. \u201d Over the last year, the two big auction houses have been wrestling with the issue of competitive guarantees: They are reluctant to offer these minimum prices, which can eat into profits, but are also compelled to give them to secure   consignments. Phillips, however, does not hesitate to rely on guarantees, even as it also tries to offload some of the risk to third parties. Thirteen of the 37 lots in the November sale had guarantees, 10 by third parties and three by the house. \u201cGuarantees are here to stay  \u2014   it\u2019s something all our clients want to consider,\u201d Mr. Dolman said. \u201cSuccess is in making the right decisions around those guarantees  \u2014   making sure the risks are laid off, if you can lay them off, and not expose the company to huge losses if you get it wrong. \u201d Phillips acknowledges that these are early days in Mr. Dolman\u2019s tenure many of the specialists he has lured away from other houses only recently took up their new positions after completing their noncompete agreements. In   and contemporary art, this crew includes the Christie\u2019s alumni   Engelen and Robert Manley, and the former Sotheby\u2019s experts Scott Nussbaum and Jonathan Crockett (who is based in Asia). Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby\u2019s former worldwide head of contemporary art, and Marianne Hoet, previously an international director at Christie\u2019s, begin positions at Phillips next year. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand about this business is it needs an absolute core of infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Dolman said. Mr. Dolman himself is widely respected in the industry, having been Christie\u2019s chief executive and later director of the office of Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa   chairwoman of the Qatar Museums Authority. He left Qatar the year after Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad   took over as emir in 2013 the fate of contemporary art in that country is unclear, since the sheikh is known to be more conservative. \u201cI was asked to develop a   plan for the arts sector in Qatar and had completed that work,\u201d Mr. Dolman said. \u201cThe change of emir certainly acted as a catalyst for my decision, as the priorities of the new government became uncertain. The old emir had been a great supporter of the arts in Qatar. \u201d Phillips took some risks in its contemporary evening sale this season that paid off, like featuring two   artists, Carmen Herrera, the   abstract painter, and Mira Schendel, a Brazilian artist, who both would have typically been featured in a Latin American sale but here sold at auction highs. \u201cIt was great to put these amazing women artists on a platform with Richter and Dubuffet and Calder,\u201d Mr. Manley said. \u201cStarting next season, we\u2019re going to break down those boundaries more and more. \u201d Phillips is also taking an approach to auction catalogs that is different from that of its competitors, which tend to publish costly \u201chuge tomes that are these    textbooks that increasingly few people will ever read,\u201d Mr. Manley said. \u201cWe try to focus on the information that really matters to clients,\u201d he added. This fall, for example, Phillips published a separate catalog detailing the restoration of Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s 1994 canvas \u201cNudes in Mirror,\u201d which was slashed during a 2005 exhibition. (The painting sold for $21. 5 million, with no guarantee.) \u201cThey were always upfront with me about their assessment of the painting and the sale,\u201d said Richard Rush, whose family consigned the work. \u201cWe were all 100 percent behind this strategy, and it was really a team effort. \u201d The Phillips specialists acknowledge that their November sale was only an opening move the larger effort to disrupt the duopoly has just begun. \u201cWe\u2019re still in this phase when we get the sympathy vote,\u201d Mr. Engelen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a giant leap. It\u2019s just a good step to take. \u201d \u201cAs long as we have a seat at the table, that was the whole point,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s get a seat at the table. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628423.5232084}
