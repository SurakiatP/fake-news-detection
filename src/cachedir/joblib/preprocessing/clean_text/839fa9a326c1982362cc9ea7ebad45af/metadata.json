S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stated in an interview on Sunday that he is \u201cdisgusted\u201d by President Obama\u2019s continued effort to empty out Gitmo. [Bumgarner charged Obama with attempting to use Gitmo to ensure his legacy at the expense of national security. He served from April 2005  \u2014   June 2006 as commander of the Joint Detention Group, the guard force component of the Joint Task Force at the U. S. prison in Guantanamo.  The Pentagon announced last Thursday that four detainees had been released to Saudi Arabia, where they will purportedly participate in a rehabilitation program.  From the 535 detainees in Gitmo during Bumgarner\u2019s work there, the population is now down to 55, and 19 of those have reportedly been cleared for release. There is speculation Obama may release more detainees in his final days in office. \u201cIt has nothing to do with national security reasons,\u201d stated Bumgarner. He was speaking on this reporter\u2019s Sunday night talk radio program, \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d broadcast on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia\u2019s NewsTalk 990 AM. Listen to the interview here: Continued Bumgarner: His whole motivation has nothing to do with national security. In my mind, it is clearly a legacy issue for Obama who signed on, you know, day one of his presidency, \u2018I am going to close Guantanamo.\u2019 I knew then   \u2026     that would never happen. It is just impossible. He had no clue what he had just signed. And he has found out how hard that is. So, the argument always is that they (the terrorists) make this a propaganda matter to recruit more people. You and I both follow this pretty closely. I don\u2019t ever see it out there that Guantanamo is your call to battle, you know. I never see that. You and I both know what drives this fight. It has nothing to do with national security. Again, it\u2019s a legacy issue for Obama. And I\u2019m ashamed that it is occurring. Embarrassed. Disgusted. I don\u2019t know how it to make it stronger. Asked whether he had any advice regarding Gitmo for   Donald Trump, Bumgarner replied: One, it certainly should not be closed. And two, increase its population. And by that it\u2019s just not that we want to stack up Guantanamo Bay. But the whole purpose is  \u2014   this may strike people as funny  \u2014   but rather than kill the terrorists on the battlefield when we engage with the ISIS fighters, bring them in for the intelligence value that they can provide.   \u2026     Use the intelligence value. The great capacity and capability of Guantanamo. Let\u2019s fill it up with people and let the intelligence world go to work and develop the human intelligence that we so badly need. Fox News last week cited statistics from U. S. officials saying 30 percent of previously released Gitmo detainees are suspected of returning to terrorist activity. Bumgarner commented, \u201cAnd you know Aaron when we talk about these numbers   \u2026     let\u2019s just think about that.   \u2026     Think about the destruction that just one man carried out in Berlin. That fellow in France. So, if you can stop one, you saved numerous lives. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
