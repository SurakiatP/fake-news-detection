What he is not, though, by his own admission, is a social media maven. \u201cI\u2019ll try to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cI get into Instagram, and the next thing I know, someone will say, it\u2019s all about Snapchat now! It\u2019s like, oh God, leave me in the Stone Age  \u2014   I got one foot in the Stone Age and the millennium right now. \u201d Mr. Armstrong\u2019s straddled take on culture is laid out on \u201cRevolution Radio,\u201d the new Green Day album, and the first since 2000 that the band  \u2014   including the bassist Mike Dirnt and the drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool  \u2014     with an engineer. \u201cIt feels more independent than we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said in a phone interview. He\u2019s also branching out  \u2014   sort of  \u2014   with \u201cOrdinary World,\u201d in which he plays a    dad who throws himself a   40th birthday party. \u201cMy thing was keeping my stubble on for the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to make sure I shaved it in the right way, once every three days. And I wanted to show my gray that I have growing in. \u201d A still boyish 44, Mr. Armstrong  \u2014   who went through rehab for substance abuse in 2012 after an onstage outburst at a pop festival  \u2014   is grappling with his shifting generation. The cover for \u201cRevolution Radio\u201d is a boombox on fire. \u201cIt\u2019s like that feeling of what\u2019s obsolete,\u201d he said, \u201clike we\u2019re turning into a   graveyard. \u201d He paused. \u201cOoh, that was good  \u2014     graveyard! I\u2019m going to say that so many times in the next few days. \u201d He hopes to reprise the role of St. Jimmy, the   bad influence, in HBO\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d a rock opera based on the 2004 Green Day album. He credits the ambition of \u201cIdiot\u201d with the new heights of success in his career. But, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not royalty. I\u2019m the king of nothing. I\u2019m in the same high school rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band I\u2019ve been in since I was 16. \u201d Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. This is your first leading film role. Did you do any actorly things to prepare? Not like anything weird  \u2014   I wasn\u2019t exactly doing any, like, mime. Me and Lee Kirk, the director, we spent a lot of time together fleshing the character out, putting it more in my language. I just went from experiences on my own, and I just tried to be as honest as I could. Acting for the stage, you project to the back of the room, especially a character like St. Jimmy. This is all about the subtleties of acting to the camera, which is difficult for me, because I\u2019m anything but subtle. And you were playing opposite some very seasoned improvisers, like Fred Armisen and Judy Greer. Did that throw you? It felt pretty intimidating, just because I have so much respect for those people. They\u2019re brilliant people they\u2019re not like   at what they do, they\u2019re all the way good at what they do. Everybody wanted to make things really relaxed and fun. A couple of the guys that played dads in the movie came in, and we just acted out some of the scenes, which is super awkward at first, doing something you\u2019ve never done, but eventually I got comfortable with it. We\u2019re seeing more and more of that nontraditional father onscreen. Can you relate? It\u2019s a different take on parenting, especially people that were maybe Generation X kind of people and are raising kids now. We\u2019re not our dads. I think there\u2019s more sensitivity training that\u2019s involved in being a parent nowadays. My kids are 21 and 18  \u2014   that was a trip. I was a very young dad. And your sons are both musicians. Do you jam with them? A little bit. Mostly they show me music that they\u2019re into, they do a lot of demos and things like that on their own. My youngest son, Jakob, he\u2019s becoming a really good songwriter. He writes songs that are straight from the heart. Joey\u2019s band, they\u2019re really good, and they\u2019re different. It\u2019s not about being, like, a rock star. If there\u2019s anything I share with them, it\u2019s the joy and the love of music. You started in the punk scene as a teenager, when it\u2019s a lot about youthful anger. What does it mean to you to be part of a punk scene now? I think punk is a lot more than just anger, and rage. It\u2019s like the weirdo that gets to find their voice for the first time. It could be someone that wants to have their own fanzine, and write about things they believe in, and despite the odds, do it anyway. Green Day records in general are about feeling kind of lost, and a bit stupid, in the midst of chaos and media and everything that\u2019s changed. And the bottom line for this album is to find something that\u2019s attainable, some kind of peace or serenity inside that chaos. The song \u201cOrdinary World\u201d is basically what that\u2019s about. \u201cSay Goodbye\u201d is about watching how Ferguson is this military state, and you see all these tanks and tear gas. \u201cRevolution Radio\u201d mentions that, too. It\u2019s just reflecting what I see, and maybe coming up with a caricature of it. You touch on difficult topics on the album  \u2014   \u201cBang Bang\u201d is a song from the perspective of a mass shooter. Is that fun to play? Yeah, and hard  \u2014   it\u2019s fast. It\u2019s a release for everyone that\u2019s singing it in the crowd. When you grow up in an era of social media and manifestoes and mass shootings and narcissism and that sort of evil side of American life, what do you say about something like that? You\u2019re just left speechless. The best way I\u2019m able to talk about it is when I do it in a song, and that\u2019s sort of my release, and that\u2019s what ends up coming along in our crowds these last few years. Has your songwriting process changed in sobriety? I\u2019ve just become more focused I\u2019ve learned to stop when I\u2019m blocked. Either you go and make the bigger mess right now, or that song doesn\u2019t want to be written right now, your brain\u2019s not ready for it. Sometimes I just gotta know when to back off something. The fact that I\u2019m clearheaded  \u2014   I just love making stuff. A song like \u201cRevolution Radio,\u201d it\u2019s so subtle and it\u2019s so nerdy. The song\u2019s got the intro, and it\u2019s got a   that goes into the chorus, and I decided to not do that   going into the chorus in the second verse. It makes the song unpredictable. For me, that\u2019s like the greatest song I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s super nerdy, but that\u2019s what I love about writing. Why do you think \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d has had such a long life, in so many forms? Because people are able to interpret it anyway they want any time there\u2019s any kind of injustice that\u2019s going along, in America, you can adapt it somehow, go listen to that record, and it makes sense. There\u2019s a lot more transparency now. In Pennsylvania, there was a small theater group with an   cast that did \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d for Black Lives Matter. When I saw that, I was like: \u201cYeah, this is why I do this stuff!\u201d Because people take it and make something of their own out of it.'"}, "time": 1742563021.7167983}
