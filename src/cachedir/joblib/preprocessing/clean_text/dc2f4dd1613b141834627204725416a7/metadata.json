In fact, just last weekend ABC released a poll that drew huge media attention on the Sunday talk show circuit as it showed Hillary opening up a 12-point national lead. Now, just a few days later, that exact same poll shows only a 5-point lead. That data seemingly proves one of two things, either the polls are indeed \u201crigged\u201d to show a desired outcome or the daily drip of WikiLeaks emails is finally starting to take a toll on the Clinton campaign. \\nBut the ABC poll isn\u2019t the only one tightening with most of the recent polls from the Real Clear Politics average showing only a modest lead for Hillary.\\n\\nA similar tightening of the polls is occurring in Florida\u2026\\n\\nAnd even in Michigan, which has been a long-time democrat stronghold.\\n\\nAs The Hill points out, the damage from the daily barrage of WikiLeaks dumps may be finally starting to take their toll on voters.\\nHillary Clinton has failed to effectively contain the damage from the release of thousands of campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s personal emails, giving new ammunition to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\\nThe fallout from the daily releases have raised concerns among Democrats that even if Clinton is elected president, the controversy will follow her into the White House. \\nAnyone with an Internet connection can dig into the thousands of pages of emails , which have revealed infighting among Clinton\u2019s top advisers, as well as new details about the millions of dollars flowing into the Clinton\u2019s charitable foundation and personal bank accounts.\\nMeanwhile, the mainstream press, after seemingly concluding that this race is a done deal, has finally decided they can no longer ignore the Clinton scandals.\\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper called the Wikileaks revelation around Brazile \u201chorrifying.\u201d \\n\u201cLet me go to bottom line: There is no way under any circumstance the Clinton Foundation should not be operating if she becomes president,\u201d Chuck Todd, moderator of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, told WGN Radio in Chicago on Thursday. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how they can keep that going.\\n\u201cShe\u2019s got an opportunity, again, if she doesn\u2019t do half measures here, if they shut it down to at least limit the political damage,\u201d he said.\\nEven Chris Matthews, who famously got the \u201cthrill up his leg\u201d listening to Obama speak back in 2008, admits that the \u201cthrill is gone\u201d with Hillary who will bring in \u201ctrain loads of contributors\u201d and \u201ccharge them by the hour\u201d to sit in the Lincoln bedroom. \\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t change because we swear them into the White House. They become that person big-time. And the Clintons were raising money like this hand over hand, hand over fist, back in 1996, using\u2014we called it Motel 6. They were hoarding them in, pulling them in by train loads of contributors and then letting them sit in the Lincoln bedroom for a while and charging them by the hour. You can still vote for Hillary Clinton, but remember, you\u2019re getting this as part of the package, because that\u2019s been their pattern.\u201d \\nAnd, the Trump campaign will continue to hammer on the daily WikiLeaks dumps through election day.\\n\u201cThe more e-mails Wikileaks releases, the more the lines between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State\u2019s office, and the Clintons\u2019 personal finances are blurred,\u201d Trump said at a campaign stop in Ohio on Thursday.\\n\u201cIf the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their criminal enterprise when they weren\u2019t in the White House, just imagine what they will do if they are given the chance to use the Oval Office to pad their pockets.\u201d \\nOf course, with 11 days left until the election there is still plenty of time for new scandals\u2026somehow we suspect the surprises aren\u2019t over.\\nDelivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by Zero Hedge of www.zerohedge.com .
