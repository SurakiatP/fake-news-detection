Kennedy, said in a Facebook post on Monday that the elder President George Bush told her that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. The former president, however, is not talking. Ms. Townsend, 65, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland who on Facebook uses her middle name, Hartington, posted a picture of her shaking Mr. Bush\u2019s hand. \u201cThe President told me he\u2019s voting for Hillary! !\u201d the caption said. Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the former president, 92, would neither confirm nor deny Ms. Townsend\u2019s claim. \u201cThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,\u201d Mr. McGrath said in an email. \u201cHe is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. \u201d Ms. Townsend\u2019s post was  reported on Monday by Politico. CNN posted a screen shot of the post, which did not appear to have been made public on Ms. Townsend\u2019s Facebook page. Ms. Townsend told Politico that she had met with the former president in Maine earlier in the day. A report in The Texas Tribune in May, several months after Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, dropped out of the presidential race, quoted Mr. McGrath saying that the former president was not planning to make a public endorsement. \u201cPresident Bush is retired from politics,\u201d McGrath wrote in an email then. \u201cHe came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule. \u201d Former President George W. Bush, Mr. Bush\u2019s oldest son, was also not planning on making a public endorsement, his aide Freddy Ford said at the time. Neither of the former presidents attended the Republican convention, though the younger Mr. Bush has campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates for Senate, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Many influential Republicans, including various members of both Bush administrations, have said they will not vote for the party\u2019s nominee, Donald J. Trump. In June, Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary under George W. Bush, wrote an   article announcing that he would be casting a vote for Mrs. Clinton, making him one of several members of the last Republican presidential administration who have said they would be voting for the Democratic candidate.'"}, "time": 1742561924.5194862}
