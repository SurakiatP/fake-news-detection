Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\u201d\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.\u201cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday.'"}, "time": 1742563676.9444084}
