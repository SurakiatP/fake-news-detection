Bourgeois Equality is McCloskey\u2019s third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with The Bourgeois Virtues (2006) and Bourgeois Dignity (2010), each published by the University of Chicago Press. This latest volume is a Big Book, alike in kind but not in theme to Jacques Barzun\u2019s From Dawn to Decadence (2000), Camille Paglia\u2019s Sexual Personae (1990), or Herald Berman\u2019s Law and Revolution (1983) and Law and Revolution II (2006). It\u2019s meandering and personal, blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls Montaigne or Emerson. \\nMcCloskey\u2019s elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice. At times humorous, rambling, and deliberately erratic, she gives the distinct impression that she\u2019s simply telling a story, one that happens to validate a thesis. She\u2019s having fun. Imagine Phillip Lopate articulating economic history. McCloskey is, in this regard, a latter-day Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona that\u2019s currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that she\u2019s more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. \\nMcCloskey\u2019s elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice.

McCloskey is, in this regard, a latter-day Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona that\u2019s currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that she\u2019s more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. \\nWriting with an air of confidence, McCloskey submits, contra Thomas Piketty, that ideas and ideology \u2014 not capital accumulation or material resources \u2014 have caused widespread economic development. Since 1800, worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated; the quality of life in poor countries has risen \u2014 even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries \u2014and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food, goods, services, medicine, and healthcare that, in earlier centuries, were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe. The transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus. The rhetorical-ethical change involved people\u2019s \u201cattitudes toward other humans\u201d (p. xxiii), namely, the recognition of shared experience and \u201csympathy,\u201d as Adam Smith stated in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Attributing human progress to ideas enables McCloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement (e.g., class mobility and fluidity) while generating extensive prosperity. Thus, her project is at once scholarly and tendentious: a study of the conditions and principles that, in turn, she promotes. \\nShe argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas \u2014 such as \u201chuman equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem\u201d (p. xxix) \u2014 that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics. \u201cNot matter, mainly, but ideas\u201d caused the Great Enrichment (p. 643). In other words, \u201c[t]he original and sustaining causes of the modern world [\u2026] were ethical, not material,\u201d and they included \u201cthe new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them\u201d (p. xxxi). This thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive. McCloskey has a habit of reminding readers\u2014in case you missed her point the first, second, or fifty-seventh time around\u2014that the causes of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Enrichment were ideas, not \u201cnarrowly economic or political or legal changes\u201d (p. 470). She maintains, to this end, that the Scottish Enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equality\u2014not equality of outcomes, of course, but of opportunity and treatment under the law. And the Scottish model, to her mind, stands in contradistinction to the French example of centralized, top-down codification, command, planning, and design. \\nA perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history: the \u201cclerisy,\u201d which is an \u201cappendage of the bourgeoisie\u201d (p. 597) and often dubbed \u201cthe elite\u201d in regular parlance. McCloskey calls the clerisy \u201cthe sons of bourgeois fathers\u201d (p. xvii) and \u201cneo-aristocratic\u201d (p. 440). The clerisy includes those \u201cartists, intellectuals, journalists, professionals, and bureaucrats\u201d who resent \u201cthe commercial and bettering bourgeoisie\u201d (p. xvi). The clerisy seeks, in different ways at different times, to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive, illiberal, irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers. \u201cEarly on,\u201d says McCloskey, referring to the period in Europe after the revolutionary year 1848, \u201cthe clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading, and so require expert protection and supervision\u201d (p. 609). The clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority. \\nBecause the clerisy is shape-shifting, assuming various forms from time to time and place to place, it\u2019s a tough concept to pin down. The word \u201cclerisy\u201d does not appear in the book\u2019s index to permit further scrutiny. By contrast, McCloskey\u2019s general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles; subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions. \\nIn a massive tour de force such as this, readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims. Historians will find McCloskey\u2019s summaries to be too breezy. Even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys. My complaints are few but severe. For instance, McCloskey is, I believe, either careless or mistaken to announce that, during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, \u201cunder the influence of a version of science,\u201d in a territory that\u2019s never specifically identified, \u201cthe right seized upon social Darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people, and to elevate the nation\u2019s mission above the mere individual person, recommending, for example, colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war\u201d (p. xviii). \\nLet\u2019s hope that it\u2019s innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd, unqualified, categorical assertion. Adam Cohen\u2019s Imbeciles (2016) and Thomas C. Leonard\u2019s Illiberal Reformers (2016) describe how, in the United States, social Darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily, though not exclusively, by the Left, not the Right. These recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject: Thomas M. Shapiro\u2019s Population Control Politics (1985), Philip R. Reilly\u2019s The Surgical Solution (1991), Joel Braslow\u2019s Mental Ills and Bodily Cures (1997), Wendy Kline\u2019s Building a Better Race (2001), Stefan Kuhl\u2019s The Nazi Connection (2002), Nancy Ordover\u2019s American Eugenics (2003), Christine Rosen\u2019s Preaching Eugenics (2004), Christina Cogdell\u2019s Eugenic Design (2004), Gregory Michael Dorr\u2019s Segregation\u2019s Science (2008), Paul A. Lombardo\u2019s edition A Century of Eugenics in America (2011), and Alexander Minna Stern\u2019s Eugenic Nation (2016). These represent only a small sampling. \\nIs McCloskey unware of these texts? Probably not: she reviewed Leonard\u2019s book for Reason, although she did so after her own book reached press. At any rate, would she have us believe that Emma Goldman, George Bernard Shaw, Eugene Debs, Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, John Maynard Keynes, Lester Ward, and W. E. B. Du Bois were eugenicist agitators for the political Right? If so, she should supply her definition of \u201cRight,\u201d since it would go against commonly accepted meanings. On the matter of colonialism and war, self-identified members of the Old Right such as Albert Jay Nock, John Flynn, and Senator Robert Taft advocated precisely the opposite of what McCloskey characterizes as \u201cRight.\u201d These men opposed, among other things, military interventionism and adventurism. The trouble is that McCloskey\u2019s muddying of the signifiers \u201cLeft\u201d and \u201cRight\u201d comes so early in the book\u2014in the \u201cExordium\u201d\u2014 that readers may lose trust in her, question her credibility, and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters. \\nOther undefined terms only make matters worse, ensuring that McCloskey will alienate many academics, who, as a class, are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises. She throws around the term \u201cRomanticism\u201d as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested: \u201ca conservative and Romantic vision\u201d (p. xviii); \u201cscience fiction and horror fiction [are] \u2026 offshoots of Romanticism\u201d (p. 30); \u201c[Jane Austen] is not a Romantic novelist \u2026 [because] [s]he does not take Art as a model for life, and does not elevate the Artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism, or worship of the Middle Ages, or adopt any of the other, antibourgeois themes of Novalis, [Franz] Brentano, Sir Walter Scott, and later Romantics\u201d (p. 170); \u201cRomanticism around 1800 revived talk of hope and faith and a love for Art or Nature or the Revolution as a necessary transcendent in people\u2019s lives\u201d (p. 171); \u201cRomantic candor\u201d (p. 242); \u201cthe late eighteenth-century Romantic literary critics in England had no idea what John Milton was on about [sic], because they had set aside the rigorously Calvinist theology that structured his poetry\u201d (p. 334); \u201cthe nationalist tradition of Romantic writing of history\u201d (p. 353); \u201cRomantic \u2026 hostilities to \u2026 democratic rhetoric\u201d (p. 510); \u201c[i]n the eighteenth century \u2026 the idea of autonomy triumphed, at any rate among the progressive clerisy, and then became a leading Romantic idea, \u00e1 la Victor Hugo\u201d (p. 636); and \u201cthe Romantic conservative Thomas Carlyle\u201d (p. 643). \\nTo allege that the clerisy was \u201cthrilled by the Romantic radicalism of books like Mein Kampf or What Is to Be Done\u201d (p. xviii) is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of, say, Keats or Coleridge or Wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of Hitler and Lenin. McCloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing German idealism or contextualizing Hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition. Her loose language will leave some experts (I do not profess to be one) scratching or shaking their heads and, more problematic, some non-experts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity. One imagines the overeager and well-meaning undergraduate, having read Bourgeois Equality, setting out to demonize William Blake or destroy the reputation of Percy Shelly, about whom Paul Cantor has written judiciously.2 Wouldn\u2019t originality, imagination, creativity, and individualism\u2014widely accepted markers of Romanticism\u2014appeal to McCloskey? Yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of Romanticism\u2014which she portrays as a fixed, monolithic, self-evident thing\u2014undermines aspects of that fluctuating movement, period, style, culture, and attitude that are, or seem to be, consistent with her Weltanschauung. \\nBut I protest too much. These complaints should not diminish what McCloskey has accomplished. Would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures, communities, and eras. McCloskey takes the long view, as we all should. Her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if, given the technological advances we have made, the \u201cwork we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree, changing minds, and less and less about implementation by hand\u201d (p. 498). Equally significant is her embrace of humanomics\u2014defined as \u201cthe story [of] a complete human being, with her ethics and language and upbringing\u201d (p. xx)\u2014which materializes in casual references to Henrik Ibsen\u2019s plays, challenges to the depiction of John Milton \u201cas a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens\u201d (p. 393), analyses of Jane Austen\u2019s novels, and portrayals of Elizabethan England. Her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment, with all of its troubles and possibilities. \\nBest of all, her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action. \u201cLet us, then,\u201d she says at one point, \u201cnot reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism, the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the French Enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the German Romantic movement, fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy. As rational optimists, let us celebrate the Great Enrichment, and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it\u201d (p. 146). At another point she encourages her audience to guard against \u201cboth cynicism and utopianism\u201d (p. 540), and elsewhere to heed \u201ctrade-tested cooperation, competition, and conservation in the right mix\u201d (p. 523). These little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors, as it were, and demonstrate that she is not attempting\u2014as is the academic wont\u2014to hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities. \\nPoverty is relative and, hence, permanent and ineradicable, despite McCloskey\u2019s claim that we can \u201cend poverty\u201d (p. 8). If, tomorrow, we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfold\u2014even fiftyfold\u2014there would still be people at the bottom. The quality of life at the bottom, however, would be vastly improved. The current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries. McCloskey is right: We should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing, that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution. Hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments. Hence we should welcome and produce more books like McCloskey\u2019s that undertake a \u201crhetorical-ethical Revaluation\u201d to both examine and celebrate \u201ca society of open inquiry,\u201d one which not only \u201cdepends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy,\u201d but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom (p. 650). In McCloskey\u2019s approach, economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are mutually illuminating and, in fact, indispensably and inextricably tied. An economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace. All economics is, at its core, humanomics. We could do without the latter term if we understood the former. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
