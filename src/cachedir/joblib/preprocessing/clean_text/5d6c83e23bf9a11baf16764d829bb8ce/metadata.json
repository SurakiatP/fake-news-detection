Here\u2019s the latest. 1. \u201cShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u201d More than 46 million Britons have registered to vote  in Thursday\u2019s referendum, and polls show a statistical dead heat. Proponents and opponents frantically campaigned for a final day. Twitter users tried to lighten the bitter debate, posting photos of their pets as #CatsAgainstBrexit, #DogsForBrexit and the like (even a few hamsters). _____ 2. Dozens of Democratic representatives staged a   on the House floor to demand that the Republican majority hold a vote on a   measure before a weeklong recess begins Friday. The Republican House leaders halted the session, cutting off the   broadcast of the Democratic protest. _____ 3. Donald Trump tried to refocus his campaign after a rough few days. He made his most sustained attack on Hillary Clinton, calling her \u201ca   liar\u201d in a speech that included many inaccurate and misleading statements. Mrs. Clinton, who on Tuesday criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s business and economic ideas, laid out her vision for the U. S. economy. And the Libertarian Party\u2019s candidates, former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, held a town hall tonight. _____ 4. Wildfires burned in at least eight Western states and Alaska, with 31 clustered in a swath of Arizona and New Mexico blistered by a heat wave. Above, Los Angeles clouded in smoke. The Midwest braced for severe thunderstorms that could push across to the Eastern Seaboard. _____ 5. Sunday will see the formal opening of a new set of locks meant to ensure that the historic Panama Canal can handle the new, giant ships crucial to a hyperglobalized world of trade. But our investigation  \u2014   interviews with contractors, canal workers, maritime experts and diplomats, and reviews of public and internal records  \u2014   reveals construction flaws that leave the $3 billion project\u2019s safety and economic viability in doubt. _____ 6. The golfer Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Rio Olympics because of concerns about the Zika virus, a   loss that may encourage more athletes to skip the Games. The event, set for August, has been diminished by the banning of Russia\u2019s track and field team and Bulgaria\u2019s   over doping. It has also been plagued by construction, pollution and national economic troubles in Brazil. _____ 7. One of the world\u2019s longest conflicts appears to be nearing an end after more than 50 years. The Colombian government and FARC rebels said they had agreed to a   at talks in Havana and would hold a ceremony on Thursday. Peace is \u201cnot an illusion now, it\u2019s a promise,\u201d the rebels tweeted. _____ 8. A woman close to Prince described for the first time publicly what happened the night he blacked out on a private jet, just days before his fatal overdose. The singer Judith Hill, who was on the plane, said she raised an alarm after \u201chis eyes fixed\u201d and he became unconscious, forcing an emergency landing, treatment with an opioid blocker and hospitalization. She said he promised her that he would get help: \u201cThat\u2019s the part that breaks my heart, because he was trying. \u201d _____ 9. Scientists reported an unnerving discovery: three species of clam that suffered from contagious cancer. The worry isn\u2019t that they could infect humans  \u2014   rather, that infectious cancers may be more widespread than previously understood. _____ 10. Discussions of   measures proliferated a day after a   visitor to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page noticed that a photo showed his computer camera and microphone jack covered with tape. Security experts say those are sensible precautions everyone should consider, to prevent a takeover by a kind of malware called a   trojan  \u2014   \u201cratting\u201d for short. _____ 11. \u201ci nvr felt this dark. \u201d One of our most riveting stories today retraces the steps of a    athlete from Columbus, Ohio, who committed suicide. A dedicated wrestler and football player proud of his tolerance for pain, Kosta Karageorge sustained at least 15 concussions. Tormented by erratic thoughts and excruciating headaches, he climbed into a garbage Dumpster and shot himself. _____ 12. Finally, more than a million fans flooded the streets of Cleveland to celebrate the Cavaliers\u2019 N. B. A. title. Some slept on the streets overnight to get a good spot for the parade, which lasted more than four joyous hours. \u201cI\u2019m nothing without you all,\u201d LeBron James said to crowds. \u201cGet ready for next year. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
