Accordingly, The Sacremento Bee reports that Harris has been making a full-court press for the Latino vote in the final days of the election. \\nThe Bee reports that Harris\u2019 comment was not a one-off pronouncement, but has become a standard campaign line. Harris is also citing her work defending sanctuary cities and her work \u201corganizing legal services for unaccompanied minors during the Central American refugee crises.\u201d \\nThe Left has been working feverishly for years to make the public believe that illegally entering this country isn\u2019t a crime, hence the word \u201cundocumented.\u201d \\nLiberals love to use the word \u201cundocumented\u201d instead of the correct word, \u201cillegal.\u201d But someone that doesn\u2019t go through the legal system to immigrate to this country isn\u2019t simply \u201cundocumented,\u201d they are a criminal. \\nUsing the term \u201cundocumented\u201d makes it seem as if it\u2019s just a simple oversight and not criminal activity. That argument wouldn\u2019t fly if you didn\u2019t file your taxes, and it shouldn\u2019t fly here either. \\nI doubt it would go over too well if someone who didn\u2019t file their taxes for years claimed that they weren\u2019t tax evaders, but simply \u201cundocumented tax filers.\u201d \\nThere\u2019s another claim also made by the anti-rule of law folks. Illegal immigrants can\u2019t be held responsible because the system is super hard! \\nWell guess what, the tax system is all kinds of messed up, takes far too much money from Americans, and is extremely complicated \u2014 so can you use that same excuse applied to illegal immigrants for why you didn\u2019t file your taxes? \\nNope, legal Americans are held to a different standard. We\u2019re expected to pay for people who break our laws to come here and get welfare, food stamps, social security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc. \\nWe need the rule of law restored in this country, and we need a president that is going to put the interests of American citizens first. That\u2019s precisely what Donald Trump has proposed to do \u2014 and is the opposite of what Hillary Clinton has proposed. \\nLet\u2019s hope that Americans see that on Nov. 8.'"}, "time": 1742628425.1804218}
