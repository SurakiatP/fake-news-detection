He has torn various ligaments in his thumbs and has broken bones in his fingers. He has worn casts and splints. His hands, though, are the indispensable tools of his trade, no matter how gruesome they look. \u201cI\u2019ve got the worst fingers,\u201d he said. Paul, the starting point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers, long ago established himself as one of the N. B. A. \u2019s premier defenders. He has collected more steals than any other active player in the league: 1, 892 and counting. A     he clutters passing lanes. He strips dribbles like paint thinner. Doc Rivers, his coach, has concluded that Paul has the best hands he has ever seen. \u201cGifted,\u201d Rivers said during an interview in January. \u201cHis hands are so damn quick. \u201d Three days after Rivers offered this assessment, Paul paid the price for possessing such gifts. In a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he jammed his left thumb fighting through a screen, tearing his ulnar collateral ligament  \u2014   not to be confused with his radial collateral ligament, the one he tore on his right thumb training for the Olympics in 2012. Few people on the planet have firsthand knowledge of the difference between R. C. L. and U. C. L. tears. Paul is one of them. (They both hurt, he said.) As for his most recent injury, Paul missed 14 games before he returned late last month. Even now, with the Clippers vying for playoff position, he is trying to regain his feel for the game. \u201cI see plays all the time where I know I can reach for the ball and I know I can steal it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like risk versus reward: Do I go for it?\u201d Such is life for Paul, who cannot help putting his hands in harm\u2019s way. He tore ligaments in his right middle finger in March 2010. He fractured his left index finger in October 2015. He broke his right hand last April, and he continues to play with 16 pins and a metal plate embedded in his palm. He shoots with that hand. In the process, he has become something of an expert on hands for colleagues. After J. R. Smith of the Cleveland Cavaliers fractured his right thumb in December, Paul called him to offer tips on his rehabilitation. Whenever Paul himself jams a thumb or sprains a finger, the first person he usually hears from is Matt Barnes, a former teammate who now plays for the Golden State Warriors. \u201cBecause he gets his fingers hit all the time,\u201d said Paul, who is averaging 17. 6 points, 9. 2 assists and 1. 9 steals a game. \u201cHe understands. \u201d The challenge for Paul is that he relies on his hands. He is not, by his own admission, one of the league\u2019s most awesome physical specimens. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. He is not particularly fast and does not jump especially high. But he has exceptional reflexes and a knack for anticipating plays. \u201cHe could have been a boxer,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he could have taken a punch, but he could have landed some for sure. \u201d Growing up in North Carolina, Paul worked to develop hand speed and coordination. He was almost never without a ball, he said. He also watched the game constantly, studying how other players dribbled and passed, and all the angles they used to create space. He determined that there were a finite number of possibilities. \u201cNot being the most athletic player,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve always had to understand where you\u2019re going with the ball. \u201d He recorded his first N. B. A. steal before he scored his first N. B. A. points, intercepting an errant pass before racing away for a layup. His professional career was less than four minutes old. In 2008, he set an N. B. A. record by going 108 straight games with at least one steal. \u201cI think that one\u2019s going to be hard to break,\u201d he said. Jamal Crawford, his teammate, said that Paul had an encyclopedic knowledge of his opponents thanks to his experience and his tireless analysis of game film. \u201cHe\u2019s ahead of the play,\u201d Crawford said. Metta World Peace, a veteran forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and a former defensive player of the year, cited Paul\u2019s \u201chunger. \u201d Few players, for example, are more skilled at recovering the ball if it happens to get stolen away. \u201cOh, I\u2019m getting it back,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI want it. I want it. \u201d But Paul said that no one had better hands than Brevin Knight, a point guard who retired in 2009 and now works as an analyst for the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 television broadcasts. As a kid, Knight knew that the only way he was going to earn his way onto the prime playground courts near his home in East Orange, N. J. was by playing great defense. \u201cBeing smaller, you have to figure out a way for people to want to pick you so you\u2019re not just sitting there on the side watching,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt stuck with me from there. \u201d Knight described himself as a \u201ctendency person. \u201d He could study an opponent for two possessions, he said, and get a feel for what that player liked to do with the ball. Paul is the same way. \u201cHe has the ability to look as though the he is not engaged defensively, but he\u2019s really there,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIt\u2019s his way of luring the offensive guy into thinking, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got an easy move here.\u2019 \u201d In retirement, Knight has found that his good hands  \u2014   along with excellent peripheral vision  \u2014   are still useful when he broadcasts games. Occasionally, he said, a loose ball will rocket toward the courtside table where he and Pete Pranica, the Grizzlies\u2019    voice, are calling the action. Knight tries to save Pranica first, he said, and the courtside monitor second. \u201cBecause these teams have enough money,\u201d Knight said, \u201cthey can replace a monitor. \u201d Rivers knows about defense, too. During his   playing career, he came away with 1, 563 steals and the mangled instruments of his profession. \u201cI mean, honestly, look at my fingers,\u201d said Rivers, who stretched his hands before him and stared at them as if they had been assembled by Picasso. Rivers was constantly putting his hands in danger. He described himself as a \u201creacher. \u201d He reached for loose balls. He reached for deflections. And he reached into the midsections of opposing point guards, committing an average of one foul for every nine minutes of playing time. Paul, on the other hand, goes about 14 minutes between fouls. \u201cI\u2019m amazed how clean he gets steals in traffic,\u201d Rivers said. Not that he is immune from workplace hazards. One of Paul\u2019s more devastating injuries occurred last April, against the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs. As Portland\u2019s Gerald Henderson drove for a layup, Paul used his left hand to strip the ball away from Henderson. The problem was that Paul entangled his right hand in the back of Henderson\u2019s jersey. He led a fast break in the other direction, but the damage was done: He had broken the third metacarpal in his right palm. The Clippers lost the next two games and the series without him. \u201cRight when he did it, you could see me react on the sideline,\u201d said Rivers, who did not react well. \u201cI knew what it was. Because I had done the exact same thing when I was playing. \u201d This season has been another exercise in perseverance for Paul, who sprained his left thumb at a preseason practice, which was bad enough. Then, in January, he tried to squeeze past that screen against Oklahoma City  \u2014   a collision made worse by the Thunder\u2019s Russell Westbrook, who tried to draw a foul by jumping into Paul. \u201cI tried to shake it out because I\u2019ve jammed my thumb a thousand times,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI thought it would calm down. But I could see how swollen it was. I said: \u2018I tore it. I know I did.\u2019 \u201d After spending several weeks squeezing a tiny rubber ball to rebuild the strength in his thumb, Paul has since returned to the court. He would like to stay there. \u201cJust trying to keep my hands out of the way,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562903.4156976}
