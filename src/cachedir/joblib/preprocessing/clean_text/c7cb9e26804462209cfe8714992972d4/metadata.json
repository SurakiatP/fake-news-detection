The man, Charles Kinsey, 47, who identified himself as a caretaker of the patient, was on a city street with the patient when officers arrived, a lawyer for Mr. Kinsey said. When the officers drew their weapons, Mr. Kinsey told them there was no need for firearms, lay down in the middle of the street and tried to explain what had happened, the lawyer said.

But then an officer opened fire, striking Mr. Kinsey in the leg. The North Miami police did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment on Thursday. The North Miami police chief, Gary Eugene, who held a news conference on Thursday, said an investigation would be led by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Chief Eugene said, \u201cThe law requires us to gather every fact and resolve every question. \u201d No gun was recovered at the scene, he added. On Friday, North Miami leaders identified the officer as Jonathan Aledda, a member of the SWAT team, and said he had been placed on administrative leave without pay, according to The Miami Herald.

Seated next to him on a street is another man, who Mr. Kinsey says is the patient he was trying to help.

Clint Bower, the president and chief executive of MACtown Inc. where Mr. Kinsey works, expressed frustration at how the police responded, but praised Mr. Kinsey for his actions. \u201cNeedless to say, after viewing the video, my employee Charles Kinsey, behavioral support professional, is a hero. He saved the    young man with autism from being shot,\u201d Mr. Bower said in an email on Wednesday. \u201cHe put his own life at risk, which is evident in the video. \u201d Mr. Napoleon said he met with city officials on Wednesday and had discussed the possibility of a settlement. Whatever the resolution, he said, the city should start by censuring the officer. \u201cThe best thing that the City of North Miami can do is come out and condemn the officer,\u201d he said. . In a statement on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said: \u201cWe have to stem the tide of violence, both nationwide and here in Florida. It starts with holding people accountable for their actions. There must be a thorough and independent investigation into this shooting that covers both whether officers violated internal use of deadly force policies and whether criminal charges should be brought. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561702.3248382}
