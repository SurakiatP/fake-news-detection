He notes: \\nMore than 1,000 pages of emails recovered from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server by the FBI during the bureau\u2019s probe into her handling of classified information was released by the State Department Thursday afternoon, five days before the presidential election. \\nThe State Department noted that the majority of these emails , released in response to a VICE News Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, are \u201cnear duplicates\u201d of emails Clinton\u2019s attorneys turned over to State in December 2014. \\nBut there were also emails never before released. Perhaps the most notable revealed discussions about how hard the State Department should push to pursue Julian Assange after his organization, WikiLeaks, released tens of thousands of State Department cables. \\n\u201cWe view this not as a \u2018clever game\u2019 of wiki leaks [sic] but rather as a \u2018criminal act\u2019 against the United States of America,\u201d Abedin wrote in a previously unreleased Dec. 2, 2010, email to Clinton that laid out a way to respond to the leak. \u201cHe might think this is a clever game today, but when he is prosecuted and if convicted he will move from being a clever cyber thief to a convicted criminal and -will find out that\u2019s a whole different kind of game.\u201d \\nWell then.'"}, "time": 1742561862.7536702}
