There were more than 600 direct rape threats, she said. \\nHampstead and Kilburn MP, Tulip Siddiq, said she too received regular online abuse including threats on her life. \\nOne-time Labour leadership hopeful Angela Eagle was the target of homophobic abuse after challenging Jeremy Corbyn earlier this year. Her Wallasey constituency office was also vandalized when someone threw a brick through a window. \\nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron was once accused of sexist behavior towards Eagle after he told her to \u201ccalm down, dear\u201d during a Commons debate. \\n\u201cIf a woman speaks loudly in parliament, she is \u2018shushed\u2019 with a finger to the mouth. That never happens when a man speaks loudly,\u201d a European parliamentarian interviewed by the IPU said. \\nRead more \\nThe IPU study also showed that more than one in five of all politicians quizzed has experienced sexual violence during their term, and one in three had witnessed attacks on colleagues in parliament. \\nAlmost 80 percent said they had been psychologically abused, causing them to suffer panic attacks or permanent trauma. \\nAccording to the IPU report, female politicians \u201csaid they must constantly deal with old-school thinking about their appearance, how they express themselves and behave, and the role they should play.\u201d \\n\u201cMore generally, their excessively or insufficiently feminine demeanour is a subject of regular and widespread comment, attacks and derision. The same is true of their conjugal status, emotional, sexual and family life, imagined or real,\u201d it added. \\nDespite this, the majority of women surveyed said the abuse would not stop them from running for another term in office. \\n\u201cParliaments need to put their own house in order if they want to lead by example and stop discrimination and violence against women in all walks of life,\u201d said Chungong. \\n\u201cThe effectiveness of parliaments, progress toward equality between men and women and the vitality of democracy itself all depend on it. \\n\u201cThe parliamentary community must speak out against sexism and harassment, and make clear that it cannot be tolerated as the price to be paid for women\u2019s political involvement.\u201d \\nVia RT .
