C.  \u2014   A rested Hillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail here on Thursday after three days of recovering at home from pneumonia, and vowed a different approach on the final stretch of the campaign, one more focused on her own positive vision for the country, rather than eviscerating her rival. \u201cI want to close my campaign focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said after her first rally of her renewed campaign. \u201cI want to give Americans something to vote for, not just against. \u201d The shift in tone felt striking after Mrs. Clinton had spent months tearing down her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump. But with less than eight weeks until Election Day and tightening polls showing a majority of voters dislike and distrust her, aides said it was imperative that Mrs. Clinton deliver a more uplifting message. \u201cFrom now until Nov. 8, everywhere I go I\u2019m going to talk about my ideas for our country,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. Next week, Mrs. Clinton plans speeches to discuss how she would help young people and improve the economy, weaving in her own background as an advocate for children and as a first lady focused on women and families. That focus was central in her address here at the University of North Carolina, where she took the stage to James Brown\u2019s \u201cI Got You (I Feel Good),\u201d seeming rested and revived, eager to tell the audience that her rare couple of days of downtime allowed her to \u201creconnect with what this whole campaign is about. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m running for all mothers and fathers trying to stay healthy so they can be there for their kids, but perhaps most of all, I\u2019m running for those kids,\u201d she said. \u201cStanding up for children has been the work of my life, as a lawyer for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, as first lady of Arkansas, in the White House. \u201d With just 54 days until the election, \u201csitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be,\u201d she said. But she called the time off \u201ca gift. \u201d Her return to the campaign trail comes as a series of polls suggest a closer race. Mrs. Clinton has faced a more disciplined Mr. Trump and scrutiny over her failure to initially disclose her pneumonia to all but a few close aides. A New York   News poll released on Thursday found her virtually tied with Mr. Trump among likely voters. Asked about the narrowing gap with Mr. Trump on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019ve always said this is going to be a tight race. \u201d On her campaign plane earlier Thursday, a   Mrs. Clinton said she felt fully recovered. \u201cI am doing great,\u201d she said before takeoff in White Plains, N. Y. as she made her way down the aisle. Mrs. Clinton flashed a wide smile at journalists studying her for signs of fatigue or illness and said she was looking forward to getting back into action. And at her rally later, she reflected on her time recuperating. \u201cI talked with some old friends,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent time with our very sweet dogs. The campaign trail doesn\u2019t really encourage reflection, and it\u2019s important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. \u201d \u201cPeople like me, we\u2019re lucky,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I\u2019m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can\u2019t. \u201d Mrs. Clinton offered a rare public glimpse at her   humor, poking fun at herself for her plans that span \u201c38 different policy areas. \u201d She said, \u201cLike a lot of women, I have a tendency to overprepare. \u201d Mrs. Clinton did not entirely avoid criticizing Mr. Trump, telling reporters after the event, \u201cWe don\u2019t need someone who rushes out a   plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. \u201d It was a reference to the child care proposals that Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka unveiled this week. The Clinton campaign\u2019s efforts to put forth a kinder, gentler candidate began last week with a speech that Mrs. Clinton delivered in Kansas City, Mo. on her Methodist faith. But the change in tactics hit an unexpected snag on Sunday when Mrs. Clinton abruptly left a ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Amid intense scrutiny over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lack of transparency over her initial diagnosis, her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, later disclosed that Mrs. Clinton had been told she had pneumonia last Friday and that she had been overheated and dehydrated on Sunday. Rather than making her case to the American people, Mrs. Clinton found herself recovering at home as her campaign confronted a series of distractions and dueling doctors\u2019 notes from her and Mr. Trump. And she had to apologize on Saturday after a backlash over remarks she made at a Friday night   in Manhattan in which she said that half of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters fell into a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d  \u2014   bigots, essentially, of one sort or the other. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton, when pressed about her handling of her diagnosis, appeared eager to put the rough patch behind her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stop,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to quit campaigning. I certainly didn\u2019t want to miss the   memorial. \u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I got the antibiotics up and going, got the rest I needed and we\u2019re going on from there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561920.292039}
