Caught in the middle is Donald J. Trump, who claims \u201ctremendous support, tremendous friendship\u201d from gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people, and has gone further than most party figures to embrace them. Gays, in fact, are one of the few minority groups Mr. Trump has not singled out for criticism. But as the presumptive Republican nominee, he is also trying to assuage doubts about the convictions of his conservatism. The uncomfortable dynamic Mr. Trump has created for himself is perhaps best illustrated by his own calendar. He huddled last month at a Manhattan hotel with hundreds of religious conservatives, many of them  \u2014   like James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council  \u2014   outspoken opponents of new legal protections for gay and transgender people. A few days later, he took what an aide described as a friendly and supportive call from Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic decathlete who came out as transgender last year. One of the most contentious issues confronting delegates when they meet on Monday to debate the platform will be whether to adopt a provision defending state laws that try to prevent transgender people from using the public restroom of their choice. At times Mr. Trump has criticized those laws. And he has said Ms. Jenner can use whatever bathroom she prefers at his properties. But he has also promised not to interfere with the platform, which serves as the party\u2019s official declaration of principles. Even as Mr. Trump keeps his distance from the debate, other Republicans who share his more accepting view of gay and transgender issues are working aggressively to tone down some of the platform\u2019s language. The existing platform, adopted in 2012, is replete with disapproval of homosexuality. It calls court decisions favoring   marriage \u201can assault on the foundations of our society\u201d and accuses the Obama administration of trying to impose \u201cthe homosexual rights agenda\u201d on foreign countries. Paul E. Singer, a billionaire Republican who has financed gay rights battles across the country, is now funding an effort to write into the platform language more inclusive of gays, lesbians and transgender people. The goal of his group, the American Unity Fund, is not to get the party to endorse   marriage but to add a more   statement that commits the party \u201cto respect for all families,\u201d though there is still fierce resistance from the right. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to say we\u2019re tolerant because we are tolerant of other views,\u201d said James Bopp Jr. a member of the platform committee from Indiana who has long supported efforts to make the platform more strongly in favor of traditional marriage. Such language promoting tolerance, he added, would be \u201credundant and superfluous. \u201d Advisers for the American Unity Fund, who say they know they are fighting a steep uphill battle, argue that the Republican Party can no longer afford to alienate people on gay rights issues. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make room for people with diverse views on civil marriage,\u201d said Tyler Deaton, the group\u2019s senior adviser. \u201cThis platform doesn\u2019t even make room for people who support civil unions or domestic partnerships or people who support basic legal equality. \u201d Both parties adopt new platforms at their conventions every four years. A draft of the 2016 version has been put together over the last several weeks by the Republican National Committee, with help from conservative activists. Members of the platform committee received the draft on Sunday evening and will add or change certain provisions over the next two days. The draft circulating Sunday night condemned the Obama administration\u2019s effort to deny funding to states that prohibit transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, accusing the administration of trying to impose a cultural revolution. \u201cThey are determined to reshape our schools  \u2014   and our entire society  \u2014   to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America\u2019s history,\u201d the draft reads. Another section criticizes those who boycott businesses that deny services to   couples. Though he will almost certainly not mention it when he accepts the nomination next week, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions and words on gay rights have been more supportive than those of any Republican presidential nominee, even if they fall short of the full social and legal acceptance that his expected opponent, Hillary Clinton, has promoted. He has boasted of his friendships with many gay people, saying \u201cI have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay. \u201d He has supported AIDS charities for years, and welcomed gay couples at his Palm Beach club when doing so was considered remarkable. And he has recently started insisting that he would be a better friend to the gay community than Mrs. Clinton, even though he opposes legal rights like marriage. But as he tries to convince social conservatives that he is not acting as a moderate, Mr. Trump has been largely   with the platform. \u201cHis guys have not shown up and said, \u2018Change this, change that,\u2019\u201d David Barton, a platform committee member from Texas, said. The Republican platform committee has long been dominated by some of the party\u2019s most stalwart activists. And some of them have hardly been shy about their views. There is Cynthia Dunbar of Virginia, who has compared the gay rights movement to Nazism. Hardy Billington, a committee member from Missouri,  placed an ad in a local paper asserting that homosexuality kills people at two to three times the rate of smoking. And Mary Frances Forrester of North Carolina has claimed that the \u201chomosexual agenda is trying to change the course of Western civilization. \u201d Mr. Bopp of Indiana recently wrote to delegates to say that the Republican Party has always opposed threats to traditional marriage \u201cbeginning with our opposition to the \u2018twin relics of barbarism\u2019 of slavery and polygamy in our 1856 platform. \u201d As dominant as those conservative voices have been, delegates who want to see a more inclusive platform are gaining seats on the committee. Many of them believe the Republican Party needs to have a serious debate this year about whittling down a platform that has grown long and become riddled with   additions. Boyd Matheson, a   platform committee member from Utah, noted that at 33, 000 words, the 2012 platform was \u201csix or seven times longer than the Constitution. \u201d Recent platforms have become, he said, \u201cthese laundry lists and litmus tests of \u2018thou shalts\u2019 and \u2018thou shalt nots. \u2019\u201d The party\u2019s first platform in 1856 was fewer than 1, 000 words. As an alternative this year, Mr. Matheson proposed a   document that he said adheres to the founding principles of the party, like equal rights and economic opportunity. It contains no mention of   marriage or transgender issues. \u201cThat does not elevate the discussion we need,\u201d Mr. Matheson said. It is not the discussion Mr. Trump is eager to have, either. Asked in a recent interview about the platform, he declined to comment, saying only that he was \u201clooking at it. \u201d But as a reminder of how unorthodox a Republican Mr. Trump is  \u2014   and of how contrary many of his views on issues like trade, foreign policy, eminent domain and gay rights are to the party\u2019s doctrine  \u2014   there is no more vivid example than the platform. \u201cThe bigger problem for Trump and the Republican National Committee,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, who led Mitt Romney\u2019s platform efforts in 2012, \u201cis the fact that there are these major disagreements between where Trump is on some of these issues and where the activist base of the party is. \u201d Differences between a candidate\u2019s views and what is written in the platform are nothing new, of course. Bob Dole admitted he had not read the entire document when he was the Republican nominee in 1996. And he publicly repudiated parts of it that called for a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants. It is not clear Mr. Trump would ever go that far, given how little attention he has paid to the party\u2019s traditions and sacraments. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump really cares,\u201d Mr. Chen added.'"}, "time": 1742564212.5396028}
