Gen. John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, had dialed in from a Coast Guard plane as he headed back to Washington from Miami. Along with other top officials, he needed guidance from the White House, which had not asked his department for a legal review of the order. Halfway into the briefing, someone on the call looked up at a television in his office. \u201cThe president is signing the executive order that we\u2019re discussing,\u201d the official said, stunned. The global confusion that has since erupted is the story of a White House that rushed to enact, with little regard for basic governing, a core campaign promise that Mr. Trump made to his most fervent supporters. In his first week in office, Mr. Trump signed other executive actions with little or no legal review, but his order barring refugees has had the most explosive implications. Passengers were barred from flights to the United States, customs and border control officials got instructions at 3 a. m. Saturday and some arrived at their posts later that morning still not knowing how to carry out the president\u2019s orders. \u201cThe details of it were not thought through,\u201d said Stephen Heifetz, who served in the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, as well as the C. I. A. under the previous three presidents. \u201cIt is not surprising there was mass confusion, and I expect the confusion and chaos will continue for some time. \u201d Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, oversaw the writing of the order, which was done by a small White House team, including Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s policy chief. But it was first imagined more than a year ago, when Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican nomination, reacted to terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. by calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. \u201d In the months that followed, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tried to back away from the proposal, which was seen by Democrats as    campaign rhetoric that would never be reality. Mr. Trump offered few details as the campaign progressed, and as   he promised to protect the country from terrorists with only vague promises of \u201cextreme vetting. \u201d But Mr. Bannon, who believes in highly restrictive immigration policies and saw barring refugees as vital to shoring up Mr. Trump\u2019s political base, was determined to make it happen. He and a small group made up of the president\u2019s closest advisers began working on the order during the transition so that Mr. Trump could sign it soon after taking office. A senior administration official said that the order was drafted in cooperation with some immigration experts on Capitol Hill and members of the \u201cbeachhead teams\u201d  \u2014   small groups of political appointees sent by the new White House to be liaisons and begin work at the agencies. James Jay Carafano, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said that little of that work was shared with career officials at the Homeland Security Department, the State Department or other agencies. There was \u201ca firewall between the old administration and the incoming one,\u201d Mr. Carafano said. One reason, he said, is that when the Trump transition team asked pointed questions suggesting new policies to the career officials, those questions were swiftly leaked to the news media, generating negative stories. So the Trump team began to limit the information they discussed with officials from the previous administration. \u201cWhy share it with them?\u201d Mr. Carafano said. R. Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama, said that his staff had little communication with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, who made no mention of a bar on entry for people from certain countries. White House officials in the meantime insisted to reporters at a briefing that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers had been in contact with officials at the State and Homeland Security Departments for \u201cmany weeks. \u201d One official added, \u201cEveryone who needed to know was informed. \u201d But that apparently did not include members of the president\u2019s own cabinet. Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense, did not see a final version of the order until Friday morning, only hours before Mr. Trump arrived to sign it at the Pentagon. Mr. Mattis, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations, was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the order and was not given an opportunity to provide input while the order was being drafted. Last summer, Mr. Mattis sharply criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration as a move that was \u201ccausing us great damage right now, and it\u2019s sending shock waves through the international system. \u201d Customs and Border Protection officers were also caught unaware. They contacted several airlines late Friday that were likely to be carrying passengers from the seven countries and \u201cinstructed the airlines to offload any passport holders from those countries,\u201d said a state government official who has been briefed on the agency\u2019s actions. It was not until 3 a. m. on Saturday that customs and border officials received limited written instructions about what to do at airports and border crossings. They also struggled with how to exercise the waiver authority that was included in the executive order, which allowed the homeland security secretary to let some individuals under the ban enter the country case by case. One customs officer, who declined to be quoted by name, said he was given a limited briefing about what to do as he went to his post on Saturday morning, but even managers seemed unclear. People at the agency were blindsided, he said, and are still trying to figure things out, even as people are being stopped from coming into the United States. \u201cIf the secretary doesn\u2019t know anything, how could we possibly know anything at this level?\u201d the officer said, referring to Mr. Kelly. At the Citizenship and Immigration Service, staff members were told that the agency should stop work on any application filed by a person from any of the countries listed in the ban. Employees were told that applicants should be interviewed, but that their cases for citizenship, green cards or other immigration documents should be put on pause, pending further guidance. The timing of the executive order and the lack of advance warning had homeland security officials \u201cflying by the seat of their pants,\u201d to try to put policies in place, one official said. By Saturday, as the order stranded travelers around the world and its full impact became clear, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, became increasingly upset about how the program had been rolled out and communicated to the public. By Sunday morning, Mr. Priebus had to defend the immigration ban on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where he insisted that the executive order was rolled out smoothly. He also backpedaled on the policy and said that the executive order\u2019s restrictions on entry to the United States would not apply to legal permanent residents \u201cgoing forward. \u201d As White House officials also insisted on Sunday that the order had gone through the usual process of scrutiny and approval by the Office of Legal Counsel, the continuing confusion forced Mr. Kelly to clarify the waiver situation. He issued a statement making clear that lawful permanent residents  \u2014   those who hold valid green cards  \u2014   would be granted a waiver to enter the United States unless information suggested that they were a security threat. But senior White House officials insisted on Sunday night that the executive order would remain in force despite the change, and that they were proud of taking actions that they said would help protect Americans against threats from potential terrorists. That assertion is likely to do little to calm the public furor, which showed no signs of waning at the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s second full week in the Oval Office. Mr. Carafano said he believed that the substance of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was neither radical nor unreasonable. But he said that Mr. Trump\u2019s team could have delayed signing the order until they had better prepared the bureaucracy to carry it out. He also said the president and his team had not done a good job of communicating to the public the purpose of the executive order. \u201cIf there is a criticism of the administration, and I think there is, I think they have done a rotten job of telling their story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not like they did not know they were going to do this. To not have a cadre of people out there defending the administration  \u2014   I mean, really guys, they should have done this. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561979.6072388}
