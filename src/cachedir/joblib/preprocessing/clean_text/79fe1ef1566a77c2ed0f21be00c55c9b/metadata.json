[\u201cNo. No. Next question,\u201d he said at a joint White House press conference, in response to reports that said Comey wrote a memo alleging that he did.  In his first press conference since he fired Comey, Trump defended his decision to do so, saying he thought it would actually draw bipartisan praise.  \u201cWhen I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision. Because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey,\u201d he said.  Democrats had slammed Comey\u2019s \u201cpoor\u201d handling of the Clinton email investigation as recently as this month, but then later decried his firing as an attempt to stymie the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the elections and any collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign.  Trump said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had recommended Comey\u2019s firing due to his \u201cvery poor\u201d performance at a Senate hearing earlier this month.  \u201cThat was a poor, poor performance,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo poor, in fact, that I believe  \u2026    that\u2019s why the deputy attorney general went out and wrote his very, very strong letter. \u201d He referenced Comey\u2019s misstatement that Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin had forwarded \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner, when FBI officials said it was only a \u201chandful\u201d of emails.  \u201cI thought that was something that was terrible. We need a great director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It\u2019s special,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a director who\u2019s going to be outstanding, I\u2019ll be announcing that director very soon. And I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very, very, very thrilled. Trump also vigorously denied there has been any collusion and said he respected Rosenstein\u2019s decision to appoint Robert Mueller as a special counsel to take over the investigation.  \u201cI respect the move but the entire thing has been a witch hunt,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself and the Russians, zero. \u201d  Trump said the issue is dividing the country and he wanted to get to work running the country.  \u201cWe look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that, when we go for the jobs, when we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we\u2019ve been pushing so hard and so successfully, including health care,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe need health care. We need to cut taxes. We\u2019re going to cut taxes. If I get what I want, it\u2019ll be the biggest tax cut in the history of our nation. And that\u2019s what I want. It\u2019s going to bring back companies. It\u2019s going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies,\u201d he added.  \u201cThere was no collusion. And everybody, even my enemies, have said there is no collusion,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we want to get back and keep on the track that we\u2019re on, because the track that we\u2019re on is  . And that\u2019s what we want to do is we want to break very positive records. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742561768.5500877}
