It doesn\u2019t hurt that the jab came from the American Civil Liberties Union, because the power behind the letter is what makes it so ominous to the president-elect. \\nThe letter begins with a request for Trump to \u201cchange course\u201d on many of the claims he has made in his extremely short political career. \\n\u201cDear President-Elect Trump, \\nFor nearly 100 years, the ACLU has stood as this nation\u2019s premier defender of freedom and justice for all. \\nAs you assume the nation\u2019s highest office, we must ask you now as president-elect to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. \\nSpecifically, you promised to: amass deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants ban the entry of Muslims and institute aggressive surveillance programs targeting them restrict a woman\u2019s right to abortion services reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture change our nation\u2019s libel laws and restrict freedom of expression\u201d \\nAs if this statement alone wasn\u2019t enough of a threat, the ACLU continues: \\n\u201cThese proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed. They are unlawful and unconstitutional, and would violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, as well as other statutes and international treaties.\u201d \\n\u201cMany of our country\u2019s most cherished rights are the result of ACLU litigation and advocacy. They include the Scopes trial (the right to teach evolution in public science classrooms) and the following Supreme Court cases: Korematsu (challenging Japanese American internment); Miranda (the right to remain silent); Griswold (the right to contraception); Loving (the right of interracial couples to marry); Gideon (the right to a court-appointed attorney if you can\u2019t afford one); Windsor (striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act); and Obergefell (the right of same-sex couples to marry) and others. We have worked with and battled American presidents of both parties to ensure that our country makes good on it\u2019s founding premise as the land of the free.\u201d \\nIn the end of the open letter, the ACLU promises to make Trump\u2019s life a nightmare if he continues to pave his road to concentration camp hell. They say Trump will have the full firepower of the ACLU to deal with if he doesn\u2019t wise up. \\nThey letter concludes: \\n\u201cIf you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at your every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of supporters stand ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights.\u201d \\n\u201cOne thing is certain: We will be vigilant every day of your tenure as president. And when you ultimately vacate the Oval Office, we will do likewise with your successor.\u201d Today we published a full-page open letter in the New York Times to President-elect Trump pic.twitter.com/FOpRqn9oNY \\n\u2014 ACLU National (@ACLU) November 11, 2016 Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563332.6153288}
