The move comes at a time of widespread uncertainty about the   impact of the vote to leave the bloc, known as Brexit. It is unclear what Britain\u2019s future trading relationship will be with the European Union, and crucially, how much access London\u2019s prized financial services industry will have to the Continent. The referendum also unleashed a summer of political turmoil that led to a new government and to questions about the new leadership\u2019s economic policies. The   impact, however, has been largely negative. In the weeks since the vote, the pound has fallen sharply, and stocks in a number of sectors, including banking and construction, have been under pressure. Several real estate funds suspended withdrawals as investors tried to pull out their cash, fearing a slowdown in the British property market. Surveys in recent weeks also indicated that consumer confidence, services output and   sentiment had plummeted. The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for Britain\u2019s economy, which had been one of the region\u2019s strongest since the financial crisis. \u201cThere is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to be there when the economy really needs it  \u2014   to have an effect when the economy really needs it,\u201d Mark J. Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said at a news conference on Thursday. The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to lower its benchmark interest rate to 0. 25 percent, the lowest level in the bank\u2019s 322 years. The rate had been at 0. 5 percent since March 2009. Mr. Carney also signaled on Thursday that the committee could cut rates further this year, but he ruled out the possibility of negative interest rates. The committee\u2019s next meeting is set for November. The bank also said that it would introduce a series of additional measures to support the economy, predicting that there would be little growth in the second half of this year and that economic growth would decline sharply next year compared with its earlier forecast for 2017. \u201cThis is a timely, coherent and comprehensive package of measures,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cIt is appropriately sized given the scale of the shock, the uncertainties about the degree of the adjustment and the relatively limited data. \u201d Those measures included increasing the size of a   program, part of a policy known as quantitative easing, which is intended to cut market interest rates and stimulate the economy. The bank said on Thursday that it would buy an additional 60 billion pounds, or about $80 billion, in assets under the program, increasing the total to \u00a3435 billion. The Bank of England also said that it would buy up to \u00a310 billion in investment grade corporate bonds from nonfinancial companies. It stipulated that the bonds must be traded in pounds and that the companies must be \u201cmaking a material contribution\u201d to the British economy. The new   bond buying program is expected to begin next month. The bank will choose from a pool of about 150 companies, accounting for about \u00a3150 billion in corporate bonds, according to Minouche Shafik, the central bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking. The central bank also said it would start a program to make it easier for banks to provide lower lending rates to households and businesses, and would penalize the banks if the net level of lending fell. Mr. Carney has previously cited the continuing uncertainty as a potential drag on the economy, possibly leading to tighter financial conditions and affecting Britain\u2019s major trading partners. And in recent weeks, a series of indicators have pointed to a sharp slowdown. \u201cDemand is expected to be markedly weaker, and unemployment higher, than projected in May,\u201d Mr. Carney said on Thursday in a letter to Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer. Lucy O\u2019Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Mr. Carney was clear in his message on Thursday that monetary policy could go only so far in supporting the economy in light of the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. \u201cWhat will really count is whether the chancellor provides a fiscal boost in the autumn,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Carroll said, referring to a planned budget update this year. \u201cMonetary policy can\u2019t do much more on its own. \u201d In cutting its economic growth forecasts for the coming years, the central bank on Thursday said it expected the economy to grow at about 2 percent in 2016, but at a slower rate in the second half of the year. It projected gross domestic product would grow at 0. 8 percent in 2017, and 1. 8 percent in 2018. It had predicted the economy would expand 2. 3 percent in each of those years. It was the biggest downgrade between inflation reports since the central bank began making public forecasts in 1993. The central bank also said it believed that the annual inflation rate over the next three years would surpass its policy target of 2 percent, reaching 2. 4 percent in 2018 as a weak currency pushed up the prices of imported goods and services. The bank sees a 2 percent inflation rate as a sign of healthy economic growth.   consumer price inflation stood at 0. 5 percent in June.'"}, "time": 1742561996.7737026}
