A   father, cradling the lifeless bodies of his two children, swaddled in white blankets. But they were also familiar, a harrowing flashback to 2013, when the Syrian government unleashed the last major poison gas attack on its own people. This time, though, a new American president was seeing the pictures and absorbing the horror. Donald J. Trump has always taken pride in his readiness to act on instinct, whether in real estate or reality television. On Thursday, an emotional President Trump took the greatest risk of his young presidency, ordering a retaliatory missile strike on Syria for its latest chemical weapons attack. In a dizzying series of days, he upended a foreign policy doctrine based on putting America first and avoiding messy conflicts in distant lands. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers framed his decision in the dry language of international norms and strategic deterrence. In truth, it was an emotional act by a man suddenly aware that the world\u2019s problems were now his  \u2014   and that turning away, to him, was not an option. \u201cI will tell you,\u201d he said to reporters in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday, \u201cthat attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me  \u2014   big impact. That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I\u2019ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn\u2019t get any worse than that. \u201d Appearing again the next evening at his Florida estate,    Mr. Trump said that President Bashar   of Syria had \u201cchoked out the life of innocent men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. \u201d It was difficult to reconcile the anguished president with the snarky critic of American engagement who, from the comfort of private life, advised President Barack Obama not to strike Syria after a chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of Damascus three years ago. \u201cPresident Obama, do not attack Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter in September 2013. \u201cThere is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your \u2018powder\u2019 for another (and more important) day!\u201d And it is not easy to square Mr. Trump\u2019s empathy for the victims of a single chemical weapons attack with his refusal to take in thousands of Syrian refugees from years of strife that have turned that country into a charnel house. Relaxing that policy did not come up in the president\u2019s deliberations over striking Syria, his advisers said. As a candidate, Mr. Trump said that forcing Mr. Assad out of power was not as urgent a priority for the United States as vanquishing the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He claimed, somewhat erroneously, that he had always opposed the Iraq war. He criticized Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who was Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the election, as plunging heedlessly into foreign entanglements, drawn by misplaced idealism and the substitution of other nations\u2019 interests for America\u2019s. \u201cOne day, we\u2019re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a major foreign policy speech in April 2016. \u201cThe next day, we\u2019re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re a humanitarian nation,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut the legacy of the   interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We\u2019ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. \u201d The contrast between Mr. Trump and his predecessor could not be starker. In the early days of his presidency, Mr. Obama made the case for America\u2019s moral responsibility to intervene militarily on humanitarian grounds. \u201cInaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later,\u201d he said in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. Yet when Syria slipped into a deadly civil war, Mr. Obama focused more on the costs of intervention than the risks of inaction. Even after Mr. Assad\u2019s forces killed hundreds in a poison gas attack in August 2013, Mr. Obama did not carry out a threatened missile strike because, he said, he had not gotten Congress to sign off on it. Mr. Trump\u2019s action, only 77 days into his term, hardly settles the question of when he might intervene in future crises. He has not articulated criteria for humanitarian interventions and, even if he did, it is not clear that he would stick to his standards any more than Mr. Obama did. Firing dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles into Syria also deflects attention from Mr. Trump\u2019s lengthening list of troubles at home, from the investigation of his campaign\u2019s murky ties with Russia to his failed health care legislation. The president\u2019s advisers insisted his decision was guided by strategic considerations. They were clearly uncomfortable with the suggestion that Mr. Trump was acting impulsively. \u201cI do not view it as an emotional reaction at all,\u201d Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said. Mr. Trump had looked back on Mr. Obama\u2019s decision not to carry out a strike and decided that the United States \u201ccould not yet again turn away, turn a blind eye,\u201d Mr. Tillerson added. Mr. Tillerson and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, laid out a case that sounded eerily similar to Mr. Obama\u2019s three years earlier, when he drew his fateful \u201cred line\u201d against Mr. Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons. These weapons violated the rules of war and the Chemical Weapons Convention, they said. Allowing Syria to wield such weapons with impunity risked normalizing them and might embolden others to use them. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides described a deliberative process, with meetings of the National Security Council, presentations of military options by the Pentagon and a classified briefing for Mr. Trump held under a tent erected in    to secure the communications with Washington. They spoke of phone calls to American allies, consultations with lawmakers and the diplomatic engagement that would follow the Tomahawk cruise missiles. What is clear, however, is that Mr. Trump reacted viscerally to the images of the death of innocent children in Syria. And that reaction propelled him into a sequence of actions that will change the course of his presidency. Mr. Trump\u2019s improvisational style has sometimes seemed ill suited to the gravity of his office. In this case, it helped lead him to make the gravest decision a    can make. \u201cI now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly, I will tell you that,\u201d the president said of Syria on Wednesday. \u201cIt is now my responsibility. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562092.3955379}
