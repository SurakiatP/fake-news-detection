The US and Nato mission in Afghanistan said in a tweet: \u201cUS forces conducted strikes in Kunduz to defend friendly forces. All civilian casualty claims will be investigated.\u201d \\nBrig Gen Cleveland, a US military spokesman, said: \u201cAs part of an Afghan operation, friendly forces received direct fire and airstrikes were conducted to defend themselves. We take all allegations of civilian casualties very seriously. \\n\u201cAs this was an Afghan operation, we\u2019ll work with our partners to investigate but refer you to them for additional details in the near term. We\u2019ll provide updates as we have them.\u201d \\nA US airstrike on a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res hospital in Kunduz in October 2015 killed 42 people . \\nThe governor\u2019s spokesman put the number of killed civilians in Bouz Kandahari at 30, while Gen Qasim Jangalbagh, a police official in Kunduz province, said 26 civilians had died. \\nAccording to an internal western security report, the US-Afghan forces came under fire and were surrounded until about 6am, when they broke the siege and escaped. \\nCleveland said the US soldiers had been killed at about 3am or 4am, but did not release further details. \\nThe Afghan ministry of defence said the two American soldiers, who were \u201cadvising\u201d their Afghan counterparts on the ground, were killed in a fire exchange with insurgents, which also killed three Afghan special forces. \\nEarly on Thursday, villagers who tried to transport the dead civilians to the city were reportedly stopped by security forces. Later in the day, residents staged a demonstration, protesting about the killings. \\nLaghmani, a prominent elder in Kunduz, said local media and community leaders had tried to go to the village where the airstrike took place, but had been stopped by security forces. \\nThe security situation around Kunduz, which Taliban fighters managed to enter last month, a year after they briefly captured the city in their biggest success in the 15-year war, remains precarious. \\nAlthough US combat operations against the Taliban largely ended in 2014, special forces units have been engaged in combat, providing assistance to the Afghan army and police. \\nThousands of US soldiers remain in Afghanistan as part of the Nato-led Resolute Support training and assistance mission and a separate counterterrorism mission. \\nA US service member was killed last month on an operation against Islamic State fighters in the eastern province of Nangarhar. \\nAfghan forces, largely fighting alone since the end of the international combat mission, have experienced thousands of casualties, with more than 5,500 killed in the first eight months of 2016. \\nThis article originally appeared on The Guardian.
