Y. He was 90. Branca\u2019s unforgivable offense (at least to Dodger fans) came on the afternoon of Oct. 3, 1951, when, in a final game with the New York Giants to determine the National League championship, he served up Bobby Thomson\u2019s electrifying (at least to Giants fans)   home run  \u2014   the \u201cShot Heard Round the World\u201d  \u2014   probably the most memorable in baseball history. The Dodgers had been in first place by 13\u00bd games in   but the Giants had come back to tie for first on the season\u2019s final weekend. \u201cA guy commits murder and he gets pardoned after 20 years,\u201d Branca once said at an  \u2019 game. \u201cI didn\u2019t get pardoned. \u201d His daughter Patti Barnes said he was pronounced dead shortly after midnight at a rehabilitation center near his home. In baseball lore the Thomson homer has been preserved in amber. It sits alongside Lou Gehrig\u2019s farewell at Yankee Stadium, Don Larsen\u2019s perfect game in a World Series and \u201cthe Catch,\u201d Willie Mays\u2019s spectacular      snare of a Series blast at the same Polo Grounds, three years after Thomson\u2019s \u201cshot. \u201d It was also immortalized in American literature by Don DeLillo, who opened his 1997 novel, \u201cUnderworld,\u201d with an extended, lyrical   of that Wednesday at Coogan\u2019s Bluff, complete with echoes of the radio announcer Russ Hodges\u2019s disbelieving call as the ball headed for the fence and sailed over the Dodgers\u2019 left fielder, Andy Pafko, culminating, as pandemonium erupted, with the joyous, repeated declaration, \u201cThe Giants win the pennant!\u201d \u201cPafko at the wall,\u201d DeLillo wrote. \u201cThen he\u2019s looking up. People thinking where\u2019s the ball. The scant delay, the stay in time that lasts a hairsbreadth. And Cotter standing in section 35 watching the ball come in his direction. He feels his body turn to smoke. He loses sight of the ball when it climbs above the overhang and he thinks it will land in the upper deck. But before he can smile or shout or bash his neighbor on the arm. Before the moment can overwhelm him, the ball appears again, stitches visibly spinning, that\u2019s how near it hits, banging at an angle off a   flashing everywhere. \u201cRuss feels the crowd around him, a shudder passing through the stands, and then he is shouting into the mike and there is a surge of color and motion, a crash that occurs upward,   hands and faces and shirts, bands of rippling men, and he is outright shouting, his voice has a power he\u2019d thought long gone  \u2014   it may lift the top of his head like a cartoon rocket. \u201cHe says, \u2018The Giants win the pennant.\u2019 \u201d As for the unlucky pitcher, DeLillo wrote: \u201cBranca turns and picks up the rosin bag and throws it down, heading toward the clubhouse now, his shoulders aligned at a slant  \u2014   he begins the long dead trudge. Paper falling everywhere. \u201d Branca, a strapping   who had won 13 games in the regular season, had started and lost the opener of a     playoff series, yielding home runs by Thomson and Monte Irvin in the Giants\u2019   victory at Ebbets Field. But the Dodgers won the next day at the Giants\u2019 home turf, the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan, setting the scene for the climactic game. The Dodgers took a   lead into the bottom of the ninth inning behind the starting pitcher, Don Newcombe, who was still on the mound. Then the Giants struck, scoring a run and putting men on second and third with only one out. Thomson, who had hit 31 home runs that season, was coming to bat. Dodgers Manager Charlie Dressen phoned his bullpen, where a coach, Clyde Sukeforth, was watching Branca and another of the team\u2019s leading pitchers, Carl Erskine, warm up. Dressen asked who was ready. Erskine had just bounced a curveball, Sukeforth told the manager. Dressen summoned Branca. Branca threw a fastball, and Thomson took a strike. Branca then delivered a second fastball, this one high and perhaps a bit inside. The ball flew off Thomson\u2019s bat on a line toward the    green wall in left field. \u201cSink, sink, sink,\u201d Branca told himself. Hodges, the Giants\u2019 announcer, made the call: \u201cThere\u2019s a long drive   \u2026     it\u2019s gonna be   \u2026     I believe  \u2014   the Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\u201d Thomson had delivered a   homer to give the Giants a   victory, capping a pennant drive known as \u201cthe Miracle of Coogan\u2019s Bluff\u201d and sending them into the World Series against the Yankees. (In that Series, the Yankees doused the Giants\u2019 hopes for a title in six games.) After the loss, Branca sat on the wooden stairs of the clubhouse, a   affair, his head bowed, his shoulders hunched. In the Polo Grounds parking lot, his fianc\u00e9e, Ann Mulvey, the daughter of James and Dearie Mulvey, part owners of the Dodgers, had been waiting for him. She was accompanied by her cousin, the Rev. Pat Rowley, a Jesuit priest. When Branca emerged, he asked Father Rowley, \u201cWhy me?\u201d The priest told him, \u201cRalph, God chose you because he knew you\u2019d be strong enough to bear this cross. \u201d Branca bore that burden without complaint even after learning a few years later that Giants players had been tipped to forthcoming pitches for much of the 1951 season through a scheme in which the Giants used a telescope in the Polo Grounds\u2019   clubhouse to pick up opposing catchers\u2019 signals. Details of the   were publicly revealed by Joshua Prager in The Wall Street Journal in 2001 and in his book \u201cThe Echoing Green\u201d in 2006. Thomson, who died at age 86 in August 2010, always maintained he was not tipped that Branca would be throwing a fastball on what became that fateful home run pitch. But Branca was convinced otherwise. \u201cWhen you took signs all year, and when you had a chance to hit a bloop or hit a home run, would you ignore that sign?\u201d Branca said in an interview weeks before Thomson\u2019s death. \u201cHe knew it was coming. Absolutely. \u201d Ralph Theodore Joseph Branca was born on Jan. 6, 1926, in Mount Vernon, N. Y. the 15th of 17 children of John Branca, a   conductor, and his wife, Katherine. After pitching for New York University as a freshman in spring 1944, he made his debut for the Dodgers in June. At 6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds, with an outstanding fastball, Branca flourished in 1947 when he went  . He was   and   the following seasons, making the National League   team all three years. After a losing season in 1950, he rebounded to go    \u2014   until that playoff series with the Giants. Branca encountered more misfortune at the Dodgers\u2019 spring training camp in 1952. A chair he was sitting on tipped over on a newly waxed floor and he fell backward onto a   bottle. His back was thrown out of alignment, tilting his pelvis and affecting his leg motion. He never regained his form, winning only 12 more games with the Dodgers, the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees and the Dodgers again, finishing his career in 1956 with an   record. Branca rejected speculation that the Thomson homer had affected his psyche. \u201cThey were saying that Bobby\u2019s home run was such a trauma that I couldn\u2019t go on,\u201d he told Sports Illustrated 40 years later. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. If you play sports, you expect to lose some. If I hadn\u2019t been hurt, that home run wouldn\u2019t have affected me at all. \u201d After retiring from baseball, Branca became an insurance salesman and served as president of the Baseball Assistance Team, which provides financial aid to needy baseball figures. Branca and his 16 brothers and sisters were raised Roman Catholic. But in 2011, Prager, the author of the book on Thomson\u2019s home run, told Branca that genealogical research had determined that his mother, who arrived in America from Hungary at age 16, was born Jewish, that her birth name was Kati Berger, and that two of her siblings had died in concentration camps. According to traditional Jewish law, Branca and his siblings were Jewish. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why God\u2019s mad at me  \u2014   that I didn\u2019t practice my mother\u2019s religion,\u201d Prager quoted Branca as saying with a smile that perhaps betrayed newfound reflection on his baseball fate. \u201cHe made me throw that home run pitch. He made me get injured the next year. \u201d Before entering the nursing home, Branca lived at the Westchester Country Club in Rye, N. Y. Besides his daughter Patti, he is survived by his wife, Ann another daughter, Mary Ellen Valentine and three grandsons. Ms. Valentine is married to Bobby Valentine, the former major league player and manager who became a broadcaster and is now the athletic director at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn. Of his 16 siblings, Branca was the last surviving one. Through the years, Branca appeared with Thomson at  \u2019 games, baseball dinners and cruises. They turned over a portion of their earnings from joint appearances to charity and became friends. And Branca grew resigned to being known solely as a classic goat of baseball history. \u201cNobody remembers that at 21, I won 21 games,\u201d he once said. \u201cNobody remembers that at 25, I had 75 wins. All they remember is the homer. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561820.497636}
