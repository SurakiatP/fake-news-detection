When asked about the timing, State Department spokesman John Kirby insisted that its purpose is \u201cto talk to researchers and scientists largely about climate change research.\u201d \\nA reporter responded by questioning the legitimacy of the trip, noting, \u201cThere\u2019s some criticism that this trip is basically, you know, the Secretary wants to knock Antarctica off his bucket list and he\u2019s doing it on taxpayer expense.\u201d \\nKirby insisted that it is important for Kerry \u201cto see firsthand what we are learning about the environment down there on the South Pole.\u201d \\n\u201cAs an individual who has literally championed climate change research and awareness for decades now, the secretary is and will remain committed to increasing the awareness and education of the public about this,\u201d Kirby said.\\n\\nThe location of Kerry\u2019s trip is also interesting. Russian scientists drew criticism in 2012 for drilling into Antarctica\u2019s \u201cAlien\u201d Lake Vostok, which scientists claim went \u201cundisturbed by sunlight for over 15 million years.\u201d \\nTheories as to what is under the surface of the lake\u2014which is considered the sixth largest in the world\u2014 include oil, a secret Nazi base with Hitler\u2019s remains, nuclear energy, Atlantis, and of course, a UFO landing site.\\nKerry\u2019s trip will add to his lead as the Secretary of State who has traveled the most miles, with over 1.3 million since 2013. This sends him even further ahead former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who traveled 956,733 miles from 2009 to 2013.\\nIn addition to staying away from the polls in the U.S. where he would be expected to vote for Clinton, Kerry is also showing her up by reminding the world that he beat her in total miles traveled\u2014an area where Clinton was very competitive.\\nIn 2010, Clinton wrote an email to her top aide Huma Abedin asking , \u201cWhat\u2019s my total now?\u201d \\n\u201cWe have 36 trips to date,\u201d Abedin responded, noting that Clinton needed at least four more to beat the record of 1.06 million set by Condoleezza Rice.\\n \\nFollow Rachel Blevins on Facebook and Twitter . \\nThe post Election Heats Up: Kerry Heads To The Poles\u2026In ANTARCTICA WTF appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628369.5400395}
