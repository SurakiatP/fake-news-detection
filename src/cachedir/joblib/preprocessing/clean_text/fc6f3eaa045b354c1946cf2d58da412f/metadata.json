His critics charge him with making baseless accusations. [Bernie Sanders labeled Trump\u2019s claim \u201cdelusional,\u201d a Politico article by Bradley Moss calls the notion \u201cpreposterous,\u201d and Al Franken dubbed it \u201cridiculous. \u201d John McCain reentered the fray over the weekend, opining, \u201cThe president has one of two choices, either retract, or to provide the information that the American people deserve. \u201d  Put another way, either Barack Obama snooped or he didn\u2019t snoop. President Trump releasing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court requests may go a long way toward proving or disproving his claim. While forthcoming information may substantiate or invalidate Trump\u2019s specific accusation, the general notion that presidents, particularly Democratic presidents, remain above abusing the security apparatus to violate civil liberties of private citizens ranks as, if not delusional, preposterous, and ridiculous, at least slightly na\u00efve. If Barack Obama spied on a political enemy under the guise of spying on a foreign enemy, he finds himself in bad company. Contrary to the \u201cshocked, shocked\u201d reactions, presidents other than Richard Nixon abused power to abuse political enemies \u2014  and violate the civil liberties of strangers. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Alien Act, the Sedition Act, Espionage Act, and the Trading with the Enemy Act, which empowered the federal government to send socialist leader Eugene Debs to prison for opposing the draft, to revoke the postal privileges of the American Socialist, the New York Call, and other   publications, and to deport sundry radicals, most notably on the famous \u201cSoviet Ark. \u201d Although the president\u2019s prejudices recently sparked a reorientation of his legacy among   liberals, his vindictive use of federal power to punish adversaries goes barely mentioned. President Franklin Roosevelt, over the objections of \u201cMr. Republican\u201d Robert Taft, instituted an internment and relocation program for those of Japanese, German, and Italian descent in America. The Korematsu decision, in which six justices \u2014  five appointed to the court and the sixth appointed as chief justice by the 32nd president \u2014  upheld Roosevelt\u2019s 1942 executive order barring Americans of   including the   Fred Korematsu, from residing on the West Coast. The order and decision regularly receive condemnation from Democrats decades after the fact. In real time, Democrats devised, praised, and upheld the constitutionality of the policy. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration launched a federal invasion of Martin Luther King\u2019s privacy that ended only with the minister\u2019s death. The president\u2019s brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, authorized wiretaps and bugs to glean personal information about King. The president, himself a man of great appetites, shared stories of King\u2019s sexual interests, including allegedly attempting to organize a sex party coinciding with 1963\u2019s March on Washington, with intimates. The prying says more about the Kennedys than King. But historians don\u2019t say much about the role of the eavesdroppers. Taylor Branch, for instance, maintains that J. Edgar Hoover \u201cmanipulated\u201d the Brothers Kennedy into hounding the   leader. This popular narrative imagines that the FBI director ordered around the president and the attorney general rather than the reverse. So many policies decried as infringements on civil liberties by today\u2019s Democrats came into existence because yesterday\u2019s Democrats regarded them as enlightened. The Palmer Raids and the McCarran Act got their names from a progressive Democrat and a conservative Democrat, respectively. Samuel Dickstein, the congressman whose resolution launched the House Committee on   Activities (HCUA) actually served as a paid agent of the Soviet Union. Republicans controlled the House, and its controversial committee, in just four of the 36 years of the   HCUA\u2019s existence. Democrats jailed Eugene Debs, forcibly relocated Fred Korematsu and barred Joe DiMaggio\u2019s   from his profession, and authorized the bugs that mined the most personal details from Martin Luther King\u2019s private life. But trust them. They don\u2019t do such things any longer.'"}, "time": 1742562024.8368406}
