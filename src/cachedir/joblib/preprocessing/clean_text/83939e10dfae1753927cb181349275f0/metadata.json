I cannot judge if it is making this choice for this reason or another, because I do not know its internal politics,\u201d Francis said, in reference to the upcoming French presidential elections.  We must \u201crespect people\u2019s opinions, honest opinions of a political discussion,\u201d he said. During the return flight from Egypt to Rome on Saturday, the Pope granted a press conference to the journalists aboard the papal flight, during which he was asked about the populist movements expanding in Europe. Virginie Riva of the French group, \u201cRadio Europe 1,\u201d made direct reference to the French presidential elections, claiming that French Catholics \u201care being forced to vote for either a populist or an extremist, and they are divided and confused. \u201d Late last month, a first round of elections reduced the list of presidential candidates to Marine Le Pen of the Front National party and Emmanuel Macron of the \u201cEn Marche!\u201d party. The final,   vote will take place on May 7. Francis confessed that \u201cI do not understand French internal politics,\u201d but repeated the principle that every country is free to make the choices it believes are right for itself. \u201cI have worked to have good relations, including with the current President, with whom there was a difficulty once, but afterwards I was able to speak clearly with him about the issue, while respecting his viewpoint,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cI do not know the history of the two candidates [Le Pen e Macron] I do not know where they are from,\u201d he added. \u201cYes, I do know that one is a representative of the far right, but the other candidate, I truly do not know where he is from,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this reason, I cannot offer a clear view on France. \u201d The Pope said that he was recently asked why there is not a Catholic political party, a proposal that the Pope found impractical and anachronistic. \u201cThis man is good, but he is living in the last century!\u201d Francis said, referring to the person who made the suggestion. The Pope also reflected on the future of Europe, as he has done on other occasions. \u201cEurope is in danger of coming undone this is true,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a problem that frightens Europe and perhaps increases populism: the problem of migration. This is true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let us not forget that Europe is made of migrants: centuries and centuries of migrants  \u2026     that\u2019s us!\u201d \u201cBut it is a problem that must be studied well, and we must also respect people\u2019s opinions, honest opinions of a political discussion with a capital \u201cP\u201d: great Politics, not the small national politics that eventually end up falling down,\u201d he said.
