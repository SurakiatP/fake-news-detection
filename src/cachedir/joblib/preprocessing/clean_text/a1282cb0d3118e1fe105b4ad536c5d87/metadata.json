For instance, he\u2019s gone as far as to claim that Hillary Clinton is in cahoots with \u201cinternational banks\u201d \u2013a \u201cpolite\u201d term for \u201cJews.\u201d Well, Bill Clinton told a crowd in North Carolina that Trump\u2019s campaign slogan may be the biggest dog whistle of all. \\nThe Big Dog was on the stump with state attorney general and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Cooper in Cooper\u2019s hometown of Rocky Mount. While pushing his wife\u2019s economic and education plans, Clinton said that when Trump says he wants to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d he\u2019s all but announcing that he wants to stick it to the poor and minorities. \u201cI\u2019m a white southerner \u2013 I know what \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 means, and all of you of a certain age know exactly what it means. I didn\u2019t fall off this truck yesterday, I\u2019ve heard this song a long time. It means first, I\u2019ll give you the economy you had 50 years ago, and second, I\u2019ll give you the society you had 50 years ago: I\u2019ll move you up and move somebody else down.\u201d \\nBill actually used the slogan himself during his 1992 campaign. However, he\u2019s not at all fond of Trump\u2019s idea of greatness. \\nThis largely continues a theme Hillary has kept up for the entire campaign\u2013trolling Trump\u2019s faux-populist slogans. If you\u2019ll remember, when Trump tried to counter the popular Hillary hashtag \u201c#ImWithHer\u201d with one of his own, \u201c#ImWithYou,\u201d Hillary\u2019s campaign team called it out for the dog whistle that it was. You* \\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 22, 2016 \\nAt least one Trump supporter has already admitted that \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a dog whistle. Earlier, when one of Trump\u2019s delegates from California, William Johnson, was outed as a white supremacist, he said that Trump wants to roll things back to the days when women were expected to stay in the kitchen. \\nDespite the retrograde vision Trump has for the country, Clinton urged the crowd in Rocky Mount not to return the hate Trump and his supporters have displayed with hate of their own. \u201cDo not treat them with the anger they often display toward us \u2013 love them to death. Look at them and say, \u2018we need you.'\u201d \\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is why America is already great. Perhaps someone needs to remind Trump of that. After all, he\u2019s going to get a very sobering reminder of this on Election Day. \\n( featured image courtesy Gage Skidmore, available under a Creative Commons BY-SA license) About Darrell Lucus \\nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school.
