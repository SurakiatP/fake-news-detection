[In this week\u2019s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie takes Republicans to task for what he claims is severe dysfunction surrounding their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.  \u201cThere was supposed to be a doctor for every person, and you could keep your doctor  \u2026     turns out, your doctor\u2019s now a plumber, and you can\u2019t find him, and if you find him, he has nothing to say to you because you\u2019re getting on his nerves, because he\u2019s working for practically nothing,\u201d Jackie says. \u201cAnd you could keep your doctor  \u2026     but you\u2019ll have to keep him in the basement because otherwise he\u2019s gettin\u2019 the hell out of there. \u201d Jackie says that now that Republicans have the White House and Congress, they can finally make good on their promises to the American people to overhaul the health law. Only problem is, they don\u2019t know how. \u201cIn eight years you can\u2019t figure out what to replace it with?\u201d he asks. \u201cI could tell you in ten minutes. Give me fifteen. Do I need eight years? And then at the end of eight years, I have no idea what the hell I wanted to talk about?\u201d \u201cStop criticizing if you have nothing to do. And if you were gonna do something, let\u2019s hear what. And if you don\u2019t know what, keep your mouth shut. \u201d Still, Jackie does want one provision written into any new healthcare law, and it\u2019s got to do with Nancy Pelosi.
