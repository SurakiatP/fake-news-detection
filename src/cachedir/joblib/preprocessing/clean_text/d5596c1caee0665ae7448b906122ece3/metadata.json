At night, the bears steal into town, making it dangerous to walk outside without a firearm or bear spray. They leave only reluctantly, chased off by the polar bear patrol with firecracker shells and spotlights. On the surface, these bears might not seem like members of a species facing possible extinction. Scientists have counted up to 80 at a time in or near Kaktovik many look healthy and plump, especially in the early fall, when their presence overlaps with the Inupiat village\u2019s whaling season. But the bears that come here are climate refugees, on land because the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is receding. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and the ice cover is retreating at a pace that even the climate scientists who predicted the decline find startling. Much of 2016 was warmer than normal, and the   came late. In November, the extent of Arctic sea ice was lower than ever recorded for that month. Though the average rate of ice growth was faster than normal for the month, over five days in   the ice cover lost more than 19, 000 square miles, a decline that the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado called \u201calmost unprecedented\u201d for that time of year. In the southern Beaufort Sea, where Kaktovik\u2019s 260 residents occupy one square mile on the northeast corner of Barter Island, sea ice loss has been especially precipitous. The continuing loss of sea ice does not bode well for polar bears, whose existence depends on an ice cover that is rapidly thinning and melting as the climate warms. As Steve Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International, a conservation organization, put it, \u201cAs the sea ice goes, so goes the polar bear. \u201d The largest of the bear species and a powerful apex predator, the charismatic polar bear became the poster animal for climate change. Al Gore\u2019s 2006 film, \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d which depicted a lone polar bear struggling in a virtually iceless Arctic sea, tied the bears to climate change in many people\u2019s minds. And the federal government\u2019s 2008 decision to list polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act  \u2014   a designation based in part on the future danger posed by a loss of sea ice  \u2014   cemented the link. But even as the polar bear\u2019s symbolic role has raised awareness, some scientists say it has also oversimplified the bears\u2019 plight and unwittingly opened the door to attacks by climate denialists. \u201cWhen you\u2019re using it as a marketing tool and to bring in donations, there can be a tendency to lose the nuance in the message,\u201d said Todd Atwood, a research wildlife biologist at the United States Geological Survey\u2019s Alaska Science Center. \u201cAnd with polar bears in particular, I think the nuances are important. \u201d Few scientists dispute that in the long run  \u2014   barring definitive action by countries to curb global greenhouse gas emissions  \u2014   polar bears are in trouble, and experts have predicted that the number will decrease with continued sea ice loss. A 2015 assessment for the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List projected a reduction of over 30 percent in the number of polar bears by 2050, while noting that there was uncertainty about how extensive or rapid the decline of the bears  \u2014   or the ice  \u2014   would be. A version of the assessment was published online Dec. 7 in the journal Biology Letters. But the effect of climate change in the shorter term is less clear cut, and a populationwide decline is not yet apparent. Nineteen subpopulations of polar bears inhabit five countries that ring the Arctic Circle  \u2014   Canada, the United States, Norway, Greenland and Russia. Of those, three populations, including the polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea, are falling in number. But six other populations are stable. One is increasing. And scientists have so little information about the remaining nine that they are unable to gauge their numbers or their health. In their analysis, the researchers who conducted the Red List assessment concluded that polar bears should remain listed as \u201cvulnerable,\u201d rather than be moved up to a more endangered category. Yet numbers aside, scientists are seeing other, more subtle indicators that the species is at increasing risk, including changes in the bears\u2019 physical condition, body size, reproduction and survival rates. And scientists have linked some of these changes to a loss of sea ice and an increase in   days in the areas where the bears live.   denialists have seized on the uncertainties in the science to argue that polar bears are doing fine and that sea ice loss does not pose a threat to their survival. But wildlife biologists say there is little question that the trend, for both sea ice and polar bears, is downward. The decline of a species, they note, is never a steady march to extinction. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen in a smooth, linear way,\u201d said Eric Regehr, a biologist at the federal Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage who took part in the 2015 assessment and presented the findings at a meeting in June of the International Union\u2019s Polar Bear Specialist Group. A dozen polar bears pick through the bone pile that sits just outside town. Men from the whaling crews had dumped the carcass of a bowhead whale on the pile earlier in the day. As two visitors watch from the safety of a pickup truck a few hundred yards away, the bears devour the leftover meat and blubber. The Inupiat people, who have been whaling here for thousands of years, believe that a whale gives itself to the crew that captures it. Once the animal\u2019s body is pulled to shore, water is poured over it to free its spirit. Even a few decades ago, most polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea remained on the ice   or, if they did come to shore, stopped only briefly. The sea ice gave them ready access to seals, the staple of their   diet. But as the climate has warmed, the spring thaw has come earlier and the fall freeze later. The pack ice that was once visible from Kaktovik even in summertime has retreated hundreds of miles offshore, well beyond the southern Beaufort\u2019s narrow continental shelf. The edge of the pack ice is now over deep water, where seals are few and far between and the distance to land is a long swim, even for a polar bear. As a result, researchers have found, a larger proportion of the bears in the southern Beaufort region are choosing to spend time on shore: an average of 20 percent compared with 6 percent two decades earlier, according to a recently published study by Dr. Atwood of the Geological Survey and his colleagues that tracked female bears with radio collars. And the bears are staying on land longer  \u2014   this year they arrived in August and stayed into November  \u2014   remaining an average of 56 days compared with an average of 20 days two decades ago. \u201cIt\u2019s one of two choices: Stay with the pack ice, or come to shore,\u201d Dr. Atwood said of the southern Beaufort bears. \u201cIf they sit on that ice and those waters are very deep, it will be harder for them to find nutrition. \u201d The shifts that researchers are seeing go beyond where polar bears decide to spend their summers. In the southern Beaufort Sea and in the western Hudson Bay  \u2014   the two subpopulations studied the most by researchers  \u2014   bears are going into the winter skinnier and in poorer condition. They are also smaller. And older and younger bears are less likely to survive than in the past. \u201cYou see it reflected through the whole population,\u201d said Andrew Derocher, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta, who has studied polar bears for 32 years. \u201cThey just don\u2019t grow as fast, and they don\u2019t grow as big. \u201d The proliferation of polar bears in Kaktovik in the fall has drawn wildlife photographers, journalists and   tourists to the village, filling its two small hotels or flying in from Fairbanks for the day on chartered planes. About 1, 200 people came to view the bears in 2015, and the number is increasing year by year, according to Robert Thompson, an Inupiat guide who owns one of six boats that take tourists to view the bears. Some visitors are surprised at the bears\u2019 darkened coats, dirty from rolling in sand and whale remains. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like polar bears,\u201d one man from the Netherlands said. \u201cBut it does not matter. I will Photoshop them when I get home. \u201d Susan Trucano, who arrived in early September with her son, Matthew, said they wanted to see polar bears in the wild before they were driven to extinction. \u201cIt was an urgency to come here,\u201d Ms. Trucano said. \u201cMy fear was that we would lose the opportunity of seeing these magnificent animals. \u201d The increasing tourism has been a financial boon for some people in Kaktovik, but it has upset others. Tourists take up seats on the small commercial flights in and out of the village during the fall months when the bears are there, crowding out residents who need to fly to Anchorage or Fairbanks. And some visitors wander through town snapping pictures without asking permission, or get in the way of the rituals that accompany the whale hunt. Last year, an intrusive tourist nearly came to blows with one of the whaling captains. For the most part, polar bears and people have coexisted peacefully here. Village residents are tolerant of the bears  \u2014   \u201cThey could break right in here, but they know the rules,\u201d said Merlyn Traynor, a proprietor of the Waldo Arms Hotel  \u2014   and with the whale remains, they have little reason to come after humans. But as the Arctic ice continues to shrink, bears are arriving in poorer condition and are staying longer, even as the number of tourists increases. Interaction between bears and humans is becoming more common, as it has in other parts of the Arctic, exposing the polar bears to more stress and the people to more danger. So far, there have been no attacks on humans, but there have been some close calls. \u201cThey never used to come into town, or maybe occasionally, like once a year or so,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cNow they\u2019re in town every night. \u201d Polar bear experts say they worry that at some point the number of bears seeking food here will exceed what is available. \u201cWhen polar bears are fat and happy and in good condition, they\u2019re not that big of a threat,\u201d said James Wilder, an expert who recently completed a study of polar bear attacks on humans. \u201cBut when they get skinny and nutritionally stressed, you\u2019ve got to watch out. \u201d Threatened species like lions or wolves face predictable threats: poaching and hunting, or the encroachment of human settlements on their habitat. But the biggest threat to the polar bear is something no regulatory authority involved in wildlife conservation can address: the unregulated release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Sport hunting once posed a significant danger to polar bears, greatly shrinking their numbers in some areas until 1973, when an agreement among the Arctic countries restricted hunting to members of indigenous groups, and the populations began to rebound. Oil spills, pollution and   still pose some risk. But these dangers pale compared with the loss of sea ice. For many researchers, the most pressing question is how many days a polar bear can survive on land without the steady source of   nutrition that seals usually provide. \u201cA bear needs sea ice in order to kill seals and be a polar bear,\u201d said Dr. Regehr of the Fish and Wildlife Service. \u201cThat\u2019s a bottom line. \u201d Some scientists have suggested that the bears might learn to survive on other types of food  \u2014   snow geese, for example  \u2014   or that they might learn to catch seals in the water, without relying on the ice as a platform. But most researchers say that is unlikely. Such changes usually evolve over thousands of years, said David Douglas, a research wildlife biologist at the Geological Survey, who spoke at the specialists group meeting. But the loss of sea ice \u201cis taking place over potentially a very rapid time frame, where there may not be a lot of time in polar bear generations to home in on behaviors that could give some advantage,\u201d he said. Much depends on how much of the ice disappears. Under some climate models, if steps are taken to control greenhouse gas emissions, the species could recover. And some evidence suggests that during an earlier warming period polar bears took refuge in an archipelago in the Canadian Arctic. In Kaktovik, at least for now, whales are providing the bears with an alternative source of food. But dead whale is not a polar bear\u2019s preferred cuisine. \u201cThe bears are not here because we hunt whales,\u201d said Mr. Thompson. \u201cThey\u2019re here because their habitat has gone away, and it\u2019s several hundred miles of open water out there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628556.0055022}
