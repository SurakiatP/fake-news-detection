Weirdo lol \\nOther users had a little fun with Clinton\u2019s picture. @HillaryClinton I\\'ve seen that look before. pic.twitter.com/TQ7FaW7Mnr \\n\u2014 Ian McKelvey (@mckelvey_ian) October 26, 2016 Odd RT @HillaryClinton Happy birthday to this future president. pic.twitter.com/FpluGgnovD \\n\u2014 Marcus Hawkins (@HawkinsUSA) October 26, 2016 \\nOther users didn\u2019t waste a moment getting down to the truth. @HillaryClinton happy bday to the single most corrupt politician in the history of the USA! #NeverHillary \\n\u2014 Chuck Norris (@Chuck7817) October 26, 2016 The saddest birthday tweet comes from yourself. https://t.co/ge67vMQhGu \\n\u2014 Michelle Ray (@GaltsGirl) October 26, 2016 \\nApparently the tweet was also promoted, which got under the skin of even more users. *Sigh* Why in the blue hell did I get a \"Sign Hillary\\'s Birthday Card\" promoted tweet\u2026I could NOT care less about her. \\n\u2014 Dan Trigona (@splinter48708) September 25, 2016 \\nClinton has always had a \u201cpeople problem,\u201d so it\u2019s no surprise that the only way to get Twitter users to wish her a birthday was to promote a tweet.

And apparently she wants everyone around her to know it. \\nClinton\u2019s problem with people is a serious one. Even those who have worked with the former secretary of state have said she isn\u2019t exactly likable \u2014 and that\u2019s putting it nicely. \\nClinton already behaves as though she is above the law. It\u2019s almost unimaginable how dangerous such an unlikable, narcissistic person could be in the White House. \\nAlthough I guess the last eight years have prepared us for it, at least a little.
