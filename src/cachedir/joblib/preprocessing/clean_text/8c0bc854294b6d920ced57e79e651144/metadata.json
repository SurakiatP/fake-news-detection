C. \u201cA museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind. \u201d But Mr. Obama said the museum\u2019s exhibits would put those problems into a larger context, allowing people to see the progress as well as the shortcomings in American society. He said he hoped it would encourage a dialogue among Americans on difficult issues like the systemic racism in law enforcement or the violence toward police officers. \u201cHopefully,\u201d the president said, \u201cthis museum can help us talk to each other, and more importantly listen to each other, and most importantly see each other. \u201d \u201cPerhaps they can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of a demonstrator in Ferguson and Charlotte,\u201d Mr. Obama said. And perhaps, he said, it could help a black visitor see the efforts of police officers who, \u201cin fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing. \u201d Acts of protest, Mr. Obama said, are acts of patriotism, whether it was sitting at a lunch counter in the South in the 1960s or wearing a   emblazoned with the words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d as Eric Garner, gasping facedown on a sidewalk in Staten Island, said before he died. Mr. Obama has articulated these themes before, most notably in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the protest march in Selma, Ala. But on Saturday, his tone was less anguished or exhortatory than it has been in the past. He was clearly rejoicing in the glorious history contained in this newest outpost of the Smithsonian Institution. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown the world we can float like butterflies and sting like bees,\u201d Mr. Obama said, not even needing to mention the author of that boast, Muhammad Ali, who died three months ago.   he said, can \u201crock like Jimi\u201d and \u201cstir the pot like Richard Pryor. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not a burden on America or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America,\u201d the president added. \u201cWe\u2019re America. \u201d Mr. Obama officially opened the museum by ringing a large bell from an   black church in Virginia, in an echo of bells rung to mark the emancipation of the slaves. He spoke against the majestic bronze backdrop of the museum, a kind of inverted ziggurat not far from the Washington Monument. In its shadow, viewers were spread across the lawn and pressed against a fence, listening intently to the president. His speech was the centerpiece of a solemn, yet quietly jubilant, ceremony featuring the civil rights leader John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Patti LaBelle and Stevie Wonder, who joked of the museum, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I\u2019m going to. \u201d Ms. LaBelle got a huge roar from the crowd when, at the end of her emotional rendition of the civil rights anthem \u201cA Change Is Gonna Come,\u201d she added the words, \u201cHillary Clinton. \u201d There was a panoply of dignitaries, including George W. Bush, who signed the legislation authorizing the building of the museum, and his wife, Laura, who spoke of her early brainstorming discussions with the museum\u2019s director, Lonnie Bunch. Bill Clinton watched from the front row, sitting alongside Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson sat nearby. \u201cThis museum tells the truth that a country founded on the principles of liberty held thousands in chains,\u201d Mr. Bush declared. \u201cEven today, the journey towards justice is not compete. But this museum will inspire us to go farther and get there faster. \u201d The museum, Mr. Bush said, celebrated several of his heroes, including the musician Chuck Berry, the baseball player Willie Mays and the Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. spoke of the legacy of racism, enshrined in Jim Crow laws, and how the fight for justice flowed through  \u2014   and was sometimes set back by  \u2014   landmark court rulings, from the Dred Scott case to Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education. To understand the real Dred Scott, Chief Justice Roberts said, one should visit this museum. Donna Sampson Rawlings, 59, of Ashton, Md. who watched the ceremony on a screen on the Mall, said the event brought back memories of her father, and of \u201call the people who weren\u2019t here who did things to get us here. \u201d She said she had toured the museum last week during a special program. Many of the visitors were older, she said, and \u201cI had to step back and think, \u2018This is their lives. \u2019\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re 80 years old, you went through so much of this,\u201d she added. \u201cSeeing it is, for them, emotional. It\u2019s something they never thought they\u2019d see. \u201d \u201cThese are the stories that we talk about that nobody knows,\u201d she said. Johnnie Wilson, of Springfield, Va. said he had fought in Vietnam \u201cfor the nation\u2019s rights, knowing that back home we didn\u2019t have the rights. \u201d He said the museum compensated for what he believed was a sanitized version of history taught in schools. \u201cThroughout the time we\u2019ve been on these shores, we\u2019ve made major contributions to America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really part of an American history that isn\u2019t told like it should be in classrooms. \u201d Mr. Obama, who was given a sneak peek of the museum recently with his family, spoke during his speech of a stone slaver\u2019s block on exhibit, marked only as the site of a speech by Andrew Jackson in 1830. It was, the president said, \u201ca stone where day after day for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle, on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet. \u201d The museum, Mr. Obama said, would make visitors face uncomfortable truths. But it would also capture the essential greatness of the United States  \u2014   the perpetual struggle to live up to its highest ideals. Mr. Obama spoke emotionally of his many flights on Marine One across the Mall, past the alabaster spire of the Washington Monument and the lighted figure of Abraham Lincoln, sheltered in his memorial. He said he had watched the museum rise from the ground and thought of the days when he and his family would return to visit it as private citizens. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk away that much more in love with this country,\u201d he said, \u201cthe only place on earth where this story could have unfolded. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563233.769752}
