After the Knott\u2019s Berry Farm maintenance team made several attempts to bring the attraction down, we contacted the Orange County Fire Authority to assist. \u201d Approximately 36 firefighters arrived near 5 p. m. according to the Los Angeles Times. An Orange County Fire Authority assured not one of the trapped riders was hurt or in danger and that firefighters are trained for just such situations.
