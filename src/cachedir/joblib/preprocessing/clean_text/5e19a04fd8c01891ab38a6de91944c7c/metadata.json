[The Associated Press notes that missile intercept technology has a \u201cspotty track record,\u201d having succeeded in just 9 of 17 attempts since 1999. Previous tests have involved   missiles, not an intercontinental ballistic missile. ICBMs pass through space en route to their targets. The difficulty of keeping the warhead intact upon reentry to Earth\u2019s atmosphere is one of the hurdles North Korean scientists have not yet been able to overcome.  \u201cThe most recent test, in June 2014, was a success, but that followed three straight failures,\u201d the AP recalls. The system, known as   Midcourse Defense (GMD) has been notoriously compared to \u201chitting a bullet with a bullet. \u201d More precisely, it involves hitting a rocket with a rocket that launches another rocket.  \u201cAn interceptor is to be launched from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and soar toward the target, which will be fired from a test range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. If all goes as planned, the \u2018kill vehicle\u2019 will slam into the   target\u2019s mock warhead high over the Pacific Ocean,\u201d the AP writes. Officials said the test target would be moving much faster than targets from previous intercept tests, to better simulate the challenge of hitting an inbound ICBM. However, the target is not meant to precisely simulate any specific model of North Korean missile. Although Reuters quotes recent remarks from U. S. intelligence officials that indicate \u201cmounting concern about Pyongyang\u2019s advancing missile and nuclear weapons programs,\u201d it notes that next week\u2019s intercept test was \u201cplanned well in advance and was not in reaction to any specific event. \u201d The U. S. has a total of 36 interceptor missiles ready to fire, and plans to build 8 more during the coming year, but no such defensive weapon has ever been used in actual combat conditions. Skeptics say even those sporadic test successes involved simulated targets that were much less challenging than an actual enemy missile would be.'"}, "time": 1742562201.995231}
