Bush and former first lady Laura Bush celebrated their 70th birthdays together in Crawford, Texas. \\nPresident Bush\u2019s birthday was July 6, and Laura\u2019s is on November 4. \\nSome of the attendees included former commerce secretary Donald Evans, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, and Ross Perot Jr., the son of H. Ross Perot. George Strait performed, and sang \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d per People. Typical of Bush\u2019s down-home style, he wore jeans, a western-style shirt and a prominent belt buckle. \\nThe dinner included an avocado and grapefruit salad, Mesquite smoked peppered beef tenderloin, Southern fried catfish, roasted corn and poblano pudding, bourbon carrots, and cheddar and black pepper biscuits. The dessert was a Texas chocolate sheet cake. \\nBush also invited guests to his art studio at the ranch, dubbed Studio 43, where he works on his paintings. \\nLaura Bush was working as a librarian in the Austin Independent School District when she met George in 1977; their friends Joe and Jan O\\'Neill invited them to a barbecue. They were married in November 1977 at the First United Methodist Church in Midland, where she had been baptized. She wore a tan, two-toned dress she had bought off the rack. \\nGeorge W. Bush later called his proposal to his wife the \"best decision of my life.\" Laura, an only child, said she gained \"brothers and sisters and wonderful in-laws\" and made her feel part of the family.
