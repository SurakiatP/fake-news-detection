The video, which tries to poke fun at itself even as it promotes the mayor, was posted on the official City Hall Twitter account, @NYCMayor, and features Mr. de Blasio in an awkward thespian effort. It also includes his wife, Chirlane McCray a senior adviser, Andrea Hagelgans and two Broadway stars, Jenna Ushkowitz and James Monroe Iglehart. Ms. Ushkowitz starred in the television show \u201cGlee\u201d and has appeared in Broadway musicals, including \u201cWaitress\u201d and \u201cSpring Awakening. \u201d Mr. Iglehart won a Tony Award in 2014 for his role as the Genie in \u201cAladdin. \u201d The video shows Mr. de Blasio, who is running for   in the coming year, sitting in the back of what appears to be one of the mayoral sport utility vehicles, talking with Ms. McCray on his cellphone. \u201cHey honey, I really like this song idea,\u201d he says. \u201cI really think it\u2019s the perfect way to wrap up all the great things we\u2019ve done this year. \u201d Ms. McCray, Ms. Hagelgans and the actors are shown in a room at Gracie Mansion. Ms. McCray puts the mayor on speaker phone so he can listen as the two actors sing, accompanied by a piano player. \u201cIn case the folks are unaware, we\u2019ve got some facts we\u2019d like to share,\u201d they sing. They go on to plug mayoral programs like protections for renters, the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and a mental health initiative. \u201cWho\u2019s bringing cops and community close?\u201d Ms. Ushkowitz sings as the beat goes  . \u201cWho\u2019s got incarceration and crime rates sinking to a record low?\u201d The performance closes with a rousing reference to Mr. de Blasio. \u201cNo matter what will be, we\u2019ve got Billy D. B. !\u201d Ms. Ushkowitz belts out. The mayor starts out nodding happily to all the praise but then whispers to an aide, \u201cThis is kind of over the top. \u201d In the end, he delivers his review of the performance: \u201cMaybe the song\u2019s a little too elaborate,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we should just do a couple of tweets and a Facebook post instead. \u201d Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog organization, questioned whether creating the video was a justifiable use of public resources and said it raised questions because it came right before next year\u2019s   campaign. \u201cThis is a virtual campaign ad that is meant to be a   announcement but goes beyond that in serving to promote the mayor,\u201d Mr. Dadey said. The video is part of a broader effort by City Hall to increase its use of the internet and social media to reach out to New Yorkers directly, bypassing traditional news media. It also comes as Mr. de Blasio controls his interactions with the press, frequently avoiding questions and limiting the news conferences at which he will take questions on any topic to once a week. Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said that the video was produced by City Hall staff and that the actors volunteered their time. Mr. Phillips said that City Hall spent a total of $700 to pay the piano player and a composer. He said it cost an additional $170 to have the piano tuned and $30 to rent a rehearsal room. Although the mayor is running for   next year, Mr. Phillips said in a written statement that the video \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with his campaign. \u201d He added, \u201cWe think New Yorkers have a right to know what their government does, and it\u2019s our job to communicate that work in a modern way. \u201d The immediate effect of the video was not exactly the stuff of Broadway hit material. In the first seven hours after the video was posted on Twitter, it had received 218 likes on the mayor\u2019s account and 88 retweets.'"}, "time": 1742563536.0573308}
