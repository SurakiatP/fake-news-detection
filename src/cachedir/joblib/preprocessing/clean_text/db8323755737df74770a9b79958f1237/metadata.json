During his Friday Fox Sports Radio show \u201cThe Herd,\u201d Colin Cowherd ripped Tim Tebow\u2019s decision to play baseball after 10 years of focusing on football in college and the NFL.  Cowherd said he\u2019s rooting against Tebow to make a major league roster because he does not want to see someone make it without putting in the work. \u201cWhy would we root for Tebow to be able to just step into baseball, which he didn\u2019t play for 10 years, and excel?\u201d Cowherd asked. \u201cHe\u2019s a crappy   player, and that\u2019s great because what it shows you, Michael Jordan was a crappy   player, is you can\u2019t just mail it in. \u201d He went on to note how people in other professions put in the time and effort to become good at their jobs. \u201cI\u2019m rooting against Tim Tebow to walk into baseball and flourish, and I rooted against Michael Jordan to walk into baseball and flourish. They\u2019ve both been exposed as dreamers and lousy once they got out of their lane,\u201d Cowherd continued. Cowherd then accused Tebow of not working hard enough and being \u201cnot willing to take the steps to be great\u201d because he refused to play in the Canadian Football League and took contracts with the New York Jets and New England Patriots over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He concluded, \u201c[Tebow] doesn\u2019t deserve to play Major League Baseball or be a franchise quarterback. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742561823.5477529}
