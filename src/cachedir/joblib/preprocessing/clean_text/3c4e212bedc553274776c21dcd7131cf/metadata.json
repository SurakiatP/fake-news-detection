The woman, 35, who has not been publicly identified, packed the   piece in her checked baggage on a flight to the southern Austrian city of Graz, where she and her husband, 40, had been living for eight years, said the lawyer, Anton Karner. Mr. Karner said his client had been acting on the advice of a doctor in Marrakesh who shared her suspicion that her husband had been poisoned at a meal the couple ate while visiting his relatives. The Moroccan doctor extracted the piece of intestine, Mr. Karner said, and apparently helped pack it in formaldehyde and in thick plastic containers. Gerald H\u00f6fler, who leads the pathology institute in Graz where the intestine is being examined, described the packaging as very professional. \u201cI would imagine that it was done by a pathologist,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was absolutely secure, triple wrapped, according to European Union norms. \u201d Dr. H\u00f6fler said the results of the examination would probably not be known until next week. The unusual cargo was found by customs officials on Sept. 8 after they searched the woman\u2019s bag as part of standard random checks when she landed in Graz, said Johannes Pasquali, a spokesman for the Austrian Finance Ministry, which oversees the country\u2019s customs operations. The story was first reported over the weekend by Kleine Zeitung, the main local newspaper in Graz. Leo Josefus, a spokesman for the police in the state of Styria, of which Graz is the capital, said customs officials had first turned to the police for guidance. Officers determined that the woman had violated no Austrian laws by bringing the sample into the country, and the intestine was then sent to Dr. H\u00f6fler\u2019s clinic. Mr. Karner, who declined to name his client, said she suspected poisoning after the family meal because some members of her husband\u2019s family had opposed their marriage.'"}, "time": 1742628454.5416777}
