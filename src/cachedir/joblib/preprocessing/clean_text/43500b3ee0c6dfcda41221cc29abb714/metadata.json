I thought we were trying to help people. \\nObamaCare visionary Jonathan \"Stupidity of the American Voter\" Gruber is back. When last we heard from the man with the same name as the Die Hard villain, he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was . \\nAn architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a \"lack of transparency\" and the \"stupidity of the American voter\" helped Congress approve ObamaCare. In a clip unearthed Sunday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Jonathan Gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass. \\nHe suggested that many lawmakers and voters didn\\'t know what was in the law or how its financing worked, and that this helped it win approval. \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\u201d Gruber said. \"And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.\" Gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was \"written in a tortured way\" to avoid a bad score from the Congressional Budget Office. He suggested that voters would have rejected ObamaCare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes, either by budget analysts or the public. \"If CBO scored the [individual] mandate as taxes, the bill dies,\" Gruber said. \\nNow the Gruber is back... and ready to explain why the only problem with ObamaCare is the lack of severe beatings . \\n\u201cThere is no sense in which\u201d the law \u201chas to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. We have individuals who are essentially free-riding on the system, they\u2019re essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan, which was pioneered in Massachusetts, was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low, and that\u2019s something I think ideally we would fix.\u201d \\nIdeally we would penalize Gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public. But predictably Gruber\\'s proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves. While pretending that anyone who isn\\'t on ObamaCare is just a \"free rider\".'"}, "time": 1742562679.2127407}
