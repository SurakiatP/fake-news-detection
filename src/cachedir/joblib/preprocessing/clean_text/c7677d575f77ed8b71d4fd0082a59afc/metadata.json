Her   speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex,   negotiation, and it defined the broad objectives, but not the details, of British withdrawal. \u201cThe United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, and my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do,\u201d she said. With the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain\u2019s relations with its neighbors for decades to come. She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people  \u2014   as well as goods, capital and services  \u2014   a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mrs. May said, acknowledging the differences. \u201cWhat I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market. \u201d She said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament. She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal, though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic, \u201ccliff edge\u201d breakup that she and Britain\u2019s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid. Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note, including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe, but not at all costs. \u201cWe seek a new and equal partnership  \u2014   between an independent,   global Britain and our friends and allies in the E. U.,\u201d Mrs. May said. \u201cNot partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out. \u201d And she appealed to Britons, especially to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc, which she had opposed. The reaction among her opponents in the \u201cremain\u201d camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process. \u201cTheresa May has confirmed Britain is heading for a hard Brexit,\u201d said Tim Farron, the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. \u201cShe claimed people voted to leave the single market. They didn\u2019t. She has made the choice to do massive damage to the British economy. \u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the Tories of turning Britain into \u201ca   tax haven,\u201d with their recent threat to slash corporate taxes if a good deal cannot be reached with the European Union. The speech, which provided some degree of substance, gained a warmer reception in the markets, with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days. It rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech, while stocks on the London exchange fell. Supporters of a withdrawal have been encouraged as well by reports that other countries in the bloc have recognized that they might suffer if there was a complete rupture and they were denied access to London\u2019s financial services sector. But British businesses remained nervous. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobbying group, welcomed the greater clarity provided by Mrs. May but worried that \u201cruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a   trading relationship between the U. K. and the E. U. \u201d Kallum Pickering, senior Britain economist at Berenberg Bank in London, was more blunt, writing in an analysis that \u201cas we do not expect the E. U. to compromise its principles, the U. K. is set to face significant economic consequences from Brexit. \u201d Few analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as Mrs. May seemed to say in her speech. In recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead, Mark Boleat, the policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, the heart of Britain\u2019s financial services industry, urged Mrs. May to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave. Charles Brasted, a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm, cautioned that the deal Mrs. May wanted was likely to be seen by the European Union as \u201cprecisely the cherry picking that they have warned against. \u201d He added: \u201cThe objectives are now clear. The path towards them is uncharted. \u201d But he warned that \u201cevery one of the aspirations expressed by the U. K. government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially. \u201d In Europe, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Twitter: \u201cSad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit. \u201d Germany\u2019s foreign minister,   Steinmeier, welcomed Mrs. May\u2019s \u201cdesire for a positive and constructive partnership, a friendship with a strong E. U.,\u201d which Germany would reciprocate. Mrs. May\u2019s speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London, was the most closely watched statement on European policy since January 2013, when the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership. The prospect that Britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since Mrs. May said in October that she would demand complete control of migration from the European Union and release from the European Court of Justice. The extent to which Mrs. May would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear. Membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual   deals with   nations. So she said she wanted a deal that would allow Britain to trade freely with the world, but still have as much   trade as possible with European Union countries. Ideally, Britain would like to have its cake and eat it, in the memorable phrase of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. In other words, Britain would reject what it disliked about the bloc, like freedom of movement, but keep trade unencumbered as it tried to get the best possible trading deal consistent with its other objectives. While European nations are expected to be stingy with market access, Mr. Pickering says he believes they will eventually bend. In the final deal, he wrote, he still expects Britain and the European Union to agree to a deal in which \u201cthe U. K. maintains a good level of access to the E. U.\u2019s goods markets and limited access to the   services markets. \u201d \u201cCrucially, we expect the U. K. to lose its E. U. financial services passport,\u201d Mr. Pickering wrote, referring to a system that allowed banks based in Britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc. \u201cThis follows from the U. K. raising some modest barriers to migration from the E. U. \u201d Many European Union countries have backed taking a hard line against Britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving. Anticipating that, Mrs. May said that Britain wanted a successful European Union and a friendly partnership, but that \u201cno deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561693.7263837}
