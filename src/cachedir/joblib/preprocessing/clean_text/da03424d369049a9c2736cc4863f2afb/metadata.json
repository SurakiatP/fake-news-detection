[\u201cI\u2019m in a \u2018take no prisoners\u2019 mode,\u201d Moore said Monday during a press conference at Sardi\u2019s in New York City, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen newspapers take down presidents, TV shows bring down CEOs, books have taken down the powerful  \u2014   art forms have contributed to making things better. Why don\u2019t we see if every night  \u2014   and twice in the afternoon for 12 weeks  \u2014   if a piece of theater could raise enough of a ruckus to discombobulate a man sitting in the Oval Office?\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d like to find out. Hey, stranger things have happened in the last year,\u201d he added. The Terms of My Surrender will reportedly run for 12 weeks at the Belasco Theater, and will be directed by   Michael Mayer. Tony   David Rockwell will design the set. Production for the show is being led by IMG Original Content. \u201cI operate with the hope that he won\u2019t be president for very long,\u201d Moore said Monday. \u201cThis is a limited   run, I guess I would like Trump to have the same thing. Should he not be President by the end of the run, if you have tickets for the last week, it\u2019ll still be as good as the first week. \u201d Moore, who was one of the first celebrities to successfully predict Trump\u2019s election, made his announcement standing next to a production prop that poses the question: \u201cCan a Broadway show bring down a sitting president?\u201d Michael Moore (@MMFlint) unveils   Broadway play, including   excursions to Trump Tower https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Ashley Lee (@cashleelee) May 1, 2017,  In an interview with the New York Times, Moore described the play as a humorous take on a \u201ccountry that\u2019s just elected a madman  \u2014   I mean, there\u2019s really no other way to put it. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re 10 blocks from Trump Tower, we\u2019re in the corporate capital of America, we\u2019re in the financial capital of America, we\u2019re in the media capital of America,\u201d Moore told the Times. \u201cIf one was going to stand on a stage and do the things that I\u2019m going to do, there\u2019s only one place to do it, and it\u2019s here in this city and it\u2019s right here at the epicenter of creative expression and free speech. \u201d Moore told reporters at Monday\u2019s press conference that he hopes President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence will come see the Broadway show. The      also assured that his show will include a message that will appeal to Republicans and middle America. \u201cI have found that Republicans or conservatives often will come to my films in part because I speak the language of the Midwest the people who voted for Trump are my neighbors,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI\u2019m always excited to talk to them. I\u2019ve noticed since the election that people who voted for Trump will stop and talk to me on the street because before the election, I was the only liberal who said he was gonna win. I took it seriously. I didn\u2019t think it was just a joke. \u201d \u201cAs far as preaching to the choir, it\u2019s been rough for tens of millions of Americans since the 8th of November,\u201d Moore added. \u201cSometimes the choir needs a song to sing, and this is a necessary and important moment to provide that. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742628556.305683}
