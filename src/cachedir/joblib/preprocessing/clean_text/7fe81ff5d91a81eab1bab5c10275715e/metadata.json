Welcome to Part 8! Just joining us? Then click here to play catch up and check all things Liberal Conservative courtesy of Liberal America. Now, on with the show! \\nExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. \\nWe finally return to the hot-button issues! In this case; \u201cIs the death penalty cruel and unusual and thus a violation of the 8th Amendment?\u201d Let\u2019s take a look\u2026 \\n\u2026but, let\u2019s get those first two provisions out of the way. Excessive bail. Excessive fines. Pretty self-explanatory: you can\u2019t be charged $1 million bail for littering and you can\u2019t be fined $14k for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign. Seems reasonable enough to me; albeit, there are some whacky things you can be fined for in this country. In the end, though, they\u2019re really more comedic than intrusive or unconstitutional. \\nOn to the juicy bits! Is the death penalty unconstitutional? Well, it comes down to the one question alluded to earlier: \u201cIs the death penalty cruel and unusual?\u201d The ACLU certainly thinks so and there are eighteen states, plus the District of Columbia , that have outright abolished the death penalty; the most recent being Maryland just this past May. That should make it clear just how divisive this issue truly is throughout this country. \\nThe polls would seem to match the divide among the States. The 18-against-32 against/for ratio of the states comes in at 64% for the death penalty and 36% against. According to a Gallup poll published in January of this year 63% of Americans support the death penalty; down from 64% in 2010, but up from 61% in 2011; and that\u2019s pretty much where the capital punishment approval rating been hanging out for the past few years after a steady decline in the decade prior. That same piece also goes on to explain that most support does, in fact, come from the Conservatives and Moderates while the majority of Liberals \u2013 just barely \u2013 oppose. Also, 67% of men stand in favor of capital punishment while 59% of women are in favor. \\nSo with almost two-thirds of the nation supporting the death penalty where does the opposition come from? What triggers it? \\nIt probably has to do with the old , archaic methods which were used to off the offenders. While three states \u2013 Delaware, New Hampshire, and Washington \u2013 still have death by hanging, and eight states \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia \u2013 still have death by electrocution, they all use lethal injection as their primary method of execution; as do twenty-one other states \u2013 plus Connecticut, Maryland, and New Mexico whose bans on the death penalty weren\u2019t retroactive. Now lethal injection isn\u2019t the coziest of methods, but at least the offenders aren\u2019t being fried like breaded chicken or hanged like deer cuts. \\nStill, one could understand that the idea of taking a person\u2019s life in response to a crime may be a little\u2026heinous. So maybe those who support the death penalty are heinous. \\nWanna\u2019 know who else was heinous? John Wayne Gacy killed 33 boys and buried most of them under his very own house. He was executed on May 10, 1994 via lethal injection. Wanna\u2019 know another heinous serial killer? David Alan Gore raped and killed a 17-year-old girl on top of five other murders \u2013 all female. He was executed in April, 2012 via lethal injection. \\nMany pro-death penalty folks will explain to you that they are proponents of Hammurabi\u2019s Code . For those of you who may not know, Hammurbi\u2019s Code is widely regarded as the first set of written laws in human history. Even if you\u2019ve never heard it referred to as \u201cHammurabi\u2019s Code\u201d before, you\u2019ve definitely heard of the concept; \u201cAn eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\u201d. You kill, you get killed. Pretty even trade. \\nSo, How Does This Amendment Apply To Modern America? \\nNow Hammurabi\u2019s Code doesn\u2019t translate 100% picture perfectly into 21st Century America; but, then again, the only absolute is that there are no other absolutes. Shades of gray run roughshod in modern law, but this is one case where black & white would seem to apply. Murder is heinous and maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 it deserves heinous punishment. \\nOnce more, the death penalty is one of those issues that is highly divisive; drawing sharp opinions from people both for and against it. Whether or not this \u2013 the 8th Amendment \u2013 can possibly fit with a pro-death penalty America depends entirely on who you\u2019re talking to and what their opinion on it is. \\nAt the end of the day, though, the death penalty is legal and utilized by almost two-thirds of the States; and, even those who do abolish it don\u2019t do so retroactively,?it leaves those who received death sentences to remain on death row awaiting their inevitable doom. Therefore, it\u2019s hard to argue that this amendment doesn\u2019t apply to modern America. It does. Very well, in fact; whether you love it or hate it. \\nEdited by SS About Jonathan Lenhardt \\nI'm Jonathan Lenhardt; fiscally conservative, socially liberal Republican.
