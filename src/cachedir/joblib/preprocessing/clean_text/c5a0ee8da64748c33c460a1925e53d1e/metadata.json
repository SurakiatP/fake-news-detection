With a warning sounded last night about the initiation of \u201cphase 3\u201d from the website, which has been leaking devastating emails about Hillary\u2019s insiders, the \u201celection dump\u201d promises to be the one that brings her to her knees. \\nWikileaks announced on Twitter that it would soon launch \u201cphase three of [its] election coverage.\u201d The tweet also asked those who wish to see more dumps to donate to the site to assist with their funding. The tweet read, \u201cWe commence phase 3 of our US election coverage next week.\u201d We commence phase 3 of our US election coverage next week.

Wikileaks supporters now include a number of disgruntled Republican voters and Bernie Sanders supporters. \\nImmediately after the site announced this dump, several WikiLeaks followers replied with tweets expressing hope that phase three would ultimately damage Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton \u2018s campaign for good. However, some expressed concern that it could be too little, too late. @wikileaks @WLTaskForce by next week, I assume you mean tomorrow, and not 3 days before the election. Near 30%+ in some states already voted \\n\u2014 Mel (@melimel521) October 30, 2016 \\nNew archives of emails released to the public would definitely devastate the Clinton campaign even further, and after the FBI\u2019s announcement that they will reopen the investigation against Hillary, it could be the straw which breaks the camel\u2019s back. \\nSo far, no amount of corruption or criminal activity has gotten devout Democrat voters to see Hillary for who she is: a power hungry sociopath. She has been caught rigging elections across the globe and cheating to get the Democrat nomination. It\u2019s even been proven, thanks to WikiLeaks, that she cheated during the debates against Donald Trump . \\nThere is some speculation that the emails released this time won\u2019t all be Hillary Clinton related, eluding to the possibility of even more Democrats and their corruption being exposed. Hillary Clinton\u2019s rigged podium helped her cheat during the debates with Donald Trump \\nHackers who have taken responsibility for the hacks of John Podesta\u2019s emails may have more up their sleeves. Guccifer 2.0, who claims to be a lone Romanian male, was also involved in the hack on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \\nHopefully, these leaks will finally get Democrat voters to realize who they have been bowing down to over the past few years. Accessing the leaked emails is not difficult, in fact, I personally check the new dumps daily. If Democrats cared half as much about honesty and integrity as they did about making sure we have the first female president, Hillary would already be no more than a stain on American history.'"}, "time": 1742562187.9835653}
