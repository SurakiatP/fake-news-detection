[Many bear responsibility for the real prospect of a catastrophic failure of that spillway.  But ultimately, the buck stops with an obscure government agency 3, 000 miles away: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  FERC has known about systemic defects of the Oroville Dam for over a decade. In fact, back in 2005, this dam was supposed to be relicensed for  . But objections were heard from various citizen groups.  They warned about   at the emergency spillway giving rise to the  potential for its catastrophic failure during high water conditions like those now present. Their calls for the spillway to be reinforced with concrete were ignored by the FERC which, instead, began granting annual   operating licenses in 2007. Those licenses have been renewed on the basis of a \u201cPotential Failure Mode Analysis\u201d of the Oroville Dam.  According to an October 14, 2016 letter sent by FERC\u2019s Office of Energy Projects to the California Department of Water Resources, the latest Failure Analysis  \u2014    which was submitted to FERC in December 2014  \u2014   was \u201ca significant improvement\u201d over its predecessor.  The public is being kept in the dark about this justification for ignoring the actual, high potential for failure of this dam, however, because FERC treats these these Failure Analysis documents as secrets. Unfortunately, this     in California is just one example of FERC\u2019s shortcomings. The agency is overwhelmed by its extensive regulatory responsibilities and it is often captured by regulated interests. Consider the following contributing factors: Bad as the dangers associated with FERC\u2019s failure to assure the safety of the Oroville dam are, these factors have contributed to the agency\u2019s culpability for even more serious malfeasance: the uncorrected vulnerability of the U. S. electric grid to physical, cyber and electromagnetic pulse attack, as well as to the effects of intense solar storms. Should the grid  \u2014   our most critical of critical infrastructures  \u2014   suffer widespread and sustained collapse as a result of one or the other of those very real dangers becoming reality, the consequences would dwarf those associated with massive flooding of areas below the Oroville Dam. These potential catastrophes underscore a   reality: The safety and security of the American people requires that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have as commissioners individuals who have been, are and will remain genuinely independent from the industries that their agency regulates. This is especially so as the commissioners are, by statute, essentially unaccountable to either the President or Congress. As it happens, three out of five FERC commissioner slots are currently open. It is imperative that President Trump nominates, and the Senate confirms, only commissioners who will have the requisite technical expertise, independence and vision to use their considerable power to protect the people of this country, and not simply the utilities they regulate.'"}, "time": 1742562276.0957682}
