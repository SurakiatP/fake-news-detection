[Five witnesses, four speaking in favor of the wall\u2019s construction and one against, testified before the Subcommittee.  Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) framed the issue before the testimony of the witnesses. \u201cA central issue of the President\u2019s 2016 campaign was the promise to build \u2018an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,\u2019\u201d he said. DeSantis cited Israel\u2019s successful border wall as a model for our own: President Trump has identified Israeli border security measures as a potential model for securing the U. S.  border. The construction of a security fence on the   Border cut illegal entries from over 16, 500 in 2011 to just 43 in 2013 and 12 in 2014  \u2014   a 99 percent decrease. DeSantis also disputed Democrats\u2019 claim that the wall might cost $70 billion, citing the Democrats\u2019 own witness at the hearing, Seth Stodder, an Assistant Secretary in the   as estimating a cost of only $14 billion in January. Mark DeSaulnier, a Democratic Member of the National Security Subcommittee, used part of his opening remarks to play a video featuring Republicans like Sen. John McCain ( ) who never supported President Trump\u2019s plans for a wall, saying they did not think he could get \u201cMexico to pay for the wall\u201d as he promised on the campaign trail. Maria Espinoza, national director of the Remembrance Project, a   representing the victims of illegal immigrant crime and their families, testified that: Americans will continue to be under assault until the wall is built   \u2026     While it seemed as though the politicians listened and even publicly gave the families their condolences, congressional leadership, the bodies of both houses, Republican and Democrat, have failed to enact the very measures that would have saved American lives. America has spoken. We want the wall built right away   \u2026     those who falsely state that a great border wall would not work either don\u2019t know their history or are in denial. \u201d Agnes Gibbony, one of Espinoza\u2019s \u201cangel mothers\u201d whose son was murdered by an illegal alien, took over to add her own horrific experience with lax border enforcement to the congressional record. Gibbony\u2019s herself is an immigrant, fleeing to America with her parents in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s bloody Soviet intervention in her native Hungary in 1956. Her memory of immigration is a far cry from the lawless chaos on the southern border today. \u201cWe followed all the rules, the law. We followed all the background investigation   \u2026     We also had to have character witnesses testify that we had good moral standing and my father was required to have a job contract,\u201d she recalled for the Subcommittee. Gibbony\u2019s  son, Ronald da Silva, was shot to death by an illegal in 2002. She told the Subcommittee: The shooter, the murderer, was an illegal alien with a long criminal record who had been previously deported. Immediately after the shooting, he fled to Mexico. His wife was depositing his welfare check at the credit union so he could live on it. He eventually returned to the United States and was sent to prison. He is due to be released in two years and seven months. I am afraid California will fail to notify ICE of his pending release. Gibbony\u2019s pain, however, will go on longer than Ronald\u2019s killer\u2019s criminal case. \u201cRonald was my first and my only son,\u201d Gibbony said, \u201cI live a life sentence of pain and suffering, wondering what would Ronald look like. Would he have grey hair at age 44? Would he be married? What would he be doing?\u201d Gibbony drew a direct link for the Members of Congress present from poor border enforcement to her and many other American\u2019s victimization, pointing out that the true toll of illegal alien crime remains poorly documented: I will forever miss all the tomorrow and everything that was taken from me, all because of broken open borders   \u2026     Hundreds of victims, innocent lives. I wonder how many more there are, because our government does not keep statistics on illegal aliens\u2019 crimes. Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced the creation of the \u201cVictims of Immigration Crime Engagement\u201d office or VOICE in an effort to better track excess crime from illegal border crossing. Gibbony also called out the culture of giving sympathetic treatment to the illegal alien issue while ignoring people like her, victims of that same unchecked border crossing. \u201cYou may say it is inhumane to deport illegal aliens who didn\u2019t care about breaking our laws. How inhumane is it that my son Ronald and thousands of innocent victims\u2019 lives were cut short?\u201d she asked. Steven A. Camarota, Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a   dedicated to studying the consequences of immigration, laid out the economic case for the wall. He cited dates from a National Academies of Science paper and estimates of illegal alien educational achievement to reach some striking conclusions. \u201cOn balance if you take all the taxes that they\u2019re likely to pay over their lifetime, given their education levels, and the services and costs they create, there\u2019s a net drain on tax payers of about $75, 000 per illegal border crosser,\u201d he told the subcommittee. If the illegal aliens\u2019 descendants here in the United States are included, the net burden rises to $94, 000 for each illegal border crosser. \u201cThe fiscal cost of illegal immigrants is not due to the fact that they don\u2019t want to work. It\u2019s not even due to the fact that many work off the books. Rather, it reflects their educational attainment,\u201d Camarota noted, \u201cThe bottom line is, unskilled immigration, which characterizes most illegal immigrants, is costly to tax payers. \u201d Camarota told the Subcommittee that the wall stands a good chance of being a net fiscal boon to the United States. \u201cIf we were to stop just  % of those crossers in the next decade, it would generate $  billion in savings  \u2026    in effect, the wall could pay for itself even if it only kept out a small fraction of people expected to come,\u201d he testified. Agent Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, added his own practical experience on the border to the mix. \u201cAs an agent who worked in two of the busiest sectors in the history of the border patrol, I can personally tell you how effective border barriers are,\u201d he told the Subcommittee. Judd was clear that he does not think it is necessary to build 2, 000 miles of wall across the entire border, but that the effect in certain strategic locations could be substantial. \u201cBorder security is not cheap, but the cost of doing nothing is much higher,\u201d he stressed. Judd further testified that the wall is not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d and would have to work in conjunction with other border security measures including staffing up the Border Patrol and cracking down on   \u201csanctuary\u201d cities. Mr. Stodder, the former Obama administration official opposed to the wall, called it a \u201cmassive waste of billions of taxpayer dollars. \u201d Stodder mocked analyses like Camarota\u2019s, noting that net immigration from Mexico has markedly decreased in recent years, telling the Subcommittee, \u201cThe fear that America is somehow being overwhelmed by massive numbers of Mexican economic migrants seeking to cross the Rio Grand to take our jobs   \u2026     [is an] outdated talking point from the 1990s. \u201d While disapproving of the wall, Stodder agreed that \u201cour immigration system is indeed in crisis. \u201d But he attributed this to \u201cstraining from the flow of Central American asylum seekers. \u201d According to him: The Wall will not help address the most pressing migration challenge we face, which stems from the crisis in Central America, whereby thousands of Guatemalan, El Salvadoran, and Honduran families (and unaccompanied children) have been fleeing violence, extreme poverty, and environmental crises, and coming to our border to seek asylum here, we need more resources specifically devoted to addressing this challenge   \u2026     suffice it to say, a wall is not going to help. Asked by Chairman DeSantis whether the drop in border crossings referenced by Stodder was related to the new \u201cposture\u201d of the Trump administration, Agent Judd replied, \u201cI know it is. When we interview these individuals who are currently crossing the border, they know that the laws are going to be enforced. \u201d \u201cBut I must warn you,\u201d Judd added, \u201cWe\u2019re in a \u2018honeymoon period.\u2019 We have to continue to enforce the laws, because if we don\u2019t, illegal immigration is going to go back up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562296.1716008}
