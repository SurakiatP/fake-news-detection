[\u201cNobody knows what I know and what I have seen. Only I can tell my story,\u201d the Material Girl wrote on Instagram.  \u201cAnyone else who tries is a charlatan and a fool. Looking for instant gratification without doing the work. This is a disease in our society,\u201d she wrote. Entitled \u201cBlond Ambition,\u201d the name of her landmark provocative 1990 tour, the screenplay is the work of newcomer Los Angeles writer Elyse Hollander. The script\u2019s description says it focuses on Madonna\u2019s life in the gritty New York of the early 1980s as she navigates her love life and a music industry that treats women as disposable. Madonna, who moved to New York in 1978 from her native Michigan, has spoken increasingly in recent years of her early experiences in New York including being raped.  \u2014     script  \u2014   Born Madonna Louise Ciccone, the now      worked at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts branch in Times Square as she pursued a career in dance before releasing her debut album in 1983. While many of Madonna\u2019s songs have been interpreted as reflections on her life and a number of books have been written on her, she has stayed away from outright autobiographical works herself. Madonna is no stranger to Hollywood, starring in movies that include \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s That Girl\u201d and \u201cEvita. \u201d Hollander\u2019s screenplay last year topped Hollywood\u2019s   black list in which film executives vote on their favorite scripts that have been in circulation but not selected for production. The Hollywood Reporter said Monday that Universal had picked up the project. It said that \u201cBlond Ambition\u201d would be   by Michael De Luca, who has worked on the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d erotic thrillers and the Facebook drama \u201cThe Social Network\u201d as well as the Oscars ceremony. Hollander, the writer, previously worked    on   film \u201cBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\u201d and has completed a short film, \u201cNikolai,\u201d about a Roma boy adapting to the United States.'"}, "time": 1742563214.7025504}
