But a Christmas Day celebration that drew more than 10, 000 people has led to a suspension of that tradition on Coogee Beach in the Sydney suburb of Randwick, where officials estimate that revelers left behind more than 16 tons of garbage. The City Council banned alcohol on the beach for the rest of the Australian summer. \u201cI\u2019m a local, and in all my time here I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Tony Waller, president of the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club, told Channel 7, adding that the club used four oxygen cylinders and 15 resuscitation masks to treat drunken partygoers. \u201cBy late evening, it got so bad that we let the shark alarm off three times to try to get the swimmers out of the water, we had such grave concerns for them,\u201d Mr. Waller said. \u201cThey were all intoxicated. \u201d Three people were arrested over \u201cantisocial behavior,\u201d according to the police. There has long been tension between the residents who live near Sydney\u2019s beaches and the tourists, many of them foreign, who hold   and   parties fueled by alcohol and drugs and leave behind piles of trash that greet early morning joggers and swimmers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen sex on Bondi Beach on Christmas afternoon,\u201d Mark Cotter, president of the North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, said in an interview, referring to a beach north of Coogee. \u201cPeople are often off their heads, drunk and sunburned. \u201d At Bondi Beach, the local council has also banned alcohol consumption. But many residents say that beer, along with cannabis and other drugs, is openly consumed on a grassy area where turntables and D. J. s entertain crowds. \u201cThe grassy knoll at north Bondi is the place to be seen on Saturdays and Sundays as it attracts buff bodies and bikinis,\u201d Zak Mann, a   Bondi resident, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to drink on the street than in the swanky, upmarket bars. \u201d The police and rangers employed by local councils have the authority to confiscate unopened alcohol and pour out alcohol being consumed on Bondi Beach, said Tony Kay, who oversees the council for Waverley, a Sydney suburb. The police in Sydney often simply warn those found in possession of up to 15 grams of cannabis leaf, enough for 15 to 25 joints. The City Council in Randwick said that it had previously restricted alcohol consumption at Coogee Beach and its surrounding parks during certain hours of the day in an effort to stop bad behavior. \u201cHowever, the poor and inappropriate behavior of a few on Christmas Day have forced the council to introduce a total alcohol ban for the area for summer,\u201d it said. \u201cThe public outrage to the devastation of the parks and beach itself on Christmas Day has been quite phenomenal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561743.0952132}
