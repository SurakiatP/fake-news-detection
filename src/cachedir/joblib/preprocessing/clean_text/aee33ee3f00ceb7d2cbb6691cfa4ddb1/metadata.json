First come the casualties: around 10,000, almost 4,000 of them civilians. Then come those anonymous British and American advisers who seem quite content to go on \u201chelping\u201d the Saudi onslaughts on funerals, markets and other obviously (to the Brits, I suppose) military targets. \\nThen come the Saudi costs: more than $250m (\u00a3200m) a month, according to Standard Chartered Bank \u2013 and this for a country that cannot pay its debts to construction companies. But now comes the dark comedy bit: the Saudis have included in their bombing targets cows, farms and sorghum \u2013 which can be used for bread or animal fodder \u2013 as well as numerous agricultural facilities. \\nIn fact, there is substantial evidence emerging that the Saudis and their \u201ccoalition\u201d allies \u2013 and, I suppose, those horrid British \u201cadvisers\u201d \u2013 are deliberately targeting Yemen\u2019s tiny agricultural sector in a campaign which, if successful, would lead a post-war Yemeni nation not just into starvation but total reliance on food imports for survival. Much of this would no doubt come from the Gulf states which are currently bombing the poor country to bits. \\nMundy points out that a conservative report from the ministry of agriculture and irrigation in the Yemeni capital Sana\u2019a, gathered from its officers across the country , details 357 bombing targets in the country\u2019s 20 provinces, including farms, animals, water infrastructure, food stores, agricultural banks, markets and food trucks. \\nThese include the destruction of farms in Yasnim, the Baqim district of Saadah province and in Marran. Mundy has compared these attacks with figures in the Yemen Data Project, which was published some weeks ago. Her verdict is a most unhappy one. \\n\u201cAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, 2.8 per cent of Yemen\u2019s land is cultivated,\u201d Mundy says. \u201cTo hit that small amount of agricultural land, you have to target it.\u201d Saudi Arabia has already been accused of war crimes, but striking at the agriculture fields and food products of Yemen in so crude a way adds merely another grim broken promise by the Saudis. \\nThe kingdom signed up to the additional protocol of the August 1949 Geneva Conventions which specifically states that \u201cit is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock\u2026for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population\u2026whatever the motive\u2026\u201d \\nThe fact that Yemen has long been part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s proxy war against Shiites and especially Iran \u2013 which has been accused, without evidence, of furnishing weapons to the Shia Houthi in Yemen \u2013 is now meekly accepted as part of the Middle East\u2019s current sectarian \u201cnarrative\u201d (like the \u201cgood\u201d rebels in eastern Aleppo and the \u201cvery bad\u201d rebels in Mosul). So, alas, have the outrageous bombings of civilians. But agricultural targets are something altogether different. \\nAcademics have been amassing data from Yemen which strongly suggests that the Saudis\u2019 Yemen campaign contains a programme for the destruction of rural livelihood. \\nMartha Mundy, emeritus professor at the London School of Economics, who is currently working in Lebanon with her colleague Cynthia Gharios, has been researching through Yemeni agriculture ministry statistics and says that the data \u201cis beginning to show that in some regions, the Saudis are deliberately striking at agricultural infrastructure in order to destroy the civil society\u201d. \\nIn a lecture in Beirut, Mundy has outlined the grievous consequences of earlier economic policies in Yemen \u2013 cheap American wheat from the 1970s and the influx of food from other countries which discouraged farmers from maintaining rural life (terracing of farms, for example, or water husbandry) \u2013 and the effect of Saudi Arabia\u2019s war on the land. \u201cThe armies and above all air forces of the \u2018oil-dollar\u2019,\u201d she said, have \u201c\u2026come to destroy physically those products of Yemeni labour working with land and animals that survived the earlier economic devastation.\u201d \\nThere are photographs aplenty of destroyed farms, factories and dead animals lying in fields strewn with munitions \u2013 effectively preventing farmers returning to work for many months or years. Poultry and beehive farms have been destroyed. \\nEven today, more than half the population of Yemen relies in part \u2013 or wholly \u2013 on agriculture and rural husbandry. Mundy\u2019s research through the files of other ministries suggests that technical support administration buildings for agriculture were also attacked. The major Tihama Development Authority on the Red Sea coastal plain, which was established in the 1970s \u2013 and houses, as Mundy says, \u201cthe written memory of years of \u2018development\u2019 interventions\u201d \u2013 is responsible for a series of irrigation structures. It has been heavily bombed twice. \\nBut I guess that one war \u2013 or two \u2013 in the Middle East is as much as the world can take right now. Or as much as the media are prepared to advertise. Aleppo and Mosul are quite enough. Yemen is too much. And Libya. And \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2026'"}, "time": 1742563973.3577168}
