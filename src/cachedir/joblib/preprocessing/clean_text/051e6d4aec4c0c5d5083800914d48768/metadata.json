[During a conversation with the Washington Post\u2019s Karen Tumulty, he cited the \u201cparticipation and the support of the   media,\u201d naming \u201cguys like Sean Hannity\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d Newt Gingrich for helping spread \u201cfake news\u201d to hurt Democrats. He specifically criticized Hannity and Gingrich for asking questions about DNC staffer Seth Rich\u2019s murder and whether or not it had a connection with Wikileaks.  Podesta explained that it was one more example of how the Russians were \u201cvery active in propagating and distributing fake news, working with these   sites in conjunction with them. \u201d He also cited an \u201cecho system\u201d created by the Russians that raised the social media profile of articles that were damaging to Democrats. He pointed out that \u201clegitimate sites\u201d like the Washington Post and the New York Times suffered, as other \u201c \u201d websites got more traction during the election. Podesta blamed websites in the United States for publishing emails from Emmanuel Macron during the French presidential election to influence the outcome. \u201cThe first reports of them came from U. S.   sites back into France,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a global phenomena. \u201d He praised the French media for helping censor the information to stop it from damaging Macron\u2019s campaign. \u201cI think unfortunately for us, but maybe fortunately for the world, I think the French press was more sensitive to it,\u201d he said, praising them for helping Macron \u201cwin by a landslide\u201d after censoring their reporting on the hacked emails. He suggested that the American media should have done the same things with his leaked emails. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like that really happened last fall   \u2026     the mainstream U. S. press was much more interested in the gossip,\u201d he said. Podesta warned the media about Russia\u2019s efforts to use the emails to hurt Democrats, pointedly directing them to be more responsible. He suggested that the media should have helped the Clinton campaign fuel the Russian angle, instead of reporting on his emails. \u201cI think if you contextualize it  \u2014   if you say that \u2018The Russians are coming,\u2019 and \u2018The Russians are here\u2019  \u2014   that can give people a sense of that they need to be more careful in the way they assess what they\u2019re hearing and what they\u2019re seeing and what\u2019s being peddled,\u201d he said. He described the period of leaks as \u201cthe Soviet days\u201d and griped that the \u201clow burn\u201d of email stories helped revive questions about Clinton\u2019s own private emails. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t put it to bed completely,\u201d he admitted.'"}, "time": 1742562744.789921}
