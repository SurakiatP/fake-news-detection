The Islamic State have officially taken responsibility for the attack. [At press time, Reuters reports that the IRGC say Saudi officials coordinated the attack, which left at least 12 dead and 42 wounded.  JUST IN: Iran\u2019s revolutionary guards say Saudi Arabia was behind deadly attacks in Tehran  \u2014   statement pic. twitter.   \u2014   Reuters Top News (@Reuters) June 7, 2017,  The   Presse reports that the IRGC claim America is also \u201cinvolved\u201d in the attack in some way: #BREAKING Iran Guards claim US, Saudi \u2019involved\u2019 in Tehran attacks,  \u2014   AFP news agency (@AFP) June 7, 2017,  \u201cLet there be no doubt that we will take revenge for today\u2019s attacks in Tehran, on terrorists, their affiliates, and their supporters,\u201d Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the deputy commander of the IRGC, said in a statement, according to Russian propaganda outlet RT. Iranian state media responded to the attack by publishing articles quoting Saudi officials\u2019 recent statements against Iran, implying that, at the very least, Saudi Arabia inspired the Sunni Islamic State terrorists to attack the centers of power in   Iran. An estimated eight percent of Iran is Sunni Muslim, compared to 89 percent Shiite. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman in challenging remarks made a few weeks ago warned that his country would take the battle to Iranian soil,\u201d the   Fars News Agency recalled Wednesday morning. Bin Salman had reported noted in May that the Iranian government perceived Riyadh as a \u201cprimary target\u201d for   terrorism, and said: \u201cWe won\u2019t wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia. Instead, we\u2019ll work so that the battle is for them in Iran. \u201d Fars also quoted Saudi Foreign Minister Adel   in a separate article, who told officials in France that reported indicated Iran was harboring   terrorists. According to Fars,   \u201csaid Iran must be punished for what he claimed as interference in the region and support for terrorist organizations. \u201d   reportedly demanded Iran become a \u201cnormal state,\u201d not a sponsor of terrorism, and abide by international law, in a report published hours before the Islamic State attack. The articles do note cite similar remarks from Iranian officials. In May, for example, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan warned that Tehran would \u201cleave no area untouched\u201d of Saudi Arabia \u201cexcept Mecca and Medina,\u201d the holy cities, if Iran felt threatened. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly claimed the United States, Israel, and \u201cthe West\u201d created the Islamic State to keep the Middle East destabilized. In recent remarks, he mocked the West for losing control of what he claimed was their own creation: \u201cThis is a fire that [Western powers] themselves ignited and now has backfired on them. \u201d A combination of armed attackers and suicide bombers targeted the two locations in the Iranian capital Wednesday, with Iranian officials identifying one of the suicide attackers as female. The gunmen, dressed as women and carryingKalashnikov rifles, executed a siege on the Parliament that lasted four hours before Iranian law enforcement announced that they had killed all assailants. The attack interrupted an active Parliament committee session.

In one of the videos, a man is heard repeating phrases popularized by late ISIS propagandist Abu Mohammad  . The attack is the latest in what is shaping up to be the bloodiest Ramadan in recent memory. Ramadan is the holy month of Islam, in which jihadists believe their acts of violence will reap them more rewards in Jannah, the afterlife.'"}, "time": 1742562154.2924757}
