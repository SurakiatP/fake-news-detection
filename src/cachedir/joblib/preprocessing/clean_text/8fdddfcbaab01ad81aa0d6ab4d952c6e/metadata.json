Putin of Russia for backing the Syrian government in the wake of its lethal chemical weapons attack on civilians, and worked to build international pressure on Moscow to change course. In Washington, Moscow and New York, the Trump administration publicly chastised Mr. Putin but privately worked to hash out increasingly bitter differences with him. At the same time, Mr. Trump embraced NATO  \u2014   a military alliance he had previously derided as obsolete  \u2014   as an effective and vital force for peace and security in a region where Russia has been an aggressive actor. During his presidential campaign, and in his early days in office, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy included speaking warmly of Mr. Putin and the prospects of a United States alliance with Russia. He had also questioned the usefulness of NATO, and the concept of an alliance for common defense to counterbalance Moscow\u2019s belligerence. In an interview that aired on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin was partly to blame for the conflict in Syria and denounced him for backing President Bashar   whom he called an \u201canimal. \u201d Later at the White House, Mr. Trump said that Russia had likely known in advance of the Syrian government\u2019s plan to unleash a nerve agent against its own people, and asserted that the United States\u2019 relations with Moscow were at an \u201c  low. \u201d In Moscow, Mr. Tillerson came away from a   meeting with Mr. Putin  \u2014   the first such    session of the Trump administration  \u2014   without reaching agreement on facts involving the chemical weapons assault in Syria or Russian interference in the American election. And sharply diverging from the meeting of the minds between the United States and Russia that Mr. Trump frequently aspired to when he was campaigning, there was no visible warming of the relationship. \u201cThere is a low level of trust between our countries,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. \u201cThe world\u2019s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship. \u201d The most immediate casualty of the clash was Russia\u2019s decision last week to suspend a communication channel, set up in 2015, to share information about American and Russian air operations over Syria to avoid possible conflict. Mr. Lavrov said on Wednesday that \u201cwe\u2019re willing to put it back into force\u201d if Washington and Moscow can resolve their differences. Further punctuating the Syria dispute, Russia on Wednesday vetoed a   resolution at the United Nations Security Council that condemned the chemical weapons attack. It was the eighth time in the    Syrian civil war that Russia, one of the five permanent Security Council members, had used its veto power to shield the government in Damascus. But in a possible sign of Russia\u2019s isolation on the chemical weapons issue, China, the permanent member that usually votes with Russia on Syria resolutions, abstained. The vote came the day after Mr. Trump spoke by phone to President Xi Jinping of China, whom he hosted last week at a summit at his    retreat in Palm Beach, Fla. White House officials said they credited the relationship between the two leaders that was forged during the visit, and the conversation Tuesday evening, with helping to influence China\u2019s vote. The day began with harsh words from Mr. Trump toward Mr. Putin, whom he had once praised effusively. \u201cI really think there\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that peace happens, because frankly, if Russia didn\u2019t go in and back this animal, we wouldn\u2019t have a problem right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network, referring to Mr. Assad. \u201cPutin is backing a person that\u2019s truly an evil person, and I think it\u2019s very bad for Russia. I think it\u2019s very bad for mankind. It\u2019s very bad for this world. \u201d Later, after a meeting at the White House with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, Mr. Trump went out of his way to praise the military institution, which he called a \u201cgreat alliance,\u201d and to express disappointment with Russia. Asked whether it was possible that Syrian forces could have launched the chemical attack without Russia\u2019s knowledge, Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible I think it\u2019s probably unlikely. \u201d \u201cI would like to think that they didn\u2019t know, but certainly they could have. They were there,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Russians during a   news conference at the White House. Even as they have intensified their criticism of Russia for backing Mr. Assad, other senior Trump administration officials, including Mr. Tillerson and Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, have been careful to say there is no consensus that Moscow had foreknowledge that the Assad government planned to launch a chemical assault. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not getting along with Russia at all  \u2014   we may be at an   low in terms of a relationship with Russia,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. Still, he held out hope that the United States and Russia could come to terms, suggesting that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s talks with Mr. Putin had gone better than expected. A quick d\u00e9tente seemed a remote possibility, given the level of tension surrounding the aftermath of the Syrian chemical weapons attack. On Tuesday, the White House accused Mr. Putin\u2019s government of covering up evidence that Mr. Assad had been responsible for the sarin assault, which was launched from a base where Russian troops are operating. Mr. Putin shot back that the charge was fabricated and accused the administration of Mr. Trump, who American intelligence agencies believe benefited during the election campaign from Russian cyberattacks intended to embarrass his Democratic rival, of fabricating the evidence to create a fake confrontation. Amid the rift with Russia, Mr. Trump made a striking reversal on NATO, saying the alliance had transformed into an effective one since he took office. \u201cI said it was obsolete it\u2019s no longer obsolete,\u201d Mr. Trump said, standing beside Mr. Stoltenberg. Mr. Trump attributed his change of heart to unspecified transformations within NATO, which he said were a direct response to criticism he had leveled that the alliance was not doing enough to combat terrorism. \u201cI complained about that a long time ago,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand they changed. \u201d It was not clear what the president was referring to NATO forces have been fighting alongside the United States in Afghanistan for more than a decade, an effort focused on combating terrorist groups including the Taliban. Still, the turnabout drew praise from some lawmakers who had been concerned with Mr. Trump\u2019s previous stance. \u201cWithout NATO, the Soviet Union would be quarterbacking half of Europe today and Putin knows it,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u201cNATO is the most successful military alliance in human history. This was the right decision. \u201d His comments came hours after a senior White House official said the Trump administration had supported the admission of Montenegro into NATO this week, in part to counter the influence of Russia in the small Balkan nation. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official cited \u201ccredible reports\u201d that Moscow had backed a plot for a violent Election Day attack there last fall. Mr. Trump on Tuesday signed the paperwork allowing Montenegro to enter NATO, two weeks after the Senate approved the move in a March 28 vote. The country\u2019s admission, White House officials said in a statement, should signal to other nations aspiring to join the alliance that \u201cthe door to membership in the   community of nations remains open and that countries in the western Balkans are free to choose their own future and select their own partners without outside interference or intimidation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628571.7994142}
