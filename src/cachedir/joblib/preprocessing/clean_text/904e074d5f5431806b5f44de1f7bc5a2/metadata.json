[Actress Sarah Paulson  \u2014   who starred in the first season of the   anthology series, The People vs. O. J. Simpson  \u2014   has been confirmed for a role, Murphy told E! News, but said she would not be playing   Lady Hillary Clinton.  \u201cThat\u2019s earmarked for talks with somebody else,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re casting that now. I can\u2019t say what Sarah is playing, but it starts shooting at the end of this year. \u201d Murphy says the show will focus on \u201cthe other women\u201d who were ensnared in the 1996 sex scandal, involving   House intern Monica Lewinsky, and the events that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting book,\u201d Murphy says about CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s book, A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down A President, which 20th Century Fox optioned the rights for last month. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about Hillary Clinton. That book is about the rise of a certain segment of a   group of people who despised the Clintons and used three women, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp to try and tear him down. The Toobin book is amazing. And there are a lot of bizarre crimes within that book that you can highlight. \u201d \u201cBut the show isn\u2019t really about Hillary Clinton, it really is about the other women. In fact, we might be doing the Clintons with hand puppets [laughs] I don\u2019t know,\u201d Murphy explains. \u201cWe\u2019re more focused on the mechanizations behind the scenes to try and get [Bill Clinton] impeached. \u201d The first season of American Crime Story explored the O. J Simpson murder trial. The     swept the Emmys and Golden Globes. Murphy said season two will tackle Hurricane Katrina and season three will focus on the 1997 assassination of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace. \u201cWe\u2019re striking while the iron\u2019s hot,\u201d Murphy says of the   filming schedule. \u201cBut that was largely due to actors\u2019 availability. If you get Annette Bening, which I did and she says, \u2018You\u2019ve got me these months,\u2019 then that\u2019s when you do it. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742628607.1910067}
