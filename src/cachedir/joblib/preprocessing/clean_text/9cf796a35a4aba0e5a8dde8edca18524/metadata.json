You can read our full report here as well as our look at the surprises and snubs. I\u2019ll offer my usual caveats that awards don\u2019t measure anything other than an ability to win awards. But still  \u2014   that\u2019s a fun ability to measure at least sometimes, isn\u2019t it? This weekend, I\u2019ll be waiting for everyone to binge all of Netflix\u2019s supernatural drama \u201cStranger Things\u201d so I can talk about it excitedly. As always, if you\u2019d like to share your thoughts with me and Team Watching, we\u2019re at watching@nytimes. com. Stay cool out there. \u201cVice Principals,\u201d Sunday, 10:30, HBO Watch if you miss \u201cEastbound  Down,\u201d or like creative cursing and shows with a dark streak. If you like Danny McBride\u2019s signature       characters, \u201cVice Principals\u201d is your jam. The show stars McBride and Walton Goggins (from \u201cJustified\u201d and \u201cThe Shield\u201d) as rival vice principals who are deeply aggrieved when neither is promoted to principal. The show can be   silly, but there\u2019s a through line of genuine meanness that\u2019s not for everyone. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d (Netflix) Watch if you like the scariest episodes of \u201cThe Twilight Zone. \u201d Warning: This is not a show you should binge. But if   global affairs have you feeling not great, and all the Pok\u00e9mon Go madness has you feeling a tiny bit conflicted about the role of technology in our society, go ahead and drive into that skid with the anthology series \u201cBlack Mirror. \u201d Every episode (there are only seven so far) is a   story, so there\u2019s no need to watch them in order, and each episode has something intriguing to offer, so you can\u2019t go too wrong. Season 1\u2019s \u201cNational Anthem,\u201d is the most overtly critical of power (it\u2019s about the British prime minister being put in an impossibly vile position) Season 2\u2019s \u201cWhite Bear\u201d is the most outright disturbing and \u201cThe Waldo Moment\u201d is the most pessimistic about the populace at large. One of those should suffice. \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d (Hulu) Watch if you like reality contest shows. The eighth and most recent season of the show that\u2019s \u201cProject Runway\u201d for drag queens is now streaming on Hulu. If you\u2019ve never watched the show, I encourage you to check out at least one season before jumping in here, since there\u2019s a lot of history baked into the show. (Season 4, also streaming, is a good place to start.) \u201cDrag Race\u201d outshines other similarly constructed shows with its   confessionals: Grandiose insults are part of drag culture, so contestants have far better quips than the people on, oh, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d or \u201cTop Chef. \u201d Are you looking for your next great TV love? (Or your next great show divorce?) Watching is here to help. Send in a question to watching@nytimes. com. I have lots of    chores and would like some TV options to keep me company during my attempts to be productive. Preferably something that doesn\u2019t require tons of attention (or wouldn\u2019t be horribly ruined if I miss a little bit of dialogue here and there) but is fun enough to help the time move by quickly. Any advice?  \u2014   Katherine Dear Katherine, I feel you. If I\u2019m home, I\u2019m always watching (or at least listening to) something. Saying these are good    shows is not at all meant as a knock, and of course you would get more out of them with devoted viewing. But perhaps not a ton more. These are organized from least to most   you could do your taxes while watching the shows at the top of this list, but I\u2019d save the ones farther down for   chores. \u2022 \u201cMy Cat From Hell\u201d (some episodes available on OnDemand) has pretty much the same plot every time: There is a cat (often multiple cats) they complain, scratch and relieve themselves at inopportune times their owners are despondent  \u2014   but usually weirdly complicit in this behavior hero cat whisperer Jackson Galaxy saves the day. It\u2019s also fine for all ages, as long as your kids aren\u2019t freaked out by how weird human beings are. \u2022 \u201cThe Profit\u201d (Hulu) follows entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis as he goes around to failing small businesses. Much like \u201cTabatha\u2019s Salon Takeover,\u201d it\u2019s secretly a show about how much debt many people are in, though this has more of a   spirit. I love it, but it\u2019s the kind of show I watch with a lot of   because every important moment gets played at least twice this is a good one to watch if you\u2019ll be in and out of the room. \u2022 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Test Kitchen\u201d (Netflix America\u2019s Test Kitchen\u2019s website) is the most educational food show on TV, but unlike the screaming carnival atmosphere of Food Network shows, this is more of a calm PBS oasis. Where to start? It doesn\u2019t matter! Every episode is equally good. \u2022 \u201cDrop Dead Diva\u201d (Netflix) has some of the   courtroom scenes and legal strategies any lawyer show has ever had. Its plot, in which a model is reincarnated as a   lawyer, is somehow more believable. It\u2019s an easy, charming, gentle show  \u2014   nothing major, but more endearing than you\u2019d expect. \u2022 \u201cElementary\u201d (Hulu) is one in a line of many iterations of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but this is the one that has Lucy Liu. \u2022 \u201cSleepy Hollow\u201d (Hulu) is just at the cusp of being too engrossing for this kind of task, so save it for something mindless like  . Time travel, American history, ghosts, monsters, but ultimately yes, another   cop show. Season 1 is fantastically fun, but things get way  \u2014   and then way  \u2014   worse after that. But 13 episodes of snappy,    horror fun is better than nothing. \u2019\u2019 \u2022 \u201cEast Los High,\u201d complete fourth season, Hulu \u2022 \u201cPower\u201d Season 3 premiere, Sunday, 9 p. m. Starz \u2022 \u201cBallers,\u201d Season 2 premiere, Sunday, 10 p. m. HBO Looking for a foreign language drama about the perils of growing up? In the Oscar nominated 2015 Turkish film, \u201cMustang,\u201d five young orphans earn the scorn of their guardians when they\u2019re caught playing with their male classmates on the beach. With their freedoms restricted, the girls make use of what\u2019s left of their childhood before forced arranged marriages. Although this is a stormy    story, the sisters\u2019 relationships with one another remain strong, and they find a few empathetic women in their family who understand their struggle against a conservative father figure. Director Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven captures the quiet beauty in the sisters\u2019 playtime, in their routines and in the world around them, even though it is shrinking. With a bittersweet running time of only 97 minutes, it\u2019s just enough subtitled teen angst. (Available on Netflix)  \u2014   Monica Castillo'"}, "time": 1742628605.2902133}
