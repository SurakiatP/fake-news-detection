The media did that for me. I am on the Republican, conservative side, and he wound up being our candidate. And so, certainly, I was going to vote for him. He looked like he would pretty good on all LGBT issues. Which is important, because my loyalties do not lie with Donald Trump. My loyalties do not lie with the Republican Party. My loyalties, and what I\u2019m fighting for is my community, the LGBT community, and particularly the trans issues that are out there, because there are many of them. And so, that\u2019s where my fight is. And I thought Trump would be pretty good. But he\u2019s kind of disappointed me in the first 100 days on those issues. \u201d Jenner added, \u201cI\u2019m not a   voter. I believe in limited government. I believe in our Constitution. I believe  \u2014   I would rather convince the Republican Party to do a better job when it comes to all LGBT issues than to try to convince the Democrats to lower taxes and lower regulations and let our country thrive financially and economically. \u201d Jenner was then asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a lot of pressure, though, on you, specifically to be a   voter? And how you respond  \u2014   how do you deal with that?\u201d Jenner responded, \u201cI totally agree with you. A lot in our community are, and they were very upset that I, you know, I was a Republican, and I said at the Republican National Convention, I said it was harder to come out as trans than it was to come out a member of the Republican Party. And so, yeah, from that stand, it\u2019s been pretty tough. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561879.443814}
