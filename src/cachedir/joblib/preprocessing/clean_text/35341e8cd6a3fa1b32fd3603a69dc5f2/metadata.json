[The program, which was developed by the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS) reportedly has an 80% accuracy rate, with researchers claiming that it could be vital in discovering how \u201caggressive\u201d a patient\u2019s treatment needs to be.  \u201cThe researchers\u2019 programme assessed the outlook of 250 patients based on blood test results and MRI scans of their hearts,\u201d explained the International Business Times. \u201cIt then used the data to create a virtual 3D heart of each patient which, combined with the health records of \u2018hundreds\u2019 of previous patients, allowed it to learn which characteristics indicated fatal heart failure within five years. \u201d \u201cThe LMS scientists claim that the software was able to accurately predict patients who would still be alive after a year around 80% of the time,\u201d they continued. \u201cThe computer was able to analyse patients \u2018in seconds\u2019 promising to dramatically reduce the time it takes doctors to identify the most   individuals and ensure they \u2018give the right treatment to the right patients, at the right time. \u2019\u201d LMS lead researcher Dr. Declan O\u2019Regan claimed it could \u201ctransform\u201d the way patients are treated. \u201cThis is the first time computers have interpreted heart scans to accurately predict how long patients will live. It could transform the way doctors treat heart patients,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cA doctor equipped with this new cardiac imaging approach would therefore be able to make more informed judgements about outcome than if they were relying only on current ways to investigate patient data. \u201d \u201cWe would like to develop the technology so it can be used in many heart conditions to complement how doctors interpret the results of medical tests,\u201d added Tim Dawes, who who created the program\u2019s algorithms. \u201cThe goal is to see if better predictions can guide treatment to help people to live longer. \u201d The researchers are now planning to test the program in London hospitals in an attempt to verify their results.
