Trump prepares to become president. Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of a \u201crigged\u201d election  \u2014   made before he won  \u2014   and his false declaration after his victory that \u201cmillions of people\u201d had voted illegally for Hillary Clinton made headlines. They also amplified longstanding Republican claims that rampant voter fraud justified a welter of state laws making it more difficult to register and vote. Democrats say the laws are not about combating fraud but about suppressing the vote of minorities and other   constituencies. Mr. Trump will have enormous power to shape future policy on voting. \u201cThe last time we had a national government that was as hostile to the protection of minority voting rights as we may have with this president was probably near the end of the first Reconstruction\u201d after the Civil War, said Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford University law professor, who was a deputy assistant attorney general under President Obama until 2015. \u201cThere are still strong Republican protectors and champions of voting rights,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t seem to have the whip hand in their own party. \u201d Such concerns could prove overstated. Beyond warnings of fraud, Mr. Trump has offered little specific about his views on voting rights. Four Trump transition officials did not reply to emailed requests for comment. One conservative scholar of election law, Hans A. von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, called the worries \u201cway overboard. \u201d \u201cThe emphasis may be a little different,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this idea that when Republicans come in, they\u2019re suddenly going to stop enforcing the Voting Rights Act and other laws  \u2014   the evidence doesn\u2019t bear it out. \u201d Mr. Trump will take office at a pivotal moment in a battle over the rules governing voting and elections, one in which   advocates seemed to be gaining an upper hand. Several potentially decisive federal court rulings on voting rules and redistricting, most favoring   advocates, now appear bound for a Supreme Court whose ideological balance is in Mr. Trump\u2019s hands. Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a linchpin of some of those cases, will fall to a Justice Department whose likely attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, is viewed with deep suspicion by civil rights advocates. One Trump adviser, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, is among the most aggressive national crusaders for voting restrictions. Entering a meeting with Mr. Trump last week, Mr. Kobach was photographed carrying a sheaf of policy recommendations. The visible text proposed to \u201cDraft Amendments to the National Voter\u201d  \u2014   an apparent reference to the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, the \u201cmotor voter\u201d law that has come under sharp attack from Republicans. The law prohibits states from purging voters from the rolls for technical reasons like moving within a district, and imposes a waiting period and other requirements to remove voters. Conservatives say the requirements keep ineligible voters on the rolls and promote fraud. Democrats say the law prevents partisan purges of poor and minority voters. Mr. Kobach, who once suggested that Mr. Obama was plotting to replace American voters with   legalized immigrants, is the leading advocate of requiring everyone to present proof of citizenship when registering to vote instead of swearing an oath. Critics say the poor are far less likely to have those documents, and the costs of obtaining them essentially amount to a poll tax, which has long been unconstitutional. But some actions that   advocates call regressive actually would improve election integrity and efficiency, Mr. von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation said. Requiring citizenship documents, he argued, would reduce fraud. And he said that Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department has failed to enforce the part of the   law that requires election officials to cull voter lists of people who have died or moved. A Justice Department under Mr. Trump is likely to press on both those fronts, he said. In general, he noted, Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department has filed far fewer lawsuits to enforce the Voting Rights Act than the department under President George W. Bush, where Mr. von Spakovsky worked on civil rights cases. \u201cThey\u2019ve been sitting on their rumps for eight years,\u201d he said. Others say the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division in the Bush era was sometimes a hostile environment  \u2014   an inspector general\u2019s report noted that one leader compared   lawyers to mold spores  \u2014   and that   lawsuits, while fewer in number, have had national rather than local impacts. Mr. Trump\u2019s greatest influence over election policy may lie in the Supreme Court, where he has pledged to nominate a reliable conservative to the seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. At least two major voting lawsuits against the Texas and North Carolina state governments seem likely to be appealed to the court. In both, federal courts of appeals this summer voided or modified Republican laws requiring voters to produce photo IDs, saying they disproportionately reduced minorities\u2019 turnout. The court has upheld photo ID requirements before. But the new cases marshal far more evidence of their outsize effect on minority voters. The North Carolina ruling concluded that the state intentionally imposed restrictive rules \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d to suppress   voters. Whether the Supreme Court will agree is an open question. Many legal experts say the eight justices appear evenly split over whether the Texas and North Carolina laws violate the Voting Rights Act or the Constitution. Should the cases be heard after a Trump nominee is approved, legal analysts agree, the chance that the laws will be reinstated will markedly increase. \u201cIf it is someone whose stance is like Justice Scalia, you should expect a reversal\u201d of the appeals courts, said Ellen D. Katz, a former Justice Department lawyer and a law professor at the University of Michigan. \u201cEvery signal they\u2019ve given us to date is that they would overturn the decisions. \u201d Yet some analysts are less certain. In recent cases, for example, courts have broadly agreed that ID laws must be written so that people who cannot reasonably obtain required identification cards still get an opportunity to vote. \u201cCourts are going to insist on a safety net\u201d for voters without proper IDs, said Edward B. Foley, a professor and director of the Election Law Project at Ohio State University\u2019s law school. \u201cEven conservative appeals judges are buying into that. \u201d The Supreme Court also seems certain to address a second important question: whether majority parties in state and local governments can gerrymander political maps during redistricting, redrawing boundaries in ways that solidify their hold on power. Gerrymandering to dilute minority voters\u2019 power has long been illegal. But while justices have said partisan gerrymandering is wrong, they have never decided whether they can outlaw it. Three partisan gerrymandering cases are moving toward hearings in a Supreme Court that some experts say could be poised to rein in the tactic, even with a Trump appointee. Other policy questions remain unanswered, Professor Katz and others said, including whether the Justice Department will pursue voting rights lawsuits that the Obama administration started or joined. Nor is it clear how vigorously it will enforce Voting Rights Act clauses that remain. The 2013 ruling ended the department\u2019s power to oversee voting and election rules in jurisdictions with histories of racial bias. Advocacy groups and pro bono lawyers have assumed some of those watchdog duties. But whether the agency will enforce remaining clauses of the law by bringing or joining lawsuits like those in the Texas and North Carolina cases is unknown. \u201cThe consequences here will be in what they don\u2019t do as well as what they affirmatively do,\u201d Professor Katz said. Should enforcement taper off, she said, \u201cit\u2019s not clear that the private bar can step up and do all the things the Justice Department has been doing. \u201d Still, officials at   organizations said they hoped to build a bipartisan consensus on issues like automatic voter registration and restoring voting rights to   where some Republicans support reforms. Beyond that, they said, they will regroup and decide what causes are most important. One leading organization, Common Cause, will renew efforts to block any resurgence of state or federal laws making registration or voting more difficult. \u201cThere\u2019s a concern at the federal level that there could be the introduction of laws to make photo IDs a national requirement, or to require documentary proof of citizenship at registration,\u201d said Allegra Chapman, the group\u2019s director of voting and elections. It is a sharp turnabout from the scenario most expected would unfold under a Clinton presidency. \u201cWhat\u2019s the phrase? \u2018These are the times that try men\u2019s souls,\u2019\u201d said Lloyd Leonard, director for advocacy at the League of Women Voters in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019ll be playing defense in a number of areas. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562256.046941}
