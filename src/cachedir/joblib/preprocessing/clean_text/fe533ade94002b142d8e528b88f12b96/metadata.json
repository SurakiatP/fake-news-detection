Reich for suggesting that the rioters were   plants. [\u201cThe labor secretary, former labor secretary, Robert B. Reichhhh,\u201d said Rush, \u201cclaims that the protesters in Berkeley were actually hired by Breitbart. That it was a Breitbart false flag. (laughing) They weren\u2019t really leftists that were doing this. Go to the audio sound bites. Last night on CNN Tonight, Don Lemon speaking with the former Secretary of Labor for Clinton, said, \u201cThe violence we saw at Berkeley, it plays right into the hands of the   white supremacists, you know, the people at Breitbart. What do you think about that, Mr. Secretary?\u201d  Rush then played the clip of Reich claiming that the protesters were planted by MILO and Breitbart. \u201cHa! Ha! Ha! Haaaaaaa! Do you hear how enthusiastic he is? (laughing) Do you know any   capable of this kind of behavior? (laughing) I mean, go to Ferguson, go to Baltimore, go to San Bernardino, go to Watts. Take any protest, any violence. Go to Oakland any time you want. Any time there is violent protests, it\u2019s always left wingers bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, the Democrat Party, or George Soros, and never once have the Democrats ever condemned them, \u2019cause they\u2019re proud of them. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re proud of these anarchists. They\u2019re proud of the people who blow up bank buildings. They\u2019re proud of the people that start fires. They never blame them. They never try to pass it off as fake protesters hired by Republicans. (chuckles) Until now. Why now? Why would it be  \u2026    ? Why don\u2019t they embrace these people? Why isn\u2019t former labor secretary Reichhhh and the rest of the left embracing these people and giving them a bunch of attaboys? Why aren\u2019t they encouraging \u2019em?\u201d \u201cYou know this is the kind of instability and chaos that they want because they know it\u2019s gonna be blamed on Trump. They know that all of this  \u2026     The   and everybody in education\u2019s gonna point fingers at Trump. Peggy Noonan\u2019s done it. I\u2019ve got it  \u2026     (That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s been superseded by other stuff in the news.) Oh, and they\u2019ve discovered a new unemployment rate! (chuckling) Wait \u2019til you hear this. They\u2019ve discovered the   unemployment rate at CNBC. Ah, this is just  \u2026     It\u2019s too juicy. And here\u2019s now the former Clinton labor secretary!\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t want anybody to think that these protesters in Berkeley that blew that place up were Democrats. They don\u2019t want \u2019em to think it\u2019s leftist students. Why do they not want to embrace them, encourage them, and claim credit? What is there to gain by blaming this on Breitbart? Don Lemon, now thoroughly intrigued, said, \u201cYou think this is a strategy by Milo Yiannopoulos or right wingers? Did they put this on in an effort to show that there\u2019s no free speech on a college campus like Berkeley? The right wingers did this? \u201d\u201d \u201cThese people are losing their minds. \u201cI was there! I was there! They were all dressed in black! I\u2019ve not seen this before. \u201d It\u2019s called  \u2026     There\u2019s a name for these people. They\u2019re Black Rock or something, and they are   leftists associated with George Soros. They come in in all black and they hide their faces. Many of them are not students. That\u2019s the point. They are bought and paid for! (laughing) But here is Reich (paraphrased) \u201cI was there! I saw them! These were right wingers, sure as I\u2019m sitting here with you, Don!\u201d (cracking up)\u201d \u201cI thought he was checking student IDs or whatever. But no, they weren\u2019t students. That\u2019s the point. Here\u2019s something else about this if I can try to regain my composure. (laughing) I don\u2019t know. I just hear this little guy get so juiced, folks. He gets so excited talking about this conspiracy. (impression) \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t bet against it, Don! I  \u2026    \u201d (laughing) I heard that the president of the university  \u2014   I\u2019m still tracking this down  \u2014   actually had campus cops and Berkeley cops stand down while this happened, that there was, in certain quarters, a desire for this to happen. \u201d Listen to the full clip here.'"}, "time": 1742561838.6340396}
