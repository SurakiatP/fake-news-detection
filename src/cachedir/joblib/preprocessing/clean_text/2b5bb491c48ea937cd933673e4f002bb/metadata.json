[\u201cHollywood is not a place of equality. I don\u2019t say that with anger or judgment it\u2019s a statistical fact,\u201d Hathaway said when asked what it\u2019s like to star in Ocean\u2019s Eight, the   spinoff of the 2001 casino heist caper Ocean\u2019s Eleven. \u201cAnd even though I\u2019ve been in some   films, I\u2019ve never been in a film like this. \u201d  The Academy   says filming a movie starring seven other   actresses forced her to come to grips with their shared struggled in the film industry in a way that male actors probably don\u2019t think much about. \u201cIt just kind of makes you aware of the ways you sort of unconsciously change yourself to fit certain scenarios. It\u2019s not better or worse or right or wrong, but there are certain things you understand about one another because of experiences you have in common  \u2026    it\u2019s probably easy for men to take that for granted,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cJust being on a set where I\u2019m the one who possesses that ease is really something,\u201d she said of filming alongside Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, and Helena Bonham Carter. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice alternative narrative. \u201d As U. N. Goodwill Ambassador for Women, Hathaway advocates for paid parental leave in the United States. In a speech last week before the United Nations, the    actress and mother championed the United States\u2019 Family and Medical Leave Act, which would grant new parents 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we don\u2019t already have it,\u201d she told Elle. Hathaway is hardly the only actress to call out Hollywood and the film industry\u2019s treatment of its female stars. Other actresses who have commented on the issue recently include Jennifer Garner, Kristen Stewart, Melissa McCarthy, Helen Mirren and Sienna Miller.
