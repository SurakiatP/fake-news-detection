It was the kind of oddball concept that Mr. Letterman pioneered in the middle of the 1980s, when his show was required viewing for the cool, young and caffeinated. Taking cameras outside the studio and into his office, Mr. Letterman recruited his mother, a   church secretary from the   town of Linton, Ind. to speak into a bullhorn through an open window of Rockefeller Plaza. \u201cAttention, New York,\u201d she said, her gentle voice amplified, as she made a reference to the \u201cToday\u201d crew. \u201cMy name is Jane Pauley. I\u2019m being held prisoner by Willard Scott. He\u2019s not wearing pants. \u201d Mr. Letterman had made a similar bullhorn joke with Bryant Gumbel five months earlier, but his comedy didn\u2019t sting as much when filtered through his mother. It even acquired a new and essential incongruity, introducing a sweetness and warmth that made him more relatable to viewers who might have been alienated by his acerbic sensibility. Ms. Mengering, who died on Tuesday at 95, was the most unlikely television star. She was   reserved and, as her three children explained in a beautiful obituary, she \u201cwas the happiest when she could curl up in a quiet place with a book and a box of   cherries. \u201d And yet she became a major figure on Mr. Letterman\u2019s shows over decades, a comic foil with a radiant smile whose cheerful unflappability contrasted perfectly with her son\u2019s exasperation. Inspired by Howard Stern, who used conversations with his mother on his radio show, Mr. Letterman turned phone calls with Ms. Mengering into a regular feature in the early 1990s, asking her to review TV shows like \u201cCop Rock\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ll watch again,\u201d she said) or recite a Top 10 list (\u201cTop 10 Things Found in Dave\u2019s Mom\u2019s Refrigerator\u201d). During these exchanges, Mr. Letterman portrayed the teasing, needling son while she gamely played along. During one show in February 1991, he told his audience that if he called his mother, who kept a garden and once worked at her husband\u2019s flower shop, at this time of year, she would say something about how the \u201ccrocuses were up. \u201d This turned a mundane conversation into an unexpectedly funny and suspenseful joke about how predictable parents can be to their children. These dozen or so phone conversations took place when the comedic heart of \u201cLate Night\u201d had shifted from scripted comedy to the compelling personality of its host. Mr. Letterman surrounded himself with a series of vivid personalities  \u2014   like Chris Elliott\u2019s bizarre characters  \u2014   who inspired   that revealed more of him than a monologue joke ever could. When Mr. Letterman moved to CBS in 1993 to begin \u201cLate Show,\u201d the role of his mother changed, shifting from an offstage voice to an   correspondent, reporting from her home in Indiana and at three different Winter Olympics, including one in Norway, where she interviewed Hillary Clinton. Through these remote videos, she proved unerringly polite and far more game than her son. (It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Letterman in a tight yellow suit and joining a luge team.) These cameos were perfectly in sync with one of the main tactics of Mr. Letterman\u2019s TV career: turning ordinary people into funny performers while also recasting the talk show, ripping it out of its context and placing it on an airplane or in a person\u2019s home or on the streets of New York. What was striking about Ms. Mengering\u2019s performances is how much the spotlight didn\u2019t change her manner or style. No matter where she was or whom she was talking to, she maintained the same poise and equanimity. She didn\u2019t mock show business, as her son did, but she appeared immune to its notorious seduction, and completely resisted being   or remotely theatrical. Mr. Letterman\u2019s relationship with his mother was, of course, more complex than simply devoted parent and loving son. In interviews, he called her \u201cthe least demonstrative person\u201d in the world, and he would tell a story about the first time his mother saw him perform live, when it was clear her muted response made an impact. After telling this anecdote to Mr. Stern on \u201cLate Show\u201d in 2013, his famously blunt listener flummoxed him with a joke: \u201cYou have mother issues, obviously, everyone knows that. \u201d Just as it\u2019s impossible to understand another person\u2019s marriage completely, the relationship between parent and child is also a mystery. The gift that Mr. Letterman gave his fans was allowing them to see things not just from his point of view, but also from his mother\u2019s. What we saw, in the limited way that television allows, was a genuine woman whose emotional understatement couldn\u2019t hide her unconditional love and a son who loved to poke fun, but then made sure he hadn\u2019t gone too far. After Mr. Letterman got his mother to yell into a bullhorn in her first appearance, the kind of brazen and juvenile move that she clearly would never do on her own, he turned away from the camera and toward her and asked, \u201cDid that just embarrass you to tears?\u201d She flashed a toothy smile, looked down and said, \u201cNo, David. \u201d He chuckled and added with some relief, \u201cO. K. good. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564602.268349}
