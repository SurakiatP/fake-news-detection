But there\u2019s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he\u2019s willing to expose Hillary Clinton. \\nVia AlternativeNews \\n\\nNow, he\u2019s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.\\nWikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested : \\nThe Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. Sounds familiar?\\nScroll Down For Video Below! In Obama\u2019s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.\\nClinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called \u201cFriends of Syria\u201d (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.\\nUnder oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack. In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks\u2019 Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.\\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what\u2019s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?\\nJULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it\u2019s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case\u2014or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can\u2019t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.\\nSo, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that\u2019s there in those emails. There\u2019s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton\u2019s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.\\nIt appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.\\n'"}, "time": 1742564561.677409}
