Two out but source says more,  \u2014   Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) February 3, 2017,  Over the course of the next hour, Clemons continued to Tweet the erroneous information and included statements he attributed to Secret Service managers. One of fired @SecretService Mgrs speculates #Trump is restructuring the service but this is speculation #secretservice    \u2014   Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) February 3, 2017,  Breitbart Texas reached out to the Secret Service who confirmed they contacted Clemons via Twitter advising him his story was not accurate. \u201cHis story was false,\u201d Secret Service Spokesman Joe Casey told Breitbart Texas in a phone conversation Friday night. \u201cIt was not Secret Service personnel who were fired or escorted out of the building. \u201d It appears Clemons was in a rush to get his story out before confirming his facts because he had a plane to catch from Tokyo to Washington, D. C. Last note on @SecretService firings 2nite b4 boarding flight. I\u2019ve posted all I\u2019ve been told. 2, and perhaps more Secret Service mgrs    \u2014   Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) February 3, 2017,  Folks. Am boarding 14hr flight to DC.

Another Agency did.  \u2014   Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) February 3, 2017,  Clemons admitted he made an assumption about what agency the fired workers reported to instead of getting a statement from Secret Service or the White House. In apparent frustration, the Secret Service Tweeted directly at Clemons advising, \u201cYour reporting continues to be false. Still waiting for you to contact us for official statement. \u201d @SCClemons @SecretService advising that your reporting continues to be false.
