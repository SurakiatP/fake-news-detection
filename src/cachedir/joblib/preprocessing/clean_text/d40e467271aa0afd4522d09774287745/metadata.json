In the United States, a reality television star is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For Palestinians, it\u2019s the other way around: A candidate chosen on a television show is the closest they have come to an elected leader in more than 10 years. \u201cThis is just a show,\u201d acknowledged Mr. Qannam, one of three contestants who made it to Thursday night\u2019s finale of \u201cThe President. \u201d \u201cBut people are hungry for a leader. \u201d The show, now in its second season, began with 24 contestants culled from more than 1, 200 applicants who had to take a series of exams on Palestinian politics, international law, development and gender equality. Each week, contestants shadowed a Palestinian minister or business person, then told a panel of judges what they had learned and how they would improve on the job. They also held election rallies while cameras were rolling and had to campaign for votes from the audience, who voted via text message at 80 cents a pop. A mix of votes from judges and the audience determined who made it to the next rounds, though in the finale only audience votes counted. Because there was no cap on how many times viewers could vote, money played a considerable role, and candidates raised funds to secure votes from viewers. On Thursday night, the three finalists all had similar platforms: Boycott Israel. Designate East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Bring about a reconciliation for the bitterly divided Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza. (Six of the candidates in the round of 24 were from Gaza, though none made it to the final round.) Mr. Qannam  \u2014   Muslim, male and from East Jerusalem  \u2014   was the leading candidate. Studying to be a lawyer, Mr. Qannam, 24, is the son of refugees, broadening his appeal in the hardscrabble camps across the West Bank. His mother is a deputy minister of Jerusalem affairs in the Palestinian Authority. And he had a nice smile. The only female finalist, Nemah Adawiah, 22, studies international relations at Birzeit University near Ramallah. She drew some resentment because her wealthy family was bankrolling her campaign, and scrutiny about her appearance when the judges deemed some of her colorful outfits inappropriate. The third finalist, Fadi Khair, a    Christian and pediatric nurse, had backers who felt he needed to broaden his appeal to Muslim voters. \u201cYou need a priest and a sheikh to sit in the front row,\u201d mused a friend at a campaign meeting before Thursday\u2019s finale. \u201cThe President\u201d  \u2014   broadcast on the Maan satellite network to large audiences in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Arab world  \u2014   was funded mostly by a State Department grant to Search for Common Ground, a nongovernmental group that focuses on conflict resolution. Suheir Rasul, the group\u2019s   said the point of the show was to groom young Palestinians to be future leaders. Yet the subtext was aimed at the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is now 11 years into what was meant to have been a   term and has offered no signs of handing over power. In an odd twist, many judges on the show were Palestinian officials, and the Palestinian Authority allowed its organizers to use their facilities. Advisers to Mr. Abbas did not respond to requests for comment on the show. The show is \u201ca message for the Palestinian leadership,\u201d said Raed Othman, Maan\u2019s general director. \u201cElections are the solution. Democracy is the solution. \u201d Before the finale, Mr. Khair, the pediatric nurse, was deeply worried about how to raise enough funds. \u201cWe focus on the rich, not the poor, because they barely have enough for their daily bread,\u201d said his mother, Hannah Khair, before the finale. They were focusing on people in his hometown, Beit Sahour, a village in the West Bank, and Christians excited to see one of their own vie for president. Ahead of the penultimate episode, he spent about $7, 800 to secure nearly 10, 000 votes. As he prepared his speech for the final episode, Mr. Khair estimated he needed to secure at least 20, 000 votes to have a chance at winning. \u201cI want to talk about economic resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cA call for foreign investment and Palestinian investment,\u201d he said, but was interrupted by his wife, Mirna, 25, holding their    son, Jihad, as he vomited on the kitchen floor. Mr. Khair continued while helping his wife. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about diplomacy,\u201d he said. Ms. Adawiah\u2019s family took care of nearly everything. Her father, Bahjat Adawiah, 72, organized her election rally on a recent night in Al Ram, a neighborhood near Jerusalem, tucked behind Israel\u2019s separation barrier, where he owns several properties. \u201cI am the daughter of Jerusalem!\u201d she read, practicing her speech. Her father paced and  . \u201cSpeak more forcefully!\u201d he told her. \u201cShe wants to win, so I have to support her. She\u2019s our little spoiled girl,\u201d he added, grinning. But the show\u2019s producers noted that Ms. Adawiah had worked extremely hard and impressed the judges. Money alone could not have propelled her to the finale, they said. Her father\u2019s business partners, Al Ram\u2019s mayor and other prominent residents piled into a school hall, where her rally underscored women\u2019s participation: There was a female master of ceremonies, and a women\u2019s folkloric dance troupe entertained guests. \u201cWe want you to be the president, and why not?\u201d said Ali Maslamani, the mayor. \u201cOur long Islamic history is filled with female leaders!\u201d But Mr. Qannam was clearly the most popular candidate. In an East Jerusalem soccer club on a recent night, he barely got through his platform before residents began endorsing him. Mustafa Shabani, a    who works two jobs to support his family, said he had spent at least $7 on votes for Mr. Qannam. Mr. Othman, the general director of Maan, said the influence of money made the show more realistic. \u201cYou can sit in a cafe and have a great idea  \u2014   but so what?\u201d he said. \u201cShow me the money. \u201d During Thursday\u2019s finale in a Ramallah studio, Mr. Khair stumbled through his speech. Ms. Adawiah laced hers with religion and nationalism. \u201cIt is time to change what is inside ourselves, so we can change our sick reality,\u201d she said. In the end, though, it was Mr. Qannam\u2019s night. \u201cYou are standing before an important decision!\u201d he told the audience. He promised his first act as \u201cpresident\u201d would be to visit Gaza and heal a   rift between Palestinians. \u201cI will reconcile our nation!\u201d \u201cWere it not that I loved this homeland, I would not have done this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a duty, not an honor!\u201d The audience roared. \u201cWaad Qannam! Waad Qannam! Waad Qannam!\u201d the back rows shouted. Mr. Qannam won with nearly 42, 000 votes, compared with roughly 28, 000 for Ms. Adawiah and about 14, 000 for Mr. Khair. His prize? A car, plus the prominence and political connections that come from being on the show. He struggled to speak over the ecstatic audience. \u201cThis is not my victory!\u201d he called out. \u201cIt is a victory for Palestine!\u201d Nearby, that victory was hard to stomach. Ms. Adawiah\u2019s family alleged that organizers had falsified the tally, arguing they had receipts for 41, 000 votes they had secured for their daughter. \u201cI bought 24, 000 votes!\u201d shouted one of her relatives. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562743.9830918}
