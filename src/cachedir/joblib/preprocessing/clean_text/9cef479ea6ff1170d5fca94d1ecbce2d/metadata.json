David Fajgenbaum was the fittest of his friends at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s medical school, a    gym addict and former quarterback at Georgetown. His mammoth hands seemed more suited to spiraling footballs than the fine fingerwork a    might need. He had endurance to match, taking multiple hits and returning to the field to play on. \u201cThis guy was a physical specimen,\u201d said his former roommate, Grant Mitchell, who used to walk to work with him. When they would arrive at the hospital for his obstetrics rotation, his friend recalled, \u201che would basically coerce me into doing   on the tree outside. \u201d In July 2010, that all changed. The    woke up at night drenched in sweat. His lymph nodes were swollen. He felt stabs of abdominal pain, and odd red bumps began sprouting across his chest. Most bizarre of all, he felt very tired  \u2014   so tired that he began slipping into empty exam rooms between patients, stealing   naps to get through the day. \u201cGuys, I think I\u2019m dying,\u201d he recalled telling his friends. A visit to the emergency room confirmed his fears. A doctor told him that his liver, kidneys and bone marrow were not working properly. Even more troubling, the doctor had no idea why his body was failing. \u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d he remembers the doctor asking him. Pursuing the answer to that question, it turned out, would become his life\u2019s work. It would transform Dr. Fajgenbaum from a patient on the brink of death five different times, whose illness stumped specialist after specialist, to one of the leading researchers in his field. He has even used himself as his own test subject, and may have discovered a treatment for his rare disease. His story, which has been circulating inside medicine, is more than one person\u2019s remarkable journey, however. It offers a look into the world of rare diseases, a corner of medicine that continues to frustrate  \u2014   and flummox  \u2014   those who seek cures for obscure conditions. About 95 percent of all rare diseases have no approved drug treatments. Fewer than 8, 000 people in the United States are found to have Dr. Fajgenbaum\u2019s condition in any given year. But taken as a whole, rare diseases are not unusual: An estimated 30 million people in the country  \u2014   or about 10 percent of the population  \u2014   are living with one of the nearly 7, 000 rare diseases that have been identified. Prompted by financial incentives passed by Congress, the drug industry is hotly pursuing treatments for a throng of rare diseases. That has led to breakthroughs in several conditions, including cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Nevertheless, with a small number of subjects to study and relatively few people to sell new drugs to, many rare diseases are overlooked by doctors and scientists, hampered by a lack of resources and public awareness. Dr. Fajgenbaum\u2019s condition is one of the many that have been given relatively little attention. Initially, doctors thought he had a common form of cancer. A CT scan  \u2014   a series of images that give doctors a clearer picture of what is going on inside the body  \u2014   revealed a body riddled with enlarged lymph nodes, a hallmark of lymphoma. The news struck a particularly cruel blow: Only a few years earlier, while Dr. Fajgenbaum was in college, his mother died of brain cancer. He declined rapidly as his immune system went haywire. A retinal hemorrhage, a type of ministroke, temporarily blinded his left eye. Fluids leaked out of his blood vessels, a sign that his liver was failing. Over the next two weeks, he gained about 70 pounds of extra fluid and his brain fogged over. For those who knew him as the Beast, the transformation was jarring. \u201cEven when he got sicker and sicker and eventually went into the hospital, it was kind of like this, oh, weird, Dave must have some really awful virus  \u2014   that\u2019s one hell of a flu,\u201d his friend Dr. Mitchell said. When Dr. Fajgenbaum\u2019s brain started slowing down, Dr. Mitchell said, the severity of the illness sunk in. \u201cI would ask him a simple question, and he would answer in a couple words, like 30 seconds to a minute later,\u201d he said. Dr. Mitchell and the other medical students scoured textbooks and the internet, searching for clues. The top medical experts at Penn, meanwhile, were not having much more luck. Lymphoma was just one theory. Others thought it might be a severe case of lupus or even mononucleosis. But test after test was inconclusive. Finally, the doctors tried a huge dose of steroids. Slowly, his body began to fight its way back. His kidneys and liver began functioning again, and the extra fluid receded. Seven weeks after he was admitted, Dr. Fajgenbaum walked out of the hospital. It was September 2010. \u201cI remember asking the doctor, saying, \u2018What was this? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I remember the doctor saying, \u2018We don\u2019t know what it was, but let\u2019s just hope it doesn\u2019t come back. \u2019\u201d It took only one month for symptoms to come rushing back, while he was convalescing at his childhood home in Raleigh, N. C. Doctors there shipped a piece of his lymph node to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where pathologists finally pinpointed his disease. The condition, called Castleman disease, was so rare that doctors at the hospital in Raleigh had no experience with it. Castleman disease had been known since the 1950s but has remained largely a mystery. A hallmark of the condition is enlarged lymph nodes, and most people with the disease  \u2014   about    \u2014   have a form that affects just one part of the body and can usually be cured through surgery. The form ravaging Dr. Fajgenbaum\u2019s body  \u2014   multicentric Castleman disease  \u2014   is even more rare and deadly. Only about 1, 200 to 1, 500 people are discovered to have it every year in the United States. It defied classification, occupying a no man\u2019s land between cancer and immune disease. Doctors weren\u2019t sure of the cause in patients like him: Some believed it was a type of cancer, while others thought it was an inherited genetic disorder, or was triggered by a virus. One thing was clear: The disease was deadly. Only about 65 percent of people with the condition live for five years after it is diagnosed, studies have shown. Over the next few years, Dr. Fajgenbaum alternated between extended periods of relative health and frightening relapses. His condition stumped even leading experts in the disease, people like Dr. Frits van Rhee of Little Rock, Ark. who has treated the largest number of patients  \u2014   about 100  \u2014   with Castleman. The tools that Dr. van Rhee and others had were blunt and harmful in their own right. More than once, Dr. Fajgenbaum underwent a devastating,   course of chemotherapy that annihilated his immune system in an effort to knock his disease into remission. Dr. Fajgenbaum was also granted emergency access to siltuximab, a drug that Johnson  Johnson was developing for people with his form of multicentric Castleman disease, which would  be approved in 2014. That year, in 2011, Dr. van Rhee secured a rare exception to try it on Dr. Fajgenbaum. But the drug, like other previous treatments, did not work. Dr. Fajgenbaum was undaunted. With the zeal he once devoted to   a personal best  \u2014   375 pounds, reached six months before he first fell ill  \u2014   he dove into the scientific research on Castleman disease and began to familiarize himself with the world\u2019s top experts. On Sundays, his roommate tried to coax Dr. Fajgenbaum out of his bedroom, with its white board covered in notes, organizational plans tacked to the wall. He rarely succeeded. \u201cI\u2019m on the couch watching TV, and Dave is just cranking away on Castleman,\u201d Dr. Mitchell recalled. The more Dr. Fajgenbaum learned, he said, the more he realized how much the field that studied Castleman was in disarray. Researchers focusing on the disease used different terminology to describe the condition, making it difficult to compare published work. Leading experts weren\u2019t in regular communication, and studies were being done over again, even though previous ones had failed. \u201cIt became just abundantly clear that just because you have smart people thinking about a problem doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s coordinated at all,\u201d he said. One of the people he called was Dr. Thomas Uldrick, a clinical researcher at the National Cancer Institute who had studied multicentric Castleman disease. The two struck up a correspondence. \u201cClearly he was a very bright medical student, and he was scared of dying from this disease,\u201d Dr. Uldrick recalled. He also began collaborating with Dr. van Rhee, who knew that Dr. Fajgenbaum was a different kind of patient after he arrived armed with charts, graphs, timelines and slide presentations. \u201cThere are patients who keep meticulous records,\u201d Dr. van Rhee said with a chuckle, \u201cbut he was definitely in the top 1 percent. \u201d In spring 2013 Dr. Fajgenbaum earned his medical degree, and a few months later he entered the Wharton School at Penn, reasoning that, to solve the tangled mystery of Castleman disease, business smarts would serve him well. But in December of that year he got sick again, with his blood platelets dropping so low that he barely avoided a fatal brain bleed. This time, though, he was able to use his relapse to further his search for a cure. For months, Dr. Fajgenbaum had been collecting weekly blood samples that served as snapshots of his immune system, tabulating the results in a spreadsheet and adding them to a detailed slide presentation that he had been preparing since he received the diagnosis. And when it was clear the disease had returned, he persuaded his doctors to remove a piece of a lymph node, test it and save it for future research. After a round of chemotherapy, he improved enough to be discharged and started looking into what secrets the tests might reveal. It turned out that five months before he started noticing symptoms in December, his T cells  \u2014   one of the key weapons in the body\u2019s immune arsenal  \u2014   had starting activating, preparing for a fight even though there was no apparent threat. Then, about three months before his relapse, he noticed that he had started producing more VEGF, a protein that instructs the body to make more blood vessels, and is another sign of an immune system gearing up. These two hints gave him an idea: Maybe the problem was with one of the body\u2019s communication lines, the one that triggered production of VEGF and also told the T cells to begin activating. If Dr. Fajgenbaum could get his body to shut down that communication line  \u2014   known as the mTOR pathway  \u2014   he might be able to stop his immune system from overreacting and prevent a relapse. The discovery was exhilarating. \u201cI felt like I was part of steering the ship,\u201d Dr. Fajgenbaum said. \u201cThis time I was part of this team. \u201d With this major clue in hand, he and his doctors turned to potential treatments, existing drugs that were known to shut down the mTOR pathway. The one that seemed the best option was practically hiding in plain sight. Sirolimus, also known as Rapamune, was commonly given to kidney transplant patients to prevent their bodies from rejecting the organ. The drug had been on the market for years and was known to have few serious side effects. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think I ever could have prescribed this to another patient, or told a patient to try it, because we just didn\u2019t have very much data,\u201d Dr. Fajgenbaum said. \u201cBut at this stage, I\u2019d had four episodes, and I\u2019d failed everything the doctors had ever given me. \u201d In choosing to become his own test subject, Dr. Fajgenbaum was following a long line of medical researchers who have experimented on themselves. At the turn of the 20th century, government researchers studying yellow fever in Cuba allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitoes who harbored the disease one researcher caught the fever and died. In 1929, Dr. Werner Forssmann inserted a catheter into the vein of his arm and guided it to his heart to prove that the procedure worked (he shared in a Nobel Prize for his work in 1956). As recently as 2005, Dr. Barry Marshall won the Nobel after drinking a broth infected with bacteria to prove that it caused ulcers. This activist approach, Dr. Uldrick said, did not sit well with everyone. \u201cThere was some tension between the various doctors about who was driving the boat,\u201d he said. But the idea that Dr. Fajgenbaum needed to try something new was unanimous: Chemotherapy had worked three times, but the powerful drugs take a heavy toll and can themselves cause cancer if given too often. Dr. Fajgenbaum eventually prevailed. In January 2014, he stopped taking his old cancer drugs and started on sirolimus. Six months passed, then a year. The weekly blood tests showed that his immune system was returning to normal. Dr. Fajgenbaum, his health improving, returned to the other challenges that were hampering progress in the field of Castleman disease. He started the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, a nonprofit whose mission was to prioritize and coordinate research into the disease, which operates out of the Perelman School of Medicine at Penn. Dr. Fajgenbaum, an assistant professor of medicine at the school, and his collaborators assembled an advisory panel of the world\u2019s experts in the disease and set an agenda for answering the most pressing questions. First on the list is figuring out the cause: Is the disease genetic, a form of cancer or caused by a virus? As always, the work is intensely personal. Last summer, he drove to Allentown, Pa. to collect a blood sample from a patient with Castleman disease. He placed the vials in his vest pocket, explaining that he needed to keep the blood warm so the tests he had planned would work properly. \u201cYou remind me of a mother hen,\u201d the patient said with a laugh. That gave him an idea: Dr. Fajgenbaum sat on the vials as he drove two hours back to Philadelphia, the car heater cranked up to ensure they were warm. It was a sweaty ride back, but worth it. \u201cThese samples are precious,\u201d he said. In medical research, discoveries come slowly and take twists and turns that no one saw coming. Seasoned researchers have learned to rein in their optimism and to know that true breakthroughs can take years, if not decades, to realize. Not Dr. Fajgenbaum. \u201cI almost wish that every disease had a David to be a part of the charge,\u201d said Dr. Mary Jo Lechowicz, a professor at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has studied Castleman disease and serves on the network\u2019s advisory board. Dr. Fajgenbaum\u2019s   mission to take on his own disease is also typical of the   world, said Max Bronstein, the chief advocacy and science policy officer at the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases in Novato, Calif. \u201cA lot of    patient organizations emerge to take on these huge challenges in rare diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one correct model for each disease there\u2019s been so many different approaches. \u201d Last month, Dr. Fajgenbaum marked his   anniversary since starting on sirolimus, a period more than twice as long as any of his other remissions. \u201cI feel 100 percent,\u201d he said. These days, Dr. Fajgenbaum, now 31, walks through the hallways of Penn\u2019s medical center, his frame again projecting the easy confidence of the athlete he once was. But he jokes that he would have to pull out photos of his days as a quarterback to explain to people why his friends still call him the Beast. Now, he said, every time he tries to exercise, his mind wanders back to an email he needs to write or a call he needs to make. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t have the energy to do it it\u2019s because all of my energy is going toward this disease,\u201d he said. Not everyone is convinced that sirolimus is what has been keeping him healthy. Dr. van Rhee noted that while the results in Dr. Fajgenbaum are promising, his is just one case and treatments need to be proven in many more people. \u201cI think the finding is very interesting,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we need to see whether a similar mechanism is active in other patients. \u201d But Dr. Fajgenbaum said he grew more confident every day that it is the drug that is helping. He has begun sharing his experience with more doctors and researchers, is conducting laboratory tests to see if the drug is likely to work in other patients and has started writing an article about his experience for a medical journal. Soon, he hopes, doctors will begin prescribing the drug to other patients. Dr. Fajgenbaum is optimistic about the drug\u2019s chances but is aware medical science is unpredictable. \u201cWho knows maybe it will work for only a small percentage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve still got a lot of work ahead of us. \u201d He now oversees the network\u2019s research from his office in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, five floors above the emergency room where he first learned his body was falling apart. It is also the same building where he spent weeks in the I. C. U. so sick that he said his final goodbyes to friends and family. At first, when he learned his office would be in the same building, he felt anxious, unsure if he wanted the constant reminder of the ordeal he had endured. A few months ago, Dr. Fajgenbaum was called to the I. C. U. to meet a patient who had just found out he had Castleman disease. He spoke to the patient about enrolling him in a new study, and as he looked out the window, realized the view looked familiar. On his way out, he bumped into a nurse who remembered him. She noted that he had stayed in the same room as a patient. Ultimately, he said, he is glad for the proximity. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would ever get to leave the hospital, and now here I am, fighting back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate motivator. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562246.5172114}
