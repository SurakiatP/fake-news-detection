Other law enforcement officers responding to the shooting ran after the suspect  \u2014   identified by the police as Nicholas Glenn, 25, of West Philadelphia  \u2014   and cornered him in an alley, where he was shot and killed. \u201cHe was hellbent on hurting a lot of people,\u201d Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. of the Philadelphia Police Department said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe still aren\u2019t absolutely clear as to why. \u201d The commissioner said that the authorities had discovered a \u201crambling\u201d note on Mr. Glenn\u2019s body, in which he expressed hatred for the police and mentioned a particular probation officer by name. The letter was found inside an envelope labeled \u201cdoomed,\u201d Commissioner Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about himself than it is about who he wanted to harm or anything like that,\u201d he said. The violence began around 11:20 p. m. the police said, when Mr. Glenn approached Sgt. Sylvia Young, 46, who was seated in her parked vehicle in West Philadelphia. Without saying anything, the man began firing into her window, Commissioner Ross told reporters at an earlier news conference on Saturday. Sergeant Young, a   police veteran, survived after leaning into the passenger seat to shield herself, the commissioner said. Mr. Glenn fired 18 shots, the police said, and some of them hit Ms. Young\u2019s left arm and a protective vest she was wearing. Two rounds struck and disabled her weapon, the police said. Commissioner Ross compared the shooting to a similar ambush in January that wounded another officer. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely astounded by the fact that they both survived,\u201d he said Saturday. Mr. Glenn fled after shooting at Sergeant Young, the police said, and along the way he fired five times into the open door of a bar, where he struck a security guard in the left leg. He then grabbed a woman and used her as a shield before shooting her in the leg, the police said. Mr. Glenn continued running, firing 14 times into a car occupied by a man and a    woman, the police said. The woman, who was shot seven times in the torso, died at a hospital around 2 a. m. on Saturday. Mr. Glenn ran into an alley, where he was pursued by a University of Pennsylvania police officer and two Philadelphia officers. He was fatally shot there, the police said, but not before wounding the university officer. The Philadelphia Inquirer identified the university officer as Eddie Miller, 56, a former Philadelphia police sergeant who joined Penn\u2019s police force two years ago. All of those wounded are expected to survive, officials said. The authorities did not release the names of the civilians who were wounded or the woman who was killed. Commissioner Ross said Mr. Glenn was \u201cwell known\u201d by the Philadelphia Police Department. The Inquirer reported that court records show Mr. Glenn had a history of   convictions. He also had been arrested and charged in connection with a   rape in November 2009, but those charges were later dropped, the newspaper said.'"}, "time": 1742563619.5522516}
