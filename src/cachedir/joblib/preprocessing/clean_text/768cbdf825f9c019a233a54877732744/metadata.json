Trump. The spectacle of the Mexican president standing next to the Republican candidate who has disparaged Mexicans prompted widespread dismay and anger here, and reportedly divided Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s cabinet. Luis Videgaray, the finance minister who stepped down on Wednesday, had championed the idea of inviting Mr. Trump to Mexico City over the objections of other ministers, according to several Mexican news media reports, though Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto insisted it was his own initiative. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced Mr. Videgaray\u2019s resignation at a news conference. He did not give a reason for Mr. Videgaray\u2019s departure. But some analysts interpreted it as the latest, and most dramatic, effort by the president to regain the trust of the Mexican public following his meeting with Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has made criticism of Mexicans and Mexico an incendiary motif of his campaign. \u201cIt will help mitigate the anger,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antonio Crespo Mendoza, a professor of politics at Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas, a Mexican research and higher education center. \u201cPresident Pe\u00f1a Nieto realized things could not stay as they were, and that they could no longer insist that it had been a good call\u201d to invite Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump cast his visit as a statesmanlike effort to reach out to a country he had alienated. But hours after his meeting with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, he gave a combative speech in Phoenix that struck many of the   themes that have defined his candidacy. The episode has left Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his government embarrassed at a time when his approval ratings were already at record lows over rising crime, poor economic growth and conflict of interest scandals. In the days after the meeting, the president scrambled to contain the fallout and to repair the damage  \u2014   using a television interview, a newspaper column and a    meeting held to mark his annual \u201cInforme de Gobierno,\u201d Mexico\u2019s equivalent of the State of the Union address. But these steps seemed to do little to mollify many Mexicans, who accused the president of humiliating the nation, first by inviting Mr. Trump and then by failing to use the opportunity to push back against the candidate\u2019s criticism of Mexico and Mexicans. The discontent has continued to simmer on social media and in the news, and an   Nieto demonstration has been called for Sept. 15. On Tuesday, an opposition senator  \u2014   seeking to provide the defense of Mexico that he said Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had failed to offer  \u2014   submitted a bill that would empower the government to fight several of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy proposals, including his promise to force Mexico to pay for the construction of a border wall and his threat to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cOf all the scandals Pe\u00f1a Nieto has faced, this is the most devastating,\u201d said Alfonso Z\u00e1rate, a political analyst and columnist in Mexico City. From Mr. Trump\u2019s perspective, the trip was a risky move from the start, given the potential for embarrassment if the Mexican president were to criticize him publicly. It came together after Jared Kushner, the    and campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, began to lay the groundwork with Mexican officials in early August. Mr. Kushner dealt with Mr. Videgaray and other government officials in negotiating how the meeting would happen, according to a close ally of Mr. Trump who was involved in the arrangements. Mr. Trump\u2019s visit was largely   and provided his campaign with pleasing visuals of the Republican nominee standing side by side with a head of state. But any positive effect was undone by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s insistence afterward that he had told Mr. Trump that Mexico would not pay for a border wall, a claim that contradicted Mr. Trump\u2019s account. Even so, the damage to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto seems to have been far worse. While Mr. Videgaray\u2019s resignation may have been intended to stanch the political bleeding in Mexico City and salvage the president\u2019s standing, it also shifted the odds in the contest for future leadership of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P. R. I. In addition, it left Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto without one of his closest confidantes in his administration. Mr. Videgaray, who holds a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been a rising star in the P. R. I. and his name was often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2018. He had worked for the president since 2005, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was the governor of the State of Mexico, helping him restructure the state\u2019s debt and coordinating Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2012 presidential bid. Mr. Videgaray became the president\u2019s closest ally and adviser in the cabinet  \u2014   \u201cthe power behind the throne,\u201d Mr. Z\u00e1rate said. His reputation was tarnished by reports he had bought a house at a golf club from a government contractor, though not enough to force him out of the cabinet or out of contention for 2018. The president, who is known for his loyalty to his inner circle, stuck by him. Indeed, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was accompanied by Mr. Videgaray when he made the announcement on Wednesday, and was warm and effusive toward his longtime adviser, thanking him for being \u201ccommitted to Mexico and loyal to the president of Mexico. \u201d Mr. Z\u00e1rate said the departure of Mr. Videgaray was \u201cvery painful for the president. \u201d He added, \u201cwe all know the enormous influence that he has. \u2019\u2019 \u201cIt leaves the president orphaned,\u201d Mr. Z\u00e1rate said. As finance minister, Mr. Videgaray was at the center of the administration\u2019s efforts to overhaul the country\u2019s telecommunications and energy sectors. He successfully pushed to open the nation\u2019s oil industry, which had been a   monopoly since the 1930s. He also championed a tax overhaul that increased tax revenue but earned him some enemies within the business community. During his tenure, however, Mexico saw slow economic growth and a weak peso, and the country\u2019s standing with   agencies has suffered. Moody\u2019s Investors Service and SP Global Ratings have each lowered their outlook from stable to negative in recent months. Economic performance has been so underwhelming that some analysts believe Mr. Videgaray\u2019s departure was an inevitability discussed well before Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. Furthermore, Mr. Videgaray is rumored to be a possible P. R. I. candidate for the governorship of the State of Mexico. \u201cI see this as a clear electoral play,\u201d said Genaro Lozano, a professor of United States government and society at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. \u201cThe State of Mexico is what they are betting on, what they have their eye on. It is one of the largest states in terms of population, with a solid and powerful P. R. I. structure, electoral support base and political mobilization. Even if they would put Trump\u2019s cousin as candidate for governor, P. R. I. would win. \u201d The cabinet shuffle occurred a day before the Mexican government was scheduled to present its 2017 budget, a job that now shifts to the new finance minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, whose appointment was announced at the news conference. Mr. Meade, 47, who has a doctorate in economics from Yale University, has been a significant player in the last two administrations. He was finance minister under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto made him the foreign minister in 2012. In that post, he broke from his reputation as an apolitical technocrat when he led an angry defense of the government against a United Nations report condemning Mexico for its use of torture on suspects in detention. Thirteen months ago, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto appointed him to head the Social Development Ministry, a post that elevated Mr. Meade to the level of a possible presidential candidate as he traveled around the country promoting the government\u2019s programs for the poor.'"}, "time": 1742563220.8961234}
