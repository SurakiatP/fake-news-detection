[The group, founded in 1982, is now the largest socialist organization in the United States and recently published a \u201cResistance Rising\u201d strategy to combat the Trump administration.  \u201cOn November 8, voters in the United States narrowly elected an openly racist, misogynist and nativist candidate for president,\u201d the organization\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe must understand \u2018Trumpism\u2019 as a   white nativist alliance the median family income of the 62 percent of white voters who supported Trump was higher than that of Hillary Clinton voters and wealthier than Bernie Sanders\u2019 primary base. \u201d Recently, the group organized protests outside Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s election party, calling on the new mayor to fight Donald Trump\u2019s deportation plans.
