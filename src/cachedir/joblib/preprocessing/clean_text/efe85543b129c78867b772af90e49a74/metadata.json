[The letter came in response to Pomona College President David Oxtoby\u2019s affirmation of commitment to free speech and intellectual diversity following the chaos that ensued during a lecture featuring Manhattan Institute scholar Heather MacDonald. Student protesters derailed her lecture on the rise of   attitudes by banging on windows and shouting, \u201cF*ck the police,\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter. \u201d Campus security ultimately forced MacDonald to livestream her lecture from a   room across campus.  \u201cProtest has a legitimate and celebrated place on college campuses,\u201d Oxtoby wrote, offering a condemnation of the conduct of the students who disrupted the event. \u201cWhat we cannot support is the act of preventing others from engaging with an invited speaker. Our mission is founded upon the discovery of truth, the collaborative development of knowledge and the betterment of society. \u201d Students at Pomona College, one of the schools in the consortium of Claremont McKenna Colleges, took issue with Oxtoby\u2019s statement and drafted a letter in response that was signed by students at the other colleges as well. \u201cFree speech, a right many freedom movements have fought for, has recently become a tool appropriated by hegemonic institutions. It has not just empowered students from marginalized backgrounds to voice their qualms and criticize aspects of the institution, but it has given those who seek to perpetuate systems of domination a platform to project their bigotry,\u201d the students wrote. \u201cThus, if \u2018our mission is founded upon the discovery of truth,\u2019\u201d the students continued, \u201chow does free speech uphold that value?\u201d Immediately dismissing the possibility that listening to MacDonald\u2019s lecture could widen their perspective, the students went on to explain how objective truth is a concept devised by \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d in an \u201cattempt to silence oppressed peoples. \u201d Historically, white supremacy has venerated the idea of objectivity, and wielded a dichotomy of \u2018subjectivity vs. objectivity\u2019 as a means of silencing oppressed peoples. The idea that there is a single truth \u2014  \u2019the Truth\u2019 \u2014  is a construct of the   that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain. This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples. The students go on to claim that Heather MacDonald is \u201cignorant of interlocking systems of domination that produce the lethal conditions under which oppressed peoples are forced to live,\u201d which is an explicit reference to the concept of intersectionality, an increasingly popular theory of oppression which conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan recently called a \u201creligion. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
