[Police arrested ten in connection with Rivas\u2019 death: four adults and six teenagers. FOX5 reports \u201cJose Ivan Castillo Rivas, 18, Springfield, Wilmer A. Sanchez Serrano, 21, Cindy Blanco Hernandez, 18, and Aldair J. Miranda Carcamo, 18\u201d are adults. Another    Venus Iraheta, who has lived in the U. S. for the past ten years \u2014  making her a \u201cDREAMer\u201d eligible for amnesty under an Obama executive order \u2014  is also in police custody. Police did not identify the other five juveniles. All ten face charges of abduction and gang participation. Rivas and Serrano are charged with murder.  Rivas died horribly on or close to January 8 of   trauma in a \u201csavage, brutal killing,\u201d Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler said. Police reportedly found video evidence of Rivas\u2019 death and declined to name the gang connected to the teenager\u2019s murder. According to Maria Reyes, Rivas\u2019 mother, her daughter had gotten involved with the El Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha or   recently. She told FOX 5 she is receiving violent threats from gang members \u201cblaming her for the arrests\u201d and is afraid for her own life. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement placed detainers on the four adults charged with murder and has asked Fairfax County to alert them before they are released from custody.   of the total population of El Salvador lives in the U. S. \u201cEl Salvador is the top country of birth for immigrants to Virginia,\u201d the Associated Press reported in 2014. Nearly a quarter, or 23 percent, of Northern Virginia residents are foreigners, and 68 percent of the state\u2019s   population lives there, researchers found in 2014. In 1970, only one in 100 residents in Virginia was   \u2014  but now, it is one in nine. Roughly 247, 000 illegal aliens live in Virginia, according to one estimate, meaning the state ranks in the top ten states with the largest populations of illegals. Among those are nearly 40, 000 illegals from El Salvador. Another estimate pegged the total number of illegals at 275, 000 in 2012, or 3. 5 percent of the state\u2019s population. Similarly, immigration led to a boom in the Latino or Hispanic population in Old Dominion since the 1990s: \u201cThe Latino share of Virginia\u2019s population grew from 2. 6 percent in 1990 to 4. 7 percent in 2000 to 8. 6 percent (or 707, 962 people) in 2013,\u201d according to the American Immigration Council. Without immigration from El Salvador, there would be no   in America and fewer machete murders and dismembered bodies buried in idyllic parks. Since the 1990s,   has operated in the Washington, D. C. area with thousands of members. Obama administration policies encouraged hundreds of thousands of Central American illegal aliens to surge into the U. S. and the administration helped them along by shipping them unannounced to unsuspecting American communities.   leaders stationed in El Salvador had told the U. S.  gangs to rebuild, and the large influx of young illegal aliens made the task easier. The Obama administration shipped illegal alien minors with clear   ties to   strongholds. One Department of Homeland Security official noted an \u201cuptick\u201d in   gang violence in the past two years, according to FOX5: \u201cHe said   and    in high schools work to recruit younger kids to help them carry out crimes because they are aware charges are less serious for juveniles. \u201d El Salvadoran nationals involved in gang violence at home bring their connections and plans for expansion to the United States. Chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force Douglas W. Keen pointed to \u201cincreased recruitment of unaccompanied minors\u201d illegally arriving in the U. S. \u201cWhen we debrief some of the arrestees they are telling us they were recruited at a young age and encouraged to commit crimes of assaults and larcenies. Then they move to narcotics and more violent crimes,\u201d Keen told the Washington Post. Director of the task force Jay Lanham also told FOX5 that gangs \u201care recruiting people as young as children in elementary school and they lure them through social media and parties where they offer them drugs, alcohol, and sex. \u201d Taxpayers, of course, foot the bill for the illegal aliens\u2019 schooling, social services, trials, incarceration, and the specialized task forces required to keep their explosive violence under control.'"}, "time": 1742564613.3819914}
