Indeed, now more than ever we don\u2019t notice it. It\u2019s barely part of the 2016 election, even though we\u2019re engaged in active conflict in half a dozen countries, toying with a relaunch of the Cold War with Russia and, of course, hemorrhaging, as always, more than half our annual discretionary budget on \u201cdefense.\u201d \\nWorld War II has been going on for seven decades now and has no intention of ever stopping . . . of its own volition. But this year\u2019s rocking electoral craziness \u2013 not just Hurricane Donald, but the unexpected staying power of the Bernie Sanders campaign \u2013 may well be the harbinger of transcendence. Apparently there\u2019s another force in the universe capable of standing up to the American, indeed, the global, military-industrial status quo. \\nSlowly, slowly this force is organizing itself and taking human shape. This isn\u2019t a simple process. After all, the game of empire \u2013 the game called war, the game of domination \u2013 has been coalescing political power for several thousand years now. \\nBut our current military budget was birthed by the wars of the 20th century. William Hartung , writing recently at TomDispatch, shows the fascinating connectedness of the wars that followed VE and VJ Days, as the corporate beneficiaries of the Big War aligned with mainstream politicians of both major parties and coalesced into the Washington consensus. Over the decades they have engaged in an ongoing struggle to maintain military spending at breathtakingly high levels and avoid any sort of transition to something called peace. \\nThe two pillars of this consensus, as Hartung points out, are the ideology of \u201carmed exceptionalism,\u201d that a shifting array of enemies are out there itching to destroy us, but we will persist in our mission to maintain order in every corner of the planet; and the \u201cstrategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and Congressional districts,\u201d ensuring entrenched political power for the arms lobby. \\nSo World War II initially, as we know, morphed into the Cold War, America\u2019s crusade against communism, which was set into motion in 1950 by a long-classified report (NSC-68) prepared by the State and Defense departments and the CIA, urging the vigorous containment of Soviet expansion and the development of the hydrogen bomb. \\nPresident Truman \u201cwas somewhat taken aback at the costs associated with the report\u2019s recommendations,\u201d according to history.com , and \u201che hesitated to publicly support a program that would result in heavy tax increases for the American public, particularly since the increase would be spent on defending the United States during a time of peace.\u201d \\nPeace! What a nuisance! But: \u201cThank God Korea came along,\u201d as an aide to Secretary of State Dean Acheson put it at the time. The Korean War gave the militarists the enemy they needed and the nuclear arms race, and so much else, was born. The military budget was set for decades. \\nAs Hartung points out, the next terrible hurdle the budget boys faced was in the wake of the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. That war, and the universal draft that essentially pulled the whole country into a front-row seat for it, spawned a passionate antiwar movement and, ultimately, a moldering national disgust for war, known as Vietnam Syndrome. The Cold War continued, but the U.S. military was confined to proxy wars for a while and had to rethink its strategy. \\nTwo things happened. The universal draft was ended, removing most of the American middle class from a life-and-death stake in our military operations; and Saddam Hussein, our ally, was recast as Adolf Hitler. And in 1991, President George H.W. Bush embarked on a month of war with Iraq known as Operation Desert Storm. Not only did the US\u201cwin\u201d this war and kill over 100,000 Iraqis (and ultimately cause hideous health problems for American soldiers), but, perhaps most importantly: \u201cBy God, we\u2019ve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all.\u201d So the president proclaimed. \\nUnfortunately for the war consensus, the Soviet Union dissolved a short time later and the Cold War ended . . . and a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d loomed. Hartung notes that Gen. Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed the situation thus: \u201cI\u2019m running out of demons. I\u2019m running out of villains. I\u2019m down to Castro and Kim Il-sung.\u201d \\nWould military spending be diverted to infrastructure repair, free education, universal health care? \\nWell, no. The Bill Clinton presidency found a few new demons. It fought a war in Kosovo and, on the domestic front, vastly expanded the prison-industrial complex. Meanwhile, the neocon think tanks cogitated and one of them, the Project for a New American Century, reflecting the fact that geopolitical thinking had stopped with World War II, decided that what America needed was a new Pearl Harbor . And then came the presidency of George W. Bush, 9/11, and the Global War on Terror. And the US military budget was carved, seemingly, in stone. \\nBarack Obama was elected president in 2008 on the promise of serious change, but any hope that he intended to upend W\u2019s wars was soon dispelled. He dumped the name but kept the wars, essentially settling \u201cfor a no-name global war,\u201d Hartung writes. \u201cHe would shift gears from a strategy focused on large numbers of \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 to an emphasis on drone strikes, the use of Special Operations forces, and massive transfers of arms to US allies like Saudi Arabia. . . . (O)ne might call Obama\u2019s approach \u2018politically sustainable warfare.\u2019\u201d \\nAnd here we are, immersed in a no-name global war that has no logical end and few serious critics in the world of mainstream media and politics. But maybe the American democracy is not the closed system it\u2019s supposed to be. \\nFor instance, John Feffer , director of Foreign Policy in Focus, points out that Donald Trump, in all his fun-house recklessness, is shaking up the consensus: \u201cDemocrats and Republicans disagree about many things. But with a few exceptions they all support an enormous military budget, an expensive overseas expeditionary force, and unilateral acts of force when necessary to protect US national interests (understood broadly). \\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd paradox that Trump, who blathers on about making America great again, departs from this consensus.\u201d \\nHe won\u2019t win, and he shouldn\u2019t win for a million reasons, but in his recklessness he has touched the raw anger of a sizable chunk of the American electorate. Sanders, speaking with compassion and integrity and delivering a far different message, managed to tap the same well of public outrage. And, as Feffer noted, \u201cthe mainstream is worried that the political parties will realize that the \u2018bring the war dollars home\u2019 message can win a national election and disrupt the comfortable revolving-door consensus.\u201d \\nAnd World War II will finally end? Not this year, but maybe four years from now, if we refuse to let the war consensus have any peace in the interim. \\nRobert Koehler is an award-winning, Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer.
