(VIDEO)   \\nThere are only a few days left in this election and Republicans are growing more and more desperate, using what Seth Meyers called \u201cincreasingly unhinged rhetoric\u201d during Thursday\u2019s Late Night segment of A Closer Look. \\n\u201c\u2018Republicans are using increasingly unhinged rhetoric to warn about the consequences of electing Hillary,\u2019 Meyers said. \u2018Many are even threatening to impeach her without any evidence of a crime before she ever takes office and if they can\u2019t do that, they\u2019ll settle for the next best thing \u2013 preventing her from filling any vacancy on the Supreme Court for her entire four year term.'\u201d \\nBut that\u2019s not all they\u2019ve done \u2014 there have also been more death threats and calls to violence. Former Congressman Joe Walsh, who, like Donald Trump, enjoys Twitter WAY more than he should, tweeted this on November 1: \\nAnother shocking GOP turn is from Ted Cruz, who just a few short months ago, during his speech at the RNC, refused to endorse Trump, but just today he hopped on Trump\u2019s plane to go campaign for him in Iowa. This, after Trump accused Cruz\u2019s father of killing JFK and also said horrible things about his wife. Remember that \u201cbaked bean teeth\u201d comment Trump made? Yeah. Just plain nasty. \\nIt\u2019s really unfortunate that Cruz caved, but the GOP is so terrified of losing control, that they are willing to forget their own pride and pull out all the stops to keep Clinton out of office. \\nWatch Seth Meyers break it all down. It\u2019s pretty terrifying. \\nFeatured Image via video screenshot Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742562675.9035661}
