It will be able to penetrate the body armor currently worn by Islamic State jihadists. [According to Army Times, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday and told them the Army is working on the new bullet.  Milley said, \u201cThe 5. 56 round, we recognize there is a type of body armor it does not penetrate, and adversarial states are selling that stuff on the Internet for about 250 bucks. \u201d He then pointed out that the Army is already onto a solution, saying, \u201cWe know we have developed a bullet that can penetrate these new plates. \u201d Sen. Angus King ( ) asked if the new bullet requires a new rifle. Milley said, \u201cIt might, but probably not. \u201d King asked if the new rifle could be an \u201cexisting,   \u201d model, and Milley said, \u201cYes, there are several options out there. \u201d For now, the Army is replacing the M4 with a Heckler and Koch 417 chambered in a 7. 62 mm \u201cfor squad designated marksmen. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \u201cBullets with AWR Hawkins,\u201d a Breitbart News podcast.
