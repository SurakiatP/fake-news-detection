[The bill, the chief architect of which was Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, was dubbed Obamacare 2. 0, as it failed to fully repeal parts of Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.  Some of the problems with the bill included persistent rising health care costs and maintaining certain health care provisions for illegal aliens, potentially leaving both Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration vulnerable to an electoral backlash. Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to fully repeal and replace Obamacare, making it a priority during his first months in office. Having taken office, Trump\u2019s first executive order called on federal agencies to \u201cease the burden\u201d of Obamacare by giving states \u201cmore flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market. \u201d ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017,  However, Trump supported the recent bill, stating that he was \u201c100 percent\u201d behind it and blaming the Republican Freedom Caucus for its failure. He has since said that when Obamacare \u201cexplodes,\u201d a new healthcare plan will be put in place. On Wednesday evening, Paul Ryan was seen entering the White House to discuss redrafting the bill, which was called the American Health Care Act. One of the key issues of contention surrounding a redraft are regulations imposed on insurance companies, which opponents say are driving up the cost of healthcare for everyone, besides those with   conditions. The failure to secure a deal on health care has left both Trump\u2019s and Republicans\u2019s approval ratings at record lows just months into a new administration. With a crowded agenda of tax reform, immigration enforcement, as well as preventing a potential government shutdown, Republicans must prioritize securing a good healthcare deal if they are to hold onto both their House and Senate majorities.
