[Dr Roy Spencer, meteorologist and noted climate skeptic at the University of Huntsville, Alabama, reports at his website that the shots were aimed at the office of his colleague and fellow sceptic, Dr John Christy:  A total of seven shots were fired into our National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) building here at UAH over the weekend. All bullets hit the 4th floor, which is where John Christy\u2019s office is (my office is in another part of the building). Given that this was Earth Day weekend, with a March for Science passing right past our building on Saturday afternoon, I think this is more than coincidence. When some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way. It doesn\u2019t matter that we don\u2019t \u201cdeny global warming\u201d the fact we disagree with its seriousness and the level of human involvement in warming is enough to send some radicals into a tizzy. Our street is fairly quiet, so I doubt the shots were fired during Saturday\u2019s march here. It was probably late night Saturday or Sunday for the shooter to have a chance of being unnoticed. Maybe the \u201cMarch For Science\u201d should have been called the \u201cMarch To Silence\u201d. Campus and city police say they believe the shots were fired from a passing car, based upon the angle of entry into one of the offices. Shell casings were recovered outside. The closest distance a passing car would have been is 70 yards away. Both Spencer and Christy have long incurred the wrath of climate alarmists for the work they do debunking the junk science behind the global warming scare. What they have shown is that the \u201cglobal warming\u201d recorded by accurate satellite measurements is considerably less dramatic than that shown on the heavily adjusted earth surface temperature datasets preferred by climate alarmists. Christy has made himself especially unpopular by testifying in Congress last month that the climate establishment is corrupt and untrustworthy and that a Red Team needs to be created to correct false \u201cConsensus Science. \u201d He told Congress: I\u2019ve often stated that climate science is a \u201cmurky\u201d science. We do not have laboratory methods of testing our hypotheses as many other sciences do. As a result what passes for science includes, opinion,    dramatic press releases, and fuzzynotions of consensus generated by preselected groups. This is not science. I noticed the House passed an amendment last year to   the U. N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC.) We know from Climategate emails and many other sources that the IPCC has had problems with those who take different positions on climate change than what the IPCC promotes. There is another way to deal with this however. Since the IPCC activity is funded by US taxpayers, then I propose that five to ten percent of the funds be allocated to a group of   scientists to produce an assessment that expresses legitimate, alternative hypotheses that have been (in their view) marginalized, misrepresented or ignored in previous IPCC reports (and thus EPA and National Climate Assessments). Such activities are often called \u201cRed Team\u201d reports and are widely used in government and industry. This is not, it would appear, a message that those in the Climate Change industry  \u2014   sometimes known as the Climate Industrial Complex or the Green Blob  \u2014  want to hear. Especially not the more extreme elements, it seems.'"}, "time": 1742563618.6620612}
