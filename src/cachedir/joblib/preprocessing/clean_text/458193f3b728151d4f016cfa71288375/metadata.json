Well, I think I\u2019ve found a jeweler you may want to consider for your darling\u2019s bling-bling. \\nA jeweler in Lubbock, Texas is offering a free firearm with the purchase of a ring. That\u2019s right, if you get married, you can get some protection as well! (Pun intended). \\nEverythingLubbock.com reported on this awesome offer: \\nThacker Jewelry is hosting their annual Shotgun Wedding Sale next week where customers who buy a ring will get a gun for free. \\n\u201cWe started this tradition I believe it was, it\u2019ll be three years now,\u201d Thacker Jewelry Owner Joe Thacker Said. \u201cThe idea, of course, is the word play and the old shotgun wedding. Not going back to the negative connotation playing off of that and it\u2019s been a lot of fun. We had a lot of people participate and this year we\u2019ve even gotten into it more,\u201d \\nThacker said the entire store will be on sale, with engagement rings on special. Anyone who purchases a ring will also get a gift certificate for a shotgun or a rifle with LSG Tactical. \\n\u201cAny time any of their customers go over there and purchase something that meets their qualifications, they get a gift certificate for either a Remington 870 shotgun or a savage bolt action rifle,\u201d LSG Tactical Steve Burns said. \\nFor Texas, this does not come as any big surprise. Texans love their guns. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s very natural for most Texans,\u201d Burns said. \u201cMost guys grew up hunting or at least exposed to hunting if not by their family, but by their friends, or social groups. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s pretty natural for all of us.\u201d \\n\u201cFarming, hunting, ranching its all intertwined,\u201d Thacker said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a natural fit for Texas.\u201d \\nWhile the free gun may be the most enticing aspect of a ring purchase for a lot of men, make sure you teach your to-be finance how to shoot as well! The ladies especially need to know how to use that gun, arguably more than we do. \\nSince men are typically stronger physically than women (sorry feminists, I didn\u2019t create the human anatomy), we might be able to fend off an attacker if we don\u2019t have a gun on us (though you should!). \\nBut our ladies may have a more difficult time of it, since they have smaller frames and typically less muscle mass. What better way to even the playing field with thugs than to teach her how to shoot? \\nA ring and a gun, that\u2019s a deal that\u2019s hard to beat, in my mind! So what are you waiting for, gentlemen?'"}, "time": 1742563811.6035874}
