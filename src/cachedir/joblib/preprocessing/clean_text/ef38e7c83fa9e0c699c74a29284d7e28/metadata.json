Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nDonald Trump\u2019s message that everything in the U.S. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only Trump can fix got slapped down today as the U.S. economy \u201croars back\u201d. \\nThe advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter of 2016 showed that the Obama economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9%. The conservative Wall Street Journal headlined this news with, \u201cU.S. Economy Roars Back, Grew 2.9% in Third Quarter.\u201d \\nJason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, summarized the numbers, \u201cReal GDP grew 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending.\u201d \\nThis news flies in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix. \u201cThe Trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral,\u201d Trump\u2019s website claims. \\nBefore these numbers, Trump\u2019s previous problem was that Trump\u2019s economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent, isn\u2019t revenue neutral and would destroy 11 million jobs. Trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run. \\nThe conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that Trump\u2019s plan would cost the US trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by 10%-16%. Trump\u2019s tax plan could cost the U.S. 11 million jobs. \\nAccording to a report released at the end of July by Moody\u2019s Analytics, Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections. \u201cThe analysis shows that, if implemented, the Democratic nominee\u2019s agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent.\u201d \\nUnder Trump\u2019s plan, Moody\u2019s estimated that unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million Americans would be put out of work. \u201cThe U.S. economy will weaken significantly if Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed,\u201d the June report said. \u201cThe economy will suffer a recession that begins in early 2018 and extends into 2020\u2026even longer than the Great Recession.\u201d \\nYikes. \\nTrump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts. Trump earned a \u201cPants on Fire!\u201d from PolitiFact for this claim made June 16th, 2015 in his presidential announcement speech, \u201cThe last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product \u2026 was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It\u2019s never below zero.\u201d \\nBut also they note, \u201cFinally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we\u2019ll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents.\u201d \\nToday\u2019s new economic numbers help Clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under President Obama. \\nHillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jacob Leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say, \u201cToday\u2019s GDP release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years\u2026 But Hillary Clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Independent experts agree her plan would create good-paying jobs through investments in infrastructure, innovation and education.\u201d \\nThe economy is roaring back under President Obama, and the numbers suggest that it does better under a Democratic president. Donald Trump keeps saying Clinton is 4 more years of Obama, which makes a sunny case for her. \\nTrump is already struggling with just 11 days to go until the election on November 8th, and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle. Reality has spoken, and it doesn\u2019t agree with Donald Trump\u2019s vision of America.\""}, "time": 1742561858.1129315}
