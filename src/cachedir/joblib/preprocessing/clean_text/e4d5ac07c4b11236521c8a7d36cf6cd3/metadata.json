Trump's victory party By Liam Miller / filmsforaction.org \\nHere we are. President Trump. \\nI\u2019m going to say it again. The pain will stop sooner. We have to toughen ourselves up. \\nPresident Trump. \\nLook. I\u2019m not surprised. \\nTurnout was low. Trump and Clinton each got 58 million votes and change. But it was enough to hurl Trump into office. \\nThe polls were close; but Clinton\u2019s supporters just haven\u2019t been passionate enough, while Trump\u2019s supporters are all too. \\nWe\u2019re looking at a bad situation. Potentially nightmarish. But we\u2019re also looking at the one situation that can get people to start working together who might otherwise have simply continued to jockey for power. (I\u2019m looking at you, establishment Democrats.) \\nMind you. It\u2019s still wretched. But look at it this way: now, we can deal with our racist, sexist, patriarchist history head on. \\nEvery Sanders supporter is, deep inside, saying \u201cI told you so\u201d. And they\u2019re right. \\nVirtually every poll had Bernie thumping Trump soundly. All the arguments people make in favor of Trump, which they seemed to think outweighed his flaws, included bucking the system. All of those people would have voted for Bernie. Someone very close to me, who had been a Republican for four decades, registered Democrat to vote for Bernie in the primary; and they voted for Trump yesterday. \\nBernie was the people's candidate; independents (who now comprise 45% of the electorate) favored him 2:1. There's no doubt he would have trounced Trump; but there is also no doubt that Bernie's ideas are America's ideals. We just can't let these lunatics have their way with the country. \\nSo look. There\u2019s really no time to lose. Let\u2019s get the ball rolling. The midterms are two years away; we need to win big. Trump has a Republican Congress; dear lord, the horror. There's a presidential election to win two years after that. Local elections up and down the line. And a lot of grassroots organizing, fundraising, and door-knocking to accomplish. \\nAt least the Koch brothers and most of the establishment Republicans hate him too. \\nPull together, people.
