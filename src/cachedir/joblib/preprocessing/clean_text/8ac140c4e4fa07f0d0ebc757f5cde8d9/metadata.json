Hasan Minhaj, a senior correspondent at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d will be the featured performer at the dinner on April 29, the association said on Tuesday. He will join the ranks of Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O\u2019Brien and other stars who have skewered Washington at the annual gathering. But Mr. Minhaj, an   and Muslim who regularly roasts President Trump in his day job, will ascend the dais at a dinner that is shaping up to be far more tense than in previous years. Mr. Trump is skipping the festivities, the first president to do so since the 1970s, and his staff will boycott them, too. Vanity Fair and Bloomberg canceled their famed,    . And the event is playing out against the backdrop of a historically strained period of relations between the administration and the news media. Comedians for the dinner are typically announced months in advance, and some   names, including the   host James Corden, reportedly declined invitations this year. Without Mr. Trump on hand to punch back, some journalists in Washington were concerned that a   monologue attacking the president would give an impression of bias. \u201cI was not looking for somebody who is going to roast the president in absentia that\u2019s not fair and that\u2019s not the message we want to get across,\u201d Jeff Mason, the president of the correspondents\u2019 association, said Tuesday morning on MSNBC. \u201cI was looking for somebody who is funny and who is entertaining, because I want the dinner to be entertaining, but who can also speak to the message that the whole dinner is going to speak to: the importance of the free press,\u201d Mr. Mason added. Mr. Minhaj, 31, joined \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in 2014 and has become popular among viewers with his cheerfully acerbic takes on current events. A   immigrant, Mr. Minhaj wrote and performed \u201cHasan Minhaj: Homecoming King,\u201d an Off Broadway show in 2015 recalling his youth in California and his struggles with ethnic identity. Some of his \u201cDaily Show\u201d commentary about the president has been scathing, and personal. The day after the election, Mr. Minhaj described his anxieties about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Muslims, saying that his mother had asked if she would be allowed back into the United States after a foreign trip to visit relatives. \u201cThe fact that I can\u2019t tell her \u2018yes\u2019 with 100 percent certainty is heartbreaking,\u201d Mr. Minhaj said. \u201cThat is my mom, and I need her back home. Because I love her  \u2014   and she owes me $300. \u201d In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Minhaj called it \u201ca tremendous honor to be a part of such a historic event even though the president has chosen not to attend this year. SAD!\u201d \u201dNow more than ever, it is vital that we honor the First Amendment and the freedom of the press,\u201d Mr. Minhaj added. Officials at the correspondents\u2019 group say the dinner will be focused on promoting journalism, with the famed writers Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward to present awards for White House reporting. Scholarships funded by the association will also be at the forefront. Alec Baldwin, who caricatures Mr. Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d called Mr. Mason at one point to talk about the possibility of an appearance, according to two people familiar with the discussion. The actor would likely have appeared as himself, and not in his Trump guise, the people said, in part because \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d would have to give permission for Mr. Baldwin to reprise the impression outside of the show. But some journalists in the Correspondents\u2019 Association felt that awarding a featured spot to Mr. Baldwin could inject a blunt partisanship into the proceedings. Would network news anchors, for instance, feel comfortable laughing along with Mr. Baldwin  \u2014   live on camera  \u2014   if no one from the White House administration was there to reciprocate? A representative for Mr. Baldwin said that the actor planned to be in Los Angeles during the weekend of the dinner. Regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s participation, there has been little question that this year\u2019s event would have a different feel. \u201cIt\u2019s a new president, it\u2019s a new administration, and we\u2019ve faced new challenges,\u201d Mr. Mason said in an interview on Tuesday, \u201cand the dinner reflects those things. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564270.0941753}
