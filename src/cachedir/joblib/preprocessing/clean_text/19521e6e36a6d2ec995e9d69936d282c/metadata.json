[In a communique Sunday in the Basque newspaper Gara, ETA said disarmament \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be a bargaining chip, but rather a way to show the intransigence of the (Spanish and French) states and to further the independence movement. \u201d  Two weeks ago ETA gave French authorities a list of eight caches where police found weapons, ammunition and explosives in a historic step toward disarmament. Inactive for over five years, the ETA killed 829 people, mostly in Spain, in a   campaign for independence. Spain and France have both demanded it disband. ETA made no mention of dissolving in Sunday\u2019s communique, its first since handing over its weapons.'"}, "time": 1742561832.9820309}
