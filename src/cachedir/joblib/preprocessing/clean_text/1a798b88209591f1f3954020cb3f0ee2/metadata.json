This will be the most important election in American history. \\nWe were once a country a freedom, and now we\u2019re becoming a country of tyranny. We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our cities: Ferguson, Missouri; Milwaukee; Atlanta; Florida; Baltimore. We are all witness to our own people killing our policemen. Islamic terrorists have killed thousands of people all over our country, and Hillary and Obama want to be politically correct and pretend all the killings are not happening. \\nHow many Americans are aware of George Soros? \u2014 an evil man who turned hundreds of Jewish people over to the Nazis to be exterminated during World War Two. He was interviewed on \u201960 Minutes\u2019 and was asked if he feels guilty for what he\u2019s done, and arrogantly he said, \u2018Absolutely not. If I didn\u2019t do it, someone else would have.\u2019 Soros is a billionaire who makes most of his money manipulating currencies and almost bankrupting many countries. He supports hate groups responsible for taking down our cities. He\u2019s a close friend of Hillary Clinton and a major supporter of her campaign. \\nRobert De Niro is a millionaire, as are so many of our Hollywood stars who are voting for Hillary, and who have absolutely no tolerance for anyone of a different opinion, forgetting that that is what our country is founded on \u2014 freedom of choice. But they will not be affected by Hillary\u2019s open borders. Only the poor and middle class will suffer. Thousands of refugees will flood our nation, and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys. It will kill our economy, which is at an all time low now under years of Obama\u2019s presidency, and Hillary boasts of how proud she will be to continue Obama\u2019s legacy! \\nNo one can afford health insurance now. Prices for health care have gone through the roof. Thanks to Obamacare, our once reasonable health care is gone. With Hillary as president, we will lose our Second Amendment with our right to bear arms. Freedom of religion will be attacked, and Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. Our highest courts will become socialists, and she will restrict what America was founded on \u2014 our freedom to become a small business owner, and pursue our own personal dreams. \\nShe has blood on her hands from the Benghazi terrorist raid. Four of our American patriots died. And when the parents stood over their loved ones\u2019 coffins, she lied to them about the cause of their sons\u2019 deaths. \\nThe pendulum of freedom is not balanced. Hillary and her followers are running a cruel campaign to stop and degrade all of Trump\u2019s followers. Her words were echoed loud and clear for all Americans to hear. Hillary said, \u2018Trump\u2019s followers are a basket of deplorables. They are unredeemable.\u2019 \\nMay God protect the real truth, and may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America, and he will certainly make it great again. \\nThank you.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561797.504654}
