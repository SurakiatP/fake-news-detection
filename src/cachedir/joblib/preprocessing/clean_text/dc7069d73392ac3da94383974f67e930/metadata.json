Unable to fall back to sleep, he would go to his computer and write. \u201cAt the time, it felt like a very sad discovery, that I still so wanted to write,\u201d Mr. Lehrer said during a recent interview in an empty conference room at his publisher\u2019s office in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cAfter everything happened, I thought I was done as a writer. \u201d Many  \u2014   including Mr. Lehrer  \u2014   assumed that his career was over after it came to light that he had plagiarized material in his work for Wired, recycled his own writing in blog posts he wrote for The New Yorker and fabricated quotations from Bob Dylan in his book about creativity. He lost his position as a staff writer at The New Yorker. His publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, recalled two of his books, \u201cImagine\u201d and \u201cHow We Decide. \u201d His banishment from the profession seemed permanent. Now, as he tries a comeback with \u201cA Book About Love,\u201d a new work of nonfiction that draws on social and psychological studies and examples from literature to explore the nature of love, Mr. Lehrer is facing fresh criticism, as well as support. Some are skeptical that he has changed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to get the ethos of journalism,\u201d said Charles Seife, a professor of journalism at New York University who conducted an investigation into Mr. Lehrer\u2019s work for Wired in 2012. \u201cThe deficits were so profound in the first round that I can\u2019t imagine him starting afresh. \u201d But others  \u2014   even some of his most ferocious former adversaries  \u2014   say that Mr. Lehrer deserves a second chance. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in destroying a person\u2019s life forever, and if Jonah wants to redeem himself, Godspeed to him,\u201d said Michael Moynihan, a correspondent for Vice, who first discovered and wrote about Mr. Lehrer\u2019s fabricated quotations from Mr. Dylan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t deny the guy a chance to right a wrong like that. \u201d In an author\u2019s note at the beginning of the book, Mr. Lehrer refers to his \u201cmistakes and failures\u201d and writes, \u201cI am ashamed of what I\u2019ve done. \u201d He describes the steps he took to ferret out errors and exaggerations in his new work. He hired an independent fact checker and sent sections of the book to his sources in advance of publication, allowing them to vet their quotations and his descriptions of their research. The book has 27 pages of footnotes. Those steps might not satisfy Mr. Lehrer\u2019s critics. If early reviews are any indication, his new book, which comes out on Tuesday from Simon  Schuster, will be highly polarizing. Some have praised the work and defended Mr. Lehrer\u2019s decision to write it. \u201cHe\u2019s had his public humiliation, and from the evidence of this book, a chastened Jonah Lehrer has a lot to offer the world,\u201d the New York Times   columnist David Brooks wrote in a forthcoming review for The Times Book Review. \u201cThe book is interesting on nearly every page. \u201d But others have argued that Mr. Lehrer, while more diligent about citing the work of others, still takes inexcusable intellectual shortcuts. In a recent review in The New York Times, Jennifer Senior slammed \u201cA Book About Love\u201d as \u201cinsolently unoriginal\u201d and claimed that Mr. Lehrer had appropriated the arguments and insights of others, concluding that \u201cit may be time, at long last, for him to find something else to do. \u201d Mr. Lehrer defended his approach. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of synthesis, trying to bring together various studies, and translate it into a form that helps people understand this vast body of research,\u201d he said. During an hourlong interview, Mr. Lehrer, 35, sat almost perfectly still and seemed at times uncomfortable talking about himself. When asked why there were no acknowledgments in the book, he said he chose to send private thank you letters to people who supported him, rather than name them publicly and expose them to scrutiny. He is not planning to go on a book tour, and he no longer gives   lectures. \u201cA Book About Love\u201d grew out of the wreckage he had made of his life, Mr. Lehrer said. \u201cI regret the kind of writer I\u2019d become,\u201d said Mr. Lehrer, a California native who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two young children. \u201cI was invested in the superficial markers of success, and I wasn\u2019t focused on making the work as good and true as possible. \u201d After he was exposed, Mr. Lehrer often woke up at 2 in the morning, consumed by regret and guilt, and would go to his laptop to write about what he had done, and the aftermath. \u201cThat writing became   in the literal sense, writing to understand myself,\u201d he said. Around that time, he read about the Harvard psychiatrist George Vaillant\u2019s research, which showed how crucial secure relationships are to   health, financial success and happiness. He decided that he wanted to write a book about the feeling that sustained him when he torpedoed his career and his reputation. \u201cWriting has always been the means by which I explore the ideas I want to know more about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became this personal investigation. \u201d But those who approach \u201cA Book About Love\u201d hoping for a   memoir will be disappointed. Virtually none of what he wrote about himself and his experience ended up in the book. (Mr. Lehrer said he used his \u201craw personal experience\u201d to frame the ideas in the book, but felt he wasn\u2019t very good at writing memoir.) Instead, he focuses on studies of the bonds between parents and children and spouses, and explores the differences between infatuation and lifelong partnerships. Though the inspiration for the book was deeply personal, Mr. Lehrer doesn\u2019t reflect much on his own life or relationships. He describes his struggle to become a better husband and parent, and writes about how he found solace in caring for his toddler daughter after his journalistic crimes were exposed, but doesn\u2019t go into great detail. Mr. Lehrer said one motivation for writing the book was that he wanted to be able to show his children that he had learned from his mistakes, and changed. \u201cI always wondered how I would tell them the story of what I lost and my failures, and how I hurt their mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to say, I did something terrible, I broke the most basic rules of my profession, but I learned a lot from it and I wrote one more book. \u201d Even so, Mr. Lehrer said it took a while to convince his wife, a   lawyer, that writing the book was a good idea. Not surprisingly, he faced a new wave of criticism in 2013 when news broke that he had sold a manuscript to Simon  Schuster. In an article for Slate, Daniel Engber combed through a leaked copy of Mr. Lehrer\u2019s book proposal and pointed to evidence of improperly cited material. (Mr. Engber was unimpressed by Mr. Lehrer\u2019s new work, and wrote, \u201cLehrer may have given up on outright fraud, but he\u2019s still prone to spreading bunk. \u201d) Given Mr. Lehrer\u2019s reduced profile, \u201cA Book About Love\u201d is unlikely to match his earlier blockbuster sales. Simon  Schuster is publishing 23, 500 copies of the book, a modest number for an author whose previous three books collectively sold more than 350, 000 print copies, according to Nielsen. Jonathan Karp, the president and publisher of Simon  Schuster, said that he felt confident that Mr. Lehrer had reformed and that he deserved a chance to publish his work again. \u201cThis is a talented writer, who I think has apologized profusely for what he did,\u201d he said. \u201cIs he just supposed to walk away from his calling?\u201d Mr. Lehrer\u2019s editor, Ben Loehnen, said he was reassured by the extra measures Mr. Lehrer took to   his work, and said he had seen some of Mr. Lehrer\u2019s correspondence with his fact checker. \u201cI\u2019ve felt all along that talent of his sort is too rare to condemn him to lifelong banishment,\u201d Mr. Loehnen said. Mr. Lehrer has not recovered everyone\u2019s trust. David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, said he had no intention of publishing Mr. Lehrer\u2019s work again. Representatives for Wired and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt declined to comment on whether they would consider publishing new work by Mr. Lehrer. Still, some prominent journalists have stood by him, applauding his return. Robert Krulwich, the   of Radiolab, on WNYC, who has known Mr. Lehrer for about 15 years, said he supported Mr. Lehrer\u2019s decision to return to writing. \u201cI said to him, you have things to say, and you have the talent to say them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you want to do this for some more of your life, then you\u2019re going to have to pay the price, and you can\u2019t ever let this happen again, ever. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562093.8274891}
