It took five years for Juno to travel this far on its $1. 1 billion mission, and the moment was one that NASA scientists and space enthusiasts had eagerly  \u2014   and anxiously  \u2014   anticipated. At 11:53 p. m. Eastern time, a signal from the spacecraft announced the end of a   engine burn that left it in the grip of its desired orbit around Jupiter. Cheers and clapping erupted at the mission operations center at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif. which is managing Juno. \u201cThis is the hardest thing NASA has ever done,\u201d Scott Bolton, Juno\u2019s principal investigator, told the mission team a few minutes later. \u201cThat\u2019s my claim. \u201d Status messages for each maneuver of the spacecraft came in as expected. The length of the engine firing turned out to be within one second of what had been predicted. Diane Brown, the program executive for Juno at NASA headquarters, described the performance as flawless. \u201cTo know we can all go to bed tonight, not worrying about what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, it\u2019s pretty awesome,\u201d she said at a news conference. Rick Nybakken, Juno\u2019s project manager, held up a sheaf of papers as he celebrated the smooth execution of the maneuver. \u201cWe prepared a contingency communications procedure, and guess what?\u201d he said, ripping the papers. \u201cWe don\u2019t need that anymore. \u201d Juno is just the second spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter. NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft spent eight years there surveying the planet and its many moons. But except for a probe that parachuted into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, Galileo did not have the tools that Juno does to delve into what lies beneath Jupiter\u2019s clouds. \u201cWe have a chance with Juno to go back and study the planet in its own right,\u201d James L. Green, the director of planetary science at NASA, said during a news conference earlier on Monday. Jupiter, most likely the first planet formed after the sun, is believed to hold the keys to understanding the origins of our solar system. How much water it contains and the possible presence of a rocky core could reveal where in the solar system Jupiter was created and provide clues to the early days of other planets. Juno\u2019s instruments are designed to precisely measure the magnetic and gravitational fields of Jupiter and the glow of microwaves emanating from within. That, for instance, will give hints about storm systems like the visible Great Red Spot, which has persisted for centuries, although it has been shrinking. \u201cJuno is really searching for some hints about our beginnings, how everything started,\u201d Dr. Bolton said. \u201cBut these secrets are pretty well guarded by Jupiter. \u201d Dr. Bolton repeatedly described Jupiter as \u201ca planet on steroids\u201d in discussing the unprecedented dangers Juno faced Monday night. Ensnared by Jupiter\u2019s gravity, Juno accelerated quickly to its rendezvous with the planet, passing within the orbit of Callisto and Ganymede, two of the main moons, on Sunday. It zoomed past the other two, Europa and Io, on Monday. Juno has been on its own since Thursday, performing a programmed sequence of actions. Around 10:30 p. m. on Monday, Juno passed over Jupiter\u2019s north pole and through a region that Heidi Becker, the leader of Juno\u2019s radiation monitoring team, described as \u201cthe scariest part of the scariest place. \u201d In this belt of radiation, electrons bouncing back and forth at nearly the speed of light could have knocked out the computer and other electronics. \u201cThey will go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Dr. Becker said. But a titanium vault built for Juno proved up to the task of shielding its crucial systems. At 11:18 p. m. Juno\u2019s main engine began firing to slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by the planet\u2019s gravity. Juno also passed through the plane of Jupiter\u2019s diaphanous rings. Although the mission planners had chosen a place that they thought would be clear, they could not be certain, and even a piece of dust colliding with a spacecraft moving at 130, 000 m. p. h. could have caused considerable damage. Juno traveled within 2, 900 miles of Jupiter\u2019s cloud tops, passing through almost the exact spot that the navigators had aimed for after its 1.   voyage. \u201cIsn\u2019t that incredible?\u201d Mr. Nybakken said. Then Juno headed outward again, away from Jupiter. After the end of the engine burn, the spacecraft pivoted so that its solar panels were again facing the sun. Sunlight at Jupiter is one   as bright as at Earth, and Juno\u2019s three    panels with 18, 698 solar cells generate a mere 500 watts to power the spacecraft and its instruments. \u201cNow the fun begins, with science,\u201d Dr. Bolton said. For now, Juno is on a   orbit. Its scientific instruments, which had been turned off for the arrival at Jupiter, will be turned back on in two days. On Aug. 27, it will swing back for its first good   look at Jupiter. Juno will fire its engine again on Oct. 19 to move to a   orbit, when the science measurements begin in earnest. The spacecraft will have to make multiple flybys, Dr. Bolton said, before the scientists will be able to start answering questions like whether there is a rocky core at the center of Jupiter. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hesitant to guessing the wrong answer until we see more information,\u201d Dr. Bolton said. With a different vantage point from Juno\u2019s polar orbit, the spacecraft\u2019s cameras are likely to add to the number of known moons of Jupiter, now 67. \u201cI expect that we will see some, and the number will keep going up,\u201d Dr. Bolton said. The assault of radiation each time Juno zooms past Jupiter will take its toll on the electronics. As the mission progresses, the orientation of the orbits will pivot, and Juno will pass through the more violent portions of the radiation belts. On the 37th orbit, scheduled for Feb. 20, 2018, Juno is to make a suicidal dive into Jupiter, ending the mission, the same way that the Galileo spacecraft was disposed of in 2003. That is to ensure that there would be no possibility of Juno\u2019s crashing into Europa, regarded as one of the likelier places for life elsewhere in the solar system, and contaminating it with microbial hitchhikers from Earth. Even in the best outcome, the mission might be extended a few months.'"}, "time": 1742562533.0369015}
