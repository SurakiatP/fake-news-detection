After waiting in limbo for two years, he said he was only days away from getting on a plane to the United States when he heard that President Trump would be barring entry to refugees. Mustafa did believe it. He teared up, saying his life was over at age 28. An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip. When she read on Facebook about the temporary ban, Alwia Abdullah, 43, who fled from Darfur in Sudan to Jordan with her husband and six children, got a sudden, stabbing pain in her gut, and couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cWe left because we were discriminated against in Darfur,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to be discriminated against by a U. S. president, by a nation we see our future in, is so disheartening. How do you live with that?\u201d They were among an estimated 110, 000 people in line to be processed for resettlement in the United States during this fiscal year. In fact, they thought they had already made it through the rigorous vetting procedure and, after years of waiting, were on the verge of having their hopes realized. Now, all are suddenly, indefinitely waiting again, barred from entry to the United States for at least four months, according to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday, with no assurances of what could happen to them next. The order, Mr. Trump said, is a way to \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said at the Pentagon. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. \u201d The executive order calls for the United States\u2019 annual refugee quota to be cut to a maximum of 50, 000, compared with 85, 000 allowed in during the fiscal year ending in September 2016. Even last year\u2019s figure was dwarfed by the historically high number of displaced people in the world, 65 million, or by the more than 1. 5 million migrants and refugees arriving in European countries since 2014. Mr. Trump\u2019s order also suspends the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, calling their arrival \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States. \u201d Beyond that, it suspends visas to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee ban, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said he hoped \u201cit\u2019s a temporary one. \u201d He noted that more people were displaced around the world than ever before. \u201cThe U. S. resettlement program is one of the most important resettlement programs the U. N. works with,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s action was the latest closed door in a world that has become increasingly unwelcome to refugees, amid rising concerns and hostility in many resettlement countries in Europe, and in countries of first refuge like Turkey and Lebanon. For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week. Faten Diab, 34, a former charity worker from Syria, said she had been told that she and her family would be among a relatively small number of Syrians allowed into the United States. Last year, only 10, 000 had been granted that privilege, compared with 40, 000 in Canada. Ms. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time. They said the friends had received a final decision just over a week ago and had flown to America. The Diabs had reason to hope that their own number would come up any day. Now, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple\u2019s    daughter could be heard playing in the background. \u201cWe are so, so, so sad,\u201d Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown. \u201cThe process of resettlement is long and difficult. You can say he is wrong. Because he didn\u2019t live the application steps in all its difficulties. \u201d Strictly speaking, America does not actually owe anything to the Diabs from Syria or the Abdullahs from Darfur they are just reacting to its historical promise to take the world\u2019s \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free. \u201d But in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump\u2019s proscribed list. Laith   37, was one of many who could not believe it. A former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from   militants in his Baghdad community. He was not ashamed to beg. \u201cPlease Mr. President, you are the president of one of the biggest states in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty in taking this decision. Be fair with us. \u201d Mustafa, the    Iraqi, is a Shiite Muslim who worked on construction crews on American bases, mostly on fortifications. As he put it: \u201cI made homes for them that kept them safe. I felt I was doing something good for humanity. \u201d But   militias in his neighborhood discovered what his job had been and accused him of treason. \u201cI was beaten and shot and knifed and eventually came to Lebanon two years ago,\u201d he said, during an interview arranged in Beirut by the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New   legal aid group. After years of interviews and investigation, Mustafa said he was finally told to take his medical examination and now only needed to be given the date for his flight, to California. To get ready, Mustafa splurged at a   Beirut store to buy the clothes he would wear into his new life: dark green pants, a vest, a checked shirt in four colors. \u201cI would wear the best clothes I have, and I wouldn\u2019t take anything else with me, not even my memories,\u201d he said. Mustafa still has some hope that somehow exceptions will be made, which is why  \u2014   like most of the refugees interviewed for this article  \u2014   he did not want his full name published. \u201cIf I do get rejected,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d regret ever having shaken hands with an American. \u201d He struggled not to weep. Sardar Hussain, 16, an ethnic Hazara boy from central Afghanistan, was rocked by disbelief. He said that when he was 13, his father, mother and younger sister were killed when a bomb blew up a taxi that was taking his mother to a hospital. After paying a smuggling network $7, 000 to get him to Australia, he was marooned en route, on the Indonesian island of Java, when Australia cracked down on boats bringing refugees there. For seven weeks, he slept on the sidewalk behind the United Nations offices in Jakarta, Indonesia. Now, after more than two years, he said, his flight to America was scheduled for Monday. \u201cWe were given a commitment to go there,\u201d he said, speaking softly in English at a coffee house in Jakarta, just after completing his final medical exam. Firas   23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment. He was a university student and opposition activist in Syria before fleeing his hometown, Raqqa, now the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital. He was still looking for answers. \u201cIs Trump trying to fight the terrorists by giving up on the victims of the very same terrorists?\u201d he asked. \u201cISIS wants to destroy our lives, and now Trump declined to give us one. \u201d Sara, 31, a former television presenter who fled to Indonesia from Afghanistan after death threats  \u2014   the Taliban and other cultural conservatives despise seeing Afghan women in public at all, let alone on television  \u2014   was trying to arrive at answers of her own. \u201cYou just wait,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see how the years pass. You get older, you cannot make any plans. You watch your dreams die with every second you spend waiting. \u201d After three years and four months, she thought that the waiting was finally over, and that she would soon have a date when she was allowed to fly. Now her life has been suspended for at least four more months, with no guarantee that she will still be included in the Trump administration\u2019s   refugee quota once the visa moratorium is lifted. \u201cThe bitter truth,\u201d she said, \u201cis that your whole life is dependent on a single decision of someone who doesn\u2019t have even the slightest idea what it\u2019s like to live as a refugee. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628569.4871984}
