Crystal Mangold, 38, paused as she carried her young daughter down Main Street. \u201cNo idea what it is,\u201d she said. Angie Searles, 45, perked up at the mention. \u201cOh, I just saw that on the news,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s going. \u201d The march galvanized hundreds of thousands of women across the country who packed buses and airplanes to flock to the nation\u2019s capital to fight for reproductive and civil rights under the Trump administration. Across the country, they rallied en masse on Saturday in downtowns, wearing pink   knit \u201cpussy hats,\u201d waving handmade signs and sharing pictures on social media with the hashtag #WomensMarch. But as conversations unfolded in Niles, a riverfront town of 11, 000 in southwest Michigan, it was a reminder of how the country has become a split screen on issue after issue. \u201cThose women don\u2019t represent me or my viewpoints,\u201d said Leta Nielsen, 66, a retired teacher, who added that she hoped that demonstrators would not start fires like the ones she saw on the news from the protests surrounding the inauguration on Friday. In Niles, the biggest draw of the weekend was the annual ice festival, which attracted people from all over the region to admire elaborate ice sculptures lining the sidewalks, participate in a 5K race and sample the tall, spicy bloody marys at the Brass Eye cocktail lounge. \u201cI don\u2019t think my husband would support me going,\u201d said Stephanie Palmisano, 26, a medical worker who supported Hillary Clinton but whose husband voted for President Trump. \u201cTrump winning has caused a lot of tough conversations in our marriage. I have two little girls. For a president who thinks so low of women, it just breaks my heart. \u201d Lucy VandenHeede, 79, said that her    and two granddaughters had taken a bus to Washington from Kalamazoo, Mich. to attend the march and that she was cheering them on from afar. Women\u2019s rights have come a long way, she said, recalling the days when she worked in the newspaper business selling advertising and was paid far less than her male colleagues. \u201cThey earned commission, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was always called \u2018Mrs. John VandenHeede.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even have a name. \u201d \u201cShe was the best salesman in the bunch, too,\u201d said her husband, Mr. VandenHeede. Other women sharply questioned the notion of protesting a president whose administration had begun only the day before. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of offensive,\u201d said Linda Hine, 56, an accounting manager who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cPeople are just criticizing because they didn\u2019t get their way. All it did was force another reason for people to be divided. \u201d Ms. Hine interpreted Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech on Friday as a generous, uplifting call to bring people together, contradicting the belief of others that it had painted an overly dark and gloomy picture of the country. \u201cIt was about unity,\u201d she said. Her friend Kim Redman, 48, said that as opponents of abortion, they would not have felt welcome at the march anyway, echoing a frequent complaint that only women who favor abortion rights were encouraged to attend. If women would just give Mr. Trump a chance, he might not be as bad as they expect, she said. \u201cHe\u2019s our president no matter what,\u201d she said. Why do women need a march at all, some people asked, when they have made so many gains in the past few decades? \u201cWomen have equal opportunities in the workplace now. We\u2019ve got minorities in jobs. The glass ceilings have opened up all across the nation,\u201d said Tammy Chesney, 53, a carpenter, adding that she had never experienced discrimination on the job. She shrugged off Mr. Trump\u2019s comments that he had grabbed women\u2019s genitals without asking permission. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he apologized, and it was in the past. It was blown all out of proportion. \u201d There are bigger concerns in Niles than expanding the rights of women, many people said. They worry about the state of local schools, the cost of health care and the town\u2019s economy, which has struggled with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d had special resonance in Rust Belt towns like Niles, said Tracy Guetterman, 49, a retail manager, as she stopped to show her    granddaughter Melanie an ice sculpture in the shape of \u201cU. S. A. \u201d \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d love to see our country go back to one parent working, like the good old days,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be able to quit my job. \u201d Ms. Guetterman saw the marches as nothing more than complaining from liberals. \u201cQuit blaming everybody for your problems,\u201d she said. \u201cGet out there and do it yourself. \u201d Yet many of the sentiments from the Women\u2019s March were echoed in the voices of people in Niles, about 600 miles from Washington. Diane Kellenburger, 69, a retired executive for a nonprofit organization who had purple streaks in her gray hair, showed off a gold medal from the 5K race, where she had the fastest finish in her age group. She had friends who went to a nearby march in Valparaiso, Ind. and she shared their disgust at Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude toward women. \u201cPersonally, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far with women\u2019s rights. I have a high level of concern that we\u2019re stepping backward. \u201d Kim Shelton sat behind the counter of her memorabilia shop downtown, a business that she said is dependent on tourists, as local people have so little to spend these days. Michigan flipped to Mr. Trump, she insisted, because its residents believe he is a successful businessman who can turn things around. Ms. Shelton is not so sure whether he will pull that off, she said, but she is convinced that he does not respect women like her. \u201cI keep hoping, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to change,\u201d she said. \u201cI think women are going to take a few steps back with Trump. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561845.0938542}
