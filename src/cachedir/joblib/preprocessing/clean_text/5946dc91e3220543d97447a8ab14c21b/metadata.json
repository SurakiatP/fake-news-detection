He had stolen their money. Mr. Farley, 55, the longtime treasurer of the   nonprofit club, had pocketed $120, 000 from the organization\u2019s bank accounts  \u2014   money paid by parents so that their children could play. A county court judge had ordered Mr. Farley to repent publicly to club members as part of his guilty plea, and so there he stood, in front of a throng of children sitting   on a grassy ball field waiting to play. The club\u2019s leaders were so fearful that an irate parent might charge or assault Mr. Farley that they hired security to maintain order. \u201cYou try to be a good example to your children,\u201d Mr. Farley, whose son and daughter had played for the club, told the gathering. \u201cWhat I did was one of the worst examples you could ever set for your children. \u201d The youth sports boom in the United States, fortified by at least 30 million participants, has turned what were once homespun local leagues into   enterprises with annual budgets that experts who track nonprofits say regularly reach $250, 000  \u2014   if not twice that. Yet with the growth and development has come a long list of embezzlement and other corruption cases unfolding in a void of oversight and regulation and capitalizing on community trust. Across the country, people who volunteered as treasurers and other officers for Little Leagues and sports clubs have been prosecuted for pilfering gobs of money from the coffers: $220, 000 in Washington, $431, 000 in Minnesota, $560, 000 in New Jersey, and so on, according to law enforcement authorities, league officials, experts on nonprofit organizations and news reports. The approximately 14, 000 youth sports organizations in the United States take in annual revenue of about $9 billion, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics. Oversight of those sums is haphazard and not centralized, as there is no national agency in the country watching over youth sports. Investigators and prosecutors in several states say embezzlement investigations involving youth sports have become common, almost always committed by unpaid board members who are highly regarded in their communities. It is difficult to say whether the problem with embezzlement has worsened or if the growth of the leagues simply means more cases there is no clearinghouse comprehensively tracking fraud in youth sports. But investigators say the problem gets little public discussion even as, by some measures, there are signs of mounting cases. In the last five years, there have been hundreds of arrests and convictions in 43 states involving 15 sports, based on a study of news accounts and a database compiled by the Center for Fraud Prevention, an organization that aims to mitigate embezzlement in youth sports. And those are only the cases that have become public. Law enforcement officials estimate that they see only about half of the actual fraud in youth sports because organizations often cover up smaller misappropriations to protect their reputations and preserve the ability to raise money in the future. Some leagues have dissolved as a result. Most organizations survive, but they often must defer buying new uniforms fixing up insufficient or dangerous fields purchasing equipment and financing capital projects. Over all, the rate of fraud across the youth sports landscape, which includes thousands of prosperous travel teams, is probably small in scale given the vast scope of youth sports. In general, there is little data of any kind on how extensive embezzlement is among all nonprofit groups, let alone youth sports associations. Yet watchdogs of the nonprofit industry note that youth sports organizations rarely put in place routine checks and balances, such as having multiple people in charge of the money, opening the door to fraud. \u201cPeople treat youth sports groups as social clubs and vest all their trust in one individual because they all know each other, but these organizations need to be treated like businesses with all the same internal and external financial controls,\u201d said James Martin, the Lehigh County district attorney, whose office prosecuted Mr. Farley\u2019s case. \u201cYes, everyone starts out with the best intentions, but then something usually goes wrong and no one is really watching. \u201d A husband and wife were implicated in Michigan after a neighbor, an accountant whose sons played for the baseball league, joined the board and scrutinized the books, leading investigators to a case that uncovered $300, 000 in missing money. In Winslow, Me. (population 7, 794) there were three theft charges against members of volunteer sports clubs in a   span, including one person who was charged with stealing from two  clubs. In Wisconsin, a   soccer mom confessed to another soccer mom about taking money from the local club, only to discover she was taking even more money. A woman in Vermont was convicted of stealing from a fund established to honor a dead child who had been a club member. The exposure of embezzlement leaves communities thunderstruck and wounded at the revelation of neighbors stealing from neighbors, friends cheating friends. The children of the accused are often best friends with the children of the accusers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t comprehend having to tell the 700 kids in our entire membership that the money was gone and they couldn\u2019t play soccer anymore because their treasurer was a thief,\u201d Diane Miller, the   Youth Soccer Club\u2019s current treasurer, said last month, recalling Mr. Farley\u2019s arrest in 2013. \u201cI wanted to cry. \u201d While a preponderance of cases occur in suburbia, there have been dozens of arrests in farm communities and in big cities, too, including Manhattan. \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of cash involved in these organizations, and whenever there\u2019s cash, there\u2019s people eyeing the cash,\u201d said Tim Delaney, president and chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits. Erik Carrozza, the founder of the Center for Fraud Prevention, said: \u201cSomeone can easily skim 20 percent off the top and it will not be noticed for a while. Twenty percent for five years ends up being a lot of money. \u201d That money gets spent in a variety of ways. The police have reported that purloined money has gone to dog grooming, tickets to Walt Disney World, illicit drugs, a child\u2019s wedding, fishing trips, financial advice, N. F. L. and Major League Baseball tickets, lingerie, large deliveries of yard mulch, college loans and the interest on personal property being held in pawn shops. Gambling debt has played a role in many cases. Kevin Short, a lawyer who represented a hockey league official in Minnesota convicted of tax evasion after stealing more than $400, 000 from a league, said casino debt in fraud cases is so common now that investigators routinely check gambling habits when embezzlement is suspected. \u201cIt\u2019s a standard question,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cSince gambling came into Minnesota, we\u2019ve been having problems and embezzlement. \u201d Prosecutors and defense lawyers say that many others who have embezzled from youth sports organizations have done so because they were enduring a period of financial distress because of a divorce, a job loss or both. From a   facility where he is confined after serving several months in jail, Kevin L. Baker said he stole more than $200, 000 from the Kent Little League in Washington State because he was trying to survive financially. \u201cI\u2019m usually a trustworthy, honest person,\u201d Mr. Baker, who was the league\u2019s treasurer for seven years, said in a telephone interview last month. \u201cI got in a bad situation, and when you\u2019re in a bad situation, you make decisions that you wouldn\u2019t normally make. \u201d Since 2007, Mr. Baker, who coached his two sons in the league, had been a responsible volunteer at the league\u2019s many activities. But in 2011, he lost his job, and his wife moved to Idaho with the couple\u2019s sons as part of a divorce. A grandfather who had helped raise Mr. Baker and had been a father figure also died around the same time. To raise his spirits and to try something new  \u2014   his grandparents had run a tavern  \u2014   Mr. Baker decided to spend $100, 000 to buy a bar. The business started strong, then flagged precipitously. Mindy Young, who prosecuted the case, said Mr. Baker had taken money from the Kent Little League in 271 transactions that included cashier\u2019s checks for as much as $20, 000. He knew that no one truly scrutinized the treasurer\u2019s books he had been doctoring. But on Dec. 9, 2014, Kent\u2019s Little League president, Greg Whitcomb, went to an Office Depot and tried to use the league\u2019s A. T. M. card to buy $18 worth of envelopes. The purchase was denied. Based on the financial reports he had been receiving from Mr. Baker, Mr. Whitcomb believed the league had $227, 000 in bank and investment accounts. For a decade, the league had been soliciting donations and were finally on the verge of buying their own baseball and softball fields. The Kent Little League was actually in debt, owing uniform manufacturers $20, 000. \u201cWorse, all the hard work by volunteers raising money for years was lost,\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said. Mr. Baker turned himself into the Kent police. \u201cI felt so guilty I couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Mr. Baker, who has since been ordered to pay $208, 000 in restitution. Last year, Mr. Baker, who had no previous criminal record, was sentenced to 22 months in jail. It often takes suspicious board members or officers to uncover the wrongdoing. In the case involving Pennsylvania\u2019s   Youth Soccer Club, Mr. Farley\u2019s crime was not uncovered until a new club president, Tino Babayan, hired a lawyer to advise the club about various matters, including its finances. The lawyer quickly became suspicious of Mr. Farley\u2019s bookkeeping, especially when the club\u2019s retainer check bounced. Mr. Babayan learned that 80 percent of the club\u2019s money was missing. \u201cFarley was basically paying off his bills and living as if the club\u2019s account were his own,\u201d said Steven Luksa, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case. Mr. Farley declined to be interviewed last month, but his lawyer, George Heitczman, said that when his client lost his job working on Wall Street, he began making loans to himself from the club\u2019s account. \u201cHe felt he was just borrowing, but that is a slippery slope,\u201d Mr. Heitczman said. \u201cThere were some payments back to the league, but Brian got so far behind. \u201d Meanwhile, the club\u2019s board members, facing a host of unpaid bills, were suddenly desperate to keep   solvent. Mr. Farley offered the club and prosecutors a restitution deal the organization\u2019s leaders and the club\u2019s parent group balked. Diane Miller, the new treasurer, had pored over the bank records and saw that the club\u2019s A. T. M. card had been used to pay for $500 hairdressing appointments, hotel stays, wine and cigars. \u201cAt that point, I wanted to find him,\u201d Ms. Miller said of Mr. Farley, \u201cand spit in his face. \u201d But the club, which needed the infusion of cash, took the deal, which amounted to $55, 000. Mr. Farley received five years of probation and was ordered to make gradual, systematic repayments to   for the remainder of what he owed the club. Mr. Farley, who has remained in the Allentown, Pa. area, has been paying back the money at about $225 a month and recently told another board member that he intended to pay back the roughly $60, 000 he owes the club. Ms. Miller is skeptical. \u201cWe\u2019ll never see it all,\u201d she said. Board members were forced to dip into their own pockets for $200 or $300 each to pay some of the club\u2019s most urgent expenses and keep it afloat. This year, the club is thriving, with a growing membership roll. Coaches and other club members have adapted to new policies mandating invoices and receipts for any reimbursable expenses, regardless of how small the sum. Two board members are also required to extensively review the club\u2019s books monthly. \u201cWe can\u2019t let anything go unexamined,\u201d Ms. Miller said. Like the   Soccer Club, the Kent Little League in Washington had to run on a skeleton budget before it rebounded in part because several local sponsors donated time and money when they heard of Mr. Baker\u2019s theft. A software company that had been working on a new league website chose to finish and install the website for free, allowing valuable registration fees to flow into the league\u2019s bank accounts faster. Still, the Kent Little League misses the more than $200, 000 it intended to spend on new fields, cash Mr. Whitcomb knows the league will probably never recoup. As Mr. Whitcomb retrieved the mail at home not long ago with his    son, he saw an envelope from Mr. Baker. \u201cI smirked and handed it to my son and said, \u2018Here\u2019s the first restitution payment to your Little League,\u2019\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said. Inside the envelope were two checks for $14 and $11. There is another common thread to many fraud cases in youth sports: the scarcity of people running them, which significantly hampers the necessary oversight. Overscheduled, working parents are hesitant to commit the time to serve on boards. And no one wants to be an organization\u2019s treasurer, which is the most tedious, thankless job. \u201cPeople are always asking, \u2018Can I pay to get out of my time working in the concession stand? \u2019\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said. Many affluent organizations have turned to paying the officers of their boards of directors as an incentive to serve. Others are hiring bookkeepers. Crime or fraud insurance designed specifically to cover youth groups is gaining in popularity. There are groups that have tried to fill the void, like the National Alliance for Youth Sports, a   nonprofit and youth sports advocate that helps train coaches and administrators. Little League offers guidelines to community leagues and training and information for volunteers. Nonetheless, in recent years youth sports officials have found themselves forced into unforeseen roles: crime investigator, mediator and crisis management specialist. \u201cYou start out wanting to help kids and you end up doing things you never thought you\u2019d have to do,\u201d said Mr. Babayan, no longer the   Soccer Club president. When Mr. Farley concluded his   apology to hundreds of young soccer players, Mr. Babayan, who had exposed Mr. Farley\u2019s embezzlement, was standing a few feet away. As Mr. Farley dropped one arm and uncomfortably raised his gaze to the crowd, Mr. Babayan diplomatically stepped forward to grasp the microphone from Mr. Farley\u2019s clenched fist. The children appeared confused. The parents were miffed. An awkward silence enveloped the grounds. \u201cNo one had ever seen anything like that before,\u201d Mr. Babayan said. Eventually, the players stood and separated into groups. It was time to play.'"}, "time": 1742562666.0390687}
