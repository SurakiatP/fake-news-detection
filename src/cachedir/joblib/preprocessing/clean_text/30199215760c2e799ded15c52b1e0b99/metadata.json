In defense of Dakota Access\u2019s land grab, the police deploy militarized equipment, including tank vehicles, to brutally disperse and round up water protectors. The people taking a stand are shipped to facilities throughout the North Dakota, and some even report numbers were written on their arm before they were put in dog kennels.\\nThis is the backdrop for which Americans can appreciate Inuit throat singer Tanya Tagaq, who was born in Iqaluktuutiaq in Nunavut, Canada. She is a strong indigenous voice, who stands with the indigenous people of Canada in their struggles, including against extraction companies. And her new album, \u201cRetribution,\u201d confronts the pillaging and plundering of the Earth quite boldly.\\nAs Tagaq told the Canadian magazine, \u201cExclaim!\u201d, \u201cThere\u2019s a general feeling of hurting the Earth and destroying the landscape and destroying ourselves, and that evil, non-consensual land grab, the take, the take. The rape of the land. The rape of residential schools, the non-consensual taking and where that originates from. It\u2019s all united.\u201d\\nThe 7-minute track, \u201cRetribution,\u201d is a warning to humanity that there are consequences for our non-consensual relationship with the Earth. She says in the intro, \u201cOur mother grows angry. Retribution will be swift.\u201d \\n\u201cWe squander her soil and suck out her sweet black blood to burn it,\u201d Tagaq adds. \u201cWe turn money into God and salivate over opportunities to crumple and crinkle our souls for that paper, that gold.\u201d \\nShe surmises. Humanity invests its time into \u201chollowing philosophies\u201d in order to \u201cplacate the fear of our bodies returning back into our mother.\u201d We collectively fear our own mortality. \\n\u201cThe path we have taken has rotted,\u201d Tagaq further warns. \u201cIgnite, stand upright, conduct yourself like lightning because the retribution will be swift.\u201d \\nTagaq\u2019s introduction gives way to a cacophonous symphony paired with the wordless exhortations that define her music. Her screams for Mother Earth carry a foreboding element, like there is nothing humans can do if we refuse to address our rotten relationship with the planet. What goes around comes around, and we should prepare for the natural disasters, for the drought, for the famine, and for whatever other hardships may lie ahead as Mother Earth responds to our abusive treatment of her.\\nThrough \u201cRetribution,\u201d Tagaq expands the concept of rape culture to include the exploitation of the environment along with the rape and abuse of women. It is all connected because it implicates a patriarchal society incapable of respecting life. \\n\u201cFor many years, my whole shtick was trying to spread awareness for indigenous rights and human rights, but when I was younger, people would just roll their eyes,\u201d Tagaq told \u201cExclaim!\u201d. \u201cSo I [started] doing this wordless performance, to have people understand what it felt like to be an indigenous woman. And it worked! People were leaving thinking, \u2018Why am I feeling this? What\u2019s resonating within me?'\u201d\\nIndeed, the essence of her throat singing is a swirl of torment and desire to keep one\u2019s soul clean in the face of a world that renders so much that is pure and good dirty. It represents the imbalance in our give and take. We cannot continue to take without giving because at a certain point, Mother Earth will have nothing left to give. \\nIn an article from CBC, she is quoted, \u201cEnough of hurting the planet. Enough of the judicial system that has allowed this and enough of the government taking, taking, taking and not giving out the education it owes to Canadian citizens. Canadian citizens deserve to be taught our history and why things are the way they are.\u201d\\nOne one hand, Tagaq\u2019s powerful music is brilliant because it pushes the boundaries of artistic expression. On the other hand, integral to its power is ugly truths that are not only relevant to Canada or the United States but to much of the world that is not far removed from perpetual climate calamity. \\nListen to \u201cRetribution\u201d: \\n\\nThe post Protest Song Of The Week: \u2018Retribution\u2019 by Tanya Tagaq appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n\""}, "time": 1742561850.4944806}
