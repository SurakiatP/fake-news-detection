So does Google.\u201d \\nThe company\u2019s detractors\u2014including small European start-ups, some local politicians and significant American firms like Oracle\u2014disagree with Google\u2019s optimistic outlook. \\n\u201cGoogle has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it\u2019s still on the right track,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, which represents those of Google\u2019s rivals that filed complaints against the company\u2019s perceived dominance. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that\u2019s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,\u201d he added. \\nDealBook continues: \\nWhatever happens, Google\u2019s battle in Europe will not end overnight. \\nEuropean officials must first review the company\u2019s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest. \\nIf found to have breached the region\u2019s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process. \\nYet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.'"}, "time": 1742563750.9525156}
