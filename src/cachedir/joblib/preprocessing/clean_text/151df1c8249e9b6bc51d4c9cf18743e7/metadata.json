Would you consider appointing Obama?\u201d \\nClinton replied enthusiastically, \u201cWow! What a great idea! Nobody has ever suggested that to me! Wow! I love that! Wow! He may have a few other things to do, but I\u2019ll tell ya, that\u2019s a great idea!\u201d \\nGod help us\u2026 \\nThis actually brings up a very important point, something many people have overlooked during this election cycle: If we do not elect Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton can stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices, and in doing so, irreversibly steer our country down the path of no return. The America our Founding Fathers envisioned and strived for will be nothing more than a distant memory. \\nSHARE the report if you believe we CANNOT let that happen!'"}, "time": 1742562335.8481734}
