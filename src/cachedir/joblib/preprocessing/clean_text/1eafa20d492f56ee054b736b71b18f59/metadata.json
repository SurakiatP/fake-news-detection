[In what the New York Times called a \u201craucous,     set,\u201d Jones questioned the likelihood that she\u2019ll ever find love in Trump\u2019s America.  \u201cI want to be in love,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI want to do that, but it\u2019s 2017, and we got a pig in office. The world is about to end. \u201d The Saturday Night Live star also chided white women who show up and march in Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cIf I see another    white woman from Williamsburg saying \u2018black lives matter,\u2019 I\u2019m going to punch you in the mouth,\u201d Jones said while performing in front of a packed audience at Carolines comedy club in New York City. \u201cStop doing that. \u201d \u201cNot one black woman out there,\u201d she added. \u201cBlack woman at home watching Housewives of Atlanta. \u201d Later in her set, Jones joked that having her personal computer and iCloud account hacked and nude photos of her posted online was not as embarrassing as having to explain the situation to her elderly female family members. \u201cNow I got to explain this to my aunties,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey old, and they from civil rights. They just now getting computers. \u201d The    star also ripped dog lovers during her set. In a bit about rescue dogs and their sanctimonious owners who say things like \u201cDid I rescue the dog, or did the dog rescue me?\u201d Jones said, \u201cHow about both of y\u2019all get caught in a fire, and neither one of y\u2019all get rescued?\u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742628558.944571}
