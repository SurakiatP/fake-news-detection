And then I suddenly recognized him because we used to commute into the city every day together from Connecticut,\u201d Hansen told The Daily Mail . \\nThe man is accused of traveling to a home where he believed he would be meeting a 13-year-old boy. When the alleged predator saw Hansen, he blurted out, \u201cOh s**t. No, Chris!\u201d Image Credit: \u201cCrime Watch Daily\u201d/Daily Mail \\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Hansen asked. \\nThe man then made a run for it. He was later allegedly found with gay porn and condoms in his car. When he was questioned by police, he claimed he thought the boy was 18, not 13, citing his bad eye sight. He argued he would never meet a 13-year-old boy, calling it \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Image Credit: \u201cCrime Watch Daily\u201d/Daily Mail \\n\u201cI could not believe it,\u201d Hansen told The Daily Mail , grappling with the fact that she shared a train and even carried on conversations with the alleged predator. \\nThe man later confirmed Hansen\u2019s story and suggested they were \u201cfriends.\u201d \\nThe new episode of \u201c Crime Watch Daily \u201d will air on Friday.'"}, "time": 1742563031.0578883}
