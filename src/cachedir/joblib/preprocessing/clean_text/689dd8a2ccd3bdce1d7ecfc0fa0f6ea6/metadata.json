Powell has long been one of the high priests of the Washington establishment, staying quiet in this year\u2019s raucous presidential campaign while tending to his reputation as a thoughtful officer and diplomat. But a hack of Mr. Powell\u2019s email this week has ripped away the diplomatic jargon and political niceties to reveal his unvarnished disdain of Donald J. Trump as a \u201cnational disgrace,\u201d his personal peeves with Hillary Clinton and his lingering, but still very raw, anger with the Republican colleagues with whom he so often clashed a decade ago. There has been an expectation that Mr. Powell, who waited until the final weeks to endorse Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, would do the same for Mrs. Clinton this year. But in one 2014 email released online, Mr. Powell lamented that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he would \u201crather not have to vote for her,\u201d describing the Democratic presidential nominee as having \u201ca long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational. \u201d The emails make clear that if Mr. Powell endorses Mrs. Clinton, he will be motivated by intense feelings about Mr. Trump, whom he also called an \u201cinternational pariah. \u201d In the email messages, which an aide to Mr. Powell confirmed were authentic, the retired   general who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s top diplomat also accuses Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, of having embraced what Mr. Powell called a \u201cracist\u201d movement when he aggressively questioned the validity of Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate and his legitimacy to serve as the country\u2019s top elected official. But the emails, many of which were sent in recent weeks, also reveal Mr. Powell\u2019s disapproval of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of her email scandal and expose his sometimes unflattering observations of the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband. In a series of exchanges, Mr. Powell lamented efforts by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cminions\u201d to drag him into the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server by claiming he had advised her on the issue. \u201cH. R. C. could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,\u201d Mr. Powell wrote late last month, referring to Mrs. Clinton by her initials. \u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a   at a Hamptons party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these \u2018character\u2019 minefields. \u201d In the 2014 email, Mr. Powell, though offering no independent knowledge, alluded in graphic language to coverage in The New York Post suggesting that Bill Clinton had continued to cheat on his wife. The emails, some of which were first reported by BuzzFeed News, also show Mr. Powell venting about some members of Mr. Bush\u2019s administration. In one reference to Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, he accuses \u201cthe idiot Rummy\u201d of being disloyal to both President Bushes. In another email, Mr. Powell calls Dick Cheney, the former vice president, and his daughter Liz Cheney \u201cidiots and a spent force peddling a book that ain\u2019t going nowhere. \u201d Mr. Powell appeared to be angry that NBC proposed that he appear on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with Mr. Cheney and his daughter, who were promoting a book they wrote together. In the email, Mr. Powell said the network agreed to invite the Cheneys at a later date. Mr. Powell\u2019s emails appeared on a website called DCLeaks. com, which had previously posted documents that the site had obtained after hacks into the accounts of prominent Democrats and some Republicans, including Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the former commander of NATO forces in Europe, and George Soros, a wealthy backer of liberal causes. It is unclear who operates DCLeaks. com. Peggy Cifrino, an aide to Mr. Powell, responded Wednesday morning to an inquiry about the emails: \u201cWe are confirming that General Powell has been hacked and that they are his emails. We have no further comment at this time. \u201d Mr. Powell did not respond to an email sent directly to his personal account. In several emails, Mr. Powell suggested that speaking out against Mr. Trump would only add to the attention the Republican nominee was getting from the news media. Responding to a reporter asking for comment, Mr. Powell wrote last month that Mr. Trump is \u201chis own best enemy\u201d and added: \u201cI will speak out when I feel it appropriate and not after every idiot thing he says. \u201d But the emails make clear that Mr. Powell, who also served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has no intention of supporting Mr. Trump. In one    with a former aide, Mr. Powell insisted that Mr. Trump should not be elected president. \u201cNo need to debate it with you now, but Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah,\u201d Mr. Powell wrote in June, noting the criticism of Mr. Trump by several prominent conservatives. \u201cHe is in the process of destroying himself, no need for Dems to attack him. \u201d Mr. Powell also made clear in a series of exchanges how much he was offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the issue of Mr. Obama\u2019s birth. \u201cYup, the whole birther movement was racist,\u201d Mr. Powell wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn\u2019t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. As I have said before, \u2018What if he was?\u2019 Muslims are born as Americans everyday. \u201d Mr. Powell dismissed as completely ineffective Mr. Trump\u2019s recent attempts to reach out to black voters, saying that the Republican nominee \u201ctakes us for idiots. \u201d Mr. Powell said that nothing Mr. Trump could say to black voters would improve his standing, in part because of the things he said about Mr. Obama. \u201cHe can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate hoping to force Obama out of the presidency,\u201d Mr. Powell wrote, saying to his aide, \u201cYou don\u2019t fall for his false sincerity, I hope. \u201d In the emails, Mr. Powell blamed the news media for helping fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. In December 2015, he turned down a request from CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria to discuss Mr. Trump. \u201cIt is time to start ignoring him. You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,\u201d Mr. Powell responded. In August 2015, Mr. Powell predicted that Mr. Trump would \u201ctake it to the convention\u201d in part because news networks were chasing ratings. \u201cHe appeals to the worst angels of the G. O. P. nature and poor white folks,\u201d Mr. Powell said in the email.\u2019 \u201dIn that email, Mr. Powell in part defended Mrs. Clinton\u2019s actions in the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\u201d \u2019In December 2015, he told Condoleezza Rice, his successor at the State Department, that the Republican political attacks on Benghazi were \u201ca stupid witch hunt\u201d and wrote that \u201cbasic fault falls on a courageous ambassador who thought Libyans now love me and I am O. K. in this very vulnerable place. \u201d He added that \u201cblame also rests on his leaders and supporters back here,\u201d including Mrs. Clinton. A few months later, in a discussion about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email scandal, Mr. Powell lamented that \u201ceverything H. R. C. touches she kind of screws up with hubris. \u201d He then related a story about \u201cthe gig I lost at a university\u201d when the institution said it could no longer afford his speaking fees after paying Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI should send her a bill. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562382.0878446}
