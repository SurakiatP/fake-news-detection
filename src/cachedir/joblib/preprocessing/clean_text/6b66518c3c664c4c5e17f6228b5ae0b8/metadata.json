Warming to her reply, Mrs. Obama slammed anyone who stood against her policy and characterized critics as people who don\u2019t want kids to be healthy. Michelle Obama criticizes Trump administration\u2019s decision on school lunch rules: \u201cThink about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. \u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 12, 2017,  Saying, \u201cThis is where you have to look at motives,\u201d Obama also hinted that she felt the only reason people opposed her nutrition rules is because people opposed her husband on a political level. \u201cIt\u2019s not politics, it\u2019s parenting,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou have to stop and think, \u2018Why don\u2019t you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you and why is that a partisan issue?\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhy would that be political?\u201d \u201cMoms, think about this. I don\u2019t care what state you live in, take me out of the equation, like me, don\u2019t like me, but think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,\u201d the former first lady continued. \u201cBecause here\u2019s the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don\u2019t care about your kid, and we need to demand everyone to care deeply about our kids,\u201d Obama exclaimed. \u201cEvery elected official on this planet should understand, don\u2019t play with our children, don\u2019t do it,\u201d she concluded. Nowhere in the discussion did Obama note that it is the role of parents to guide their children\u2019s eating habits, not that of the government. In another part of her appearance, Obama ran contrary to the penchant of liberals who constantly insist that children should be given the same   power as adults. At one point, Michelle Obama claimed that kids should not have any say in the foods they eat at school. \u201cHow about we stop asking kids how they feel about their food? Kids, my kids included, if they could eat pizza and french fries every day with ice cream on top and a soda, they would think they were happy until they got sick,\u201d she said during the session. \u201cThat to me is one of the most ridiculous things we talk about in this movement, that the kids aren\u2019t happy. Well, you know what? Kids don\u2019t like math, either. So what are we going to do, stop teaching math? We gonna cut history out because there are kids who are bored with history? We are the adults in the room, you know? They look to us. So let\u2019s just stop with that. I\u2019m good if kids are mad at me,\u201d she concluded. Obama is unhappy that the Trump administration has begun the process of rolling back the unappetizing food restrictions the former first lady put into place during her husband\u2019s tenure in the White House. Late last month, U. S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue began easing some of the restrictions Obama worked to enforce in school lunch programs throughout the country. Perdue put in place an interim rule for the   school year that suspended Obama\u2019s requirements for sodium reduction and whole grains. The new rules also once again permitted   flavored milk in school cafeterias.
