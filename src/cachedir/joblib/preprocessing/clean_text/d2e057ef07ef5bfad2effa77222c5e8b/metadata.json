(From the horse\\x92s mouth) http://www.nato.int/docu/Review/2015/Russia/sanctions-after-crimea-have-they-worked/EN/index.htm by Edward Hunter Christie NATO\\x92s Defence Economist EU Total Change To Exports To Russia (EUR mn) -8,652 Eurostat trade statistics; 2015Q1 compared to 2014Q1. Biggest loser is Germany with (EUR mn) -2,566 followed by Italy with (EUR mn) -668 . European economies are affected by the sanctions and by Russia\\x92s current recession principally through trade , i.e. by losses in export revenues.Losses are caused:\\x96 Directly by Western sanctions (exports of oil-producing equipment and of military and dual-use goods);\\x96 Directly by Russia\\x92s food import ban;\\x96 And indirectly due to Russia\\x92s recession and lower exchange rate, which together lead to much lower demand for imports (from anywhere in the world).The latter, indirect effect is by far the largest, but it can only be partly attributed to Western sanctions \\x96 the lower oil price remains the dominant driver according to leading analysts.
