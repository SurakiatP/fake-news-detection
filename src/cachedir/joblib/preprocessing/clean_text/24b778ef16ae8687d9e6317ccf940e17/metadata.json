Sarah Palin condemned comedian Kathy Griffin for photographing herself holding up President Donald Trump\u2019s severed head on Tuesday, saying Griffin is \u201csick. \u201d[\u201cNo one should be shocked at the sick audacity of sick characters. Kathy is a hurting individual. She needs help,\u201d Palin told Breitbart News. \u201cCan you imagine if the subject of such an outrageous visual was a liberal? Obviously, media would be unhinged and uncontained in response. \u201d  Griffin told a   blogger she had herself photographed holding the president\u2019s   and severed head because she was upset about comments he made during the GOP primary season. \u201cShe said they were putting together a Trump mask and that led her to think of Trump\u2019s infamous statement early on in the primary,\u201d blogger Yashar Ali tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThe \u2018blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her ears, blood coming out of her wherever\u2019 statement. \u201d After the attempted assassination of Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 in a shooting that left six dead, the Left launched a   assault on Palin, trying to blame her for \u201cinspiring\u201d the severely   shooter\u2019s actions.  A political action committee supporting Palin had released a Facebook graphic displaying crosshairs on congressional districts where Tea Party candidates could compete in the 2010 midterm elections. \u201cWe never imagined, it never occurred to us that anybody would consider it violent.

Palin blasted the media and the Left for trying to smear her as an enabler of a  . \u201cIf you don\u2019t like a person\u2019s vision for the country, you\u2019re free to debate that vision. If you don\u2019t like their ideas, you\u2019re free to propose better ideas. But, especially within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible,\u201d Palin said. Despite further Democratic backlash against Palin\u2019s use of the term \u201cblood libel,\u201d   Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said Palin\u2019s comments were not at all \u201cimproper. \u201d \u201cThere is nothing improper and certainly nothing   in Sarah Palin using the term [blood libel] to characterize what she reasonably believes are false accusations that her words or images may have caused a mentally disturbed individual to kill and maim,\u201d Dershowitz told Breitbart News\u2019 Big Government. \u201cThe fact that two of the victims are Jewish is utterly irrelevant to the propriety of using this   term. \u201d Griffin said she does \u201cnot condone\u201d violence Tuesday while joking about displaying the president\u2019s severed, bloodied head. \u201cI caption this \u2018there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his  \u2026     wherever\u2019 Also @tylershields great   maker,\u201d Griffin tweeted Tuesday.'"}, "time": 1742628545.693105}
