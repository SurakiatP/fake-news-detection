Excavation machines moved rubble onto trucks to clear the streets of this quiet mountain town on Thursday, even as two strong aftershocks  \u2014   among more than 400 since the 6.  earthquake struck at 3:36 a. m. on Wednesday  \u2014   jolted Amatrice again. One volunteer who was flown in by helicopter as part of a United Nations    team, Alessandro Dalvit, and his dog Muttley found 16 bodies, including those of an    boy and his parents. \u201cOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven  \u2014   dead, morti,\u201d Mr. Dalvit said, showing photographs on his cellphone, ending with an image of a row of coffins. \u201cAt least you are able to give the bodies back to their families. \u201d As of Friday morning, the death toll stood at 267, including victims from towns like Amatrice and Accumoli, both in the Lazio region, and the village of Arquata del Tronto, in the neighboring Marche region. The figure could rise again, given that some people remain unaccounted for. \u201cFor this phase, it\u2019s important that we continue to dig through the rubble and also offer assistance to the population, providing beds, and food, and letting them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d Nicola Zingaretti, the president of the Lazio Region, said as he walked briskly through the Amatrice neighborhood where various emergency coordination operations had been set up. \u201cIn tragedy there is complete solidarity. \u201d The number of missing in Amatrice remained unclear on Thursday, as local residents wondered aloud about tourists and seasonal workers, mostly from Romania, who arrive during the busy summer months. Romanian officials confirmed that five of their citizens had died in the quake, that four had been injured and that 11 others were missing. Two Spaniards also died, Italian officials said. Speaking from Rome, Immacolata Postiglione, who runs the emergency unit at the Civil Protection Department, said that 215 people had been rescued from the wreckage of the earthquake. At least 264 people had been hospitalized, the Health Ministry said. In Saletta, another town damaged by the quake, Adriana Ciocchetti, a homemaker and a grandmother from Pagliano, near Frosinone, said she had not known what to expect when she arrived as a volunteer for the Italian Red Cross. \u201cIn cases like this, you just go,\u201d Ms. Ciocchetti said. But the work was heartbreaking, she said. One woman she comforted on Wednesday had lost her family. \u201cI was looking at a crushed house and said out loud, \u2018I hope no one lived there,\u2019 and a woman turned and said, \u2018That\u2019s where my daughter and grandchildren lived,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ciocchetti said. \u201cPeople are so disoriented that many don\u2019t even really realize what\u2019s happened. \u201d The Italian Red Cross was one of the first organizations to arrive in Amatrice. \u201cWithin two hours of the quake we were ready to move,\u201d said Ignazio Schintu, the organization\u2019s emergency manager. By Wednesday evening, the Red Cross  \u2014   with about 400 workers and volunteers  \u2014   had set up medical services, emergency kitchens, washroom facilities and tents. On Thursday, they were setting up a base camp on an athletic field in Amatrice for the workers assisting those left homeless and now living in tents. \u201cOur psychologists are here to assist them,\u201d Mr. Schintu said. \u201cMany earthquake victims don\u2019t want to sleep under any sort of covering, even a tent. \u201d \u201cPeople have to get over this first moment,\u201d though the two strong aftershocks felt on Thursday \u201ccertainly don\u2019t make it easier,\u201d he said. Just outside the town, a camp for 250 homeless survivors was being set up by Anpas, one of the dozens of volunteer associations that rushed to the quake area. Tents, for eight to 12 people each, were being prepared for their arrival. Though temporary in nature, for some, they could become home for months. Some Amatrice residents found themselves pressed into service as emergency workers, like the Rev. Savino D\u2019Amelio, a parish priest, who helped guide to safety 27 people from his retirement home shortly after the quake hit. \u201cThere were three of us, moving wheelchairs,\u201d Father D\u2019Amelio said, still shaken. \u201cWe got them all out without a scratch. \u201d \u201cNow we\u2019re trying to help people, ease the desperation of those who lost children and teenagers,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope our strength holds out. \u201d Across Amatrice, volunteers collected clothing, blankets, toiletries and food donated by people and institutions throughout Italy. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible solidarity, closeness, love, help from all of Italy,\u201d with even the country\u2019s struggling municipalities offering funds, said Giancarlo Carloni, the town\u2019s deputy mayor. \u201cIt makes me proud to be an Italian. \u201d Outside the temporary morgue in Amatrice, a small crowd of residents waited for names of the dead to be called. Some sobbed, while others clutched at one another for support. \u201cThe identification has to be done right away  \u2014   it\u2019s hot,\u201d Mr. Carloni said. Fabrizio Curcio, the chief of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Department, praised the \u201cgreat generosity\u201d and \u201cpositive enthusiasm\u201d on the part of the rescue workers and volunteers who had raced to the earthquake zone. But, he said, some volunteers will be asked to go home. \u201cWe are many, and only those who are necessary must remain,\u201d he said. Those residents who could leave Amatrice, now a ghost town, did so, finding refuge with relatives or at second homes on the seaside, said Mr. Carloni, the deputy mayor, who spent the night with his wife in their car. His house was standing, he said, but she was afraid to stay in it. Bishop Domenico Pompili of the nearby town of Rieti and the Rev. Fabrizio Borrello, a priest from the town, came to Amatrice on Thursday to offer spiritual comfort to the survivors and bless the bodies in the morgue. \u201cThere were a lot of them,\u201d Father Borrello said. \u201cBut there are still many people missing,\u201d including many families, so \u201cthere is no one to come and identify them. \u201d Efforts to find survivors in the rubble continued throughout the day, \u201cbut the probabilities are about down to zero,\u201d said one officer with Italy\u2019s Finance Police who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Mauro Bellavita, a volunteer who came to Amatrice with four other volunteers from the town of Acquapendente, said he was not ready to give up. \u201cHope is the last thing to die,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628535.8790116}
