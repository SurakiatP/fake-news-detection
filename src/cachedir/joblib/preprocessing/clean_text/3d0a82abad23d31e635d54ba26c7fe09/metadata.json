See? Hillary\u2019s line is in orange and Trump\u2019s is in gray. She must be winning. \\nBut there\u2019s a problem with the poll \u2013 like with so many other polls that have come out recently \u2026 they\u2019re conveniently asking many more Democrats than Republicans. \\nHere\u2019s a link to their methodology (they have to publish this if they\u2019re going to pretend they\u2019re legitimate). \\nIf you look at page 7, you\u2019ll see exactly who they\u2019re polling. \\nOf the 1,135 people they polled, 36 percent identify as Democrats and just 29 percent as Republicans. \\nThis is bad enough, but they also have 29 percent self-declared \u201cindependents\u201d answering the poll. How do independents vote? Gee? Who knows? The pollsters do\u2026 \\nNow, they have to justify the fact that there are so many more Democrats than Republicans at the polls (and of course, there are simply not 29 percent of \u201cindependents\u201d going to the polls. They\u2019re going to choose a Republican or a Democrat, except for the tiny percent who will choose a third-party candidate. \\nSo here\u2019s the paragraph justifying their methodology: \\nThis survey uses statistical weighting procedures to account for deviations in the survey sample from known population characteristics, which helps correct for differential survey participation and random variation in samples. The overall adult sample is weighted to correct for differential probabilities of selection among individuals who are landline-only, cell phone-only or dual users. Results are also weighted match the demographic makeup of the population by sex, region, age, education and race/ethnicity according to the latest Current Population Survey March Social and Economic Supplement by age, race/ethnicity, sex and education. Party ID was weighted to the average of the most recent Post-ABC surveys. \\nDid you understand that? That\u2019s okay, because they do. And they want you to trust them. \\nThe only poll that counts is the one that you are going to participate in on Nov. 8, and they don\u2019t get to \u201cover sample\u201d or \u201caccount for deviations.\u201d They count the votes. \\nSo make sure your vote is counted.'"}, "time": 1742561854.262953}
