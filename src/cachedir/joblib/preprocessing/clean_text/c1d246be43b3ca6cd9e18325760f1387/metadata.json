[\u201cThe veterans have poured out their sweat and blood and tears for this country for so long, and it\u2019s time that they\u2019re recognized, and it\u2019s time that we now take care of them, and take care of them properly,\u201d Trump said.   The bill allows veterans to seek private care outside of the VA system, if they live more than 40 miles away from a VA hospital or can\u2019t get an appointment within 30 days. Trump specifically thanked Senator John McCain and Senator Johnny Isakson for their work on the bill, as well as Rep. Phil Roe, the Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. \u201cSome people have to travel five hours, eight hours, and they\u2019ll have to do it on a weekly basis, and even worse than that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen anymore. \u201d Trump was joined by Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, who praised the bill. \u201cThis is a good day for veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great day to celebrate not only what veterans have contributed to the country, but how we\u2019re making things better for them. \u201d The extension of the bill passed by Congress authorized the sharing of medical records to hospitals outside the VA and modifies the procedures for reimbursement for private hospitals.'"}, "time": 1742563572.7385764}
