I know this because Facebook told me so; well, maybe not Mark Zuckerberg himself, but all my friends on Facebook were posting pictures of their daughters and celebrating National Daughter\u2019s Day so it must be true, right? \\nActually, I Googled it, and guess what??? September 24 is NOT National Daughter\u2019s Day\u2026According to Wikipedia , National Daughter\u2019s Day is August 11th. This little snippet in Wikipedia also stated that National Daughter\u2019s Day originated from the Bible. I have done some more digging, and honestly, I can\u2019t find proof for either the day or the fact that the Bible calls for it. So it got me to thinking\u2026 \\nHow did a day, which didn\u2019t actually exist, go viral in just a few hours on Facebook? There has to be a need which something like this fills or else the entire Facebook population wouldn\u2019t have jumped on it so quickly. \\nThen it hit me. We love our daughters! It really is that simple. We love our daughters so much that we felt we needed to tell them so publicly on Facebook. I saw some of the cutest baby pictures and some of the sweetest words of love scroll through my Facebook feed yesterday. Mothers and fathers discussing how sweet their little girls were and exclaiming pride in the women they had become. All ages were represented. It was really quite moving, and it was a wonderful change from the politics and hatred I normally see there. \\nMy question is, why did we need to create a fictitious holiday to say these things. We all know our society is in desperate need of love, but yesterday also proved that our society is desperate to show love. It is OK to tell the world you love your daughter, or for that matter, your son, your wife, your husband, your life partner, your best friend, your ex, your mailman, your mother, your dog, or your local friendly hardware store worker. You don\u2019t need a special occasion or an official day. We don\u2019t have to all agree it is OK to do it on that particular day. \\nJust love. Show it openly. Tell the world and Facebook. Do it every day. It\u2019s in your DNA. You need it. \\nI declare today National I Am Going To Post About Who I Love Day\u2026every day. \\nBy the way\u2026 My daughter, Mallory, is intelligent, beautiful, and compassionate, and I am blessed that she calls me Mom. Just thought I would throw that in since it is National I Am Going To Post About Who I Love Day! Now faith, hope, and love remain\u2014these three things\u2014and the greatest of these is love. 1 Corinthians 13 About Melanie Tubbs \\nMelanie Tubbs is a professor, pastor, mother, Mimi, and true Arkansas woman.
