The moment you step up to the gates of the Dulvey estate, you\u2019re the one watching for predators. There is an unnerving rattle of the chain locking you out it\u2019s a hollow sound, too loud for the   silence that permeates your heavily wooded surroundings. The house stares down at you with quiet malice. From that moment, it\u2019s clear that Resident Evil 7 is going to be different. This isn\u2019t the high concept horror of an action hero braving hordes of shambling corpses, but the seedy dread of hidden atrocities. Every step of your exploration will be laced with that same feeling of constant wrongness, of mortal danger from which you are never more than temporarily hidden. Resident Evil 7 stalks you.  The shift to   surpasses the level of dread that the fixed perspective camera of previous Resident Evil entries used to. Rather than the   feeling of paranoia due to clumsy controls and an artificially restricted view of your surroundings, the   camera ensures you can only ever see threats encroaching from one direction. A floorboard creaks to your right. Something scrapes in the darkness ahead. The door behind you slams shut. There is no \u201csafe\u201d direction to look, no manner in which to easily retreat from the creeping horror. Resident Evil 7 feels dangerous in a way that very few games achieve. All of this is captured with haunting visual and auditory splendor, in one of the most technically accomplished releases I\u2019ve ever seen. With all of the game\u2019s various visual settings maximized, the game regularly verges on the photorealistic. The audio rivals the best work ever done in video games  \u2014   even the most nondescript room is plagued by the distant splatter of rain, creaks and scratches and moans that come from everywhere and nowhere. Playing in surround sound, or with a good headset, is a terrifying experience in all of the best ways.  It\u2019s a shame that so much of that   splendor disappears once enemies are on the screen. Clumsy   hair physics and terrible mouth animation are a jarring departure from the detailed design of each antagonist, momentarily reminding you that these threats aren\u2019t real. The expressions on the faces of the characters just don\u2019t match the   flapping of their jaws. And while the voice work is competently performed, it still suffers from the awkward translation from Japanese to English that has become a recurring theme throughout Resident Evil\u2018s history. Once the action really began, I was startled by just how tight the game\u2019s shooting felt. Weaponry has heft and impact, and its flashing roars walk the line between making you afraid to attract attention and feeling temporarily   in your righteous fury. But in many cases, no weapon will suffice. The Baker family is virtually unkillable  \u2014   something that the game takes great pains to show you throughout the first hours. In many cases, your only choice will be frantic retreat. Here, too, Resident Evil 7 sometimes loses its way. While the \u201cboss\u201d encounters are frightening, they\u2019re also frustrating. Each one is a bullet sponge, and it\u2019s almost always difficult to tell whether you\u2019re having any effect at all or if you\u2019re missing some mechanic necessary to advance the fight. At times I was forced to retry a fight over and over again, because I simply could not discern how to \u201cwin\u201d the encounter.  To make things murkier still, many of these encounters don\u2019t even have a victory condition, per se. Sometimes the game just wants you to do something that clearly doesn\u2019t work, for long enough to progress the event. It\u2019s   and can definitely prove frustrating. You\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated that bullets have no effect on \u201cDaddy\u201d Baker. Why then do I need to spend several clips on him before I am mechanically allowed to do him real harm? Aside from these   encounters, combat is about halfway to sheer brilliance. While the guns themselves are exceptionally well designed, the enemies you are allowed to kill are all very similar in both appearance and behavior. Because of that, parts of the game begin to lose their sense of dread before their time. Once you see the mess of oily black crawling over the walls, you know what to expect. The initial fear of the unknown dissipates, and you\u2019re left counting how many bullets to your enemies\u2019 heads you\u2019ve fired to make sure you have enough for whatever\u2019s next.  Finally, the frustrations of Resident Evil\u2018s inventory system returns. It\u2019s been simplified and severely limited, as has crafting. And while both are staples of the franchise, too often it becomes a hassle of juggling half a dozen key items, while still trying to scavenge what you need to make medicine or ammunition. It\u2019s another unwelcome intrusion on the game\u2019s carefully crafted atmosphere, but it will feel comfortably familiar to series veterans. The game is a healthy 10 or so hours long, slowly transforming from creeping dread to desperate action. It ends with just enough left unsaid to continue the tale, and I truly hope that\u2019s the case. This is a phenomenal first effort at something new for a franchise that had gotten decidedly stale in its last few iterations and a fresh take on Resident Evil\u2019s trademark brand of survival horror.
