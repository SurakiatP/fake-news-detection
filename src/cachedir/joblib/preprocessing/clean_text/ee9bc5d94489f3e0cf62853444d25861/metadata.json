Inhabitants of the jungle were seen fleeing the safety of urine saturated trees, bushes and other watering holes with pieces of stinking camembert stuck to their curly-haired heads after being bashed into surrender! \\nThe Tricolore was raised after this outstanding victory.

Others who escaped the attack were spotted swimming in the English Channel! Passengers on ferries threw lumps of stale, tasteless English sandwiches, purchased on board, at them, believing they were a school of passing hump-back whales in dire need of nourishment (?).
