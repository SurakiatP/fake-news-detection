[A patron of the Paydirt Bar in Portland, Oregon recently posted a photo of one of the bar\u2019s receipts to Twitter, noting that the bottom of the receipt featured the proclamation, \u201cPunch Steve Bannon, Get Free Whiskey For Life. \u201d The tweet, which earned thousands of likes and retweets, has since been deleted, but a photo of the receipt can be seen below and a link to an archive of the tweet still exists.   The Paydirt Bar has a history of posting   messages to their various social channels. A tweet from the bar\u2019s Twitter account in 2015 links to an Instagram post which reads: \u201d \u201cTonight\u2019s whiskey pairing: \u2018Thanksgiving Dinner Conversation With Your Racist Uncle About Donald Trump\u2019 (a shot of Wild Turkey 101 and a cold tall boy of @olympia_beer) #paydirtbar #pdxdrinks #movingtocanada\u201d Tonight\u2019s whiskey pairing:\u201dThanksgiving Dinner Conversation With Your Racist Uncle About Donald  \u2026     https:  .   \u2014   Paydirt (@paydirtpdx) November 25, 2015,   Tonight\u2019s whiskey pairing: \u201dThanksgiving Dinner Conversation With Your Racist Uncle About Donald Trump\u201d (a shot of Wild Turkey 101 and a cold tall boy of @olympia_beer) #paydirtbar #pdxdrinks #movingtocanada, A post shared by Paydirt (@paydirtbar) on Nov 25, 2015 at 2:30pm PST,  Breitbart News reached out to the Paydirt Bar to ask why it is that they offer prizes for the assault of Steve Bannon and whether or not they had offered similar prizes for other political figures. In response, a representative for the bar stated: The text is a series of comments that we leave at the bottom of our receipts. We change the receipts nearly daily and they touch on all sorts of politicians on both sides of the aisle, plus (mostly) our beloved Portland Trail Blazers. We\u2019re surprised as anyone that these image went viral since it\u2019s clearly a joke. We went private on all our accounts since after this happened we were inundated with a series of very serious death threats.
