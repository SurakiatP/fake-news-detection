Chris Christie of New Jersey knew that three of his top officials were involved in a plan to shut down lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as it was happening and that the closings were intended to punish a local mayor for declining to support him, federal prosecutors said on Monday. The assertion was an unexpected and startling beginning to the trial of two former Christie administration officials charged with closing the lanes in 2013 and then covering it up. And it was a surprising claim because of the side of the courtroom it came from, as lawyers made opening statements. Defense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie, a Republican, and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the   as they tried to protect the governor\u2019s political aspirations  \u2014   saying their clients were \u201cthrown under the presidential bus,\u201d as one lawyer argued on Monday. But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie. And it directly contradicts the governor\u2019s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed, paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee, N. J. Mr. Christie, a former top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, has consistently denied that he knew about the lane closings as they unfolded, and argued that the United States attorney\u2019s office had \u201cexonerated\u201d him when it declined to indict him along with the defendants now standing trial. The prosecutor, speaking for the United States attorney\u2019s office, said that two of the alleged   in the case, David Wildstein and Bill Baroni, had \u201cbragged\u201d to the governor about the lane closings at a memorial service for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, on the third day of the closings, and that they had been done to \u201cmess\u201d with Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, a Democrat, because he had declined entreaties to endorse the governor\u2019s  . Mr. Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, who were close allies of Mr. Christie, are the two defendants in the trial. Mr. Wildstein and Mr. Baroni boasted to Mr. Christie that panicked phone calls from Mr. Sokolich, pleading that the lane closings were a \u201cpublic safety emergency,\u201d were deliberately being ignored, the prosecutor said. The prosecutor, Vikas Khanna, quickly moved to quell any curiosity the jury might have about why Mr. Christie was not charged in the plot. \u201cThe evidence may show that others could have, should have, perhaps known certain aspects of what was going on in Fort Lee,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps you will even wonder what happened to those people. But at the end of this case the only issue for you to decide is whether Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni are guilty of the crimes with which they are charged beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s it. \u201d Defense lawyers quickly seized on his comments in their own opening statements. Michael Critchley, a lawyer for Ms. Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, said: \u201cWe know who they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re talking about Governor Christie. They\u2019re talking about Kevin O\u2019Dowd. \u201d (Mr. O\u2019Dowd was the governor\u2019s chief of staff at the time of the closings.) A spokesman for Mr. Christie, Brian Murray, responding to the prosecutor\u2019s assertion, referred reporters on Monday to statements the governor made in 2014, in which he said he had not known about the plan to close the lanes. Mr. Murray declined to address whether the governor knew about the closings while they were happening. The office of the United States attorney, Paul J. Fishman, declined to comment on why the governor was not charged, but Mr. Fishman has said in the past that merely knowing is not a federal crime. Mr. Christie was intimately woven into the story both sides told in the packed courtroom on Monday. Prosecutors and defense lawyers alike described an administration tightly controlled by the governor, one that worked    with his   campaign to trade favors for endorsements. The governor was trying to win a big and broad margin of victory, and to win over Democratic mayors like Mr. Sokolich, so he could make the case that he was the Republican best able to win the White House. Mr. Khanna said Mr. Baroni covered up the lane closings because \u201cthis was something that was important to Trenton. \u201d He added, \u201cTrenton: the governor\u2019s office. \u201d Mr. Baroni\u2019s lawyer, Michael Baldassare, later told the jury it would be hearing a lot about Trenton. \u201cTrenton, Trenton, Trenton Trenton is the governor,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s make no mistake. Open a dictionary: Trenton, the governor. \u201d The details of the plot that Mr. Khanna laid out are largely familiar by now  \u2014   that Ms. Kelly sent an email in August 2013 saying \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\u201d after confirming that the mayor of that borough would not endorse Mr. Christie. A month later, two of three access lanes to the George Washington Bridge were shut down. Mr. Baroni, then the   official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the bridge, studiously ignored the mayor as he pleaded by text, email and a handwritten letter for the agency to reopen the lanes. Mr. Critchley, Ms. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Christie and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York developed a strategy to cover up the lane closings as soon as they ended, and executed it through official statements over the next several weeks, lying that the closings had been a \u201ctraffic study. \u201d Mr. Critchley characterized their strategy as one that sought not to \u201cinflame the issue. \u201d \u201cThe idea that they  \u2014   the governors of New Jersey and New York  \u2014   they\u2019re going to let a single mother of four control the future is also crazy,\u201d he added, referring to Ms. Kelly. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo flatly denied that he had any involvement. \u201cThe governor did not have any role  \u2014   direct or indirect  \u2014   in any press statements regarding the purported traffic study,\u201d he said. The case will hinge on the government\u2019s star witness, Mr. Wildstein, a former political blogger hired to a position created specially for him at the Port Authority, who has admitted, in a guilty plea as part of a deal to cooperate with the government, that he conceived the idea to close the lanes. Defense lawyers characterized him as crazy, a liar described even by witnesses for the prosecution as \u201ca vicious guy,\u201d \u201cmaniacal\u201d and \u201ca horrible person. \u201d And it was Mr. Christie, they said, who installed Mr. Wildstein at the agency to be his enforcer. Mr. Baldassare, Mr. Baroni\u2019s lawyer, said the governor referred to Mr. Wildstein as his \u201cfixer,\u201d or \u201cMr. Wolf,\u201d after the Harvey Keitel character in the movie \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d the guy who cleans up the dead bodies. And everyone  \u2014   Mr. Baroni included  \u2014   feared crossing him. \u201cAt the Port Authority at the time, when David Wildstein spoke, Governor Christie\u2019s voice came out and everybody knew it,\u201d Mr. Baldassare said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Bill. David Wildstein, based on this evidence, looks like a ventriloquist\u2019s doll sitting on Christopher J. Christie\u2019s lap. \u201d Mr. Christie, defense lawyers said, was United States attorney when he began talking to Mr. Wildstein, then the author of an anonymous and gossipy political blog in New Jersey the governor hired him after seeing his ability to work in the shadows as a virtue. Mr. Wildstein was a political operative so wily, Mr. Baldassare said, that he once stole Senator Frank R. Lautenberg\u2019s jacket before a debate so that Mr. Lautenberg would have to borrow someone else\u2019s jacket and be uncomfortable during a debate with Mr. Wildstein\u2019s candidate, Representative Millicent H. Fenwick. At the Port Authority, Mr. Baldassare said, he operated on \u201cone constituent rule,\u201d wanting to please only Mr. Christie. He and the governor played a \u201cred light, green light\u201d game, Mr. Critchley said, going down a list and firing people they did not like, greenlighting those who remained in their favor. Mr. Wildstein\u2019s goal, Mr. Critchley said, was to run Mr. Christie\u2019s presidential campaign in one of the important early states  \u2014   Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina. As the bridge scandal threatened to take down those presidential hopes, Mr. Critchley said, Mr. Christie pinned the blame on Ms. Kelly. \u201cThis case is not only about traffic, it\u2019s about a presidential campaign for the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat she knew could be fatal to an embryonic presidential campaign. \u201d She was scapegoated, he argued, by a \u201ccoterie of cowards. \u201d \u201cCowards who were addicted to power,\u201d he said. \u201cCowards who despite all their titles, when it became time to speak the truth, they showed they were nothing more than opportunists, ambitious opportunists. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564474.5851195}
