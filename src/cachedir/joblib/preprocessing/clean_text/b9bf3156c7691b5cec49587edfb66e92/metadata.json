Mr. Arany joined the fight for independence against the Austrian Empire. The poem, written in 1857, tells the story of bards slaughtered in the 13th century, after the invasion of Wales by King Edward I of England. One verse reads: \u201cIn martyrship, with song on lip   Five hundred Welsh bards died   Not one was mov\u2019d to say he lov\u2019d   The tyrant in his pride. \u201d The rebellious Welsh performers inspired Hungarians, who equated the tyrant king with Franz Joseph, the Austrian emperor. Decades later, the assassination of the heir apparent, Franz Ferdinand, set off World War I and the empire\u2019s demise. This month, Hungary celebrated the 200th anniversary of Arany\u2019s birth. Wales, too, has taken a liking to his poem. As one mayor there put it, \u201cIn these days of the \u2018Brexit\u2019 situation, it\u2019s good to keep furnishing good relations with our neighbors in Europe. \u201d _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.
