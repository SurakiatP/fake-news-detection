Video of it shows a terrified young white man crouching in the corner of a room as four black attackers taunt and beat him, at times yelling \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cFuck white people. \u201d Holloway told Kassam, \u201cWe do not need hate crime laws. Every crime has a motivation. Every act of evil has some element of hate in it. We were perfectly able to prosecute crimes worse than this before any hate crime legislation came into the picture. \u201d Holloway said hate crime laws are \u201cof the left and political correctness. \u201d The two discussed the implications and possibility of the rollback of hate crime legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be the political will to roll it back,\u201d said Holloway. \u201cI just think we never should have gotten started down this road in the first place,\u201d he added.
