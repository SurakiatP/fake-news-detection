But Ms. Spears has plenty of back story she\u2019s a    working mother, the headliner in her own Las Vegas spectacle and a performer who has weathered teenage fame, backlash, public meltdowns and wave after wave of tabloid headlines. \u201cGlory,\u201d her first album since 2013, is her latest attempt to reclaim her place on the pop charts, which are now crowded with younger performers who have studied her the way Ms. Spears studied Madonna. Her latest strategy is relentless and unambiguous: Stick to sexy. Ms. Spears\u2019s albums in the 2000s, like \u201cBlackout\u201d and \u201cFemme Fatale,\u201d showed that she and her advisers know something about the dynamics of celebrity and media, as she toyed with provocation and selective revelation. Hits like \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d and \u201cToxic\u201d teased at the power dynamics of lust and romance. But \u201cGlory\u201d has shallower aims it\u2019s all   and promises of pleasure, as if the only intimacies that matter are physical ones. \u201cTo know each other   your love all over me,\u201d she coos in \u201cInvitation,\u201d the breathy, Janet    Glass enticement that opens the album. For songwriting and production, Ms. Spears drew from the talent pool that also supplies material for her pop peers and rivals, among them Selena Gomez, Nick Jonas, Fifth Harmony, Demi Lovato and, yes, Madonna. Her vocal producer, Mischke, has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stretching from Michael Jackson and the Spice Girls to Gwen Stefani. Unlike Will. i. am, the producer who filled Ms. Spears\u2019s 2013 album \u201cBritney Jean\u201d with   clich\u00e9s, her new collaborators make musical space for her. They look toward the melting tones, echoey hollows and   constructions of recent releases by Ms. Gomez and Justin Bieber. Heavy bass lines and kick drums are all but banished, perhaps to return in remixes. Instead, syncopations are sketched in the midrange by handclaps, keyboard chords, electronic plinks or bits of guitar. The album\u2019s peppiest song, \u201cWhat You Need,\u201d matches a track that sounds like     Motown to a vocal that flaunts its electronic warbles. Throughout the album, Ms. Spears\u2019s voice  \u2014   no doubt still processed, but far less obviously robotic  \u2014   has emphatically returned to the foreground. In verses, she recalls the flirty singer, with the knowing scratch in her   voice, who conquered 1990s pop. She sounds more involved, more present, than she has in a decade. Choruses, like those in \u201cMake Me  \u2026   \u201d sometimes layer her voice into an ecstatic choir. Yet even with her voice upfront, Ms. Spears isn\u2019t singing anything particularly personal. \u201cGlory\u201d is one long, often catchy, announcement of availability. Ms. Spears declares \u201cnobody should be alone if they don\u2019t have to be\u201d in the   \u201cDo You Wanna Come Over?\u201d \u201cSlumber Party,\u201d which eases into a   chorus, promises, \u201cWe ain\u2019t gonna sleep tonight. \u201d In \u201cLove Me Down,\u201d she says, \u201cYou say we don\u2019t talk any more  \u2019m thinking we talk too much,\u201d preferring communication by touch. A song on the deluxe version of this album, \u201cChange Your Mind (No Seas Cort\u00e9s),\u201d sets out to seduce a guy who is \u201ctrying to be a gentleman\u201d and doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccross the line\u201d by urging, in Spanish, \u201cdon\u2019t be polite,\u201d adding \u201cI\u2019m   desperate. \u201d And often, behind the sleek electronics and the tidy vocals, a certain desperation comes through. \u201cJust Luv Me,\u201d one song, begs. Ms. Spears\u2019s previous album, \u201cBritney Jean,\u201d was her commercial nadir, and the singles preceding the release of \u201cGlory\u201d  \u2014   \u201cMake Me. .. \u201d and \u201cPretty Girls,\u201d a collaboration with Iggy Azalea that\u2019s not on this album  \u2014   weren\u2019t smashes. Another preview, \u201cPrivate Show,\u201d was introduced alongside a new perfume of the same name. It casts the singer as a stripper: \u201cSlide down my   me spin it and twerk it. \u201d Working for others, the songwriters behind \u201cGlory\u201d have come up with other messages, particularly for female singers. Teen pop now abounds with   messages of doubts overcome, of pride, of confidence, of empowerment that doesn\u2019t depend on pleasing a guy. Ms. Spears, with turbulent decades of experience, might connect her life with her songs, as divas do, and find herself forging a stronger bond with listeners. But \u201cGlory\u201d doesn\u2019t make that reach. It\u2019s as if, after all her fans and fame, Ms. Spears can still only present herself as that most generic pop commodity: a sexpot.'"}, "time": 1742628594.7773948}
