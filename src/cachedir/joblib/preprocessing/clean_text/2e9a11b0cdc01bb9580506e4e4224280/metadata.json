At a hearing in New York State Supreme Court on Wednesday, the lawyer, Judd Burstein, who is representing the former Fox anchor Andrea Tantaros, said that another one of his clients had received a grand jury subpoena related to Fox News. He did not identify that client. Mr. Burstein said in a text message that he believed federal investigators were looking at whether Fox News structured sexual harassment settlement claims by paying them out in salaries, \u201cso as not to have to report them. \u201d He added that the prosecutors had identified themselves as being from a securities fraud division of the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. In a statement, Fox News said it had not received a subpoena but had \u201cbeen in communication with the U. S. attorney\u2019s office for months. \u201d The statement added that Fox \u201cwill continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities. \u201d The United States attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. The prospect of a criminal investigation is a surprising escalation of the sexual harassment scandal that engulfed Fox News over the summer and led to the departure of its chairman, Roger Ailes. After reaching a $20 million settlement with Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor who sued Mr. Ailes, and conducting an internal investigation into his conduct, the company tried hard to put the episode behind it. The scope of the investigation by the United States attorney\u2019s office, which appeared to be in the early stages, was not immediately clear. Mr. Burstein made the remarks while he was arguing that Ms. Tantaros\u2019s case  \u2014   she sued the network in August, accusing Fox News of retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment  \u2014   should go forward in an open court. A judge rejected that claim on Wednesday and ruled that her case would be resolved in arbitration. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Fox News said, \u201cThe court granted Fox News\u2019s motion to send Andrea Tantaros\u2019s case to arbitration, where it always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein\u2019s histrionics. \u201d Asked whether Mr. Ailes had received a subpoena, Susan Estrich, his lawyer, declined to comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the sexual harassment allegations. Ms. Tantaros\u2019s suit asserts that the network\u2019s newsroom resembled \u201ca   Playboy   cult. \u201d The suit named a number of Fox News executives in addition to Mr. Ailes, accusing them of marginalizing her and removing her from the air after she complained. Fox News denied the charges, saying that Ms. Tantaros was let go for violating her contract by writing a book without approval. In July, Ms. Carlson sued Mr. Ailes for sexual harassment. Fox News\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison to conduct an investigation, and a number of other women stepped forward with similar accusations, including the former Fox star Megyn Kelly.'"}, "time": 1742562769.9612563}
