[Abedin, a former close aide to Hillary Clinton, filed an uncontested \u201cAnonymous vs. Anonymous\u201d action in Manhattan Supreme Court, meaning she is likely to hold custody of the couple\u2019s young son.  Last August, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner, after further lewd photos of Weiner were leaked, one of which included his son. However, a report earlier this year indicated the pair were \u201cworking hard\u201d to save their marriage. Her filing comes on the same day that Weiner pleaded guilty on a single charge of sending explicit material to a minor. The    girl alleged that over the course of their communication, Weiner had sent her nude photos, shared pornographic videos with her, discussed his \u201crape fantasies,\u201d and requested that she undress and masturbate during video calls. Weiner cried in court as he entered his guilty plea, saying, \u201cI have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse. \u201d Although a final determination is yet to be made, Weiner will not appeal a sentence of between 21 and 27 months in prison and will be forced to register as a sex offender after his conviction.
