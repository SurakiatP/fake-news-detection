[The Los     \u201crebel artist\u201d shared photographs of his handiwork on his Twitter page Friday the work includes a poster with a quote from the Quentin Tarantino film True Romance: \u201cAll those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books. \u201d  DISCOUNTING HOLLYWOOD by SABO https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   unsavoryagents (@unsavoryagents) February 24, 2017,  Another one of Sabo\u2019s posters was pasted onto a Redbox movie rental kiosk: \u201cYeah! We wouldn\u2019t have paid full price to watch any Oscar nominated movies either,\u201d reads the caption. In a post on his website, the artist wrote that it was \u201cout of touch actors who rail against my political beliefs\u201d that served as the inspiration for the latest work, which he calls, \u201cDiscounting Hollywood. \u201d \u201cShia LaBeouf, Bryan Cranston, Cher, Madonna, Ashley Judd, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck   \u2026     I could go on all day, have shot their mouths off long enough calling people like myself every vile name in the book, again and again, and again, and again,\u201d Sabo wrote. \u201cI used to really love movies and the occasional tv show but not so much these days. I \u2018discount\u2019 what goes on in them these days more than ever. \u201d The artist cited a recent Hollywood Reporter poll that found that 60 percent of Americans cannot name one nominee for Best Picture. \u201cWhat this tells me is America for the most part is more and more discounting what\u2019s coming out of Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure many who do eventually watch these movies are waiting for them to show up on RedBox because $1. 50 is all they think they are worth.\\u2028\\u2028\u201d Sabo told the Hollywood Reporter on Friday that he hopes the posters will remain up outside the Dolby Theater ahead of Sunday night\u2019s ceremony. \u201cThese pieces look so legit no one is thinking to take them down,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIt almost looks like a real Redbox ad. \u201d Sabo repeatedly used his artwork and the streets of Los Angeles to skewer celebrities and liberal politicians during the 2016 presidential election. In August, the artist targeted former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and actor Leonardo DiCaprio with \u201cmoney laundering\u201d street art after the election, he placed fake realtor  on bus benches that mocked celebrities\u2019 promises to leave the country if Trump won.
