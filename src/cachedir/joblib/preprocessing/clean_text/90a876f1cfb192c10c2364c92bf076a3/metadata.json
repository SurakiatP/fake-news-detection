A   deadlock seemed a real possibility, one that would leave in place an appeals court ruling that blocks the plan and deny Mr. Obama the chance to revive it while he remains in office. A tie vote would set no Supreme Court precedent and therefore would allow a renewed challenge to the plan once the court is back at full strength. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2019s questions were deeply skeptical of the administration\u2019s position. They appeared to signal that he would not join the court\u2019s four more liberal members in dismissing the case on the ground that the challengers had not suffered injuries giving them standing to sue. A ruling based on standing would be a victory for the administration. The case, brought by Texas and 25 other states, could still produce a significant ruling on presidential power and immigration policy in the midst of an election campaign in which both issues have been prominent. A loss for Mr. Obama would vindicate Republican accusations that he has acted lawlessly in exceeding the limits of presidential power and has not done enough to secure the nation\u2019s borders. A victory for him would uphold one of the central legacies of his presidency and affect the lives of countless immigrants. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. the government\u2019s top appellate lawyer, opened the arguments with a vigorous defense of Mr. Obama\u2019s authority to set priorities for immigration enforcement. He was quickly challenged by Chief Justice Roberts. \u201cCould the president grant deferred removal to every unlawfully present alien in the United States right now?\u201d the chief justice asked skeptically. Mr. Verrilli said there were statutory constraints that would prevent the president from doing so. Mr. Verrilli also argued that Texas had not suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. The chief justice said the administration had given Texas an impossible choice, \u201ca real  . \u201d Texas says it has standing to sue because it would be costly for the state to give driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy. Mr. Verrilli said the state could simply change its law to deny driver\u2019s licenses to the immigrants. \u201cYou would sue them instantly,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts responded, meaning that the federal government would file a lawsuit challenging Texas\u2019 unequal treatment of immigrants affected by the program. Mr. Verrilli said that was probably so but that such a suit might not succeed. The answer did not seem to satisfy Chief Justice Roberts, who suggested that the choice between incurring a budget shortfall and facing a lawsuit from the federal government was enough to establish standing. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, on the other hand, twice suggested that Texas could have filed a different kind of lawsuit, one in which its standing would not be in question. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that \u201cnearly 11 million unauthorized aliens are here in the shadows. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re here whether we want them or not,\u201d she said. But Justice Kennedy questioned whether the president can defer deportations for millions of people without specific congressional authorization. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the president is defining the policy and the Congress is executing it,\u201d Justice Kennedy said. \u201cThat\u2019s just upside down. \u201d The case, United States v. Texas, No.   concerns a program intended to allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and providing them work permits. The program, announced in November 2014, was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. Mr. Verrilli told the justices that it addressed \u201ca pressing humanitarian concern in avoiding the breakup of families that contain U. S. citizen children. \u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked if the president could simply open the nation\u2019s borders. Mr. Verrilli said that was \u201ca million miles from where we are now. \u201d That comment prompted Justice Kennedy to jump in. \u201cWell, it\u2019s four million people from where we are now,\u201d he said, referring to the number of immigrants affected by Mr. Obama\u2019s plan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is defining the limits of discretion,\u201d Justice Kennedy said of the court\u2019s role in determining the lawfulness of the plan. \u201cAnd it seems to me that that is a legislative, not an executive act. \u201d Scott A. Keller, Texas\u2019 solicitor general, said Mr. Obama\u2019s plan was unprecedented and unlawful. He faced skeptical questions from the court\u2019s more liberal members about whether his state had standing. Justice Sotomayor wondered why it would cost more to issue more driver\u2019s licenses. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just let people wait on line?\u201d she asked. A different line, for one of the coveted red tickets that allow members of the public into the Supreme Court for the oral arguments, stretched around the block on Monday. Some people had been camping in front of the court since Friday night, eager for a chance to witness history. Groups of young people walked up and down the sidewalk holding banners and chanting mantras like \u201cS\u00ed se puede,\u201d Spanish for \u201cYes we can. \u201d Thomas Pittman, a retired firefighter and a deacon at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, said he was interested in the effects the case might have on the presidential race. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to have a major impact on the election, due to the fact that Trump wants to deport people and close our borders down,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Obama has said he took action after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, promptly challenged the plan, accusing the president of ignoring administrative procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by sidestepping Congress. If the Supreme Court upholds Mr. Obama\u2019s actions, the White House has vowed to move quickly to set up the program and begin enrolling immigrants before his successor takes over early next year. Democratic presidential candidates have said they would continue the program, but most of the Republicans in the race have vowed to dismantle it and redouble immigration enforcement. Mr. Keller, Texas\u2019 lawyer, acknowledged that the president has wide authority over whom to deport. \u201cIn this case,\u201d he said, \u201cgiven that they are removing 400, 000 people a year, we admit that they could do forbearance from removal. But what they can\u2019t do is grant authorization to be in the country. \u201d He said the states\u2019 quarrel was with what he called a blanket grant of \u201clawful presence\u201d to millions of immigrants, entitling them to various benefits. Mr. Verrilli, the administration\u2019s lawyer, said the term \u201clawful presence\u201d had been misunderstood. Chief Justice Roberts asked him whether he was slicing things a little too fine. \u201cLawfully present does not mean you\u2019re legally present?\u201d the chief justice asked. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Mr. Verrilli responded. Justice Alito said that response was mystifying. \u201cI\u2019m just talking about the English language,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand it. \u201d But Justice Elena Kagan said the term \u201clawful presence\u201d was a red herring, suggesting that the administration could \u201chave done the exact same thing without using that phrase. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562001.1694884}
