He points his fingers and smiles that Apprentice smile as he makes a point. \\nOn the right side of this picture, we have Barack Obama \u2013 a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. He sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office. And Obama, rightly, looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes. \\nBehind Obama sits a bust of Abraham Lincoln, his eyes downcast, mourning for his country. \\nYep. \\nGreatest picture ever. \\nThis is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant. Barack Obama\u2019s image of himself is not accurate \u2013 to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star. He transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfie-stick, celebrity-ridden sinkhole of Hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with Glozell and Macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with Jimmy Kimmel before saying that a reality star like Trump could never be president. \\nThis picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as Obama\u2019s former pastor might put it. \\nAnd then there\u2019s Lincoln. \\nLincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind Barack Obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. \\nLincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd. Given Republicans\u2019 domination of the Senate and the Congress, I have hopes for Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 I hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president, and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises \u2013 but Trump occupying Lincoln\u2019s office is, at best, a jarring visual. \\nThat\u2019s the picture.
