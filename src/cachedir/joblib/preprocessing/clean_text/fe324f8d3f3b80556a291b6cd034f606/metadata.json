Trump, the Manhattan real estate mogul who boasts about his wealth, maintains a fleet of aircraft and sells his own brand of neckties, paid respects on Sunday to an incongruous constituency. \u201cLook at all these bikers,\u201d Mr. Trump, standing before a crowd in front of the Lincoln Memorial, said with admiration. \u201cDo we love the bikers? Yes. We love the bikers. \u201d Mr. Trump was addressing a gathering at the 29th annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle run, a vast event over Memorial Day weekend that is dedicated to accounting for military members taken as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action. Bikers assembled at the Pentagon before riding en masse into the nation\u2019s capital, with many dressed in leather vests covered in patches, their bikes rumbling throughout the afternoon. For the   Mr. Trump, who likes to stress his desire to strengthen the military and improve how veterans are treated, the gathering provided a receptive audience, if one where he might otherwise seem out of place. \u201cHe speaks what\u2019s on his mind and means what he says,\u201d said Tom Christian, 43, a heating and   contractor from Tennessee. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what a biker does. That\u2019s the way we are: We say what we think. If you like it, you like it. If you don\u2019t, go the other way. \u201d The warm embrace from the crowd gave no hint of the controversy that Mr. Trump incited last year when he denigrated the military service of Senator John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Mr. Trump said Mr. McCain, a fellow Republican, was not a war hero, saying, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, O. K.?\u201d Mr. Trump is the latest political figure, but not the only one, to pay attention to bikers. Wearing a black   helmet, Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, appeared at Rolling Thunder in 2011, months before saying she would not run for president in 2012. And one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former Republican rivals, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a proud   owner, campaigned at Harley dealerships and wore motorcycle boots on the campaign trail. Asked during a debate what he wanted his Secret Service code name to be, he suggested Harley. Campaigning in Wisconsin in March, Mr. Trump observed that Mr. Walker was \u201calways on a Harley. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a huge biker, I have to be honest with you, O. K.?\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI always liked the limo better. \u201d Nancy Regg, a spokeswoman for Rolling Thunder, said the group had invited Mr. Trump to appear. The group did not extend an invitation to Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders, she said. Richard McFadden, 58, an annual Rolling Thunder attendee from North Carolina, said Mrs. Clinton would not have been welcome. \u201cJust like asking Jane Fonda to show up, it\u2019d be a very, very bad thing,\u201d said Mr. McFadden, who works in computer support and wore a button that read, \u201cHillary for Prison 2016. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters include a group called \u201cBikers for Trump,\u201d which has more than 46, 000 \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook. Speaking on Sunday, Mr. Trump told the crowd of seeing large numbers of bikers at his campaign events. \u201cI said, \u2018What are they all doing here?\u2019 and my people would say, \u2018They\u2019re here to protect you, Mr. Trump,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing. And I want to tell you, some of these people are tough. \u201d But when he shakes their hands, \u201cthere is love, and it\u2019s an incredible feeling, and that\u2019s why I wanted to be with you today,\u201d he said. Wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and forgoing a necktie, Mr. Trump pledged to rebuild the military and said George S. Patton and other deceased generals were \u201cspinning in their graves. \u201d He lamented that veterans \u201chave been treated so badly in this country\u201d and asserted that in many cases, immigrants in the country illegally were taken better care of. He said that on Tuesday he will detail the money he had raised for veterans\u2019 groups. Standing before the reflecting pool with the Washington Monument offering a striking backdrop, Mr. Trump also expressed disappointment about the size of the crowd, which did not fill the space cordoned off in front of the Lincoln Memorial for the event. \u201cI thought this would be like Dr. Martin Luther King, where the people would be lined up from here all the way to the Washington Monument,\u201d he said. He seemed to blame event organizers, saying he passed enormous crowds along the roads on the way to the gathering, including \u201cthe most beautiful bikes I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. \u201d Two retirees from New Jersey, Tom Gadosky and his companion, Marney Pratt, who are both 67, traveled to Rolling Thunder on their    . Both plan to vote for Mr. Trump in November. \u201cA lot of the people, if you walk around, are baby boomers, like us,\u201d Ms. Pratt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through it all. We want to have it back again. \u201d Neither of them was bothered by what Mr. Trump had said about Mr. McCain. People, Mr. Gadosky said, \u201chave very short memories. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562143.6761818}
