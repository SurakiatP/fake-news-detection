The stunt in question was when MILO called out a transgender student who had been forcing his way into men\u2019s bathrooms under the guise of being a woman at UC Milwaukee. The student later left the university. \u201cWhen you get here on Feb. 1, we will be waiting here to strip you of your gay identity. You can have sex with all the men you want, but you\u2019re not gay anymore. You\u2019ve used your sexual orientation as an excuse to spit bile and galvanize cowards for long enough. Put your badge and gun on my desk. The community rejects you. You have never been one of us,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cYou never should have booked this UC tour, Milo. But you want to come to my town? I say, welcome to Berkeley, motherfucker. I\u2019m the meanest gay on this coast. I was assigned to raise hell at birth. You come through me,\u201d she continued. Technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, also had his event cut short whilst delivering a keynote at UC Berkeley, as protestors stormed the venue. LGBT activists have also claimed that Thiel, who is openly gay, cannot be a real homosexual due to his support for   Trump. MILO\u2019s visit to UC Berkeley will take place Wednesday, February 1.
