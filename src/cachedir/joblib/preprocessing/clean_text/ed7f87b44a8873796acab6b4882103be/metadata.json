President Obama had made a pragmatic calculation in January 2009, as the financial crisis drove communities across the United States toward economic collapse. Whatever he did for   whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others, he would not describe as efforts to specifically help Black America. Mr. Obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of    \u2014   and knowing that no matter what he did, it would not be seen as enough. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018They are going to hate us one day,\u2019\u201d said Melody Barnes, who is black and served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first domestic policy adviser, recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president. \u201cI knew that we couldn\u2019t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations. \u201d The fear inside the West Wing was that promoting a \u201cblack agenda\u201d and aiming programs directly at   at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash  \u2014   the kind that, years later, White House officials would view as helping to elect Donald J. Trump. \u201cAt a minimum, that would have been tone deaf,\u201d said Eric H. Holder Jr. who served as the nation\u2019s first   attorney general during much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201cand at worst, would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do. \u201d Mr. Obama, who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, wanted to be the president of all America. Framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering, he thought. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to lift the economy over all,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in the summer of 2009 when he was asked about doing more to help   recover economically. But over the next seven and a half years, racial tensions across the country forced Mr. Obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. Ultimately he led a national conversation on race ignited by spasms of violence  \u2014   police shootings and protests in Florida, South Carolina, Missouri and elsewhere. Inside the White House, aides recall them as among his most painful moments as president. \u201cAfter my election there was talk of a   America,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his farewell speech on Tuesday in Chicago, reflecting on the threat that racial strife poses for the country\u2019s democratic ideals. \u201cSuch a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. \u201d After he leaves office, Mr. Obama will continue that conversation in work for My Brother\u2019s Keeper and other programs to help black youths. There is plenty to do. As much as his   presidency has inspired and empowered   black unemployment is still about double that for whites. Nearly a quarter of blacks are living in poverty, almost the same as in 1976. \u201cHe made it seem like everything was all good, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Thelonious Stokes, 21, a black artist whose experiences of being racially profiled in Chicago left him jaded about the state of race relations. \u201cWe almost needed Trump to show the true state of America. \u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s earliest public reflection about race as president backfired. Asked about a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr. a friend of Mr. Obama\u2019s who was arrested in July 2009 trying to enter his own house by a white officer, Mr. Obama immediately took sides. \u201cIt is fair to say,\u201d the president said six days after the arrest at a   news conference, \u201cthat the Cambridge police acted stupidly. \u201d Those words  \u2014   and the frenzied reaction to them  \u2014   helped deepen the caution about racial issues inside the White House. For days, the president\u2019s critique of the arresting officer dominated the news and the morning staff meetings in the West Wing. Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, was especially agitated, his colleagues recalled, and argued that the White House had to do something to change the subject. Mr. Gibbs succeeded in pushing for what the news media quickly labeled a \u201cbeer summit\u201d on the edge of the Rose Garden in the White House, where Mr. Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, joined Mr. Obama over beer for a discussion. \u201cIt had to be cauterized in a way that it would stop leading the news,\u201d Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s closest adviser, conceded. Professor Gates, for one, was pleased. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody but Barack Obama would have thought about bringing us together,\u201d he said at the time. As a candidate for president in 2008, Mr. Obama had drawn praise for confronting racial divisions during a powerful speech he delivered about his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. who had characterized the United States as fundamentally racist and the government as corrupt. \u201cThe profound mistake of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It\u2019s that he spoke as if our society was static as if no progress had been made,\u201d Mr. Obama said that March day in Philadelphia, urging people to move beyond old racial wounds. \u201cLet us be our brother\u2019s keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister\u2019s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well. \u201d But the beer summit was deeply disturbing to many of the president\u2019s   advisers, who thought he should not have backed down. The officer had acted stupidly, they thought, and the nation\u2019s first black president ought to be able to say so. The meeting \u201cwas demeaning and diminished his leadership and his voice at that moment,\u201d one of them recalled, asking for anonymity to bluntly discuss the topic. \u201cPeople thought we were being punked. I got so many emails, so many phone calls from people I respected: \u2018He was right. Why are you backpedaling? \u2019\u201d Inside the West Wing, the impact was clear. Mr. Obama would have to be more cautious when it came to racial issues, particularly ahead of the 2012   campaign. The issue of race was too divisive at a time when Mr. Obama needed to emphasize inclusion. \u201cWhat it did teach us is that you just have to be careful about the words that you choose,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you shy away from issues that arise that deal with race, just as he didn\u2019t shy away from Reverend Wright. But you have to be sensitive to a long history of people reacting strongly to the topic. \u201d Outside the White House, people noticed, too: \u201cHe plainly arrested him because he was black,\u201d said Edward G. Robinson Sr. who is black and works at a box factory in Cleveland. Mr. Obama \u201cbacktracked because he wanted to be everybody\u2019s president. \u201d Like others, Mr. Robinson said the president was met with racially motivated disrespect in Washington, and pointed to the moment when a white Republican lawmaker yelled, \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the president during a congressional address. The White House would go on to publish reports about its efforts to help   including details about the impact that the Affordable Care Act was having to help poor blacks. But Mr. Obama rarely talked about race publicly during the next few years. The president\u2019s voice was shaking with emotion. \u201cIf I had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin,\u201d Mr. Obama told Ms. Jarrett and David Plouffe, his senior adviser and former campaign manager, as the three talked in the Oval Office about what the president should say publicly about the death of the      at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. \u201cI am going to say that. \u201d It was March 2012, nearly three years after the beer summit. The specter of that meeting still hovered and Mr. Obama was, in a sense, taking sides again. But in personalizing the shooting, his aides recalled, Mr. Obama\u2019s hope was that people might view   boys differently if they saw Trayvon through the president\u2019s own eyes. Mr. Obama headed out to the Rose Garden, announced his nomination of a new World Bank president, then took the question from a reporter that everyone knew was coming: \u201cCan you comment on the Trayvon Martin case, sir?\u201d Mr. Obama called it a tragedy, said he was glad the Justice Department was looking into it, reflected on how the nation was doing necessary soul searching and then concluded: \u201cBut my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. If I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon. \u2019\u2019 Moments after Mr. Obama returned to the Oval Office, Gene Sperling, one of his top economic advisers, stopped by with tears in his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what that will mean to my son,\u201d Mr. Sperling, who is white and is married to an   woman, told the president, according to a colleague who was there at the time. This time, the president\u2019s comments were embraced by many outside the White House, too. Media reports focused on the emotion Mr. Obama had displayed  \u2014   rare for a politician whose usual demeanor was cool and professorial. \u201cFor him to say things like that in front of the entire country and the world, I think sends a strong message to people,\u201d Ryan Shultz, 33, an art teacher in Chicago who is white, said in a recent interview. But others viewed the president\u2019s comments that day as a continuing affront to police officers and a saw in them a willingness to take sides in the racial debate. For at least one person, it went further. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine parishioners in Charleston, S. C. in 2015, later said he was inspired to kill because of media coverage of Trayvon\u2019s shooting. \u201cCrime is still bad and police are still shooting black people left and right,\u201d Mr. Shultz said. \u201cI live in Chicago  \u2014   a murder capital of the United States  \u2014   and it\u2019s crazy and it hasn\u2019t gotten that much better, I don\u2019t think. \u201d Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo. shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014. Only minutes before, Mr. Obama had arrived on Martha\u2019s Vineyard for his summer vacation, which would soon be dominated by how to respond to the racial violence that Mr. Brown\u2019s death unleashed. The president and his aides, including Mr. Holder and Ms. Jarrett, who were also vacationing on the island, made urgent calls to Missouri\u2019s governor, state police officials and civil rights leaders. They debated whether Mr. Obama should go to Ferguson, and decided against it, knowing that a presidential visit would be disruptive. Mr. Holder would go instead. But the more urgent question for the three of them was how to weigh in. The president was wary of putting his thumb on the scale in a case destined to be investigated by the federal authorities. But it was just as clear that tensions between the police and   were increasing  \u2014   not only in Ferguson, but also around the country. If Mr. Obama wasn\u2019t the right person to step into that issue, who was? \u201cYou want to try to calm the situation,\u201d Mr. Holder said, recalling the discussions he had with the president and Ms. Jarrett about what to say. \u201cYou want to reassure the community that an investigation will be done and done fully. But you want to make sure that the people in law enforcement know it is done fairly. \u201d \u201cThere was that trust gap,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was something that had to be dealt with. \u201d As the violence worsened, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama and Ms. Jarrett concluded that the president needed to denounce the violence  \u2014   and at the same time criticize the police for their conduct during the protests. \u201cThere is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,\u201d the president said in a televised statement on Aug. 14 from Edgartown, Mass. But he added, \u201cThere\u2019s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. \u201d For the rest of his presidency, Mr. Obama would strive for the balance he struck in his remarks that day: empathy and understanding for   and support for the police and the rule of law. But however he weighed in, the events in Ferguson made clear that he could no longer hang back and instead had to lead a national debate about race, violence and unity. \u201cOnce it was so in America\u2019s face, police brutality, it blew the circuit,\u201d said Bill Burton, an   who served as deputy White House press secretary during the first term. \u201cIt made it possible to have that conversation that our country had actively not been having. \u201d Inevitably, Mr. Obama\u2019s striving for balance often left him vilified by both sides. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, rebuked Mr. Obama for not being \u201chelpful\u201d in discussing police tactics from his vacation. Years later, Mr. Pasco told NPR that the president often struck the wrong tone when he talked about race and policing. \u201cThe president has never been a police officer. He\u2019s never walked in a police officer\u2019s shoes,\u201d Mr. Pasco said last July. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a breakdown in communication more than there is a breakdown in insincerity or intent. \u201d Ja\u2019Mal Green, a    Black Lives Matter activist based in Chicago, said he thought Mr. Obama \u201cignored\u201d the calls of organizers for federal policy and funding aimed at stopping police brutality. Mr. Green said he also grew tired of hearing Mr. Obama couple his grief for families in racially charged shooting episodes with statements supporting white police officers. \u201cHe is trying to walk a neutral line and he wants to please both sides,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cHe wants to please black people and then he wants to please police supporters and police officers and police unions. But sometimes you have to pick a side in situations. You need to pick your time when you fight for home or you\u2019ll just have everybody hating you. \u2019\u201d Mr. Stokes, the    artist from Chicago, felt similarly disappointed. \u201cChicago is the exact same,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cHe simply opened up, maybe, a lane for young men like me to just maybe be accepted a little bit more to people that don\u2019t accept educated black people. But that\u2019s it, literally. White America is still running everything, and that means that nothing is changing. \u201d Less than a year after Mr. Brown\u2019s death in Ferguson, on June 17, 2015, nine   parishioners, including a pastor, were gunned down by a    white supremacist during a church meeting in Charleston. Two days later, the victims\u2019 families addressed Mr. Roof, the gunman, at a court hearing, where one by one they forgave him. \u201cYou took something very precious away from me,\u201d Nadine Collier, the daughter of    Ethel Lance, told Mr. Roof, as her voice rose in anguish. \u201cI will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul. \u201d It was an extraordinary scene, broadcast live on television, which moved many who saw it to tears. Mr. Obama was traveling and did not see it in real time, but when Eric Schultz, the deputy press secretary, read Ms. Collier\u2019s words out loud to Mr. Obama on Marine One, the presidential helicopter, the president was awed by what he heard. \u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s what we need to recognize here, the ability of people to forgive on the worst day of their lives.\u2019 It really struck him,\u201d Ms Jarrett recalled. \u201cWe sat there and talked about it on the helicopter. About that quality, the amazing grace. \u201d Later, in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama struggled with his chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, to come up with the right words for a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor of the Charleston church and a friend of the president\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say,\u201d Mr. Keenan told Mr. Obama, according to Ms. Jarrett. \u201cYou\u2019ve said everything that one could possibly say on the subject. \u201d Eventually, the president decided that instead of talking about guns he would talk about what black churches stood for and the meaning of grace. \u201cIt would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again,\u201d the president told a hushed audience at the memorial service. \u201cOnce the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual  \u2014   that\u2019s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society. To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change  \u2014   that\u2019s how we lose our way again. \u201d The week before, during a podcast interview with Marc Maron, the comedian, Mr. Obama had caused a minor stir by using the word \u201cnigger\u201d in answering a question about race relations. He knew it would cause a ripple, an aide with him recalled, but he shrugged. At the beginning of his term, the podcast could have caused a fury and Mr. Obama might have pulled back again. But events in the country  \u2014   especially the deaths of young black men  \u2014   had given him more opportunities to engage the topic. Mr. Pinckney\u2019s funeral was one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to just whistle in the wind,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a chance to talk to people when they are ready to hear him. He doesn\u2019t ignore moments. \u201d One of those moments came this past May. Mr. Obama had a little more than eight months left in office, and he had already said plenty about race. But as he headed to deliver the 2016 commencement address at Howard University, the historically black college in Washington, Mr. Obama said he had something he wanted to add. It was a message to young   the ones who wanted to protest the injustices they saw around them. The president had invited some of them to the White House to talk with him about their cause, and in a few cases, they refused the invitation. People close to him said that made him burn. \u201cYou can be completely right, and you still are going to have to engage folks who disagree with you,\u201d Mr. Obama told the students that day, speaking more to members of the Black Lives Matter movement than to the graduates before him. Being \u201cas uncompromising as possible, you will feel good about yourself, you will enjoy a certain moral purity, but you\u2019re not going to get what you want. \u201d For the president, a onetime community organizer in Chicago, it was a crucial distinction. Mr. Obama had tilted against the powerful and connected  \u2014   he called his time as an organizer \u201cthe best education I ever had, better than anything I got at Harvard Law School. \u201d His approach had always been more strategic than confrontational and foreshadowed his cautious, meticulous attitude in the White House. In the speech, Mr. Obama recalled working as a young Illinois state senator to fight racial profiling, not by calling the police racist, but by sitting down and negotiating a new law. \u201cSo we engaged and we listened, and we kept working until we built consensus,\u201d he said. By the time he became president, people close to Mr. Obama said, he was frustrated by the idea that young activists would view themselves as tainted if they came into the White House to talk to him. In the speech, he urged the young protesters not to give in to the idea that the system is rigged. \u201cThat will lead to more cynicism, and less participation, and a downward spiral of more injustice and more anger and more despair,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s never been the source of our progress. That\u2019s how we cheat ourselves of progress. \u201d \u201cListen,\u201d he told the students. \u201cEngage. If the other side has a point, learn from them. If they\u2019re wrong, rebut them. Teach them. \u201d Mr. Obama has told people that he avoided framing his early White House efforts in overtly racial terms because he wanted to avoid a white backlash  \u2014   but acknowledges that he got one anyway. Still, the president repeatedly tells crowds like the students at Howard that race relations are better since he graduated from college. \u201cTo deny how far we\u2019ve come would do a disservice to the cause of justice, to the legions of foot soldiers,\u201d he told them last May. Two days after the 2016 election, Mr. Obama took his own advice about engaging adversaries by sitting down in the Oval Office for 90 minutes with Mr. Trump. Many in his party were still in shock about the election\u2019s results, and wanted to see fury from their president. Instead, he offered a hand. In Atlanta, Latonda Henderson, a    marketing consultant, watched Mr. Obama\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump with admiration as the president she loved sat down with the man who had led the movement questioning the legitimacy of his birth certificate. \u201cYou sit down with people who opposed you,\u201d said Ms. Henderson, who is black. \u201cYou sit down and try to find a common ground with people who were attacking your family, spitting on your family. That\u2019s President Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563952.9939492}
