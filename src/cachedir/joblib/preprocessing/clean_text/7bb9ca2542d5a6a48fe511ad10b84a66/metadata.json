I\u2019m not afraid to admit that at that moment, I was terrified.\u201d \\n\u201cIt soon became a race to see how quickly we could reach the emergency services and get him some treatment before the ego suffered permanent damage.\u201d \\nThe star\u2019s support staff reacted swiftly, with an on-site emergency first-aider ensuring Kanye received some much needed mouth-to-ear ego stroking. \\nOne witness explained, \u201cI think that first-aid saved his ego to be honest \u2013 they just seemed to instinctively know how to react, and the right thing to say. Thankfully the paramedics arrived after just a few minutes. \\n\u201cThey brought all this incredible equipment and spent about fifteen minutes applying emergency ego-massage, while the rest of us just looked on in horror. \\n\u201cFortunately they managed to stabilise him so that they could get him to the hospital, but they continued the ego-massage as they loaded him into the ambulance. \\n\u201cThe last thing I heard them say was, \u2018You\u2019re amazing Kanye, and The College Dropout is the best album of the last twenty years, and that\u2019s absolutely all down to you, and you alone\u2019.\u201d \\nKanye was rushed to a specialist \u2018Ego Hospital\u2019 in Beverly Hills and underwent a complex eight-hour surgery to re-locate the ego, which Doctors have declared a complete success. \\nA hospital spokesperson confirmed that his recuperation could take up to eight weeks, but that he would likely make a full recovery and should return to his previous levels of brazen egotism.
