Trump left little doubt on Monday that he intends to run on the same proposals on immigration and terrorism that animated his primary campaign, using his first speech after the massacre in Orlando, Fla. to propose sweeping measures against Muslims that pay little heed to American traditions of pluralism. Without distinguishing between mainstream Muslims and Islamist terrorists, Mr. Trump suggested that all Muslim immigrants posed potential threats to America\u2019s security and called for a ban on migrants from any part of the world with \u201ca proven history of terrorism\u201d against the United States or its allies. He also insinuated that American Muslims were all but complicit in acts of domestic terrorism for failing to report attacks in advance, asserting without evidence that they had warnings of shootings like the one in Orlando. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, delivered at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N. H. represented an extraordinary break from the longstanding rhetorical norms of American presidential nominees. But if his language more closely resembled a European nationalist\u2019s than a mainstream Republican\u2019s, he was wagering that voters are stirred more by their fears of Islamic terrorism than any concerns they may have about his flouting traditions of tolerance and respect for religious diversity. Mr. Trump, who drew criticism last fall, including a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for first suggesting a constitutionally questionable ban on Muslim immigration, on Monday described Islamic extremism as a pervasive global menace that was penetrating the United States through unchecked immigration. Citing the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 by two men with ties to Chechnya and instances of radicalization in Minnesota\u2019s Somali immigrant community, Mr. Trump painted a bleak portrait of the country as under siege from within and abroad. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. \u201d He accused American Muslims of failing to \u201cturn in the people who they know are bad,\u201d effectively blaming other Muslims for the shooting in Orlando and the attack last year in San Bernardino, Calif. that was carried out by a married couple inspired by the Islamic State. \u201cThey didn\u2019t turn them in,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand we had death and destruction. \u201d Mr. Trump carefully read his remarks from a teleprompter and offered more detail than his stump speeches generally contain, but his speech was still rife with the sort of misstatements and exaggerations that have typified his campaign. He repeatedly stretched the facts, for example, in describing the United States as overrun by dangerous migrants. He claimed the country has an \u201cimmigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country,\u201d brushing aside the entire customs and immigration enforcement infrastructure. And he asserted that there was a \u201ctremendous flow\u201d of Syrian refugees, when just 2, 805 of them were admitted into the country from October to May, fewer than   of the 10, 000 Syrians President Obama said the United States would accept this fiscal year. Mr. Trump described the gunman in the Orlando shooting as \u201can Afghan,\u201d though he was born an American citizen in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Afghanistan to the United States over three decades ago. Mr. Trump assailed the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, accusing her of favoring immigration policies that would invite a flood of potential jihadists to the United States, which he warned could be \u201ca better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was. \u201d Mrs. Clinton, speaking in Cleveland earlier in the day, argued that engaging in \u201cinflammatory,   rhetoric\u201d made the country less safe. Delivering the sort of conventional speech that most presidential contenders would offer in the wake of tragedy, she did not mention Mr. Trump. But, while saying the \u201cmurder of innocent people breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security and makes us furious,\u201d she described proposals to ban Muslim immigration as offensive and counterproductive. \u201cAmerica is strongest when we all believe we have a stake in our country and our future,\u201d she said, calling to mind the bipartisan spirit that took hold after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when she was a senator from New York. Mrs. Clinton has sought to present herself as the default choice of mainstream voters, including Republicans disturbed by Mr. Trump, and on Monday she stressed the importance of building relationships between law enforcement agencies and American Muslims. \u201cOur open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. As Mrs. Clinton reached for the mantle of statesmanship, Mr. Trump\u2019s speech amounted to a rejection of the conventional wisdom that he must remake himself for the November election as a more sober figure and discard the volcanic tone and ethnic and racial provocation that marked his primary campaign. Yet Mr. Trump has showed little interest in assuaging those concerns. He used the hours after the Orlando massacre to claim prescience about the attack and to demand Mr. Obama\u2019s resignation. Then, in a television interview on Monday morning, Mr. Trump darkly suggested that the president was sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. \u201cWe\u2019re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he\u2019s got something else in mind,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere is something going on. \u201d Some Republicans said Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to play to his   base was undermining his standing as a general election candidate. \u201cHe has to do what Reagan had to do. Reagan eventually had to make a sale that he was not a risk,\u201d said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman, recalling the 1980 election. \u201cThere is time, but the way he\u2019s going about it now doesn\u2019t do it at all. It keeps him in the hunt, but it doesn\u2019t get him elected. \u201d John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary and an adviser to John McCain\u2019s and Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaigns, said he anticipated that Mr. Trump\u2019s standing would improve after the Orlando attack. But he said Mr. Trump\u2019s Muslim ban went \u201ctoo far\u201d and questioned whether he had made any effort to learn about national security. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks may come as an acute disappointment to Republican leaders in Washington who have spent the days since he claimed the party\u2019s nomination pleading with him to button down his campaign, only to see him intensify its racial tenor. It is enough to convince senior Republicans that talk of an eventual pivot is folly  \u2014   that he is unwilling or incapable of being reined in. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Look, he\u2019s so civilized, he eats with a knife and fork,\u2019\u201d said Mike Murphy, a former top adviser to Jeb Bush. \u201cAnd then an hour later, he takes the fork and stabs somebody in the eye with it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628549.95163}
