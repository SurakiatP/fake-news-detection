The sentence was roughly double the number of years suggested under federal sentencing guidelines. The man, Alonzo Knowles, 24, had used his illicit access to the celebrity accounts to obtain unreleased movie and television scripts and personal information, which he then tried to sell for thousands of dollars, prosecutors said. Mr. Knowles had also stolen unreleased music, financial documents, and nude and intimate images and videos, the government said. Kristy J. Greenberg, a prosecutor, said in Federal District Court in Manhattan that Mr. Knowles\u2019s motivation had been greed. \u201cHe had a singular focus on becoming rich and famous,\u201d she said, \u201cby disseminating personal information of celebrities and exploiting them. \u201d Several victims had submitted statements to the judge. Naturi Naughton, an actress in the Starz drama \u201cPower,\u201d said in a video statement that Mr. Knowles had hacked her personal emails and stolen six scripts of the show, and then \u201ctried to extort me, the producer, 50 Cent and my showrunner. \u201d \u201cI have never felt more violated and out of control in my entire life,\u201d Ms. Naughton said. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer of Federal District Court called Mr. Knowles\u2019s crimes \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d and told him that he had chosen to use \u201cyour gifts, your   for dark and lawless ends. \u201d When Mr. Knowles pleaded guilty in federal court in May, he apologized, saying he knew what he had done was wrong. But he then wrote in emails sent from jail that he planned to write a book and reveal the secrets of the victims whose accounts he had broken into, the government said. \u201cIm name dropping everyone involved and what I know,\u201d Mr. Knowles wrote, \u201cand im including pictures of paperwork that aint public. \u201d He wrote that he would charge $35 a copy, would hack into Twitter accounts to promote his book and that his goal was to make money. \u201cEveryone loves gossip,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI cant wait to get out i already know how the cover is gonna look. \u201d The emails, which prosecutors cited in a sentencing memorandum to Judge Engelmayer, had been sent on a Bureau of Prisons email system that prisoners may use after they give consent to the monitoring of their messages. The judge said that Mr. Knowles\u2019s jailhouse messages were \u201cdevoid of any remorse,\u201d and showed that if he were released from prison any time soon, he \u201cwould be a clear and present danger to commit the very same crime again. \u201d \u201cUnavoidably, Mr. Knowles,\u201d Judge Engelmayer said, \u201cthe public has a significant interest in your being behind bars in federal prison where you have no access to the internet and no practical ability to do such harm. \u201d Mr. Knowles, who had pleaded guilty to charges of identity theft and criminal copyright infringement, read a brief statement, apologizing to the court and his victims. \u201cWhat I did was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have ruined people\u2019s lives. \u201d His lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, had asked for a sentence of 14 months. Mr. Knowles had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years the federal sentencing guidelines, which are not binding on a judge, had suggested 27 to 33 months, his plea agreement shows. Mr. Knowles was arrested last December after he flew to New York to meet with a man who was posing as a potential buyer of the scripts he had stolen. The man was actually an undercover agent. The case drew attention in part because it followed the widely publicized hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014. The Knowles case also showed how a hacker could obtain confidential information from victims by targeting the accounts of their friends and associates, a process Mr. Knowles called \u201csocial engineering. \u201d \u201cIn the wee hours of the night, when his victims were likely asleep, Knowles trolled his victims\u2019 private email accounts, obtaining their most personal communications,\u201d the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had said in its sentencing memorandum.'"}, "time": 1742628431.818782}
