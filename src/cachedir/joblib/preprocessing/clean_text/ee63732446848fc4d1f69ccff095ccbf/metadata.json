It would be completely pointless to try and compare her to the eloquent Michelle Obama or any other former First Lady for that matter. The best way to get to know the wife of President-elect Donald Trump is to, well, compare her to him. \\nTheir differences are glaring. She is an immigrant; he hates immigrants. She speaks five languages; he\u2019s barely mastered one. But they do have a lot in common as well. Melania\u2019s father was a Communist party member; and as Putin can attest, Donald likes Communists . \\nThey also both really love Donald. In her speech at the Republican rally in Berwyn, Philadelphia on November 3, 2016, Melania said about Donald, \u201cHe knows how to get things done. He certainly knows how to shake things up, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d \\nYou can watch her speech here: \\nMelania was apparently talking her husband\u2019s approach to politics but was she really. In 1998, at the tender age of 28, the Yugoslav-born former model, Melania Knauss, met Donald Trump at a fashion party. He was still married to Marla Maples and was on a date with another woman. He sent his date to the washroom so he could get Melania\u2019s phone number. Yep, he knows how to get \u2018er done in a variety of areas. \\nBut Melania knows how to shake things up, too. Just ask Howard Stern. In 1999, Melania participated in an on-air radio conversation with the shock jock. \\n\u201cAre you naked? Are you nude?\u201d Howard asked Melania. \\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d she said. \\n\u201cAhhh, I\u2019ve got my pants off already,\u201d replied Howard. \\nLike her husband, she apparently loves getting her picture taken as well. You can check out some of the most un-First Lady like pictures here when Melania was profiled in 2000 by GQ. The photos were posted online again in March 2016. Included in the spread, which took place on Trump\u2019s customized Boeing 727, is Melania spread out naked on the bed. \\nAir Force One \u2013 here they come! \\nFeatured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564494.9774575}
