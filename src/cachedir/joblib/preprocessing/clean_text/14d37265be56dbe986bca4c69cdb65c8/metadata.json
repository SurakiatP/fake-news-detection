Friday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d former NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor Tom Brokaw advised Democrats to pick and choose their fights, including their obstruction efforts of Supreme Court justice nominee Neil Gorsuch.  \u201cA lot of young people come up to me and say, \u2018I\u2019m just outraged by what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d Brokaw said. \u201cI say, \u2018Rage is not a policy.\u2019 That\u2019s my advice to them. You\u2019ve got to figure out what you want to do. For example, there\u2019s going to be a big pushback about Judge Gorsuch from the Democrats. They\u2019re going to make that one of the testing places for them. The fact is, this man has a very distinct background in the judicial world. He has a doctorate from Oxford. I have friends in the federal judiciary that don\u2019t agree with his philosophy but say there is not a better judge in the federal circuit right now. So why pick that as a fight because who are you going to get next and what issues are you going to raise given the reality of where the Democrats are at this moment. \u201d According to Brokaw, Democrats have their own internal problems and not putting the effort to rebuilding their own party will be to their detriment. \u201cThey\u2019re playing by the Republican playbook, frankly, for the last eight years,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the other thing is, Democrats have a lot of reconstruction to do of their own party and that\u2019s what they ought to be thinking about and that\u2019s what they should be getting  \u2014   they ought to be out in the middle of America saying what do we need to know from you rather than sitting in Washington, reelecting Nancy Pelosi after they lost the House three different times. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562000.1774378}
