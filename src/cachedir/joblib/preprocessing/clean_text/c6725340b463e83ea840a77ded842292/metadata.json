In a statement, Temple University said the implications of the new study were \u201cfar-reaching\u201d.\\n\u201cThe gene-editing platform by itself may be able to eradicate HIV-1 DNA from patients, but it is also highly flexible and potentially could be used in combination with existing antiretroviral drugs to further suppress viral RNA. It also could be adapted to target mutated strains of HIV-1,\u201d it added. Professor Khalili said a clinical trial could happen within the next few years, but he first planned to carry out a similar study involving a larger group of animals.\\n\\nTMZ Breaking \\nSOURCE '"}, "time": 1742563953.1668854}
