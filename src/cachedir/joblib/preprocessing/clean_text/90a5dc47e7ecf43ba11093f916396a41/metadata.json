His poll numbers are dropping. The other 3rd party candidate is Jill Stein of the Green Party who is seeing an actual rise in her numbers in spite of lies and smears coming from mostly the Democrats, with assistance from the main stream media,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cThat the race is tightening is no surprise. It often happens at this time but the reasons now are not because people are becoming more assured of who they want but more and more disgusted in the choices they have,\u201d he stated. \\n\u201cRegardless of who wins, and it\u2019s most probable that it\u2019ll be either Clinton or Trump, this country\u2019s nightmare will only begin on Jan 21st, the day after the inauguration. If it\u2019s Clinton one wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the ink on the articles of impeachment isn\u2019t already dried. By then, it\u2019s possible that criminal charges will have been presented to her or that she had received by then a presidential pardon from the outgoing President Obama,\u201d the analyst noted. \\n\u201cPresident Ford once said, when he was a leader in the House of Representatives, that impeachment is for whatever the Congress wants it to be. Simply the whiff of impropriety or criminal behavior would make any partisan congressman see that as reason enough for such an article of impeachment. Compound that with an actual indictment and it\u2019s guaranteed,\u201d he said. \\nThe commentator said, \u201cTrump has a different set of problems if he were to be inaugurated in January. His positions are so outlandish that even his own party, which by and large has rejected him, would pounce on anything he does that would jeopardize their chances as a party and individually in the next off-year elections of 2018.\u201d \\n\u201cWe have to look inward as to what kind of nation we are that we have degenerated to the point where a majority of Americans want neither candidate to win,\u201d he said in his concluding remarks.'"}, "time": 1742563804.8888636}
