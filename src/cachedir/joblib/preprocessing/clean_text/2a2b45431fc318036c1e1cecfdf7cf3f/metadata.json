Think again\u2026 Ultimately, the Electoral College votes determine who becomes president, not the majority or popular vote. So, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. (1) The popular vote, on the other hand, is to appease the masses in thinking that they actually have a say in who gets elected. The above image is from NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, TN who apparently already have the results from the election that hasn\u2019t occurred yet. (2) So, how is this possible? In 2012, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) legalized the use of PROPAGANDA on the American public. (3) This includes ANYTHING the mainstream media \u201creports\u201d including the election results before they happened. This is reminiscent of the BBC announcing that World Trade Center building 7 collapsed before it actually collapsed on 9/11.

When the reporter asks if that is already a \u201cdone deal\u201d\u2013 that Clinton will be our next president no matter what \u2013 Soros says \u201cyes,\u201d and nods his head. (5) George Soros is most likely one of the main cogs in the shadow government . Look no further than all of the money his \u201cOpen Society Institute\u201d donated to \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d (6). His main agenda is to keep America living in the premise of \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d. As long as America is divided, we cannot come together under a united cause. A George Soros company, Smartmatic, has provided voting machine technology in 16 states including battleground zones like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. You can read more about George Soros and his dark allegiance here . Other jurisdictions affected are California, District of Columbia, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. Its website includes a flow-chart that describes how the company has contributed to elections in the U.S. from 2006-2015 with \u201c57,000 voting and counting machines deployed\u201d and \u201c35 million voters assisted.\u201d After this report\u2019s publication, Smartmatic updated its website to remove the flow chart and declare that \u201cSmartmatic will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.\u201d (7) I\u2019m not buying it. Are you? My \u201cvote\u201d is for a council of elders to replace ALL governments and politicians . The current system is corrupt, broken, and outdated. It's time to evolve!
