[The two alleged rapists, ages 17 and 18, enrolled as freshmen at a public high school in Rockville, Maryland, after federal immigration authorities detained and later released them even though they were in the country illegally, the Baltimore Sun reported.  The suspects allegedly forced a girl to perform oral sex on them in a bathroom stall while they raped and sodomized her, despite her crying out in pain, begging them to stop, police said. Police investigating the incident found blood and DNA at the scene of the crime, Fox DC reported.   television networks left their viewers uninformed about the rape case, according to the Times. Times writers John Koblin and Nick Corasanti said that, unlike the other networks, Fox News gave \u201cconsiderable time\u201d to what they called \u201ca rape case in Maryland. \u201d They added that \u201cviewers would not have heard\u201d about the Rockville rape\u201d if they had turned to CNN or MSNBC,\u201d where the case was \u201cvirtually uncovered\u201d on those networks. The Times also said that Fox News was accurate in criticizing the other networks for not covering the issue, according to an   \u201c \u201d by the paper. Even though the story was ignored by most networks, the alleged rape has generated national outrage. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the alleged rape by illegal immigrants is one of the reasons why President Trump is so \u201cpassionate\u201d about cracking down on illegal immigration. \u201cThis is a tragic event, and it is horrendous, and horrible, and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I can\u2019t possibly imagine,\u201d Spicer said at the White House on Tuesday.'"}, "time": 1742564001.9894469}
