Hurricane Matthew is barreling toward the U. S. after killing nearly 300 people on its rampage through Haiti, above. The storm is expected to make landfall in Florida early Friday. (Follow our live coverage.) \u201cYou need to leave. Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott told the 1. 5 million residents in evacuation zones. \u201cThis storm will kill you. Time is running out. \u201d ____ 2. The N. S. A. contractor arrested on suspicion of stealing highly classified information, Harold Martin III, doesn\u2019t fit any of the usual profiles of an \u201cinsider threat,\u201d officials say. One of the officials described Mr. Martin, a Navy veteran, as a hoarder. He worked at the same consulting firm as Edward Snowden, but investigators suspect that he began taking material  \u2014   some of it was code used to hack into the networks of foreign governments  \u2014   before Mr. Snowden\u2019s actions became public. ____ 3. Donald Trump says he should be elected because of his business acumen. But a close look at about 60 ventures started or promoted by him showed that   flopped or had problems. Mike Pence, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, declared that Mr. Trump no longer wants to impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants  \u2014   a significant reversal. And the places Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign views as most critical can be identified through the presence of a particularly powerful advocate: Michelle Obama. ____ 4. Your surgeon is probably a Republican and your psychiatrist is probably a Democrat. That\u2019s according to our new data analysis, which found that physicians\u2019 political leanings tend to vary according to their specialty. Urologists and anesthesiologists also tended to be registered Republicans, while   of doctors in infectious disease, psychiatry and pediatrics are Democrats. ____ 5. The Syrian war is often cast as a contest between competing rebel groups and the government of President Bashar  . The truth is messier. A tangled array of allies is fighting on the government\u2019s behalf, including Iraqi militias, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Afghan refugees and Hezbollah. They\u2019re backed by Russia, but not fully controlled by it, adding to the chaos on the ground. ____ 6. West Bank settlers are preparing for a clash with the Israeli government. One flagship settlement, Amona, was the site of a bloody 2006 confrontation between settlers and thousands of police officers sent to raze nine homes. Now the Supreme Court has ordered that the entire outpost be dismantled by Dec. 25. Israel plans to move residents to a nearby settlement. The Obama administration has condemned that plan. ____ 7. Governments from more than 190 countries adopted a measure to reduce the climate impact of international jet travel. Rather than reduce emissions, the plan calls for carriers to buy credits  \u2014   things like forest conservation programs  \u2014   to offset them. The measure takes effect in 2021. But it will be voluntary for the first six years, and countries can opt out. ____ 8. A surge in deaths from drug overdoses across the U. S. has become a lifeline for people waiting for organ transplants. \u201cIt\u2019s an unexpected silver lining to what is otherwise a pretty horrendous situation,\u201d said Alexandra Glazier, chief executive of the New England Organ Bank. ____ 9. \u201cFrom now on, this is it. Humans will never get older than 115. \u201d That\u2019s according to an expert on aging who, with two graduate students, published evidence that we might have hit our ceiling on longevity. Not everyone agrees. And for the sake of Yisrael Kristal, who celebrated his bar mitzvah last weekend at the youthful age of 113, let\u2019s remember that there are always outliers. Mr. Kristal, who was imprisoned at Auschwitz during the Holocaust, is the world\u2019s oldest man. ____ 10. \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d the debut film from the director Nate Parker, above, hits theaters Friday. The film dramatizes the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner, played by Mr. Parker, in Virginia in 1831. It was billed as the   movie of the year. But details that emerged about a 1999 sexual assault case involving Mr. Parker made it simultaneously the \u201cwon\u2019 \u201d movie of the year, our critic writes. ____ 11. Finally, New Yorkers can now remain close to their pets even after death. A new law allows pets to be buried alongside their owners in cemeteries meant for people. It can be a dog, a cat, a turtle  \u2014   any domestic animal. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a kid, so it\u2019s like having a kid buried next to you,\u201d a pet owner said.
