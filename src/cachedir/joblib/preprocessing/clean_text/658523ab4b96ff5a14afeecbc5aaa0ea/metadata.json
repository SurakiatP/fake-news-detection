And, more than a year before it arrives in many cities, theaters around the country are trying to convert the hunger for tickets into subscriptions and memberships. In many cities, theaters are encouraging potential patrons to subscribe to their   seasons, even though \u201cHamilton\u201d won\u2019t arrive until the following season, with the promise that those who subscribe now  \u2014   and then renew  \u2014   will be guaranteed \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets and can lock in their chosen subscription seats. The strategy is   because the theaters acknowledge that some tickets will ultimately be available for sale to nonsubscribers. Given the widespread publicity over the scarcity of tickets to the Broadway production of \u201cHamilton,\u201d though, many theatergoers appear unwilling to risk facing a   show in their hometowns. \u201cIn my 38 years of being involved with selling tickets for various activities, I don\u2019t believe there has ever been this kind of \u2018but how do I get  \u2019 conversation,\u201d said Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. \u201cHamilton\u201d is scheduled to be at the Kennedy Center for 14 weeks in the summer of 2018 on Wednesday, the center started selling tickets for its   season, with the promise that anyone who subscribes that season, and renews next, will be guaranteed tickets. The effort to goad people into subscribing for two years to get tickets to the show prompted criticism in The Washington Post from a blogger, who called it a \u201cquite high entrance fee,\u201d and from a letter writer, who criticized what she called \u201cextortionist prices. \u201d Ms. Rutter said there would be tickets available for purchase to nonsubscribers, but that it only made sense to reach out to try to bolster subscriptions first. \u201cPeople have accused us of gouging, but it\u2019s not gouging  \u2014   if you want to be first in line, the best way to do that is to be a subscriber,\u201d Ms. Rutter said. The strategy is already proving a significant boon to theaters where \u201cHamilton\u201d will be staged  \u2014   some are nonprofits, and some are commercial enterprises, but all depend on subscriptions or memberships as important elements of their budgets. Many arts groups have hard times sustaining subscription bases as consumers gravitate toward more \u00e0 la carte and   planning for their cultural activities. \u201cWe live and breathe by the subscription model,\u201d said Lauren Reid, chief executive of the theater unit at Key Brand Entertainment, which brings shows to 40 stages in North America through its Broadway Across America subsidiary. Ms. Reid said she had never seen as high a level of consumer awareness about a new show as for \u201cHamilton\u201d consequently, she added, every theater expecting \u201cHamilton\u201d is \u201cteasing\u201d it early to promote subscriptions. \u201cThe bottom line is \u2018Hamilton\u2019 is really good for our industry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an event, and it\u2019s a cultural moment, and it\u2019s unusual that we have an opportunity like this to highlight something special. \u201d The tactic is working. In Chicago, the first city outside New York where \u201cHamilton\u201d will be seen (starting on Sept. 27) Broadway in Chicago has sold out its fall subscription package for the first time, according to Lou Raizin, the organization\u2019s president. The company has not yet started selling tickets to nonsubscribers  \u2014   and there will be many such tickets available, because the show plans to stay in Chicago as long as sales are healthy. But, Mr. Raizin said: \u201cWe believe there will be very strong demand. You\u2019d have to be hiding under a rock not to have that opinion. \u201d In San Francisco, where \u201cHamilton\u201d is expected to run at the SHN Orpheum Theater for 21 weeks, starting next March, SHN, which operates two locations in the city, expects to have 40, 000 members enroll for its   season, up from the usual 20, 000 to 23, 000. \u201c\u2018Hamilton\u2019 has been an incredible driver for membership sales,\u201d said Greg Holland, SHN\u2019s chief executive. Also noteworthy, Mr. Holland said, was that 80 percent of the new membership buyers were   visitors to the company\u2019s website. In Iowa, Des Moines Performing Arts has said that \u201cHamilton\u201d will come for an unspecified length of time at unspecified dates during the   season, but that has been enough to cause a spike in subscriptions to the coming season. \u201cWe\u2019ve more than doubled the number of new season tickets purchased compared to a year ago, and our renewal rate is shooting up to the levels we always aspire to,\u201d said Jeff Chelesvig, the center\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cOur goal is 11, 000 subscribers, and I have no doubt we\u2019ll plow through that. \u201d The lead producer of \u201cHamilton,\u201d Jeffrey Seller, said he was aware that theaters were using the promise of a future production of the show to market   subscriptions. \u201cI\u2019m O. K. with it  \u2014   it\u2019s good for the theater in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t want anyone to say is that if you don\u2019t buy a subscription, you won\u2019t be able to get a ticket, because there will be single tickets. They won\u2019t sell out through subscriptions. \u201d The Broadway production of \u201cHamilton,\u201d which has been essentially sold out since it opened last August, is expected to continue to run for years. The show is planning to visit other cities through two additional productions: the one that will open in Chicago this fall and stay there indefinitely, and the one that will begin in San Francisco next March and then tour. Thus far, tour stops, often without specific dates or duration, have been announced for Atlanta Boston Costa Mesa, Calif. Des Moines Houston Las Vegas Los Angeles Portland, Ore. Seattle Tempe, Ariz. and Washington. \u201cHamilton\u201d is also planning a fourth production, in London, but that has not yet been officially announced.'"}, "time": 1742561769.8086753}
