Thanks to the incredibly fast processing power of computers in this day and age, early votes were counted in record time giving the soon-to-be-President an entire extra day to get ready for his imminent Presidency. The irony of an election called so early, and what Trump would have said had it been called in Hillary\u2019s favor about it being \u201crigged\u201d is not lost on many Americans. Local pig farmer and regional pie eating champion Kenneth Bacon said of the results, \u201cNow how about that. I was gonna go vote for Hillary tomorrow, but I suppose if it\u2019s a lost cause I\u2019ll just farm some extra pigs. I know when I\u2019m beat and I see no reason to pretend it ain\u2019t how it is!\u201d Many analysts are perplexed by the incredibly early voter turnout in favor of Trump, citing that poll numbers just don\u2019t seem to match up. \u201cI guess Trump supporters are just a close-lipped bunch that keep their opinions to themselves,\u201d said Nate Silver, an American economist and well-respected predictor of both baseball and American elections. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t have seen this coming. \\nTo be honest with you, I\u2019ve lost a lot of money and am going to have quite a bit of egg on my face when I get into the office tomorrow.\u201d \\nEven if every person that hasn\u2019t voted yet in the country rushed out and voted right this minute, Hillary could still not possibly win, meaning those of us that haven\u2019t voted can just sit back and relax. Especially Trump supporters. \\nWhen reached for comment about the victory, Trump had few words, saying only, \u201cNow that I\u2019ve won I\u2019m not going to just sit back and rest on my laurels. I\u2019m going to get out there and start doing my damnedest to make America great again, just like I promised.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742561794.3527663}
