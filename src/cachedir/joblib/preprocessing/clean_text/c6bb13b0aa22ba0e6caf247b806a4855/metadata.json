Trump. They admitted that they could not complain too much: Only two of them had voted. But there were no regrets. \u201cI don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d Mr. Fleming said, trimming a mustache. \u201cMilwaukee is tired. Both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway. \u201d As Democrats pick through the wreckage of the campaign, one lesson is clear: The election was notable as much for the people who did not show up, as for those who did. Nationally, about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots. Wisconsin, a state that Hillary Clinton had assumed she would win, historically boasts one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of voter participation this year\u2019s 68. 3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states. But by local standards, it was a disappointment, the lowest turnout in 16 years. And those   were important. Mr. Trump won the state by just 27, 000 voters. Milwaukee\u2019s   neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures. Of the city\u2019s 15 council districts, the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas  \u2014   accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide. The biggest drop was here in District 15, a stretch of fading wooden homes, sandwich shops and   restaurants that is 84 percent black. In this district, voter turnout declined by 19. 5 percent from 2012 figures, according to Neil Albrecht, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission. It is home to some of Milwaukee\u2019s poorest residents and, according to a 2016 documentary, \u201cMilwaukee 53206,\u201d has one of the nation\u2019s highest   incarceration rates. At Upper Cutz, a bustling barbershop in a   wooden house, talk of politics inevitably comes back to one man: Barack Obama. Mr. Obama\u2019s elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced. But their lives have not gotten appreciably better, and sourness has set in. \u201cWe went to the beach,\u201d said Maanaan Sabir, 38, owner of the Juice Kitchen, a brightly painted shop a few blocks down West North Avenue, using a metaphor to describe the emotion after Mr. Obama\u2019s election. \u201cAnd then eight years happened. \u201d All four barbers had voted for Mr. Obama. But only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time. And even then, it was a sort of protest. One wrote in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The other wrote in himself. \u201cI\u2019m so numb,\u201d said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. \u201cIt\u2019s like I should have known this would happen. We\u2019re worse off than before. \u201d But Mr. Obama did do something important: \u201cHe did give black people something to aspire to. That\u2019s a lot. I\u2019m happy my son was able to see a black president. \u201d Mr. Fleming, 47, who has been trimming hair, beards and mustaches for 30 years, had hoped his small business would get easier to run. But it hasn\u2019t. \u201cGive us loans, or a 401( k),\u201d he said, trimming the mustache of Steve Stricklin, a firefighter from the neighborhood. His biggest issue was health insurance. Mr. Fleming lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford. He finally found one, which starts Monday but costs too much at $300 a month. \u201cAin\u2019t none of this been working,\u201d he said. He did not vote. Mr. Albrecht, of the election commission, said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout. This was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo ID card, and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence. This was particularly onerous for the poor, who move often. Mr. Albrecht said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote. \u201cTo me that\u2019s very significant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes away from the fairness and integrity of the election. \u201d Although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo ID law discriminated against   who disproportionately lack the approved IDs, the law was applied on Election Day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who backed the laws, has said they have no impact on voter participation, and Mr. Albrecht allowed that their effect on Milwaukee\u2019s turnout would not have erased Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the state. Perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in Milwaukee, as in the rest of the country, were the candidates themselves. To some, it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver. \u201cI felt cornered,\u201d said Ian Pfeiffer, 25, who works the grill at Jake\u2019s Delicatessen and says he did not vote. \u201cWe were stuck between Trump and Hillary. They really left us with no choice. \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer\u2019s grandmother, an avid supporter of Mrs. Clinton, spent months trying to convince him to vote for her. But he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the Clinton Foundation. (Mr. Pfeiffer\u2019s grandfather pushed him toward Mr. Trump, but he found him even less appealing.) He thought Oprah Winfrey would be a good candidate. \u201cHey, would you vote for Oprah Winfrey?\u201d he said in a loud voice to a line of customers. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d vote for her,\u201d said Erin Miles, 41, a financial services worker waiting for her sandwich. \u201cShe has a level head and   skills. \u201d Few of the men and women interviewed on West North Street last week had voted for Mr. Trump, though many said they admired him. (He spoke his mind. He was rich.) \u201cIf I would have voted, I would have voted for him,\u201d said Andre Frierson, 40, a security guard working the evening shift at Jake\u2019s. \u201cFrom a business perspective, I loved him. \u201d As for Mrs. Clinton, \u201cother countries probably wouldn\u2019t have respected us because we had a woman running the country,\u201d he said. One exception was Justin Babar, who said he voted for Mr. Trump as a protest against Mrs. Clinton. He blamed her husband\u2019s policies for putting him in prison for 20 years. As for the claims of racism that have dogged Mr. Trump, Mr. Babar wasn\u2019t so worried. \u201cIt\u2019s better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our kids,\u201d he said. Tarvus Hawthorne, 45, a program coordinator at a local nonprofit, agreed. \u201cHe was real, unlike a lot of liberal Democrats who are just as racist\u201d but keep it hidden, he said, his jaw slathered with shaving cream. \u201cYou can reason with them all day long, but they think they know it all. They want to have control. That they know what\u2019s best for \u2018those people. \u2019\u201d Still, he voted for Mrs. Clinton, as did many others here. Upper Cutz gets busier as the day wears on. Children come in after school. Danielle Rogers, Mr. Toney\u2019s sister, stopped by the barbershop for a visit. Everybody agreed they would miss Mr. Obama. Ms. Rogers said Mr. Obama had aged a lot. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a bunch of bad kids,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably saying: \u2018I\u2019m done. Take them back to their mama\u2019s house. \u2019\u201d Mr. Fleming was trying to imagine Mr. Trump as president. \u201cThe White House is going to be the penthouse!\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Trump would be like Al Pacino in \u201cScarface,\u201d with parties in the mansion and exotic animals roaming around the grounds. \u201cIf he comes home and finds his wife cheating on him, he could just say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to war! \u2019\u201d They were laughing. But they were also worried. \u201cHe\u2019s going to mess with us on some racist level,\u201d said Otis Jackson, 45, a barber who did not vote. \u201cHe\u2019s already appointed a known racist,\u201d he said, referring to Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist and the former head of Breitbart News, which has been denounced as a white nationalist hate site. With so many people sitting in his chair over the years, Mr. Fleming has developed a keen sense of where society is headed. But now he is stumped. \u201cThis was a weird election,\u201d he said, holding a set of clippers and looking pensive. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds. There are less cars out there. No one wants to come out. No one knows what comes next. \u201d He added, \u201cHell, Trump doesn\u2019t even know. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563787.2513745}
