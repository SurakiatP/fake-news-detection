Haley, said in answer to a question after a United Nations Security Council meeting devoted to the   conflict. \u201cBut we are thinking out of the box as well, which is  \u2014   what does it take to bring these two sides to the table, what do we need to have them agree on?\u201d she said. She said nothing about what that approach would be, nor did she go any further in revealing a coherent picture of United States policy on the conflict, one of the most intractable in the world. The day before, Mr. Trump hinted at a new regional effort aimed at bringing the two sides together, but he said he would not insist on the creation of a Palestinian state. \u201cI\u2019m looking at   and \u201d he said. \u201cI like the one that both parties like. \u201d Both Ms. Haley\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were in sharp contrast with warnings from other diplomats, including the United Nations envoy entrusted to help the two sides find a path out of their long, bitter conflict. \u201cThe   solution remains the only way to achieve the legitimate national aspirations of both peoples,\u201d the envoy, Nickolay E. Mladenov, told the Security Council earlier in the day. \u201cIsrael can take the necessary step to stop settlement expansion and construction in order to preserve this prospect, while the Palestinian leadership can demonstrate their commitment to tackling the challenges of violence and incitement on their side,\u201d Mr. Mladenov said. Speaking in Egypt the day before, Mr. Mladenov\u2019s boss, the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said, \u201cThere is no Plan B to the situation between Palestinians and Israelis but a   solution. \u201d The Swedish ambassador, Olof Skoog, told reporters on his way into the Security Council meeting on Thursday, \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to move away from the   solution idea, especially before you have something viable as an alternative. \u201d France\u2019s ambassador, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, said the risks were too high. \u201cShould the prospect of a   solution disappear as a mirage in the desert, then that would be an open door to more extremism and more terrorism,\u201d he said. Ms. Haley, who has been on the job for less than a month, used her remarks to the news media mostly to harshly criticize the United Nations as a whole for what she called its \u201c  bias. \u201d Palestinians have accused the Trump administration of the opposite. The United States objected last Friday to the appointment of a former Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, as the secretary general\u2019s envoy to Libya. The Palestinian ambassador, Riyad Mansour, said on Thursday that Mr. Fayyad had been rejected \u201csimply because he was a Palestinian. \u201d Ms. Haley also suggested that it was unnecessary and counterproductive for the United Nations Security Council to hold monthly meetings on the   conflict  \u2014   or in her words, \u201cobsess over Israel. \u201d In fact, the Council has three meetings on Syria every month, one on Yemen as well as regular briefings on every United Nations mission, from Afghanistan to South Sudan, plus briefings on the impact of Security Council sanctions on countries such as North Korea and Iran.'"}, "time": 1742561732.856008}
