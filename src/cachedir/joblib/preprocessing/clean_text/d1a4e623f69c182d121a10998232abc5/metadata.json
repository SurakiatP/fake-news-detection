Trump claims he used no undocumented workers \u2013 and as we saw earlier , oh yeah, Hillary Clinton sleeps three days at a time. \\nTrump\u2019s decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows, not just in the Clinton camp. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt told MSNBC, \\n\u201cHe is not doing any of the normal activities that you\u2019d be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody who\u2019s competitive. You don\u2019t take a time-out to tend to your business interests.\u201d \\nAs Libby Nelson wrote at Vox , \u201cClinton is making her closing argument. Trump is making infomercials.\u201d \\nAll this seems to have stung the thin-skinned Trump, who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in Scotland. As CBS News\u2019 Sopan Deb tweets , Trump\u2019s defense was a little odd, to say the least: Trump's riff on his hotel is worth your time to read. Denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says Clinton sleeps for 3 days at a time pic.twitter.com/Rlsbebzk2Y \\n\u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 27, 2016 \\nThe Republican nominee protested to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash , \u201cFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop, and then she goes home and sleeps.\u201d It is literally impossible for Trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else. \\nTrump\u2019s defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism: he \u201cworks all the time\u201d while Clinton sleeps \u201cfor three days.\u201d He says he took \u201can hour off\u201d (it was a bit more than that) to open his new hotel while \u201cshe wants to sleep all the time.\u201d \\nHe says Clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days. In fact, Clinton made two \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d stops in Florida yesterday; she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in North Carolina and has two appearances scheduled in Iowa for the day after. \\nAnd Trump\u2019s heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing, considering his track record in that regard. \\nIt is a fact, as Hillary Clinton said yesterday, that Donald Trump \u201conce again\u201d used undocumented labor to build a hotel. He used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower . And The Washington Post reports that \u201cTrump\u2019s new downtown D.C. hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included Hispanic construction workers, including some workers who say they are undocumented .\u201d Said one worker in 2015, \u201cThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally.\u201d \\nThe old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind, in reading Trump\u2019s denial. This is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves, this remains true. \\nNonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection, and it won\u2019t work. Trump already has his clothing lines made in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of American jobs. \\nTrump is a hypocrite, and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him, and certainly no recommendation for the office of president.\""}, "time": 1742562676.0892644}
