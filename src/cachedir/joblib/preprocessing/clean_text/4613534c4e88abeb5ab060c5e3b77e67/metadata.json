The move comes as part of a comprehensive plan to rescind regulations set in the wake of the financial crisis. [The White House will also enact another executive action that will dismantle the Department of Labor\u2019s controversial Fiduciary Rule that critics argue would upend the   advisory business. The Fiduciary Rule requires retirement advisors to act in the best interests of their clients. The new executive order will ask the Labor Department to revise or revoke the Fiduciary Rule.  White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn says that limits consumer choice. Cohn said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, \u201cAmericans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we\u2019re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year. The banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers. \u201d The Trump White House will plan to draft additional orders to revise the rules regarding the Federal Stability Oversight Council, the agency responsible for designating   entities such as insurance firms like MetLife as \u201csystemically important financial institutions,\u201d or SIFIs, adding regulation on the firms. White House Economic Council Director has said previously, \u201cWe don\u2019t think nonbanks should be SIFIs. \u201d President met with business executives, including J. P. Morgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock Inc. CEO Laurence Fink, pledging to dismantle   as well as provide a health care and tax overhaul. Director Cohn contends that the   regulations are so onerous that it has stifled banks\u2019 ability to lend, and consumer\u2019s financial choice has been limited as well. \u201cWe have the best, most highly capitalized banks in the world, and we should use that to our competitive advantage,\u201d he added. \u201cBut on the flip side, we also have the most highly regulated, overburdened banks in the world. \u201d Mr. Cohn also hopes to overhaul   mortgage finance giants   and   which has been placed into conservatorship, under control of the Treasury Department since the financial crisis. The White House will seek a more   direction for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, by replacing current Director Richard Cordray with a new director. The CFPB is largely responsible for regulating mortgage and credit card rules, and Cohn said that change will start at the top, \u201cPersonnel is policy. \u201d Donald Trump has been critical of 2010 financial law, calling   a \u201cdisaster. \u201d He promises, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing a big number on  . \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563260.2996073}
