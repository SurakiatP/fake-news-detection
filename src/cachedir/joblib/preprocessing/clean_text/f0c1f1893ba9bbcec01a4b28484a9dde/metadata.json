Elizabeth Warren\u2019s speech being stopped after she attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and broke the rules in the Senate this week to Breitbart Senior Editor MILO\u2019s    at UC Berkeley last week in an opinion piece citing the Streisand Effect. [\u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to make sure a message gets heard? Try to muzzle it,\u201d declared The Washington Post\u2018s Catherine Rampell on Thursday. \u201cBoth liberals and conservatives are newly rediscovering the political power of this phenomenon, known as the Streisand Effect. The term refers to what happens when an attempt to censor information backfires and instead unintentionally draws more attention to the censorship target. \u201d  \u201cAfter all, suppression of speech not only generates more public interest, as bystanders scramble to learn what all the fuss is about it can also win the speaker sympathy and the moral high ground,\u201d explained Rampell, before comparing Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s attempt to suggest Jeff Sessions was a racist before his confirmation as attorney general to MILO\u2019s Berkeley event, which was violently shut down by   rioters. \u201cThe riots didn\u2019t silence Yiannopoulos, however instead, the resulting coverage megaphoned his ugly message to a much broader audience and will help him sell more books, schedule more lucrative speaking gigs and receive more sympathetic tweets from our sitting president. \u201d Throughout the piece, Rampell failed to go into detail on why Warren, who was stopped from speaking after she broke Senate rules and falsely branded Sessions as a racist, was remotely similar to MILO, who was forced to evacuate UC Berkeley after violent rioters started several fires, smashed up buildings and ATMs, assaulted numerous attendees, and attacked cars passing by. \u201cThere are many compelling arguments for why protecting free speech, including speech you disagree with or even abhor, is important,\u201d concluded Rampell. \u201cBut one underappreciated argument is  . Forcibly silencing and thereby martyring your opponents  \u2014   rather than employing   to expose them as wrong or, better yet, ridiculous  \u2014   may be exactly what they want you to do. \u201d Whereas Warren clearly broke the rules of the Senate by slandering Sessions, and was thus punished and not unfairly silenced, MILO was violently stopped from delivering a speech at a college he was invited to. MILO was also threatened with more violence by   activists should he return to Berkeley to deliver his speech, while Warren, as far as Breitbart News is aware, has not been violently threatened by fellow senators should she return to the Senate.'"}, "time": 1742561652.2151256}
