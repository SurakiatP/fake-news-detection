And it was her striking beauty and \u201csparkling personality,\u201d the French Vogue editor Emmanuelle Alt said, that led her to feature the    on the magazine\u2019s March cover. Ms. Alt wrote in her editor\u2019s letter that transgender people are \u201cthe ultimate of a rejection of conformity\u201d  \u2014   the sort of \u201cicons that Vogue supports and chooses to celebrate. \u201d French Vogue is not the first fashion magazine to feature a transgender model on its cover. Hari Nef appeared on Frische, a   fashion and art magazine, in 2014 Andreja Peji\u0107 was on Marie Claire Spain a year ago and Ms. Sampaio on Elle Brazil last October, to name a few. But the action was groundbreaking for the Vogue empire as well as the French fashion establishment, in part because of the cover line  \u2014   \u201cTransgender beauty: How it\u2019s shaking up the world\u201d  \u2014   below Ms. Sampaio\u2019s face. Ms. Alt wrote that being transgender \u201cis a detail one would prefer not to have to mention,\u201d adding that Ms. Sampaio was not on the cover only for her looks \u201cbut because despite herself she embodies an   arduous struggle to be recognized and not be perceived as something Other, a gender exile. \u201d French Vogue\u2019s editorial choices have long pushed social limits. In the 1970s, it published sexually charged images by Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton, most notably Mr. Newton\u2019s 1979 picture of Gia Carangi, fashion\u2019s first openly lesbian model, wearing an Yves Saint Laurent evening gown and being seduced by an androgynous woman in a Saint Laurent tuxedo. (It is worth noting that Ms. Sampaio greatly resembles Ms. Carangi.) In 2007, Carine Roitfeld, then the French Vogue editor, ran a Bruce   cover of the   blonde Carolyn Murphy horsing around with Andre J. a black, bearded androgynous model who was wearing a   mini trench. Still, the fact that the current issue reached newsstands the same week that President Trump reversed federal policy protecting some rights of transgender students  \u2014   and during a French presidential campaign in which   populism looms  \u2014   made Ms. Alt\u2019s cover statement that much more pointed. Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman and chief executive of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, the parent company of French Vogue, called the cover a brilliant decision. \u201cIt reinforces the power of the Vogue brand as a bold, innovative and highly relevant voice in the worlds of journalism and fashion,\u201d Mr. Newhouse said. \u201cI am not aware of any commercial impact, either positive or negative. My impression is a lot of people liked it. \u201d Olivier Lalanne, the magazine\u2019s deputy editor, said the public response had been \u201cpositive and encouraging\u201d with \u201cno backlash at all for the moment. \u201d Ms. Sampaio concurred. \u201cI\u2019ve only had supercool feedback,\u201d she said last week. On her Instagram feed, @valentts, her following has shot up by several thousand to more than 53, 000, and the Vogue cover image has received laudatory comments such as \u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d \u201cHistory made\u201d and \u201c#finally. \u201d It helps that Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the photographers who shot the cover and its accompanying fashion story, were careful to avoid clich\u00e9s or fetishizing Ms. Sampaio. The magazine published two cover versions: In one, Ms. Sampaio shimmers in a gold lam\u00e9 Saint Laurent evening gown, her   eyes piercing a haunting violet light in the second, a   she is bathed in a flare of fuchsia. For the fashion spread, Ms. Alt dressed Ms. Sampaio in a series of sexy 1970s throwbacks, such as a Louis Vuitton   sheer black gown over a black cutout bodysuit a Balenciaga red poppy print blouse and skintight pants and a pair of slouchy Dolce  Gabbana leopard print sequined pants, her naked torso and modest breasts painted gold. \u201cIt\u2019s not gratuitous,\u201d Mr. Lalanne said. \u201cIt makes sense as a story, therefore it doesn\u2019t shock. \u201d Ms. Sampaio, who grew up in Aquiraz, a fishing town in northern Brazil, said, \u201cI always felt like a girl. \u201d She refused to reveal what her name was before she chose Valentina, or when she transitioned, but did allow that her father, a fisherman, and her mother, a schoolteacher, \u201cwere always supportive and are very proud\u201d of her choice. Her schoolmates accepted her, too, \u201csince they already saw me as a little girl. \u201d She was studying fashion when she was discovered by a makeup artist a few years ago and signed by a modeling agency based in S\u00e3o Paulo. At first, there were a few \u201cincidents,\u201d as she puts it  \u2014   clients who refused to hire her because she was transgender  \u2014   and she considered giving up her new career. But after other transgender models, like Ms. Peji\u0107, Ms. Nef and Lea T, Riccardo Tisci\u2019s muse, moved firmly into the fashion mainstream, Ms. Sampaio found herself working steadily for magazines and on the runways. Last year, L\u2019Or\u00e9al produced a short film about Ms. Sampaio, which it released on International Women\u2019s Day. She is now one of the brand\u2019s ambassadors. It was Mr. Alas and Mr. Piggott who brought Ms. Sampaio to the attention of Ms. Alt and Mr. Lalanne. \u201cThey found her beautiful,\u201d Mr. Lalanne said. \u201cAnd we agreed. \u201d Ms. Sampaio traveled to London for the shoot in December and had no idea it included the cover until she was on the set. \u201cFor Vogue to shine a light on someone who changed her sex when it is such a hotly debated topic projects a calming image of tolerance,\u201d Mr. Lalanne said. \u201cFashion is freer than other domains in the arts. It opens doors, and we are able to highlight people who are social antagonists. So we have. \u201d As for Ms. Alt, she said she longed for the day when a transgender person \u201cposes on the front cover of a fashion magazine and it is no longer necessary to write an editorial on the subject. \u201d Only then, she said, \u201cwill we know that the battle is won. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561650.7331219}
