Not all have worked. But of all those failed exhortations, none  \u2014   at least, none known so far  \u2014   have occurred on a JetBlue Airways flight, ending with Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s removal from the plane. Mr. D\u2019Amato, 79, who represented New York as a Republican from 1981 to 1999, was removed from a JetBlue flight in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. after causing a conflict, according to the airline. The episode, captured in part on cellphone videos taken by passengers, was on a New   airplane at Fort   International Airport on Monday, days after a gunman killed five people there. The JetBlue flight, which had been scheduled to depart around 1:40 p. m. Monday, did not take off until about 8 p. m. after delays. During the delay, Mr. D\u2019Amato stood in the aisle and urged other passengers to walk out with him, according to video of the episode. \u201cWe can still speak in this country,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato said in the video. \u201cI am making an appeal to all you people. Stand up for what\u2019s right and walk out with me. \u201d At least one unidentified passenger stood to join him. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he said. It is not exactly clear what prompted Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s response. The crew was trying to move passengers to address a weight imbalance, an airline spokesman said. A passenger, Jeffrey A. Wurst, said that the plane\u2019s captain explained that about 10 people needed to move to the back of the plane from the front to balance how the cargo had been loaded. \u201cI saw Al D\u2019Amato go to the back, to one of the last rows,\u201d Mr. Wurst said. \u201cPeople spotted him and asked to take pictures. The captain then asked for more people to move. D\u2019Amato gets up and starts\u201d shouting, he said. Eventually, the police were called. An officer from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office can be seen walking toward Mr. D\u2019Amato in the video. Mr. D\u2019Amato seems to refer to the issue with the seats, speaking during an announcement that the plane would take off once everyone was seated. \u201cI\u2019m getting thrown out because I stood up and said to the captain, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do what you\u2019re supposed to do? \u2019\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato says in the video. \u201cIf you\u2019re supposed to move two or three people, move them. And so he got annoyed at that, and I\u2019m getting thrown out. \u201d As he walks by the open cockpit door, Mr. D\u2019Amato can be seen telling the captain that he is a \u201cpoor excuse\u201d for a leader. He turns to a flight attendant and appears to curse. JetBlue said that decisions to remove passengers from flights were not made lightly. \u201cIf a customer is causing a conflict on the aircraft, it is standard procedure to ask the customer to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs a risk of escalation in flight,\u201d the company said in a statement. Gary Lewi, a spokesman for Mr. D\u2019Amato, said that the former senator was in Florida to visit an ailing friend. Mr. Lewi cited Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s frustration over the long delay and \u201csleep deprivation\u201d as factors in the incident. \u201cAnyone who knows Senator D\u2019Amato knows he speaks his mind,\u201d Mr. Lewi said in a statement. \u201cJetBlue has apologized to the senator for overreacting, and the senator apologized for speaking his mind at a time when he clearly had left his patience at the gate. \u201d The sheriff\u2019s office said it had referred the matter to JetBlue. The airline said no further action would be taken. The intensity of emotions raised by travel and the ubiquity of social media have combined to produce a perpetual stream of caustic episodes that spin into viral news after being captured on cellphone cameras. This year, tempers flared in the wake of an emotional presidential election. A video of a supporter of the   Donald J. Trump, taunting other passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa. spread widely in November. The airline eventually barred the passenger for life. Weeks later, a man was kicked off a JetBlue flight about to depart from Kennedy International Airport after causing a disturbance upon learning Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were on the flight. His husband posted about it on Twitter. Mr. Wurst said that what concerned him most about the D\u2019Amato episode was the lack of civility. \u201cWhat I find disappointing in the situation is that we were one terminal away from where a tragedy erupted on Friday,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564309.0839365}
