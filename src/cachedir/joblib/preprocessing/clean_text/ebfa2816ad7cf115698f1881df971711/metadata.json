The joy of breaking a   fast with the first bite of a sweet date. The horror of hearing about the attack on a gay nightclub in Florida that left 49 dead. The drudgery of reviewing a year\u2019s worth of earth sciences and trigonometry notes. The frustration of defending Islam  \u2014   and the right to be in this country  \u2014   after another terrorist attack carried out in the name of the Islamic State. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Muhammad, a    junior at Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island, Brooklyn, who immigrated from Pakistan with his family in 2014. \u201cIslam is all about peace. In Ramadan, we don\u2019t even curse. You\u2019re not supposed to do anything bad. \u201d Ramadan is usually Muhammad\u2019s favorite time. This year, though, the holiday, which encompasses a month of fasting from dawn to dusk, has not offered its usual refuge. Already, Ramadan coincided with the Regents, the series of state tests that most high school students in New York take. Then on Sunday, a Muslim man born in New York, Omar Mateen, called 911 to proclaim his allegiance to ISIS and opened fire in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Within a day, Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was renewing his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. And the day after that, another student in Muhammad\u2019s English class started echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s call. \u201cHe was talking a lot of bad things, with no proof,\u201d Muhammad said of the classmate. Muhammad replied that there were differences between Muslims like Muhammad Ali and those like Omar Mateen. \u201cIf you can tell the difference between white people and K. K. K. you can at least differentiate between Muslims and ISIS,\u201d Muhammad recalled arguing in class. How did that student respond? \u201cHe said, \u2018Because Donald Trump said so,\u2019\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cEverybody in the class was laughing. \u201d Salwa Mozzeb, 15, who is finishing her freshman year at Millennium Brooklyn High School in Park Slope soundly dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal. \u201cThat\u2019s messed up,\u201d she said on Tuesday, wearing a hijab and speaking in a brassy Brooklyn accent. A naturalized United States citizen, she came with her mother from Syria when she was 9 months old. \u201cI was raised here,\u201d she said. \u201cAmerica is my home. \u201d Salwa lives in a Bay Ridge apartment with her parents, grandmother and four younger siblings she has uncles and cousins who live in the same building and on the same block. She volunteers at the Arab American Association of New York, whose headquarters are in Bay Ridge. Her mother, who is from Syria, has a brother who escaped the civil war there and made his way to Sweden. Another relative has been waiting 10 years for a visa to enter the United States. Once populated largely by Scandinavian immigrants, as well as those of Italian and Irish heritage, Bay Ridge has been transformed like so much of New York. There are nine mosques in the area now, according to Tony Carnes, a sociologist who publishes an online journal, \u201cA Journey Through N. Y. C. Religions. \u201d Many of the store signs on the avenues are written in Arabic. After the killings in Orlando, Salwa\u2019s father, Abdulnoor Mozzeb, 39, a naturalized American citizen originally from Yemen, warned his daughter to be especially careful on the subway, and to sit near the conductor. The idea annoyed her. \u201cI\u2019m just like any other    here,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to hang out and chill. I don\u2019t want to stress about feeling like I\u2019m different because I\u2019m Muslim. \u201d Mr. Mozzeb approved of her convictions. \u201cShe\u2019s strong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to your identity, somebody is going to disrespect you, you got to stand up. \u201d Salwa\u2019s mother, Manar Al Ahamar, said that in April, outside a pharmacy in Bay Ridge, an older woman had confronted her, telling her to go back to her country and cursing her in front of her    son, Ahmed. Ms. Al Ahamar, 32, said she had just walked away, but had gotten so upset later that her blood pressure soared and she began to have severe chest pains. Salwa had helped her mother into in an ambulance. It was not until Wednesday that her mother revealed what had caused the emergency. Salwa did not understand how a woman could verbally attack her mother, especially in what she considers her own neighborhood. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to be surrounded by Muslims,\u201d Salwa said, \u201cwhy is she in this community? \u2019\u201d As for Muhammad, he spends his days in two Brooklyn neighborhoods dotted with mosques. He and his family live in Brighton Beach, and he volunteers at the Council of Peoples Organization, a group in Midwood that serves Muslims, Arabs and South Asians. In Brighton Beach, he and his older brother, Hassan, often attend a Turkish mosque up the block from their house, or one of three smaller mosques in the area. Though from the outside, Ramadan might seem to be a hardship  \u2014   rising before dawn to eat, then going back to sleep before getting up again for school  \u2014   Muhammad and his friends say it is more like a sweet respite. \u201cWe get to fast, we get to stay close to Allah, we pray five times a day,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cAnd after, when we pray at night, we go out with our friends and stay out till 1. \u201d Muhammad described the communal outdoor prayers in his hometown, Karachi, and how, with the streets closed, he and his friends would play cricket late into the night. He said he missed the Ramadan of his childhood, but understood why his family moved to the United States. \u201cMy parents wanted us to have a good education,\u201d he said. He and Hassan, 21, who attends the Borough of Manhattan Community College, are permanent residents. Salwa\u2019s parents want the same for their children. \u201cIf you have education, you are a different person,\u201d said Salwa\u2019s father, who works as a doorman at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The family lives half a block from their mosque at the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, decorated on the outside this month with strings of colored lights. At 10 p. m. every night, Salwa and her friends go through the women\u2019s entrance and, bypassing the hot, crowded third floor, climb to the roof. They stay there in the soft breeze as the last embers of sunset fade and the lights of the   Bridge twinkle in the background. Like most high school girls, they check their phones, compliment one another on their outfits and discuss their exam schedules, while younger children turn cartwheels nearby. When the prayers begin, the girls go into the stairwell so they can hear through the speakers, kneeling on the cold linoleum to be closer, spiritually, to Allah. Muhammad and his family usually pray at home before going to the mosque for evening prayers. Then, often until early morning, he and Hassan engage in philosophical debates in the room they share, discussions about American values versus their Pakistani upbringing. \u201cUsually,\u201d Muhammad said, \u201cit\u2019s about sneakers. \u201d He wants to add to his Air Jordan collection, even at $250 a pair. His brother counters: \u201cYou can feed four to five homeless people with that. \u201d Because of Ramadan, the brothers were awake before dawn on Sunday when the first reports of the massacre in Orlando began to appear on their phones. \u201cI was literally praying, \u2018Don\u2019t be a Muslim,\u2019\u201d Hassan said. Just the week before, the brothers had watched as America mourned one of its most famous Muslims, Muhammad Ali. They were proud. Now, they are hurt and angry. \u201cIt takes people like Muhammad Ali to do good things for Islam,\u201d Muhammad said, \u201cand then it takes seconds for people like Omar Mateen to destroy everything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628476.7825937}
