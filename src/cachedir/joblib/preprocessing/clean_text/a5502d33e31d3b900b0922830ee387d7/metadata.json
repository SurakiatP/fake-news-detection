Dyer reports that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace. On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year, according to the Associated Press . \\nThe AP reported: \\nBefore taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. \\nMoreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. \\nIn some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark \u201csecond-lowest cost silver plan\u201d will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. \\nBut HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. \\nLarry Levitt, who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the increases: \u201cConsumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period.\u201d \\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, said in a statement on Monday: \u201cThis shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.\u201d Miller added, \u201cWhile (Hillary) Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation\u2019s failing health care system is complete and total reform.\u201d \\nReports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time; however, HHS\u2019s confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1 \u2014 one week before the election \u2014 is likely to cause major headaches for many people. \\nThis debacle is not unexpected either \u2014 it\u2019s exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen. \\nObamacare was never the end goal. Rather, it was a stepping stone toward single-payer, government-run healthcare. That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president \u2014 his legacy is at stake. \\nObama\u2019s legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to. Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed, but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected. \\nIf Clinton becomes president, there\u2019s no doubt that her next step will be to move to single-payer healthcare. Obamacare is bad, there\u2019s no doubt about it, but single-payer government healthcare would be even worse.'"}, "time": 1742561938.0300193}
