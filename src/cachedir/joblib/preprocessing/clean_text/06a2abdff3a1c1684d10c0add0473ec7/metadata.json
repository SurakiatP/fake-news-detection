That\u2019s all on the first day. I can\u2019t see any way of getting that done without the use of some pretty powerful magic. \\n\u201cBut appointing the evilest wizard for thousands and thousands of years? That is a bold move.\u201d \\nLord Voldemort, who has been described as a \u2018raging psychopath, devoid of normal human responses to other people\u2019s suffering\u2019 will be in charge of the day-to-day operation of President Trump\u2019s White House, including controlling access to the President, management of staff, and organising Secret Santa for the Christmas party. \\nIt is understood that Lord Voldemort had been seeking a return to public life after his humiliating defeat at the hands of Harry Potter, and came close to replacing Randy Jackson on Season 13 of American Idol, but turned it down for a promised role in Celebrity Masterchef that fell through. \\nRumours that Lord Voldemort was only offered the role after Sauron, Dark Lord of Mordor, turned it down to work with David Davis on Brexit, are so far unconfirmed.
