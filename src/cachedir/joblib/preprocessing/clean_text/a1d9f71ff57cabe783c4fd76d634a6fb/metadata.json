The businessman was identified as Ahmed   41, by the Cleveland chapter of the Council on   Relations. Relatives of a front desk clerk at the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Avon, Ohio, called 911 on Wednesday to report that the clerk had panicked after seeing a man in robes and \u201cfull head dress\u201d in the hotel lobby, speaking on a phone and \u201cpledging his allegiance or something to ISIS. \u201d Officers rushed Mr. Menhali outside the hotel with guns drawn, pinned him to the ground, handcuffed him, searched his clothes and wallet, and took off his shoes to check his feet. Police   video of the encounter shows Mr. Menhali, who appeared to speak limited English, saying: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m tourist,\u201d and \u201cNot good,\u201d while he was on the ground. The Avon Police Department released audio and video of the episode to the news media, and the recordings were uploaded to YouTube. About 10 minutes into the encounter, as the likelihood of any arrest appeared to dissipate and Mr. Menhali was allowed to stand up, he collapsed on the pavement. An ambulance took him to St. John\u2019s Medical Center, the police said local news reports said he had been treated for minor injuries and released. The warning from the Emirates government coincided with heightened security alerts in cities around the world after deadly terrorist attacks in Iraq, Bangladesh and Turkey further raised fears about the global reach of terrorism. The Ohio episode, however, raised questions about the intense police response to a report of a man in Middle Eastern dress standing in a hotel lobby, speaking on a cellphone. The Avon Police Department said in a statement that no weapon was found on Mr. Menhali. The police said after officers interviewed the hotel clerk, they concluded there had been a \u201cclear miscommunication\u201d with her relatives, and that Mr. Menhali had not made \u201cany statements related to ISIS. \u201d The police said the episode was being investigated, and the findings would be forwarded to the prosecutor\u2019s office for review. Julia A. Shearson, the executive director of the Cleveland chapter of the Council on   Relations, said in an interview Sunday: \u201cIt is shocking this happened. The bottom line is we understand the American people are on edge, and there\u2019s definitely violence in the world, but we\u2019ve come to this brute level of giving in to our fears. \u201d Ms. Shearson also told The Independent that the way the police referred to Mr. Menhali\u2019s clothing in their report  \u2014   \u201cas a criminal indicator\u201d  \u2014   was \u201cvery concerning. \u201d In a statement Monday, Marriott International, which owns the Fairfield Inn and Suites, said that it \u201cdeeply regret\u201d what happened to Mr. Menhali. The company said it planned to discuss with the hotel \u201cdiversity and inclusion training designed to help prevent this type of situation. \u201d Avon officials apologized to Mr. Menhali Saturday night at the council\u2019s Cleveland office. The mayor, Bryan K. Jensen, told Mr. Menhali, \u201cThere were some false accusations made against you, and those are regrettable. \u201d The chief of the Avon police, Richard Bosley, said, \u201cYou should not have been put in that situation like you were. \u201d The United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement on Tuesday that he had met with Mr. Jensen and had received his personal apology. In a phone interview on Sunday, Mr. Jensen described the episode as \u201cfrustrating on our end\u201d because \u201cit could\u2019ve been tragic. \u201d \u201cGuns were drawn,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWhen you make a false accusation, you put that person\u2019s life in danger. \u201d Mr. Menhali, he added, \u201cwas 100 percent innocent. \u201d Mr. Jensen said he had no problem issuing the apology because he was reminded of being teased as a child because his father, Niels, who immigrated from Denmark, spoke little English. But his father worked hard, he said  \u2014   just like the 20 to 30 Arabic families who live in Avon, which is about 20 miles west of Cleveland with a population of about 21, 000. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to the Muslim community and the rest of the world to know that we care and it\u2019s not something that we take lightly,\u201d he said. Mr. Menhali, speaking through an interpreter by phone Sunday, said that the apology from city officials was a \u201cgood first step,\u201d but that he still had questions about why something like this could happen. He said he was in Ohio because he was visiting the Cleveland Clinic for a medical procedure. He had been looking for a hotel room because the owner of the apartment where he was staying in Cleveland wanted to rent it out for the Republican National Convention. Mr. Menhali said he had ended up in Avon because hotel rooms in the city area were scarce. At first, when the police approached outside the hotel, he thought it was a training exercise. Then he became afraid, he said. Since the encounter, he said, he has been having bad dreams. The travel warning issued by the Emirates\u2019 Ministry of Foreign Affairs told citizens to avoid wearing the national dress during their travel, especially in public areas, to ensure their safety. On its website, the ministry also told residents to abide by the dress codes of nations they visited, and to take note of the ban on wearing   veils in countries like France and Belgium. The ministry\u2019s messages did not mention the episode in Ohio specifically. But Ibrahim Hooper, a national spokesman for the Council on   Relations, said on Sunday, \u201cAs far as I know, it came out as a result of this incident. \u201d The ministry said on its website that it had summoned Ethan Goldrich, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy, over the \u201cill treatment\u201d of Mr. Menhali. According to the police audio and video, the hotel clerk sent text messages to her sister saying she had seen a \u201csuspicious male\u201d in the lobby with \u201cmultiple disposable phones\u201d and was feeling panicky about it. The sister then called the police. The clerk\u2019s father apparently also phoned the police, saying she was \u201cterrified\u201d and had locked herself in a bathroom. Police videos showed officers arriving at the hotel, drawing and cocking rifles. One officer could be heard saying, \u201cThere he is!\u201d Another officer shouted, \u201cGet on the ground!\u201d A man in a white robe could be seen kneeling on the pavement in front of the hotel. Officers performed a   search and went through his wallet, allowing paper to blow away in the wind. When Mr. Menhali complained about a possibly broken phone, an officer can be heard saying: \u201cYeah? Well you\u2019ve broken my nail. \u201d But an officer searched for and retrieved one of Mr. Menhali\u2019s cellphones, which had been tossed into the bushes. Mayor Jensen said of the police\u2019s treatment of Mr. Menhali, \u201cI think there were things we can probably learn from this. \u201d Asked if there would be repercussions for the false accusations against Mr. Menhali, the mayor said: \u201cSomething will come out of this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be just a warning. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628468.7217052}
