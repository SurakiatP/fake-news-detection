For the eight years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, the media treated conservatives who raised those concerns as racists, or cranks, or both. [Now  \u2014   as predicted  \u2014      are suddenly en vogue. The media pounce on every Tweet  \u2014   every joke  \u2014   as an sign of the imminent, lawless tyranny that President Donald Trump will foist upon us all.  Not so fast. And not without an apology first  \u2014   from all of you, from every single journalist who covered up Obama\u2019s abuses, from every   \u201cgood government\u201d champion who looked the other way, from every pundit that   the IRS scandal or excused Hillary\u2019s email server or said nothing when \u201cstimulus\u201d cash went to Obama\u2019s cronies and political allies. I\u2019m talking about people like Norm Eisen, who left Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) to become Obama\u2019s ethics czar. There, he opened White House visitor logs to the public  \u2014   a new policy that Obama relied upon, for years, to claim that his was the most transparent administration in history. Except, as Andrew Breitbart pointed out, once you found someone\u2019s name on the visitor logs, the White House would not tell you whether they were actually that person, or someone else. Meanwhile, Obama staffers simply took to meeting lobbyists and other dubious characters across the street. Eisen has suddenly surfaced as a talking head on television, blasting the Trump administration\u2019s supposed conflicts of interest. He was in high dudgeon on Thursday morning over Kellyanne Conway\u2019s joke on Fox  Friends  \u2014   \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff\u201d  \u2014   which was a response to controversy over whether Nordstrom pulled Ivanka Trump\u2019s products for political or business reasons. Yet Eisen and his ilk were silent in 2012 when President Obama touted J. P. Morgan bank, where his own money sat. My Breitbart News colleague Peter Schweizer is concerned that President Trump and his staff may have crossed a line in their defense of Ivanka Trump. He is entitled to make that criticism, because he spent the past several years documenting conflicts of interest by members of both parties. In 2011, when Schweizer revealed that 80% of the loans made by President Obama\u2019s Department of Energy went to campaign donors, most of the people complaining today about a Tweet were saying nothing. Eisen told MSNBC on Thursday that President Trump\u2019s defense of Ivanka was the \u201cbehavior of a corrupt mafia family. \u201d He added that Trump\u2019s criticism of the courts was unprecedented: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this in a White House,\u201d he said. Perhaps Eisen was too busy enjoying Prague to notice in 2012 when Obama warned the Supreme Court not to overturn Obamacare. Or maybe he slept through the State of the Union in 2010, when Obama rebuked the Supreme Court for Citizens United. On that occasion, the media had a lot to say  \u2014   not about Obama\u2019s appalling insult to judicial independence, but about Justice Samuel Alito, who shook his head and mouthed the words \u201cnot true\u201d as Obama distorted the opinion of the Court. So supine was the press under Obama that they barely bothered to defend themselves, even when the administration spied on them and lied about trying to prosecute them. When they finally complained, it was about access to Obama\u2019s golf games on vacation. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. And it is no better for a Republican president than a Democratic one to mock the judiciary, to attack the media, or to make public statements for private benefit. But some of us  \u2014   myself included  \u2014   were critical of both Obama and Trump in those areas, long before the mainstream media suddenly discovered their principles. Most have failed to own up to their past negligence  \u2014   or complicity. They owe America an apology before their criticisms can be taken seriously. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
