It was in a gym on Paerdegat Avenue in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. It was a midrange jump shot. His team was down by 1 and won by 1 and, he said, it turned basketball into his duty, not just a game. \u201cIt set me up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts some fuel in it for you where I took basketball more serious, and that\u2019s what I want to do, play basketball. I remember that day going to the park and working on my game, and I kept working and working. \u201d How long did that feeling from his first   last? \u201cI still have it,\u201d Carrington said. The   is the heart of the N. C. A. A. tournament. It\u2019s a hallmark play, and everyone has a favorite. Lorenzo Charles. Tate George. Tyus Edney. Christian Laettner. If the   shot takes down a favorite (Bryce Drew of Valparaiso, 1998) or delivers a championship (Kris Jenkins of Villanova last year) the celebration is a little louder, the memory a little more enduring. For players, though, draining a   is a benchmark, no matter how young they are. And the setting does not have to be the grand stage of the N. C. A. A. tournament. Arkansas guard Daryl Macon was 14, a freshman at Parkview High School in Little Rock, when he hit a   to send a game into triple overtime. He was not a starter, and he did not even play in that third overtime. But he said he leaned on that moment throughout his high school career. \u201cI was just    as a freshman,\u201d Macon said. \u201cI had my doubts whether I was going to be a player or not. I made that shot and I remember thinking: Maybe I have something. Maybe I have what it takes. \u201cThat shot kept me going. Anytime I felt like giving up in high school because I wasn\u2019t getting recruited, I remembered that  . \u201d Macon went to Holmes Community College and grew into a standout    guard, then joined the Razorbacks\u2019 program this season. On Jan. 24, he had his own   moment when he made three free throws with 1. 6 seconds left to deliver a   win at Vanderbilt. \u201cThe floor was shaking under my feet because we were on the road,\u201d Macon said. \u201cI said: \u2018Look at the goal, look at the goal. Find tunnel vision. \u2019\u201d Not all   are the same, of course. Players interviewed here all insisted that the spontaneous dribble and shoot was easier than play stopping and emotions getting a chance to build ahead of   free throws. \u201cIt gives you too much time to think,\u201d Carrington said. But the dogma of the   is pretty simple: Do not think, because that is when pressure replaces instinct. Seton Hall junior Desi Rodriguez had his   moment at age 12, while he was in middle school in the Bronx. He made a layup to give his team a   victory. \u201cI started taking basketball more serious from there,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI felt I was good at it. I felt I was getting better. A moment like that wakes you up a little. That was my only one. \u201d But what of the player who misses the  ? Princeton\u2019s Devin Cannady had an open   that would have lifted the Tigers over Notre Dame in the first round on Thursday. The shot was similar to one he had once made to win a high school game. But this one clanged off the rim and the Irish won,  . \u201cI didn\u2019t think about a March Madness moment,\u201d Cannady told reporters. \u201cIt was a good look. It\u2019s a shot I\u2019ve taken before. But the ball didn\u2019t fall like I wanted it to. \u201d Duke\u2019s Jayson Tatum also remembers a   that didn\u2019t fall, during a playoff game when he was a high school sophomore. His team\u2019s season ended with the miss. \u201cThat was a tough one to miss because you have to wait until the next year,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one game. It doesn\u2019t define your career. You keep shooting. I was just 15. I have a lot of basketball to go. \u201d Sometimes the vanquished have to live with a   for a lot longer than that. It is well known that North Carolina guard Nate Britt lives in the same house in Upper Marlboro, Md. with Villanova\u2019s Jenkins. Britt\u2019s parents are Jenkins\u2019s legal guardians. And it was Jenkins who took down Britt and North Carolina at the buzzer in last year\u2019s national championship game in Houston. When he came home from school last summer, Britt found that his parents had commemorated the moment by putting up pictures of the winning shot near where the family eat their meals. \u201cThere is a picture on the wall of the shot,\u201d Britt said. \u201cI don\u2019t eat at my table anymore, partially because of that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562049.0947285}
