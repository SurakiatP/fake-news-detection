Can you imagine in here   \u2026     we have the outgoing president coming up here today to talk to only Democrats. We have the incoming vice president coming up to talk only to Republicans. Manchin then stated that this is not what \u201cmakes this place work. \u201d Obama met congressional Democrats on Capitol Hill to discuss how to prevent Republicans from repealing Obamacare. Vice   Mike Pence also addressed Obamacare in a meeting on Capitol Hill with Republicans Wednesday, the Washington Times reported. Manchin said that 172, 000 West Virginians gained health care under Obamacare for the first time, but he also said that Obamacare could use a lot of \u201crepairing. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m willing to look at replacing, repairing, doing anything that we can to make it better.
