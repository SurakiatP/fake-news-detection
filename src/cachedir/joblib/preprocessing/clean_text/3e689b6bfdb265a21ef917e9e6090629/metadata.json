The collapse in the price of crude oil was the result of a carefully designed speculative operation. \\nNeocons in Washington want control over Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves, among the world\u2019s largest. With full US support and encouragement, the right wing opposition which controls the National Assembly want Maduros ousted \u2013 its latest tactic by recall referendum as constitutionally permitted. \\nOn October 18, Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court ruled valid signatures of 20% of voters in each of the nation\u2019s 24 states must be collected to proceed with a process against Maduro.\\n\u201c(F)ailure\u2026will render the call for the presidential recall referendum as nullified,\u201d the High Court said in its ruling.\\nOn October 21, Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council (CNE) suspended the referendum until further notice, following Supreme Court allegations of fraud. Over 30% of signatures collected had irregularities \u2013 including listing over 10,000 deceased persons.\\nA previous article explained how Venezuela\u2019s recall referendum works. Article 72 of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution states \u201c(a)ll magistrates and other offices (including the president) filled by popular vote are subject to revocation.\u201d\\n\u201cOnce half (their) term of office\u2026has elapsed, 20% of (registered) voters (by petition may call for) a referendum to revoke such official\u2019s mandate.\u201d\\n\u201cWhen a number of voters equal to or greater than the number of those who elected the official vote in favor of revocation (provided the total is 20% or more of registered voters), the official\u2019s mandate shall be deemed revoked\u2026\u201d\\nSignatures collected must be verified for authenticity before proceeding further with the recall process. If achieved, it\u2019ll be organized within 90 days. Removing Maduro requires support from more than the 50.6% of voters supporting his 2013 election.\\nTiming is important. If held by January 10, 2017, a new election will be called if Maduro loses. If things go against him after this date, Vice President Aristobulo Isturiz will serve as president until January 2019, when his term expires.\\nIn response to CNE\u2019s suspending the recall process, the factions controlling the National Assembly barely stopped short of urging coup d\u2019etat action to remove Maduro forcefully.\\nLast Sunday, they said they\u2019ll impeach him for \u201cviolating democracy.\u201d The body has no legal standing after ignoring the Supreme Court\u2019s October 18 ruling.\\nUnited Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) leader Hector Rodriguez mocked them, saying parties violating the \u201crules of the game come and talk about democracy\u2026There will be no recall referendum in 2016 because of fraudulent signatures collected.\u201d\\nViolent demonstrations may follow, similar to what occurred in 2014 \u2013 perhaps another US coup attempt.\\nOn October 24, WaPo editors disgracefully headlined \u201cHow to derail Venezuela\u2019s new dictatorship.\u201d What followed was a disgraceful litany of misinformation, exaggeration and Big Lies.\\nWaPo: Maduro \u201cmade clear (he and his government are) prepared to shred what remained of the country\u2019s constitutional order\u2026(They) stripped the opposition-controlled national assembly of its powers, imprisoned several top leaders and tried to slow\u201d the recall process.\\nFact: Maduro and Venezuela\u2019s CNE observe the letter of constitutional law. No opposition powers were \u201cstripped.\u201d Their imprisoned officials plotted to remove Maduro by coup d\u2019etat.\\nCollecting fraudulent signatures \u201cslow(ed)\u201d the recall process, not administration officials.\\nWaPo: Opposition National Assembly members \u201cissued a declaration saying Mr. Maduro had staged a coup. That is accurate \u2013 and it ought to provoke a consequential reaction from the United States and Venezuela\u2019s Latin American neighbors.\u201d\\nFact: No Maduro \u201ccoup\u201d occurred, nor is one in prospect. WaPo calling for \u201cconsequential\u201d action sounds ominously like urging Washington to oust him forcefully.\\nWaPo: \u201cThe recall referendum the opposition was pursuing offered a democratic way out of what has become one of the worst political and humanitarian crises in Latin America\u2019s modern history.\u201d\\nFact: US dirty tricks and economic manipulation leading to disruptions in the distribution of food, bear much responsibility for hard times in Venezuela. Real problems exist. Hunger isn\u2019t one of them. WaPo lied claiming \u201c(t)he vast majority of low-income families say they are having trouble obtaining food.\u201d\\nVenezuelans changed their dietary practices because of the scarcity of commonly eaten foods, at times consuming less than earlier. Profiteers hoarding and diverting foodstuffs for resale are responsible, along with high inflation resulting economic manipulation.\\nWaPo: \u201c(T)he United States should be coordinating tough international action.\u201d\\nFact: Neocon WaPo editors want Maduro toppled and replaced. Do they mean by coup d\u2019etat by calling for \u201ctough international action?\u201d\\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago. He can be reached at lendmanstephen@sbcglobal.net .
