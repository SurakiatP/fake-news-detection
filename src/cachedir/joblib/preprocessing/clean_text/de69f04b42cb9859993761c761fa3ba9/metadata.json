The party in power in a given state controls the programming of the voting machines. \\nWhen the establishment asked Trump if he would accept the outcome of the election a whole three weeks before the event, it was like asking a sports coach if he thinks the game was refereed fairly before the game is played. \\nAnd the Democrats are now attempting to cover all bases. They are sueing the RNC over Trump\u2019s election rigging claims, and also suggesting if any evidence of voter fraud does emerge, then it is probably Russia\u2019s fault . \\nDo not believe that voter fraud does not exist. It\u2019s real, the numbers are huge, and it\u2019s undermining true democracy in the United States. We must fight to eradicate it. \\nIf you notice any sign if possible voter fraud or election rigging, call the Trump Ballot Security Project toll free on 1-855-245-4634 or email StopTheSteal@gmail.com.'"}, "time": 1742564371.6877966}
