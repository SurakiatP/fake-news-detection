Maybe he was just half wrong, which makes him half right \u2014   which among politicians makes him a genius,\u201d Gutfeld stated. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t vindicate Trump, but it does not not vindicate him,\u201d he added. \u201cHe may have been wrong specifically but generally speaking, what happened is enough smoke to maybe look like fire. For Trump, that\u2019s a win. It\u2019s funny, even when he\u2019s losing he ends up winning because the nuttiness of his enemies makes him right by comparison. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742561845.1909137}
