Trump\u2019s National Security Council, has decided against taking the position after allegations that she plagiarized key passages in a 2012 book. Ms. Crowley, whose name was briefly floated as a candidate for White House press secretary, has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism in recent weeks, beginning with the discovery by CNN that she copied several passages in a book she published with HarperCollins. A later report in Politico unearthed similar issues in her doctoral dissertation. \u201cAfter much reflection, I have decided to remain in New York to pursue other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming administration,\u201d Ms. Crowley said in a statement to The Washington Times. \u201cI greatly appreciate being asked to be part of   Trump\u2019s team, and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal,\u201d she said. She did not address the allegations of plagiarism. Ms. Crowley is the second official announced by the transition team to decide not to go to the White House, following Jason Miller, who was to be the communications director. One person close to the transition said that Ms. Crowley\u2019s role would have involved overseeing certain speeches, something that would have been difficult after the plagiarism claims. HarperCollins has withdrawn the digital edition of Ms. Crowley\u2019s book \u201cWhat the (Bleep) Just Happened?\u201d Published by Broadside Books, a conservative imprint at HarperCollins, it is a critical look at Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. It sold out 20, 000 copies in hardcover, Publishers Marketplace said. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team had labeled the plagiarism reports \u201ca politically motivated attack\u201d and defended Ms. Crowley\u2019s ability to serve. \u201cMonica\u2019s exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this country around is exactly why she will be serving in the administration,\u201d transition officials said in a statement to CNN. \u201cHarperCollins  \u2014   one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world  \u2014   published her book, which has become a national best seller,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAny attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country. \u201d Most publishers do not check for plagiarism, fabrication or factual inaccuracies.'"}, "time": 1742628344.2995892}
