Then 2017 came along. As Mr. Oliver prepares for the   premiere of \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on Sunday, he returns to an arena where President Trump, the b\u00eate noire of the   shows, has been in charge of the country for nearly a month. During that time, the Trump administration has already made the picture more complicated for many issues that Mr. Oliver has addressed in his   segments, like net neutrality, voter fraud, torture and nuclear weapons. Now, who wants to hear some jokes? In an interview on Monday at HBO\u2019s New York offices, Mr. Oliver, 39, said that despite some clear challenges to his way of looking at the world, he did not believe his past work had been in vain. \u201cI\u2019m not a complete nihilist,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite got to the point where I\u2019m going, \u2018What\u2019s the point in anything? Burn it down. \u2019\u201d Though he was mum on the subject of Sunday\u2019s episode, Mr. Oliver said \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d would continue to resist the impulse to go \u201call Trump, all the time,\u201d and instead try to focus on subjects not addressed by his   peers. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of people feeding on the same carcass,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to pick a different carcass because of how many different beaks have already gotten to it. \u201d The   Mr. Oliver did talk about how his   perspective and   experiences have informed his takes on the presidential election, the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban why you\u2019d have to be a \u201csociopath\u201d to think   comedy programs helped Mr. Trump win and the relationship between his show and what he considers real journalism. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How did you spend your election night? I just watched it at home, but it was the same muscle memory as the Brexit vote, as those early returns came in  \u2014   I think I know what\u2019s going to happen here. You\u2019ve been living in the United States for about a decade. Do news events in Britain still have a visceral impact on you? I hadn\u2019t left much of a career behind in England  \u2014   I pretty quickly had flipped the switch in my head. This is my home. But Brexit was awful because it reminded me of a certain blatant ugliness in the country that I was raised in. I\u2019d just had a baby, so I liked the idea that he\u2019d have a British passport as well  \u2014   which is a European passport, meaning he can live and work anywhere in Europe. From that vote, you realize his horizons have been contracted dramatically, and that becomes a physical manifestation of what is true for a lot of people. I\u2019m very happy that he doesn\u2019t understand anything that\u2019s happened in the last year. You\u2019re a   holder and the husband of a former United States Army medic. Do you fear any personal ramifications from the travel ban, which created widespread complications for immigrants and residents? Practically speaking, I should be O. K. but it\u2019s kind of scary in a way. That pales into insignificance next to the   trauma of other people. My wife\u2019s been in Iraq. She had a translator. So I know IRAP [the International Refugee Assistance Project] very well. They were there the whole time at J. F. K. I know some of the people who have bled for this country and are now not being let in. When I was still on a visa, I remember the third or fourth time I landed back in J. F. K. from England, catching myself thinking, Oh, great to be home. And then realizing, that is a dangerous thought when there is someone behind a glass panel deciding whether this is your home or not. I still have the basic immigrant\u2019s crush on this country. I like the point of America, that it is diverse  \u2014   not a reactionary idea of an America that happened after the fact. When, say, you do a long segment on \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d about the importance of the   fiduciary rule, and then Trump signs an executive order that could put a halt to it, does that frustrate you?  No, but it hurts more. We\u2019ve spent so long looking at those stories, we know how important it is. Even something like the fiduciary rule, which can seem like a luxury issue  \u2014   that, in very meaningful ways, affects people\u2019s lives down the line. Our researchers have been looking at the [hiring freeze on federal workers]  \u2014   there\u2019s a lot of veterans who are going to be adversely affected and they don\u2019t even realize it yet. With some of these E. O. s [executive orders] it\u2019s like a tsunami warning. You\u2019re in real trouble and you don\u2019t yet know because the sea looks calm. Do you accept the argument that   comedians helped Trump win, either by insulating Clinton voters from the possibility she could lose or egging on his supporters to vote for him? That is just a stick to hit someone with, knowing that it\u2019s something that could hurt someone. What\u2019s a thing that you like? I\u2019ll attach something you don\u2019t like to it. \u201cPancakes  \u2014   this is why Trump won. \u201d But I like pancakes! I\u2019m not saying that comedians are not, by their nature,  . But if you, as a comedian, think you got Donald Trump elected, you\u2019re a sociopath. The election and its aftermath have brought attention to the problem of fake news. Do you think shows like \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d contribute to this problem?  The phrase \u201cfake news\u201d has now been used so liberally, it\u2019s meaningless. The problem with aggregation is that the very act of aggregating a piece of information assumes that somewhere along the line, there was a level of  . We are very, very strict about making sure that every piece of information that we pass along, we   independently. I do not, for a second, say that our sourcing is transferable across other political comedy shows. Mr. Trump has vociferously criticized the media  \u2014   news outlets as well as comedy shows like \u201cSaturday Night Live. \u201d Do you fear he might actually try to retaliate against his critics? What he says about journalists is a serious, lasting concern. He has proven these threats are not entirely empty. They\u2019re sometimes promises. But \u201cS. N. L. \u201d is a comedy show. What would he do, get \u201cS. N. L. \u201d taken off the air? \u201cS. N. L. \u201d is something he cares about. We are a meaningless mosquito that he barely hears buzzing by his ear. There is a nonzero chance that he\u2019ll do anything. There\u2019s a nonzero chance you and I are taken to the border this evening and deported as Mexicans. That\u2019s probably not going to happen, but it\u2019s not zero. [laughs] Do you feel as if you were seeing more TV journalists use some of the basic techniques \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d developed, like juxtaposing video clips of an administration official contradicting himself?  What you\u2019re describing just seems like basic   to expose hypocrisy. I always find it pretty dispiriting if ever I see journalists trying to tell a joke. This is not your concern. Pick a lane. You don\u2019t need to do this. Also, almost 100 percent of the time, you\u2019re less funny than you think you are. Although, you could absolutely apply that to most comedians. [Laughs.] In all my working years at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d whenever [a TV journalist] said, \u201cI wish we could do what you guys do\u201d  \u2014   you can. Just don\u2019t tell jokes at the end. Because you can\u2019t, and you shouldn\u2019t. Have you been approached about hosting the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner? Oh, no. God, no. That is just such a noxious concept. I have such contempt for that, as an evening. It would seem really [awful] to go and say, \u201cThis whole thing is a horrendous farce. \u201d I don\u2019t need to go and ruin their unearned evening of celebration. Any of that commentary, I can do on my own show.'"}, "time": 1742628558.6605127}
