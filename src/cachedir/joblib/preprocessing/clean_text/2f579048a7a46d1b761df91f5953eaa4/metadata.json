Speaking at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 15th, he raised a hand as if to take an oath and declared : \u201cI am a victim!\u201d The great business tycoon, the one and only man who could fix America and make the place great again (trust me, folks), was laying claim to martyrdom\u2014and spinning another news cycle. \u201cI am a victim,\u201d he declared, \u201cof one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country. They are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country.\u201d \\n\u201cI am a victim.\u201d That pathetic line echoed in my head, which is why I\u2019m writing this. In my long life, I had seen a large white man stand up in a public arena and proclaim those words\u2014the shrill, self-pitying complaint of the remorseless perpetrator\u2014only once before. That was in a courtroom in lower Manhattan in 1988. The man was Joel Steinberg , a New York lawyer who, over a 12-year period, had brainwashed and beaten into oblivion a woman named Hedda Nussbaum, once a successful young editor of children\u2019s books. In the early years of their relationship, she had run away several times, seeking help, and every time a doctor or friend had called Steinberg to come and get her. At that point\u2014time and again\u2014Steinberg would administer \u201cpunishment,\u201d breaking her bones and her spirit. She took on what police would later describe as \u201ca zombie-like quality.\u201d \\nSome years earlier, a teenage girl had hired Steinberg to arrange an adoptive home for her baby. Instead he kept the child, Lisa, until one evening when she was six years old and \u201cstared\u201d at him in a way he didn\u2019t like. He responded by striking her repeatedly in the head. After which he went out to dinner with his cocaine dealer, leaving the child unconscious on the floor. Nussbaum, by then so traumatized, so absent from anything like life, thought vaguely of calling a doctor, but she was not allowed to use the phone in Steinberg\u2019s absence. Instead, she sat on the floor and watched over the girl as she lay dying. \\nOn trial for the child\u2019s murder, Steinberg blamed everyone but himself. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here,\u201d he whined in court. He swore that he had \u201cnever hit anyone,\u201d not anyone , even though he was known to have assaulted a business associate and three other women before he settled into the single-minded, single-handed demolition of Hedda Nussbaum. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nJudge Harold Rothwax observed that Steinberg was \u201ca man of extraordinary narcissism and self-involvement\u201d who had \u201can extreme need to control everyone in his ambit\u201d while he lived a \u201clife of self-gratification.\u201d Yet Steinberg could not see in himself the man Judge Rothwax described. He thought people should feel sorry for him. He had been disbarred and had lost a child (not to mention his Greenwich Village apartment). He railed at those who had conspired to bring him down: the police, the neighbors, the judge, the prosecutor, the expert medical witnesses, his defense attorney, the jurors, the press, and Hedda Nussbaum. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here,\u201d he claimed. \\nAt the time, nearly 30 years ago, the public blamed Hedda Nussbaum. The district attorney, the police, the doctors and psychiatrists who treated her intensively for more than a year before the trial all agreed that, on the evening in question, she was too physically and mentally \u201cincapacitated\u201d either to cause the girl\u2019s injuries or take action to save her. Nonetheless, she was tried and condemned by the press and public opinion, including women who called themselves \u201cfeminists.\u201d In court, the jurors were merciless. When they began to deliberate, only four thought Steinberg guilty of murder as charged, five were \u201cin the middle,\u201d and three held out for lesser charges, feeling certain that Hedda Nussbaum had somehow been responsible for killing the child. \\nThey finally agreed upon a verdict of manslaughter. Even then, a woman juror assured the press that Nussbaum was \u201ca very sick woman\u201d who should have been charged and convicted of \u201csome crime.\u201d Another juror, also female, expressed popular opinion this way: \u201cI just feel that she was to blame.\u201d And a third woman juror, who claimed that \u201ccertain others\u201d agreed with her, said, \u201cPoor Joel. Joel\u2019s a victim. We have to send a message to the system: \u2018You don\u2019t make victims out of nice men like Joel.\u2019\u201d \\nJudge Rothwax sentenced Steinberg to eight and a half to 25 years. Released after 17 years, Steinberg, now in his seventies, still claims to have done nothing hurtful to anyone. He has not paid a civil court-ordered settlement of $15 million to the birth mother of the dead child, nor has he ever been charged with any crime for what he did to Hedda Nussbaum. \\nTwo lessons lurk in this story, one old and one very up to date. First, it\u2019s a reminder of how much women at that time, even after a great wave of feminism, still blamed women (including themselves) for whatever happened to them at the hands of men; second, a man with a character like Steinberg\u2019s is not the kind of guy you want to choose for high office\u2014or any office at all. \\nJoel Steinberg stalked a far tinier stage than Donald Trump and he did more deadly damage, but the two men seem to be brothers under the skin, sharing common character defects well described in psychiatric texts: extreme narcissism, a taste for sexual predation, and very similar views of the women on whom they prey. Like Steinberg, who was incapable of seeing himself as the judge accurately described him, Trump seems blind to the real nature of his own behavior. (His current wife describes him as a \u201cboy.\u201d) Neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm he\u2019s done, and when their own actions finally call down retribution, branding them as losers\u2014ah, then come the conspiracy theories and the vindictive wail of the victim. \\nMen Who Use Women \\nLast June, I published a piece at TomDispatch venturing to explain why candidate Donald J. Trump was getting \u201crock-bottom ratings\u201d in the polls from women voters. Nearly 70% of them reportedly couldn\u2019t stand the guy. I pointed out what seemed to me to be the obvious: \u201cTrump\u2019s behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628476.4685311}
