Conway told Kornacki Flynn continues to \u201cenjoy the full confidence of the president\u201d despite those allegations. \u201cYes, General Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the president,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd it is a big week for General Flynn. He\u2019s the point of contact for many of these foreign visits. If you look at the schedule, we had the prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau here. Obviously for bilateral meetings. On Wednesday, we\u2019re welcoming Benjamin Netanyahu here. Behind the scenes, where they\u2019re talking about trade, they\u2019re talking about terrorism, security, the fact that Canada and the U. S. are very important, neighbors to each other and will continue to be. And obviously, the national security advisor is a very important point person in those discussions. General Flynn has said he can\u2019t recall. And that he had about 30 phone calls with, I guess leaders at the time. And since then, 70 I\u2019m told, with different leaders, and I\u2019ll just leave his comments at that. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742564458.4936824}
