At one point, a few of the protesters surrounded and yelled at the cafe\u2019s owner, who argued with them while standing outside the cafe. \\n{snip} \\nBlue Cat Cafe opened its doors a year ago on Oct. 17. It replaced the family-run pi\u00f1ata store Jumpolin, which was demolished in February 2015. Jumpolin\u2019s owners said the eight-year-old business had been torn down with no notification, and the demolition sparked protests as people argued that the event symbolized how Austinites and Austin landowners are pushing out minority residents and business owners as the city grows. \\n{snip} \\nOn Friday morning, the owner of Blue Cat Cafe discovered graffiti on the business\u2019 walls that read \u201cyou gentrified scum.\u201d The doors had also been glued shut, temporarily trapping the cafe\u2019s cats inside. \\n{snip} \\nThe cafe\u2019s owner asked the Statesman not to use her name because of multiple death threats that she said she\u2019s gotten from protesters who opposed the demolition of Jumpolin. \\n\u201cThe vandalism and the mental anguish they\u2019ve caused me and the cyber-bullying they do\u2013it\u2019s really out of control,\u201d the owner said. \u201cThey show up with megaphones and they yell profanity; they send me emails with pictures of dead cats and pigs.\u201d \\n[Editor\u2019s Note: There is footage of the protest at the original article link below.]'"}, "time": 1742563318.6158726}
