The Hoosier State delivered an    victory to Donald Trump, who beat Ted Cruz soundly in the state, sweeping up at least 51 delegates. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders won an unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton, though it was not enough to halt her march to the nomination. Shortly after the Republican race was called, Mr. Cruz announced that he was ending his campaign, leaving Gov. John Kasich as the sole rival to Mr. Trump in the G. O. P. contest. That the   had hoped to fall back on Mr. Cruz, perhaps the most reviled politician in his party, was a measure of their panic about the prospect now before them. With Mr. Trump\u2019s success, \u201cI\u2019m watching a    political party commit suicide,\u201d said Henry Olsen, an elections analyst with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Republicans will all but certainly nominate Mr. Trump, who would be the most volatile and least prepared presidential candidate nominated by a major party in modern times. A man once ridiculed by many prominent Republicans will become the G. O. P.  . This is a moment of reckoning for the Republican Party. It\u2019s incumbent on its leadership to account for the failures and betrayals that led to this, and find a better way to address them than the demagogy on offer. Republicans haven\u2019t yet begun to grapple with this. Instead they\u2019re falling into line. Republican leaders have for years failed to think about much of anything beyond winning the next election. Year after year, the party\u2019s candidates promised help for   people who lost their homes, jobs and savings to recession, who lost limbs and   to war, and then did next to nothing. That Mr. Trump was able to enthrall voters by promising simply to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d  \u2014   but offering only xenophobic, isolationist or fantastical ideas  \u2014   is testimony to how thoroughly they reject the politicians who betrayed them. Now, myopic as ever, Republican leaders are talking themselves into supporting Mr. Trump. At a party retreat in Florida last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser Paul Manafort, brought in to make the candidate seem safer to the old guard, assured them that Mr. Trump will better prepare himself for the presidency. \u201cThat was all most of these guys needed to hear,\u201d said an operative in the room. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s trainable. \u201d But within a day, Mr. Trump was back to making vile comments at his rallies. In his confused foreign policy address, he demonstrated nothing but a willful refusal to learn. Some Republicans still seem to hope they can direct voters\u2019 attention past the Trump candidacy. Last week in Washington, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, told a dismayed young Republican at Georgetown University to try not to worry so much about Mr. Trump. \u201cI would just ask you to raise your gaze and look at the horizon that we\u2019re trying to paint,\u201d he said, promoting #ConfidentAmerica, his plan to create a plan. Its mission reads like this: \u201cWe do not like the direction the country is going, and we have an obligation to offer an alternative. That\u2019s why House Republicans are developing a bold,   agenda to take to the country. By giving the people a clear choice in 2016, we can earn a mandate to do big things in 2017 and beyond. \u201d It is the Republicans who are making a clear choice in 2016, one that seemed unimaginable a year ago: To stamp what they still like to call the party of Lincoln with the brand of Donald Trump.'"}, "time": 1742562023.6639102}
