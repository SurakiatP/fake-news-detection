But outside on East 62nd Street stood people, some in tears, who had never met the man who survived the Holocaust to become a clarion voice for those victims who did not. \u201cHe was someone who protected us he interceded against our worst instincts,\u201d Sarah Bardin, 44, a preschool teacher who had come to pay her respects, said as she cried. She knew Mr. Wiesel, who died on Saturday at 87, only through his prolific writing. His works, including the memoir \u201cNight,\u201d gave voice to the Jews murdered during World War II and demanded they never be forgotten. Without him, Ms. Bardin said, the world felt like a more vulnerable place. Inside the Orthodox Fifth Avenue Synagogue, about 100 people attended a ceremony that not only reflected Mr. Wiesel as a man of extraordinary scholarship and influence who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his life\u2019s work, but also remembered him as a friend, a mentor, a husband, a father, a grandfather. In a wheelchair, his widow, Marion, listened as Mr. Wiesel was eulogized by his son Elisha, a partner at Goldman Sachs. He spoke of what it was like growing up with a man of such stature but who still had time for unconditional love. A young grandson, Elijah, spoke of sharing simple moments with a man who was a moral titan to many. Elijah recalled the fun of making English muffins together, smothered in blueberry jam. Mr. Wiesel was liberated from the Buchenwald camp as a    with the numbers   tattooed on his arm. At his funeral he was remembered for a legacy little known by those outside his immediate circle: He loved to laugh, Ted Koppel, the television news anchor said in a eulogy. He spoke of how funny Mr. Wiesel was, and of their   friendship that was spent finding ways to make each other laugh. \u201cIt made clear his love of the Jewish people extended to all mankind,\u201d Menachem Rosensaft, a friend of over 50 years, said of the service. Mr. Rosensaft, a professor of law at Columbia and Cornell, said he had been a teaching assistant for Mr. Wiesel when he taught at City College in New York beginning in the 1970s. In attendance was Sheila Johnson Robbins, a member of the board of the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, the organization he started to promote understanding among ethnic groups in conflict. \u201cHe gave us the sense of responsibility, to follow in his footsteps, and continue his mission  \u2014   to never forget,\u201d she said after the service. \u201cAnd everyone is thinking of him as a thinker, a writer,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was also a man  \u2014   he loved chocolate!\u201d Around noon, the coffin with Mr. Wiesel\u2019s body was wheeled from the synagogue surrounded by a dozen mourners, a simple pine box that is customary in Jewish funerals, a blue velvet cloth draped over it. Later that day, in keeping with the Jewish tradition of burying a person with expediency, he was interred at Sharon Gardens cemetery, in the Westchester County town of Valhalla. \u201cHe was not just a leader for the Jewish people, but for mankind,\u201d Ronald Lauder, the businessman and philanthropist, said after the service. \u201cI would not be who I am without him. What he taught me is that we have to stand up to indifference. He would say, \u2018The opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. \u2019\u201d At the burial in Valhalla on Sunday afternoon, family members and friends shoveled dirt onto the coffin, as is Jewish tradition. Among those at the burial was Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, who began a friendship with Mr. Wiesel over 25 years ago when he invited Mr. Wiesel to speak at Oxford University, where Rabbi Boteach was in residence. \u201cWhat went through my mind the entire time was that the six million of the Holocaust were never granted the dignity of a burial their ashes were merely scattered,\u201d Rabbi Boteach said. \u201cHere we were with the privilege of burying the Holocaust\u2019s greatest witness. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563092.3537807}
