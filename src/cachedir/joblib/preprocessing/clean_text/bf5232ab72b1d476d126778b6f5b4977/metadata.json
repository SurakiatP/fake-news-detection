Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing American society today is that there are 11 illegal immigrants who don\u2019t have legal status. \u201d \u2022 Trump ticked through the names of three Americans who were killed by undocumented immigrants. These are staples of his speeches and familiar to his audiences at this stage of the campaign. He has held them up as examples of an immigration system run amok with tragic consequences. \u2022 Comparing himself to Hillary Clinton, who he maligned throughout the speech, Mr. Trump asked: \u201cWhat do you have to lose? Choose me. \u201d It was an echo of a much mocked question he asked black voters recently. \u2022 \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll be able to deport her. \u201d Mr. Trump wondered provocatively, whether it\u2019s possible to send Mrs. Clinton out of the country. \u2022 A memorable passage from this speech: \u201cOur message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can\u2019t do it. This declaration alone will stop the crisis of illegal crossing. You can\u2019t just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. Those days are over. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Trump invited onto the stage the mothers and fathers of Americans whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants. He asked each to describe their children and how they died. He then kissed many of them on the cheek. It was the most emotional moment of the speech. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote Trump, we won\u2019t have a country,\u201d one of the mother told the audience. Mr. Trump, first reading slowly from a statement and then speaking more freely in response to a question, said he now considered Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto a friend and heaped praise on Americans of Mexican descent.   Mr. Trump said, were \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and \u201cspectacular,   people. \u201d But Mr. Trump said he also told Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto directly that he felt Mexico had benefited disproportionately from its trade agreements with the United States, and that he had described illegal immigration as a problem for both countries. Mr. Trump said the two did not discuss the issue of forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall  \u2014   one of the signature promises of his campaign. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not challenge the idea during the news conference but later posted on Twitter that, during his meeting with Mr. Trump, he had made it clear that Mexico wouldn\u2019t pay for the wall. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto pushed back in the gentlest of terms on several of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims on Nafta, citing U. S. Chamber of Commerce statistics to argue that free trade had been beneficial for both countries and stressing the economic importance of easy movement across the border. Without mentioning specific remarks by Mr. Trump, Mexico\u2019s president said that hurtful comments had been made. \u201cMexican nationals in the United States are honest people, working people,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMexicans deserve everybody\u2019s respect. \u201d But Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto stopped well short of scolding Mr. Trump on the international stage. On the contrary, he expressed optimism that they could work together if Mr. Trump was elected president, \u201ceven though we do not agree on everything. \u201d The showing was something of a surprise, considering the sense of betrayal among many Mexicans, who feel that their president sold them out to the worst possible person. By the start time of 11 a. m. there were dozens of journalist but only a few protesters. A   later, the number of protesters  \u2014   at least those being vocal and carrying   signs  \u2014   seemed stuck at four, including a guy wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, while the number of journalists topped 50. By 12:30 p. m. there were no more than 10 demonstrators, while the journalist pack continued to balloon. Still, the protesters did their best to represent the anger and disappointment that many Mexicans have expressed toward Mr. Trump as well as toward Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is struggling with low approval ratings and a string of scandals. He has spoken out sharply against Mr. Trump in the past, saying in a television interview last month that there was \u201cno way\u201d Mexico would pay for a border wall, and earlier comparing Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to the rise of Hitler. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t represent the Mexican people, he didn\u2019t consult with us,\u201d said the demonstrator in the wrestling mask, who called himself \u201cMaldito Perro\u201d  \u2014   Damned Dog  \u2014   though later said his real name was Diego Garcia. He admitted to being disappointed by the anemic turnout. Social media activity, he lamented, seemed to be replacing the   tradition of the street protest.'"}, "time": 1742563207.319206}
