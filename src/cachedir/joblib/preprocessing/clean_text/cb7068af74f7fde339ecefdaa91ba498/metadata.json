But it\u2019s days like today when we really feel his absence and wonder what could have been. Andrew Breitbart was right about a lot of things. But m n was he right about Anthony Weiner \\n\u2014 Logan Dobson (@LoganDobson) October 28, 2016 \\nWas he ever. \\nAs Twitchy told you , the FBI reportedly decided to reopen their probe into Hillary Clinton in light of emails discovered on one of Anthony Weiner\u2019s devices. Tweeters are having a field day, of course. But it will still never come close to perhaps one of the greatest moments in modern media history: Big ups, AB. pic.twitter.com/qMxopaGBo6 \\nHere\u2019s the whole thing, because it\u2019s just so fantastic: \\nThose were the days, weren\u2019t they? The only sad thing about this Anthony Weiner / HRC insanity\u2026 It makes me sad Andrew Breitbart is not here to enjoy it. #HillarysEmails \\n\u2014 Andrews Dad (@Andrew_Dad) October 28, 2016 \\nIt\u2019s indeed sad that Breitbart is no longer with us. Still, hopefully we can all draw some comfort in remembering his brilliance \u2014 and smiling at the thought of him right now. Andrew Breitbart, still doing his thing from beyond. \ud83d\ude42'"}, "time": 1742628606.8892708}
