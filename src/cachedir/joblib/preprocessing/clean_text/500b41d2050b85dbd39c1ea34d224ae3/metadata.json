Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They fought and protested a war together, argued over Nixon and Kissinger together, laughed at Archie Bunker together. As children, they practiced   drills as adults, they cheered the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the 1990s, they saw one of their own become president, watching him gain glory as one of the most gifted politicians of his time, but also infamy as one of its most    \u2014   a poster child for the Me Generation. They are of course the baby boomers, the collective offspring of the most fertile period in American history. At 75 million strong, they have been the most dominant force in American life for three decades, and one of its most maligned. Enlightened but   introspective but reckless, they are known among the cohorts that followed them  \u2014   and even to some boomers themselves  \u2014   as the generation that failed to live up to its lofty ideals, but still held fast to its sense of superiority. If Bill Clinton was their   id, Hillary Clinton is their superego in a pantsuit. A second Clinton presidency could represent a last hurrah for the baby boomers. But it could also offer a shot at a kind of generational redemption. \u201cThere is a kind of   quality to it,\u201d said Landon Y. Jones, the author of the 1980 book \u201cGreat Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation. \u201d \u201cThis is their last chance to get it right. \u201d A shared history binds the boomers  \u2014   as do, broadly speaking, some shared traits. Their parents suffered through the Depression and World War II before rearing them in the most prosperous society the world had ever seen. Inevitably, perhaps, they were guided by two polestars: responsibility and entitlement. Those dueling impulses powered the rise of both Clintons: one impulse galvanizing supporters who deeply admired their commitment to public service, the other galling critics who saw them as playing by their own rules. \u201cThere\u2019s this tremendous idealism with the Clintons  \u2014   actually living social change, embodying social change,\u201d said Gil Troy, the author of \u201cThe Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s\u201d and a history professor at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cBut also, at the end of day, not just having this will to power, but also being so convinced of their own   that they improvise a new set of morality and ethics. \u201d Like her husband\u2019s, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political odyssey began in earnest when she volunteered for George McGovern\u2019s   1972 presidential bid, one that ended in a lopsided,    takedown of \u201960s idealism at the hands of President Richard M. Nixon and his \u201csilent majority. \u201d It was there, in the trenches, that the Clintons  \u2014   still in their   and not yet married  \u2014   began to assemble the network of trusted friends that continues to surround them. Twenty years later, at 46, Bill Clinton became the   president ever elected. At 69, Hillary Clinton would be the  . In many respects, her journey has become her generation\u2019s journey  \u2014   from protester to parent and now grandparent, from earnest idealist to   realist. They would be bookends on their cohort, one seizing the national stage on behalf of their generation in its prime, the other, who now qualifies for Medicare, vying to lead it into its dotage. Of course, the presidential election has featured not one but two members of the generation born between 1946 and 1964. And just as the Clintons grew out of the campus left, Donald J. Trump traces his political following, if not his own formation, to that generation\u2019s Nixon voters: those who did not protest, or even attend college who preferred Elvis to the Beatles, Sinatra to Santana, the familiar to the foreign, order to upheaval. (Though at this point, what was once the counterculture has become the culture: Mr. Trump has been known to play the Rolling Stones at events.) If Mr. Trump does not fit the profile of the searching, liberal, conflicted boomer, well, blame the liberal boomers whose cultural contributions crystallized that image, most memorably in \u201cThe Big Chill. \u201d (They also created its   foil: Think of Mr. Trump  \u2014       schooled in uniform  \u2014   as the R. O. T. C. commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer in \u201cAnimal House. \u201d) The most enduring boomer icons, however, sprang not from a Hollywood script but from Yale Law School and the Arkansas Statehouse. Standing under the balloons at Madison Square Garden in 1992  \u2014   with Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d blaring  \u2014   the Clintons sent a clear message to their peers: Yesterday\u2019s gone. Our time is now. And also, maybe, now. Not much remains of the      optimism that swept in with the new administration in 1993, and maybe with good reason. The great accomplishments of Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency  \u2014   peace and its anticipated dividends, a surging economy, shrinking budget deficits  \u2014   were washed away. As some boomers sent their kids to college, others sent their sons and daughters off to fight in a seemingly permanent conflict halfway around the globe. If elected, Mrs. Clinton would inherit the Islamic State, an   income gap, partisan gridlock and a populace so polarized and full of loathing that it seems to be segregating. Her husband had it easy by comparison. It\u2019s no fun getting old. Not that Mrs. Clinton is complaining. She has embraced her longevity, beginning a recent rally in Pueblo, Colo. with a callback to her last visit there. \u201cI know there are a lot of really young people here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut was anybody here back in 1992?\u201d Cheers shot up from some of the gathering\u2019s elders. People have been hurrying the Clintons\u2019 generation off the stage for a while: Time magazine declared the \u201cTwilight of the Boomers\u201d in a headline in 2000. Even then, the nation was suffering from boomer fatigue. \u201c  Baby Boomer   to Begin Soon, Experts Say,\u201d The Onion teased, imagining \u201ca glorious new world in which no one will ever again have to endure tales of Joan Baez\u2019s performance at Woodstock. \u201d In 2008, Barack Obama, though born at the tail end of the generation in 1961, consciously styled himself as younger, saying that Americans were tired of \u201cthe psychodrama of the baby boom generation,\u201d that they hungered for \u201ca different kind of politics. \u201d No doubt. And yet in many ways, the 2016 election has served as a rematch between two boomer factions: one candidate promising a   throwback to an idealized postwar America at its most muscular, the other sounding the familiar liberal call to tear down whatever societal barriers still stand. Mrs. Clinton is a long way from the 1969 commencement speaker who told her Wellesley classmates that the challenge for their generation was to \u201cpractice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible. \u201d She is now more likely to warn of the perils of overpromising. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more of that,\u201d she says. But the battles of the \u201960s are never far from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mind. Even a September speech to students at Temple University in Philadelphia featured a reference to her struggles during the Vietnam War. In the fight for the soul of the boomers, Mrs. Clinton holds a slight upper hand: A recent New York   News poll showed her with an edge over Mr. Trump, 48 percent to 42 percent, among likely voters in their generation. The difference was within the poll\u2019s margin of error. As much as they were inspired by Mr. Clinton and exhilarated by Mr. Obama, her peers appear to be turning to her to supply the   voice of reason a fractious country needs. \u201cI think at this point in history, it\u2019s crucial that we have someone who understands the long view,\u201d said the actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who was born in 1958 and has been campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI think we\u2019re a nation in trouble. \u201d They remain a powerful voting bloc. Though millennials are now the most populous living generation, they lack the boomers\u2019 electoral punch. According to the Pew Research Center, fewer than half of eligible millennial voters said they voted in 2012. Turnout among boomers was nearly 70 percent. This is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s demographic sweet spot. Her stump speeches are liberally salted with mentions of her grandchildren her platform includes opposing efforts to cut Social Security benefits and raise the retirement age. And a volunteer army of boomer celebrities, some of whom have known the Clintons since the 1990s, are working on her behalf, including the actress Mary Steenburgen and her husband, Ted Danson. Another is Rob Reiner, who played the lefty student Michael Stivic on \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and says he feels that the bigotry sent up on that sitcom has flared back up with a vengeance. \u201cWe are living in \u2018All in the Family\u2019 right now,\u201d Mr. Reiner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a daily reality show that stars Donald Trump as Archie Bunker. \u201d If those old characters were still around, Archie would probably be blaming Michael for everything from free trade to illegal immigration to the country\u2019s   divorce rate. And Michael would be taking credit for gay marriage, a black president and Bob Dylan\u2019s Nobel Prize. For all the steep challenges that await, if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she will at least have the chance to pursue a new set of progressive causes. To address and amend aspects of her husband\u2019s political legacy. And to reshape America\u2019s image of a generation and the couple that has come to embody it.'"}, "time": 1742563829.645903}
