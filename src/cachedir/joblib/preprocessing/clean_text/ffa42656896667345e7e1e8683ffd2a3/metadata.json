Jeff Sessions ( ) gets during his confirmation hearing for United States Attorney General as   protesters continuously interrupted the hearing. [\u201cIt is somewhat sad to watch someone  \u2014   the folks on the left  \u2014   to try to interrupt the Democratic process,\u201d Spicer stated to reporters on a conference call on Tuesday morning.  Spicer said he was peppered with questions during the campaign process about the type of individuals that support Trump and whether or not he would denounce these certain individuals and that he hopes the media ask Democratic leaders the same about the actions of these protesters. \u201cI would hope that you on the call relentlessly ask the leaders in the Democratic Party  \u2026    whether or not they equally denounce the   tactics by   \u2026    groups to interrupt the Democratic process,\u201d Spicer challenged the press. During Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing, several groups interrupted him as well as other lawmakers, including one group dressed as members of the KKK in an attempt to call Trump and his administration fascist. Two more guys disrupt Sessions hearing. \u2019No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!\u2019 Gonna be a lot of this. Sessions resumes. Then another one!  \u2014   Byron York (@ByronYork) January 10, 2017,  Before Jeff Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing for attorney general began, protesters wearing KKK garb were escorted out https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   CNN (@CNN) January 10, 2017,  Woman with @codepink removed after laughing out loud when one Senator praised Sessions civil rights record. pic. twitter.   \u2014   NAACP (@NAACP) January 10, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742563294.8015783}
