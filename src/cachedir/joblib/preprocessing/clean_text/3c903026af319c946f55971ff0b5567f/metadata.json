They spent a lot of money and personal resources to help Hillary Clinton out during the election, but not any more says CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg! After the liberal media tried to make him turn on one of his oldest friends, Peter Thiel, for donating to Donald Trump , Zuckerberg finally decided to fight back. Since Zuckerberg is still technically supporting Hillary for President, in the following video I suggest what his real motive may have been for lashing out with pro-Trump rhetoric, and why the person he\u2019s defending doesn\u2019t win Zuckerberg any humanitarian awards either\u2026 He wrote a scathing post, telling people that Facebook will stand for more than just the ideas of a few tech elite, but instead for the ideas of the people. Zuckerberg even acknowledged there are GOOD reasons that people support Trump : They believe strongly in smaller government They want a different tax policy They want a better health care system They want to maintain religious freedom They worry about American gun rights Or ANY other issue where he disagrees with Hillary He ended the post by saying: \u201cThat\u2019s ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.\u201d So, despite the fact that he still supports Hillary Clinton , I want to thank Mark Zuckerberg for having the common decency to acknowledge the Trump Train even though all his tech billionaire friends will attack him for it. Now let\u2019s get this shared out everywhere so we can show the world that Hillary\u2019s \u201cnetwork\u201d is finally turning it\u2019s back on her. In related news, could what happened just hours after the final debate be the REAL reason Zuckerberg came out of the closet as a pro-Trump keyboard warrior? Several hours after what was arguably Trump \u2019s best performance of the campaign so far, one of the world\u2019s top political experts gave Trump the best news he could hope to hear\u2026 Danny Gold continues: If you love Trump , today just became a HECK of a lot better! A very well respected political professor from Syracuse has just given Donald Trump the best news of the entire election. Professor Helmut Norpoth stepped forward today, despite HUGE opposition from his peers, to announce that his scientific formula has predicted the TRUE results of the election. And the result is\u2026 There is an 87%-99% chance that Donald Trump will WIN the election! Heck yeah! See, at least there are still some people who have not been bought off by Hillary Clinton. According to Northrop, all the other predictions are based entirely on opinion polls, which are inherently wrong. Instead of opinion polling, Norpoth relies on statistics from candidates\u2019 performances in party primaries and patterns in the electoral cycle to forecast results. His model has correctly predicted the victor in every presidential election since 1996. (H/T- The Gateway Pundit ) So if you wanted something to celebrate, I mean other than Donald Trump \u2019s epic win over Hillary Clinton at the final Presidential debate, then Helmut Norpoth has just given you exactly that. Now let\u2019s help share this GREAT news to everyone else in the entire world. Let every Trump supporting Facebook friend you have know! First of all, Zuckerberg may be a flaming liberal, but he\u2019s no fool. It\u2019s no secret that Zuckerberg has enjoyed a cushy relationship with Obama and the White House over the past eight years, but a Trump presidency could pose a threat to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s current role as the self-proclaimed arbiter of \u201cfree speech.\u201d As Facebook\u2019s CEO, Zuckerberg has almost absolute control over what is, and what is not \u201cacceptable\u201d to believe in, or talk about on the Internet. Then, there\u2019s the whole issue of who Zuckerberg was defending when he had his micro-aggression and temporarily boarded the \u201c Trump Train.\u201d It\u2019s not like he was defending Mother Teresa\u2019s good name or something. Peter Thiel, the guy who is Zuck\u2019s BFF that people were ragging on for donating to Trump , just happens to the chief henchman of the Bilderberg Group, and chairman of its steering committee. It\u2019s worth noting too, that Peter Thiel is HARDLY Zuckerberg\u2019s closest connection to the Bilderberg group. I won\u2019t discuss it here, but he\u2019s got another connection that hits MUCH closer to home, so before everyone gets all excited thinking that perhaps Zuckerberg isn\u2019t such a bad guy after all, it\u2019s more likely he\u2019s just hedging his bets, and Hillary was probably fully aware of what he said ahead of time.
