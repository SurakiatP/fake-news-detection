The centerpiece of the meal was roasted goat, a sacrifice by a father offered upon the return of his son, for that was what was happening. Just three months before, the host, Abdul Basir, a government militia commander, had fired his rifle in the dark of the night at his son Said Muhammad, a hardened Taliban fighter, and was sad not to have killed him. Now, after trying several times to fulfill their vows to kill each other, the father and son were embracing and exchanging garlands of plastic flowers in the northern province of Faryab, where their battle had played out. \u201cHe was my son  \u2014   but he had been a coward out there fighting me,\u201d said Mr. Basir, a lanky, cleanshaven commander in his 40s who has known little but combat since he was 15. Several of his children and five of his brothers serve in his militia. \u201cNow I am very happy that he has returned to us. I hugged him and I said, \u2018No matter what you did, you are my son. \u2019\u201d It was an extraordinary twist, and perhaps not the last, in a story about how Afghan families have been fodder for a perpetual war, framed by grand ideologies but more truly depicted in misery and loss. Suddenly, a new chapter was starting. The celebratory feast was cut short as Mr. Basir\u2019s outposts came under Taliban fire, seemingly in retaliation for Mr. Muhammad\u2019s switching sides and bringing with him a couple of his comrades, as well as precious weapons and ammunition. In a telephone interview, Mr. Basir proudly described how he and his son hurried to the fight together, with Mr. Muhammad turning his gun against his old comrades. Since then, multiple interviews with both father and son, as well as relatives and officials in Faryab Province, detailed the family\u2019s ordeal. For much of his life, Mr. Basir has been a commander in the northern militia of Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former warlord who now serves as Afghanistan\u2019s vice president while continuing to draw accusations of human rights abuses. Mr. Basir crossed paths with the man who would turn his son against him in the 1990s, while the Taliban were in power. That man, Mawlawi Said Hafiz, was a Taliban military commander in Faryab Province, and Mr. Basir was a militia commander fighting him on behalf of Mr. Dostum. After the 2001 American invasion, Mr. Basir gained the upper hand, but he forgave Mawlawi Hafiz on the condition that he give up his links to the Taliban. Mr. Basir said he made Mawlawi Hafiz the imam of a village mosque, having the congregants pay him a tithe of wheat for his salary. Mr. Basir himself tried to take up a civilian life, though he maintained his cache of weapons and ammunition. Mawlawi Hafiz was keeping his powder dry, too. He secretly maintained his links to the Taliban and rose to become a senior judge for the insurgents\u2019 shadow government in Faryab. After the Taliban grew stronger in the province in recent years, Mawlawi Hafiz was in a position to exact revenge. First, he recruited Mr. Basir\u2019s teenage son. Mr. Muhammad stole thousands of his father\u2019s bullets, more than 40 magazines and a Kalashnikov rifle, and joined the Taliban. \u201cThe mullahs told us: \u2018Your father is an infidel  \u2014   he is supported by the Americans. You should come join our jihad,\u2019\u201d Mr. Muhammad recalled. \u201cI had decided to kill him. \u201d More than three years ago, Mr. Muhammad arrived at home with two pistols, set to gun down his father. But other villagers had tipped off Mr. Basir, who overpowered him. \u201cI wanted to kill him right there, but my relatives said: \u2018Let him be. He is your son,\u2019\u201d Mr. Basir recalled. \u201cI let him live, and convinced him not to return to the Taliban but join the army. \u201d Mr. Muhammad enlisted and joined an army unit sent to the eastern province of Paktia. But his loyalties had remained with the Taliban. Every month, he said, he would send his salary of about $202 to the Taliban, depositing it into an insurgent account. Back home, Mr. Basir said, he found out about the arrangement and warned Mr. Muhammad\u2019s superiors to be on watch in case the young man tried to surrender a post to the insurgents. But then Mawlawi Hafiz\u2019s Taliban came directly for Mr. Basir. He was arrested, and only narrowly avoided execution. He and his second wife and children fled their home, in the Qaisar District of Faryab. \u201cWe paid money for his release, and all of us left the area,\u201d said Mr. Basir\u2019s brother Said Abdul Rahim. \u201cBut Taliban continued to burn our five houses and cut down our trees. Then Basir decided to fight them. \u201d When Mr. Muhammad returned from his army base in the east last year, he went straight to Mawlawi Hafiz in Faryab and rejoined the Taliban there. As Mr. Muhammad was making his way back to Faryab, Mr. Basir learned of his son\u2019s plans and set up ambushes. Mr. Muhammad managed to avoid the traps, but Mr. Basir had made it his mission to kill his son. \u201cIt is up to God, but I think his blood is legitimate for me,\u201d Mr. Basir told The New York Times in May, after an unsuccessful raid to kill his son. In the middle of the night, Mr. Basir\u2019s men had surrounded their ancestral home village of Zyaratgah, which remained under Taliban control. \u201cMy mother came and said someone had shot the dog,\u201d Mr. Muhammad said about that night. \u201cI picked up the weapon and fired a couple times, but realized they had me surrounded. \u201d Mr. Muhammad flung himself out a window and ran into the orchards. Mr. Basir shot some rounds, chased him in vain and then left when other Taliban arrived to drive off the attack. At the heart of the blood feud, the women of the family were caught on opposite sides  \u2014   especially Mr. Muhammad\u2019s mother, Mr. Basir\u2019s first wife. She remains in Taliban territory, and could not be reached by telephone this week for comment. Mr. Rahim, Mr. Basir\u2019s brother, suggested that she was potentially a factor in Mr. Muhammad\u2019s joining the Taliban. \u201cBasir\u2019s wife has complained that he married another woman and did not take care of her,\u201d Mr. Rahim said. \u201cSo she convinced her son to join the Taliban. \u201d Mr. Basir insists that his first wife is not angry with him. \u201cSuch things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I love that wife of mine  \u2014   she has put up with a lot. \u201d Mr. Muhammad said: \u201cMy mother was on both sides. Sometimes she was on my side, sometimes on my father\u2019s side. \u201d Mr. Basir could not say what finally changed his mind about his son since trying to ambush him in May. In the months since, he began reaching out to try to persuade Mr. Muhammad to return. The men\u2019s reunion was secured by shuttle diplomacy, with relatives going back and forth between the two. They sought to convince Mr. Muhammad that he was, in effect, burning his own property  \u2014   seeking to destroy the orchards and home he stood to inherit. Mr. Muhammad said he had slowly realized that the Taliban were not the holy warriors they had portrayed themselves to be. Top commanders were getting payments, and none was trickling down to fighters like him. \u201cI told Muhammad: \u2018Your father is a serious enemy of the Taliban. If the father is an enemy, the son cannot be a friend,\u2019\u201d said Said Qayum, one of Mr. Basir\u2019s cousins who served as a  . For now, Mr. Muhammad is fighting on his father\u2019s side. Still, some in the family and their home district remain skeptical that someone who was once so determined to kill his own father, and who barely survived his father\u2019s gunfire, could put it all behind him. What if he is an infiltrator? Mr. Basir said he had no doubts. \u201cI believe him now  \u2014   he was ignorant. My friends there told him that your father has killed 300 to 400 Taliban, they will kill you eventually. They will not leave you alive,\u201d Mr. Basir said. \u201cI told him, \u2018I want to get you married. \u2019\u201d When asked about that plan, Mr. Muhammad  \u2014   who years ago explicitly chose the Taliban rather than bow to his family\u2019s pressure to marry  \u2014   had only a hesitant answer: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear now  \u2014   I can\u2019t say if I will marry. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563767.7477024}
