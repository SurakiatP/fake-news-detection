But what was encouraging about the court decision, experts said, was that in affirming the value of diversity, including race and ethnicity, in higher education, the court recognized that there was not one, immutable way of defining and achieving it. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific outcome,\u201d said Peter McDonough, the vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. \u201cI think today\u2019s decision is about deference. It\u2019s not about dictating. I think it\u2019s about the continuing recognition that our country\u2019s campuses are laboratories for experimentation, and that the formula for diversity does remain elusive. It changes over time, and it is impacted by context. \u201d Mr. McDonough echoed a critical part of the Supreme Court opinion that described public universities as \u201claboratories for experimentation\u201d and called on the University of Texas at Austin \u201cto scrutinize the fairness of its admissions program to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a   policy and to identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the   measures it deems necessary. \u201d The decision was made on fairly narrow legal grounds and does not establish any bold new policy, said David Hawkins, the executive director for education content and policy of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see a resounding clarion call for further investment in the use of race and ethnicity as an admissions tool,\u201d he said. Mr. Hawkins said he expected colleges to react by heeding the court\u2019s call to be introspective  \u2014   to \u201cengage in constant deliberation and continued reflection\u201d  \u2014   about how they achieved diversity. Several states  \u2014   including Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington  \u2014   have banned affirmative action, and some education analysts wondered whether the court\u2019s decision would lead to more such backlash. \u201cPublic opinion polling suggests that most Americans don\u2019t like the idea of counting race in deciding who gets into universities,\u201d said Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, who has argued for using poverty rather than race to achieve diversity and said he saw the decision as a setback for that cause. \u201cRepublicans have resisted pushing this issue because they fear that it will generate turnout among \u201d he said. \u201cBut all bets are off with Donald Trump. It will be interesting to see what he does. \u201d Affirmative action bans have led public universities like the University of Michigan to look for other ways to achieve diversity, like reaching out to minority students after they have been offered admission to persuade them to accept. Experts also said other affirmative action plans could still face challenges in state legislatures and in cases before lower courts challenging admissions policies at Harvard and at the University of North Carolina. The lawsuits argue that diversity can be achieved through   alternatives. The Harvard complaint also argues that affirmative action policies have the effect of discriminating against     applicants. \u201cThe lower courts will obviously have the Fisher precedent to apply while looking at those schools\u2019 programs,\u201d said Rachel Kleinman, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, referring to the name of the case, Fisher v. University of Texas, No.  . \u201cI think that could be very helpful. \u201d Lee C. Bollinger, president of Columbia University, noted that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in his dissent, said the Texas plan discriminated against  . \u201cThe points made in Justice Alito\u2019s dissent about his view and the view of dissenters that this discriminates against   I think, is one of the themes that the opponents of affirmative action are pursuing,\u201d Mr. Bollinger said. \u201cI do not expect Fisher to be the end. \u201d On the campus of the University of Texas, Sergio Cavazos, 20, president of the Senate of College Councils, said he thought students overwhelmingly supported the admissions policy. Mr. Cavazos, a senior government major, is from Brownsville, at the southern tip of Texas on the border with Mexico. One of four children from a   Hispanic family, he graduated from high school in 2013 ranked 10th in his class of 350 and entered the university under its policy of admitting the top 10 percent of graduating high school seniors. He has a full academic scholarship. \u201cWe value diversity on this campus,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the key concerns for me  \u2014   myself being a Hispanic student from Brownsville  \u2014   was ensuring this campus remain diverse and representative of the population of this state. \u201d The court seemed skeptical of using poverty as a proxy for achieving racial diversity, as some have called for. The decision said that Texas had \u201ctried, and failed, to increase diversity through enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and other factors. \u201d Some have argued that making large allowances for race could lead to admitting students who would flounder because they were \u201cmismatched\u201d to academic standards, a theory that Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to be thinking of during oral arguments in the case. The court said Thursday that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence. \u201d Justice Scalia died in February before he could participate in the Fisher decision.'"}, "time": 1742562052.9121091}
