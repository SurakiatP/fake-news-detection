[The law requires all gun sales \u2014  retail or private \u2014  to be conducted via the auspices of a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL).  When the law took effect in August 2015 it immediately placed a strain on those charged with enforcing it and a number of sheriffs in the state quickly made known that it would not be a priority for their departments. The Statesman Journal quoted Polk County Sheriff Bob Wolfe saying, \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t know if I even have enough people to enforce it. We\u2019ll have to evaluate it on a case by case basis until we can get some staff on and figure out if we even have the resources to really deal with it. \u201d KTVZ reports that since then \u201cfour counties have passed a measure known as the Second Amendment Preservation ordinance. \u201d This ordinance declares that the sheriffs of the four counties are not obligated to enforce the gun control measure. And \u201ccommissioners in Malheur, Union and Lake counties\u201d have all heard proposals for the same ordinance during recent weeks. Gun control advocate Penny Okamoto says counties are not allowed to take such action because of Oregon\u2019s preemption law. Because of this, she says the ordinance barring enforcement of gun control is \u201clargely very symbolic. \u201d But Coos County\u2019s Rob Taylor \u2014  a chief proponent of Second Amendment Preservation ordinances \u2014  begs to differ. He wants Oregon to have \u201csanctuary counties\u201d where the Second Amendment is free from gun control enforcement in much the same way that the state \u201chas become a sanctuary state for immigration. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
