The media has taken sides. They\u2019ve aggressively taken sides and they\u2019ve admitted that we\u2019re aggressively taking sides and I think you get some Republicans that see that every four years. It\u2019s so funny. They do that every four years. Every four years it\u2019s like the end of the world if a Republican gets elected president because they\u2019re all racist. It\u2019s the boy that cried wolf.\u201d \\nIn a sense, what was articulated is that the mass media\u2019s historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one, their usual partisan attacks against Trump\u2019s controversial personality are not as effective. Also, Scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals. \\nFurthermore, in conversation with frequent panelist Mike Barnicle, Scarborough added: \u201cAlso, it\u2019s such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what it\u2019s about, Mike Barnicle said all along that it\u2019s about Hillary Clinton. People say \u2018I\u2019m going to vote for Hillary Clinton as a protest against\u2026\u2019 and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go \u2018eh\u2026maybe not.\u2019\u201d \\nIn a way, they were all trying to explain how Trump is still almost tied to Clinton in a number of battleground state polls, despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage. Later on in response to co-host Willie Geist\u2019s remarks about the race being almost over, Scarborough proved his earlier point about the media\u2019s disconnect: \\n\u201cI got to say, Willie. Everybody that is saying it\u2019s over and you\u2019re a fool if you\u2019re suggesting that the American people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in August, September, October, November, December, January, February that there was no way in a million years that Donald Trump would ever win the Republican nomination. Stating it just as emphatically as they\u2019re stating now that we need to avert our eyes, this race is over. \u201c \\nHere are the excerpts from the October 26th discussion on Morning Joe : \\nMSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe \\n10/26/2016 \\n6:07:14-6:08:04 AM \\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: People in the press won\u2019t like to hear there also is \u2013 as a Republican there\u2019s a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned.
