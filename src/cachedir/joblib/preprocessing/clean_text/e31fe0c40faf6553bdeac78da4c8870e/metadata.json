[\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d he said.  The temporary ban blocks travel and immigration from six Middle Eastern countries  \u2014   Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Trump\u2019s second attempt at instating a ban was blocked in March by a federal judge in Hawaii, which was upheld by an federal appeals court in May. The president\u2019s first attempt was withdrawn by the White House after it was also blocked by the courts. Trump signed his support for the stronger, first ban. \u201cThe Justice Department should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to (the) Supreme Court,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Trump asked for his Justice Department to expedite hearings for his second version of the ban and then move forward again on a tougher ban. \u201cIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U. S. in order to help keep our country safe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe courts are slow and political!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562997.3958259}
