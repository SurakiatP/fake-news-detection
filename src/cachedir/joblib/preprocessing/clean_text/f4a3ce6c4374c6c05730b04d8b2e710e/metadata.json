Throughout recorded history, hubris has been the Achilles\u2019 Heel of political despots.

Worse infractions were discovered.\u201d \u2013 John Titus \\nIn addition to exposing Hillary to all sorts of felonies, her statement to the FBI under oath undermined by this unforeseen \u201cBlack Swan\u201d event that has engulfed her campaign. \\nThe Shadow of Truth is pleased to present John Titus of Best Evidence productions adds his unique insight into this event.
