We\u2019ve been pessimistic on the economy, on the social foundation of our country, our standing in the world, our concern over potential for war, our healthcare, our jobs and generally speaking\u2026 our future.\\nFor some of you Barack Obama may be a likable character. While many of us believe he\u2019s corrupt and wrong in his way of thinking, it\u2019s understandable that many of his voters found him to be generally likable. For those who do, the truth is he betrayed you. He betrayed all of us.\\nHis healthcare law was sold to you as a law that would make healthcare affordable and wouldn\u2019t change the plan/doctor you have. Most of us are now finding that was a lie. We\u2019re losing our plans and doctors, and costs are skyrocketing.\\nHis economic policy enriched the mega rich while crushing jobs. His environmental policy has pumped billions of our dollars into the pockets of special interests, killed off jobs and did absolutely nothing for the environment. His tax policy is painful. If you pay taxes you know this to be the case.\\nHe spends money like it grows on trees. For him it\u2019s not an issue. He lives in the high castle and will never have to worry about money. But you and I? Yeah, it\u2019s an issue.\\nHe dragged us nearly into world war with Russia. He collapsed the Middle East in a way that has rippled across the globe.\\nWe can disagree on issues, but surely we can agree this hasn\u2019t been a good situation. Something has to change. Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t going to change anything. She was going to take Obama\u2019s burning agenda and throw gasoline on it.\\nWe now have an opportunity. Donald Trump has his flaws. We all have concerns about it. No secret there. But his plan is something we should all get excited about. That is, of course, provided he actually follows through with it.\\nTrump is likely to relax tensions with Russia. He\u2019s likely to pull back our nonsensical involvement in the Middle East. He\u2019s likely to repeal and replace Obamacare. He\u2019s likely to initiate a tax and economic policy that WILL invigorate business growth.\\nFor businesses, Trump has a plan that will help create spenders. And for consumers his plan will help us earn and retain more financial stability.\\nThis is a good thing. It\u2019s good for liberals, conservatives and independents. It\u2019s good for America.\\nNot long ago there was a time when Americans were optimistic, hungry for success and excited to work hard for it. We\u2019ve exiting a period of time where that mentality has been non-existent. We\u2019re entering a time where it can exist again.\\nWe\u2019ve got a mess on our hands. There is much work to do to clean it up. But it can be cleaned up, and we can flourish as a result of it.\\nThat is, if we unify and optimistically strive for success as a nation.\\nIt\u2019s time, America. It\u2019s long overdue.\\nLet\u2019s make America great again.\\n-Eric Odom \\n'"}, "time": 1742564601.4311705}
