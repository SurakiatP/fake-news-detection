He was 90. The St. Charles County Police Department confirmed his death on its Facebook page. The department said that it responded to a medical emergency at the home, about 45 miles west of St. Louis, and that lifesaving measures were unsuccessful. While Elvis Presley was rock\u2019s first pop star and teenage heartthrob, Mr. Berry was its master theorist and conceptual genius, the songwriter who understood what the kids wanted before they knew themselves. With songs like \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d he gave his listeners more than they knew they were getting from jukebox entertainment. His guitar lines wired the lean twang of country and the bite of the blues into phrases with both a streamlined trajectory and a long memory. And tucked into the lighthearted, telegraphic narratives that he sang with such clear enunciation was a sly defiance, upending convention to claim the pleasures of the moment. In \u201cSweet Little Sixteen,\u201d \u201cYou Can\u2019t Catch Me\u201d and other songs, Mr. Berry invented rock as a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit). In \u201cPromised Land,\u201d \u201cToo Much Monkey Business\u201d and \u201cBrown Eyed Handsome Man,\u201d he celebrated and satirized America\u2019s opportunities and class tensions. His rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was a music of joyful lusts,   tensions and gleefully shattered icons. Mr. Berry was already well past his teens when he wrote   manifestoes like \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d \u201cRock and Roll Music\u201d and \u201cSchool Day. \u201d Born Charles Edward Anderson Berry on Oct. 18, 1926, in St. Louis, he grew up in a segregated,   neighborhood there, soaking up gospel, blues, and rhythm and blues, along with some country music. He spent three years in reform school after a spree of car thefts and armed robbery. He received a degree in hairdressing and cosmetology and worked for a time as a beautician he married Themetta Suggs in 1948 and started a family. She survives him, as do four children: Ingrid Berry, Melody Eskridge, Aloha Isa Leigh Berry and Charles Berry Jr. By the early 1950s, he was playing guitar and singing blues, pop standards and an occasional country tune with local combos. Shortly after joining Sir John\u2019s Trio, led by the pianist Johnnie Johnson, he reshaped the group\u2019s music and took it over. From the Texas guitarist   Walker, Mr. Berry picked up a technique of bending two strings at once that he would rough up and turn into a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll talisman, the Chuck Berry lick, which would in turn be emulated by the Rolling Stones and countless others. He also recognized the popularity of country music and added some hillbilly twang to his guitar lines. Mr. Berry\u2019s hybrid music, along with his charisma and showmanship, drew white as well as black listeners to the Cosmopolitan Club in St. Louis. In 1955, Mr. Berry ventured to Chicago and asked one of his idols, the bluesman Muddy Waters, about making records. Waters directed him to the label he recorded for, Chess Records, where one of the owners, Leonard Chess, heard potential in Mr. Berry\u2019s song \u201cIda Red. \u201d A variant of an old country song by the same name, \u201cIda Red\u201d had a   backbeat with a hillbilly oompah, while Mr. Berry\u2019s lyrics sketched a car chase, the narrator \u201cmotorvatin\u2019\u201d after an elusive girl. Mr. Chess renamed the song \u201cMaybellene,\u201d and in a long session on May 21, 1955, Mr. Chess and the bassist Willie Dixon got the band to punch up the rhythm. \u201cThe big beat, cars and young love,\u201d Mr. Chess outlined. \u201cIt was a trend, and we jumped on it. \u201d The music was bright and clear, a   amalgam of country and blues. More than 60 years later, it still sounds reckless and audacious. Mr. Berry articulated every word, with precise diction and no noticeable accent, leading some listeners and concert promoters, used to a different kind of    singer, to initially think that he was white. Teenagers didn\u2019t care they heard a rocker who was ready to take on the world. The song was sent to the disc jockey Alan Freed. Mr. Freed and another man, Russ Fratto, were added to the credits as songwriters and got a share of the publishing royalties. Played regularly on Mr. Freed\u2019s show and others, \u201cMaybellene\u201d reached No. 5 on the Billboard pop chart and was a No. 1 RB hit. In Mr. Berry\u2019s groundbreaking early songs, his guitar twangs his famous   lick. It also punches like a horn section and sasses back at his own voice. The drummer eagerly socks the backbeat, and the pianist  \u2014   usually either Mr. Johnson or Lafayette Leake  \u2014   hurls fistfuls of tinkling anarchy all around him. From 1955 to 1958, Mr. Berry knocked out classic after classic. Although he was in his late 20s and early 30s, he came up with high school chronicles and plugs for the newfangled music called rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. No matter how calculated songs like \u201cSchool Day\u201d or \u201cRock and Roll Music\u201d may have been, they reached the Top 10, caught the early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll spirit and detailed its mythology. \u201cJohnny B. Goode,\u201d a Top 10 hit in 1958, told the archetypal story of a rocker who could \u201cplay the guitar just like ringin\u2019 a bell. \u201d Mr. Berry toured with rock revues and performed in three movies with Mr. Freed: \u201cRock, Rock, Rock,\u201d \u201cMr. Rock and Roll\u201d and \u201cGo, Johnny, Go. \u201d On film and in concert, he dazzled audiences with his duck walk, a   strut that involved kicking one leg forward and hopping on the other. Through the 1950s, Mr. Berry had pop hits with his songs about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and RB hits with less   material. He spun surreal tall tales that Bob Dylan and John Lennon would learn from, like \u201cThirty Days\u201d and \u201cJo Jo Gunne. \u201d In \u201cBrown Eyed Handsome Man,\u201d from 1956, he offered a barely veiled racial pride. His pithiness and humor rarely failed him. In 1957, Mr. Berry bought 30 acres in Wentzville, where he built a   amusement park, Berry Park, and a restaurant, the Southern Air. In 1958, he opened Club Bandstand in the theater district of St. Louis. In the early 1960s, Mr. Berry\u2019s songs inspired both California rock and the British Invasion. The Beach Boys reworked his \u201cSweet Little Sixteen\u201d into \u201cSurfin\u2019 U. S. A. \u201d (Mr. Berry sued them and won a songwriting credit.) The Rolling Stones released a string of Berry songs, including their first single, \u201cCome On,\u201d and the Beatles remade \u201cRoll Over Beethoven\u201d and \u201cRock and Roll Music. \u201d But by the time his music started reaching a new audience, Mr. Berry was in jail. He had been arrested in 1959 and charged with transporting a teenage girl  \u2014   who briefly worked as a hatcheck girl at Club Bandstand  \u2014   across state lines for immoral purposes. He was tried twice and found guilty both times the first verdict was overturned because of racist remarks by the judge. When he emerged from 20 months in prison in 1964, his wife had left him (they later reconciled) and his songwriting spark had diminished. He had not totally lost his touch, though, as demonstrated by the handful of hits he had in 1964 and 1965, notably \u201cNadine,\u201d \u201cNo Particular Place to Go,\u201d \u201cYou Never Can Tell\u201d and \u201cPromised Land. \u201d He appeared in the celebrated   1964 concert film \u201cThe TAMI Show,\u201d along with James Brown, the Rolling Stones, Marvin Gaye, the Beach Boys and the Supremes. While he toured steadily through the 1960s, headlining or sharing bills with bands that grew up on his songs, his recording career stalled after he moved from Chess to Mercury Records in 1966. He remade some of his old hits and tried to reach the new hippie audience, recording \u201cLive at the Fillmore Auditorium\u201d with the Steve Miller Band, billed as the Steve Miller Blues Band at the time. When he returned to Chess in 1970, he recorded new songs, like \u201cTulane\u201d and \u201cHave Mercy Judge,\u201d that flashed his old wit but failed to reach the Top 40. In 1972, Mr. Berry had the biggest hit of his career with \u201cMy  \u201d a   novelty song that was included on the album \u201cThe London Chuck Berry Sessions\u201d (even though he recorded the song not in London but at a concert in Coventry, England). The New Orleans songwriter Dave Bartholomew wrote and recorded it in 1952 Mr. Berry recorded a similar song, \u201cMy Tambourine,\u201d in 1968, and is credited on recordings as the sole songwriter of the 1972 \u201cMy   . \u201d It was a   and Mr. Berry\u2019s first and only No. 1 pop single. It was also his last hit. His 1973   album, \u201cBio,\u201d was poorly received \u201cRockit,\u201d released by Atlantic in 1979, did not sell. But he stayed active: He appeared as himself in a 1979 movie about 1950s rock, \u201cAmerican Hot Wax,\u201d and he continued to tour constantly. In July 1979, he performed for President Jimmy Carter at the White House. Three days later, he was sentenced to 120 days in federal prison and four years\u2019 probation for income tax evasion. He had further legal troubles in 1990 when the police raided his home and found 62 grams of marijuana and videotapes from a camera in the women\u2019s room of his restaurant. In a plea bargain, he agreed to a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession, with a suspended jail sentence and two years\u2019 probation. By the 1980s, Mr. Berry was recognized as a rock pioneer. He never won a Grammy Award in his prime, but the Recording Academy gave him a lifetime achievement award in 1984. He was in the first group of musicians inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. Around his 60th birthday that year, he allowed the director Taylor Hackford to film him at his home in Wentzville for the documentary \u201cHail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll,\u201d which also included performances by Mr. Berry with a band led by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and special guests. \u201cChuck Berry: The Autobiography\u201d was published in 1988. Mr. Berry continued performing well into his 80s. He usually played with local pickup bands, as he had done for most of his career, but sometimes he played with fellow rock stars. When the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum opened in Cleveland in 1995, Mr. Berry performed at an inaugural concert, backed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. In 2012, he headlined a Cleveland concert in his honor with a   bill that included Darryl McDaniels of  . M. C. and Merle Haggard. Although he told reporters before the show, \u201cMy singing days have passed,\u201d he performed \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and \u201cReelin\u2019 and Rockin\u2019\u201d and joined the other musicians for the closing number, \u201cRock and Roll Music. \u201d From 1996 to 2014, Mr. Berry performed once a month at Blueberry Hill, a restaurant in St. Louis where he appeared regularly until Oct. 24. He made a surprising announcement on his 90th birthday, Oct. 18, 2016: He was planning to release his first studio album in almost 40 years. The album, called simply \u201cChuck\u201d and scheduled for release in June, was to consist primarily of new compositions. And Mr. Berry\u2019s music has remained on tour extraterrestrially. \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d is on golden records within the Voyager I and II spacecraft, launched in 1977 and awaiting discovery.'"}, "time": 1742628501.82306}
