[Spicer said on the show:  I think the president, after almost a month in office has, done so many things to help move the country forward \u2014  create jobs, secure the nation \u2014  and I think so many times the filter of the mainstream media loses sight of both what he\u2019s done, accomplished, and intended to do. And I think he wants to make sure that the people who are out there who supported him, that are fighting for him and that are praying for him, know that he can talk directly to them and he can get out there and have an unfiltered conversation with them. And this is going to be a great opportunity here in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 o\u2019clock to have that conversation with the American people so he can talk to them about all of the things he\u2019s already done in 30 days to move the country forward. Spicer continued by noting that people in Washington, D. C. and some in New York City \u2014  those along the   \u201cAcela Corridor\u201d that\u2019s largely out of touch with the rest of America \u2014  \u201cmiss\u201d what is happening. He said: I think people who are caught up in Washington, D. C. or to some extent New York City, I think they miss what\u2019s going on here: A successful businessman went out and got into politics and has laid out a vision for America and then has actually came to Washington and did it. And there\u2019s like a bunch of people melting down and having their minds blown by the fact that a guy is actually keeping his word and doing exactly what he said to the American people. And not just doing it, but successfully doing it, and I think that that really sort of defies the narrative about what\u2019s supposed to happen for a lot of these individuals. I\u2019ll tell you, we were in South Carolina yesterday at Boeing and there were 5, 000 individuals there cheering on the new 787 Dreamliner that Boeing has created \u2014  and in doing so not just that but created thousands of jobs in South Carolina to support it. It was amazing to see their support for the president and his agenda. And then down here in Florida where we are for the weekend, it\u2019s similar. It\u2019s refreshing to get outside of Washington, D. C. and talk to people on the street or in a convenience store who just say, \u2018Hey, I really appreciate everything you\u2019re doing, I\u2019m standing with the president, I support everything \u2014  his agenda \u2014  and don\u2019t get down.\u2019 It really is reassuring to his team and to him to know that when you get outside of Washington there\u2019s just so much support for somebody keeping his word and moving the country forward. Spicer called out several establishment media outlets, including the Associated Press and CBS News. The AP printed fake news this week, claiming inaccurately that the Trump administration was activating the National Guard to round up and remove illegal aliens. That is not true. CBS News also reported inaccurately that Trump\u2019s designee to serve as Secretary of the Navy, Philip Bilden, is going to withdraw from serving. Spicer noted that he spoke with Bilden and that the CBS report is simply untrue. He also called out inaccurate reporting   about National Security Adviser possibility, retired Vice Admiral Bob Harward\u2019s, reasoning for turning down the job. Spicer said: It\u2019s not just that, although I share your concern with that story, but I also think that just today I had someone tell me that our Secretary of the Navy was stepping down \u2014  from CBS News \u2014  I called him, Phil Bilden, he\u2019s an amazing individual, and he says \u2018I\u2019m 100 percent committed, where is this coming from?\u2019 Yesterday, these stories about Admiral Harward, a really dedicated public servant who retired after 40 years in the Navy. He had some personal and financial obstacles in the way that didn\u2019t allow him to further his discussions with the president and he said \u2018you know what, Mr. President, you have an amazing team. I\u2019d be glad to be part of it, give me some time to get my family situation and financial situation straightened out after 40 years of serving this country in the Navy, and I\u2019d love to do something in your administration.\u2019 Yet, you read the mainstream media and they say, \u2018Oh he didn\u2019t accept it because of this\u2019 \u2014  he basically stopped the process and said, \u2018I can\u2019t go any further because of these objections, but I can\u2019t believe what an amazing national security team you have. I\u2019d love to be part of it in a year or two once I straighten some of this stuff out.\u2019 Yet the reporting is quite the opposite. And it\u2019s always, Matt, the thing that troubles me is if I say it or the President of the United States says it, it\u2019s well, \u2018We got two blind sources that say the opposite.\u2019 At some point, it\u2019s amazing they won\u2019t take the president\u2019s word, but they will take two blind sources about what the president\u2019s word is. Spicer said that outside the media the administration is seeing widespread support, even among former opponents \u2014  and that the president is not \u201cholding grudges. \u201d He went on: Well I think there\u2019s two groups of people \u2014  there are groups of people who truly do want to see the country succeed regardless of who they voted for. And then there are some people who are against him and are now for him based on the success he\u2019s having. Frankly, at the end of the day, I\u2019ll take anybody. If you were a fierce opponent of the president, but you like his agenda now that you\u2019re seeing the vision that he has, we need to grow not subtract from people who want to support his agenda and move this country forward. The president talks all the time about unifying this country and bringing people together. One of the individuals who was one of the leading \u2018Never Trump\u2019 members of the movement, Paul Singer, was in the Oval Office right before the press conference and he basically said, \u2018You know, Mr. President, you won and I want to be supportive of your agenda. And Mr. President, I embrace that.\u2019 He\u2019s not holding grudges. He wants to bring people together. He wants to move the country forward. And he understands that the more unified we are, the more we can enact policies that lift up people and get them to work. But he also said there are many people in the media who presume automatically that President Trump is doing something is a negative. Spicer said: But I think, frankly, to get to the point of your question Matt, that there are a lot of folks in the media \u2014  and I said this a couple times at the podium \u2014  the presumption is always negative. It\u2019s \u2018No matter what he does, it can\u2019t be for the right reasons. It can\u2019t be successful.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing how if you literally stripped the name from some of the words of his speeches or some of the words from Obama or Bush or Clinton rather, you could almost say the exact same thing, but the second you put his name attached to the quote it\u2019s \u2018Well, that was a negative statement because he said it \u2014  not because of the words.\u2019 That\u2019s what I find amazing \u2014  there\u2019s this presumptive negativity in everything he does and says.
