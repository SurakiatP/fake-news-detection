The spokesman, John Vlautin, said the Los Angeles mansion, home to Hugh Hefner, 90, the founder of Playboy Magazine, was under contract to be sold to Daren Metropoulos, 32, a principal at the private equity firm Metropoulos  Company and an owner of Hostess Brands, the maker of that indestructible,   snack cake, the Twinkie. Mr. Vlautin declined to comment on the financial details, citing confidentiality restrictions. The house, which is nearly 20, 000 square feet, according to its sales listing, was built in 1927 in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles and has 29 rooms, including 12 bedrooms. It has a wine cellar, a theater, a gym, tennis courts and a huge swimming pool, complete with a shadowy grotto. Its listing price: $200 million. The listing also said the mansion was \u201cone of a select few private residences in L. A. with a zoo license. \u201d Mr. Metropoulos will not have to go far once the purchase is completed: He lives next door in a house he acquired in 2009. He would, however, have to be willing to live with a nonagenarian celebrity roommate if he wanted to move in right away. Mr. Vlautin said that, regardless of the sale, Mr. Hefner planned to stay in the house indefinitely. Playboy bought the house in 1971, and Mr. Hefner moved in (permanently) in 1975. A spokeswoman for Mr. Metropoulos\u2019s company said in a statement that after Mr. Hefner\u2019s tenancy ends, the buyer hoped to connect his current house with the Playboy Mansion, \u201cultimately returning the combined 7.  compound to the original vision executed by noted architect Arthur R. Kelly. \u201d The mansion is famous for the lavish parties hosted by Mr. Hefner and attended by the rich, the famous and the  . The house has been featured as the ideal party destination for men in movies like \u201cBeverly Hills Cop II\u201d and television shows like \u201cEntourage\u201d on HBO. Holly Madison, a former girlfriend and housemate of Mr. Hefner\u2019s and one of the stars of the E! reality show \u201cThe Girls Next Door,\u201d which frequently featured the mansion, offered a different perspective on the house in her 2015 memoir. She called the climate \u201ctoxic\u201d and described a stifling atmosphere that caused her to develop a stutter and even to consider suicide. Mr. Metropoulos told The Wall Street Journal, which reported the deal, that he was more interested in the mansion\u2019s historic architecture than its reputation as a party pad. \u201cThe heritage of this property transcends its celebrity, and to have the opportunity to serve as its steward would be a true privilege,\u201d he said. The Playboy Mansion was listed for sale early this year, and potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring Playboy Enterprises in its entirety. The company has suffered since the advent of internet pornography, and in March, its magazine stopped featuring fully nude women.'"}, "time": 1742564562.2786496}
