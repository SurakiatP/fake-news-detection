On Friday, the Met said that more than 50 employees had taken the buyouts but that it would seek further cuts in its core departments, for a total of at least 100 positions. Curatorial and conservation jobs are likely to be cut by an additional 5 percent, and administrative staff  \u2014   including marketing, human resources, and digital personnel  \u2014   may see staff cuts of 15 to 20 percent. \u201cThere is no letting up on the quality and the commitment we have to excellence  \u2014   nothing we\u2019re doing will be discernible or visible to the public,\u201d said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to streamline our budgets but not to diminish our mission. \u201d These significant cuts in staff come as some are questioning the museum\u2019s direction under Thomas P. Campbell. It has faced not only layoffs, but also a ballooning deficit of $10 million this year, and a pause in work on a $600 million new wing dedicated to Modern and contemporary art. The museum also underwent a $3 million rebranding, which was widely derided. In addition, the Met\u2019s   lease of the former Madison Avenue home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, now known as the Met Breuer, has proved to be expensive, soaking up about $17 million in yearly operating expenses in addition to an estimated $15 million building renovation. Given the Met\u2019s annual attendance of more than six million, annual operating budget of $300 million and endowment of nearly $3 billion, any cracks in its foundation are surprising. But, Mr. Campbell insisted, \u201cWe\u2019re not in a crisis. \u201d \u201cThe Met is a very strong institution firing on all cylinders,\u201d he said, adding that the museum had to establish \u201ca fiscally sustainable budget over the long term. \u201d In response to the buyout offer in April, 56 staff members signed up, out of 159 eligible employees  \u2014   those 55 years or older who had served for at least 15 years. Among those taking it is Carrie Rebora Barratt, the Met\u2019s deputy director for collections and administration. The Met would not release or confirm other names. In June, three   employees, including the Met\u2019s first chief digital officer, Sree Sreenivasan, stepped down from their posts. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum also recently announced buyouts. The Met\u2019s roughly $10 million deficit this year, officials have said, would almost certainly rise to as much as $40 million if the museum failed to, as Mr. Weiss put it, \u201cdial back. \u201d Mr. Weiss  \u2014   formerly the president of Haverford College who came to the Met last year  \u2014   appears to be overseeing the  . \u201cI was brought in to be the chief operating officer of the museum,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cI\u2019m making the corrections I need to make to fulfill that responsibility. \u201d Mr. Campbell, its director and chief executive since 2009, said that he and Mr. Weiss \u201cwill be working together\u201d in making layoff decisions and that departures were to be expected at an institution with 55 departments and 2, 300 employees. \u201cThe   assumption when people write about attrition is often fear of some kind of a brain drain  \u2014   I want to push back against that really robustly,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cInevitably, people come, people go. \u201d The number of annual exhibitions over the next few years will also be curtailed to reduce costs, perhaps to 40 from 55, Mr. Campbell said. For example, the museum has postponed by a year a major show on Versailles. \u201cWe\u2019ll be stretching out and slimming down the numbers of exhibitions,\u201d Mr. Campbell said, \u201cbut not compromising the quality and the content. \u201d He said that would make the museum \u201cmore manageable\u201d for general visitors. \u201cWe have seen considerable growth in installations and exhibitions,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re very conscious that it\u2019s too much. \u201d Some have questioned Mr. Campbell\u2019s decision to devote significant resources to the Met Breuer. While shows there have received positive reviews, attendance often seems sparse. But the museum said that Met Breuer attendance  \u2014   185, 000 visitors in the first four months (March 1 through June 30)  \u2014   exceeds initial projections of 155, 000. \u201cWe obviously hope we can grow those in the future,\u201d Mr. Campbell said of the numbers of visitors, \u201cbut we\u2019re very satisfied with the attendance to date. \u201d The Met also consistently makes the point that it has raised operating funds separately for the Met Breuer, though donations are arguably coming from donors who would give to the Met regardless. The Met is working to lift its revenues, particularly in its retail operations, which declined by between $3 million and $4 million over the last year. Mr. Weiss said the retail numbers had already improved. \u201cWe are putting greater emphasis on our publications and some of our more distinctive merchandise,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. The museum\u2019s executives said that restructuring is a continuing process, all to create a leaner Met. Asked how the Met  \u2014   with its board of several financiers  \u2014   failed to anticipate the $8. 5 million annual debt service on $250 million in bonds issued for capital infrastructure work (one of the reasons given for its deficit) Mr. Weiss said that arrangement had been made before he started. And Mr. Campbell said that the Met is \u201cstill learning. \u201d \u201cWhat we have to emphasize is, we\u2019re a big institution,\u201d he said. \u201cTurning around in the ocean takes time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562270.4660187}
