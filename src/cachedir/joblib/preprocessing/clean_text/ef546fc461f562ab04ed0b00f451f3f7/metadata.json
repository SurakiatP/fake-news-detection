The Times quotes Trump as follows: \u201cI just fired the head of the F. B. I. He was crazy, a real nut job,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to the document, which was read to The New York Times by an American official. \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off. \u201d Mr. Trump added, \u201cI\u2019m not under investigation. \u201d Trump appears to be referring to \u201cpressure\u201d in foreign policy. At no point does he say he felt any legal pressure. The Times includes a comment from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who does not dispute that Trump made the comment, but attempts to explain the context: \u201cBy grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia\u2019s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. \u201d The Times does not report what else may have been in the document, which would appear to have been classified. The Times used the same dubious methods in reporting Tuesday that President Trump had \u201casked\u201d Comey to end the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. In that story, the Times relied on a Comey \u201cassociate\u201d who read from a purported memorandum by Comey, which the newspaper never obtained or verified itself. And it spun Trump\u2019s words as a \u201crequest,\u201d when Trump had, in fact, merely said: \u201cI hope you can let this go. \u201d CNN, predictably, convened a panel of experts immediately after the story was published, all of whom agreed that the Times story provided \u201cbombshell\u201d evidence of obstruction of justice. Spicer also told the Times: \u201cThe investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations. \u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
