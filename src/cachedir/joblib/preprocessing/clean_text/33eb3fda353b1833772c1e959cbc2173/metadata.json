Completing it successfully required many months of hard bargaining, Iran giving more than it got in return \u2013 to free itself from sanctions imposed solely for political reasons, serving US and Israeli interests mainly. Its nuclear program has no military component, not now or earlier, claims otherwise falsified. Since ending a generation of US-installed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi rule in 1979, Washington treated the Islamic Republic deplorably. It\u2019s not at war with its neighbors, threatens no one, and advocates a nuclear-free Middle East \u2013 Israel the sole regional nuclear armed and dangerous nation, yet nothing is done to contest its arsenal, no JCPOA-type deal to eliminate it. Why challenge Iran? Because it\u2019s a sovereign independent nation Washington doesn\u2019t control. And there\u2019s all their hydrocarbon riches Big Oil wants exploited for its own bottom line interests. On November 25, The Wall Street Journal reported Washington \u201cand its Western allies\u2026pressing pressing Iran to take steps to sharply cut the amount of radioactive material it holds in a bid to shore up last year\u2019s nuclear deal and discourage the incoming Trump administration from abandoning it,\u201d citing unnamed Western officials. Will Trump scrap or renegotiate JCPOA as vowed while campaigning? Highly unlikely. It\u2019s an international agreement, America one of six countries involved plus Iran. Renegotiating what took many months to agree on would begin his tenure on the wrong foot, irresponsibly challenging the other permanent Security Council members plus Germany. He\u2019s more likely to continue a hard line on Tehran in other ways, maintaining illegal US sanctions, maybe adding more, breaching the letter and spirit of JCPOA \u2013 instead of responsibly ending 37 years of hostility, treating Iranian sovereignty with the respect it deserves. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, warned against taking steps to undermine JCPOA terms, stressing Tehran\u2019s full compliance, saying: \u201cThe P5+1 countries have a clear responsibility to abide by the JCPOA with good will and in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect and through avoiding any steps that run contrary to the text and spirit of the JCPOA and undermine its successful implementation.\u201d Complaints about Tehran exceeding its agreed on heavy water inventory of 130 metric tons were overblown \u2013 the issue resolved when 11 tons were sent to Oman days earlier. IAEA director general Yukiya Amano confirmed Iran\u2019s full compliance with JCPOA terms. Last April, he praised the Islamic Republic for exceeding its obligations under the agreement. Washington continues breaching it by maintaining sanctions, imposing new ones since JCPOA\u2019s implementation in January, and failing to unfreeze all Iranian assets.
