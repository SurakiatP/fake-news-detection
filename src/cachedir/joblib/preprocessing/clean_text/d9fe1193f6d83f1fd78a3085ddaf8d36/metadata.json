Bernie Sanders ( ) started off Monday night\u2019s CNN town hall with Chris Cuomo delivering biting words against   Donald Trump, calling him a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d before going on to praise him for winning the presidency when an audience member asked him what he deemed Trump\u2019s \u201cstrongest attribute. \u201d[\u201cWell, let me  \u2014   that\u2019s not a hard question for me to answer,\u201d Sanders said:  Look, any objective assessment in the last year or a     or how long it was, will tell you that Donald Trump did something extraordinary. Something that nobody, but nobody, thought that he could do. Trump took on the Republican establishment, took on the Democratic establishment, took on the media establishment, and he ended up winning the election to become President of the United States. That is an extraordinary accomplishment. Donald Anyanwu, a student at George Washington University, whose family emigrated to the United States from Nigeria when he was in middle school, asked the question. Anyanwu, a registered independent, voted for Hillary Clinton, but he had asked Sanders to provide a positive remark about Trump \u201cin light of the efforts to inspire a cohesive front. \u201d Sanders said, \u201cSo, I give, you know, Donald Trump his due. And I think any   person has got to. \u201d Earlier, Sanders had called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d in response to a question that was asked about Trump\u2019s skepticism about the intelligence committee\u2019s findings that suggest Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. Sanders said he agreed with the intelligence committee\u2019s findings on Russia. \u201cWe are dealing with a man who, in many respects is  \u2014   how can I phrase this?  \u2014   a pathological liar,\u201d Sanders said. He added, \u201cI have many conservative friends, and I disagree with them. They are not liars. They have their point of view. But time after time after time, he says stuff that is blatantly untrue. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz.'"}, "time": 1742563609.2751284}
