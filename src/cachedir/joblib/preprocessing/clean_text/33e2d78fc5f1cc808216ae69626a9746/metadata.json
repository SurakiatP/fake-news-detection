The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, told reporters on Capitol Hill that \u201cI don\u2019t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower\u201d and that Mr. Trump, if taken literally, is simply \u201cwrong. \u201d Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said he had provided no information to Mr. Trump that might have formed the basis for the president\u2019s claim. And two Republican senators threatened to block Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy attorney general until they get clarity from the F. B. I. about the accuracy of the president\u2019s assertions. One of them vowed to issue subpoenas, if needed. But Mr. Trump appeared defiant. In a Fox News interview, he hinted at a broader meaning to his Twitter messages and suggested that his online assertions would eventually be vindicated, saying that \u201cwiretap covers a lot of different things. \u201d Mr. Trump added, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks. \u201d It is unclear if Republicans will accept an effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to redefine what he meant. Mr. Nunes told reporters on Wednesday that lawmakers will have to confront that issue as hearings of the intelligence committee open on Monday. In one of the most significant signs of pressure from within Mr. Trump\u2019s own party, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would block the nomination of Rod J. Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general unless the F. B. I. answered his questions. Mr. Rosenstein had been expected to win Senate confirmation easily. The Judiciary Committee has primary oversight of the F. B. I. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, joined Mr. Grassley in the threat. \u201cWe\u2019ll hold up the deputy attorney general\u2019s nomination until Congress is provided with information to finally clear the air as to whether or not there was ever a warrant issued against the Trump campaign,\u201d Mr. Graham said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program. A delay on Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s appointment would create a number of problems for the Justice Department. In particular, he was expected to oversee any department investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the presidential election after Mr. Sessions recused himself because Mr. Sessions was an adviser to the Trump presidential campaign. Previous presidents have faced similar uprisings within their own parties: Democratic lawmakers initially denounced President Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior with an intern that led to his impeachment in the House, and Republican frustration with the Iraq war, as President George W. Bush\u2019s approval ratings fell, hampered Mr. Bush\u2019s   agenda. But rarely does a president clash so forcefully with his own party so early in his first year. Mr. Trump already faces a difficult dynamic on Capitol Hill as he struggles to push through a major overhaul of the nation\u2019s health care system that is already dividing the   Congress. To overcome that intraparty opposition  \u2014   not to mention the hostility to his health care plan from Democrats  \u2014   Mr. Trump will need to woo the very Republicans who are increasingly growing weary of defending his online assertions. In the days since Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on March 4, the White House has offered a series of shifting response, explanations and clarifications, some of which have been in conflict with each other. Democrats have been particularly aggressive in assailing the president and his staff. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, said Wednesday that if no evidence emerged to substantiate his claim, Mr. Trump should \u201cexplain himself. \u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t level an accusation of that type without retracting it or explaining just why it was done,\u201d he said. Mr. Nunes and Mr. Schiff said the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, would testify Monday at the committee\u2019s first public hearing on its Russian interference investigation. Mr. Comey could presumably resolve the question about the wiretap. Mr. Schiff also challenged the statements of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, who had said that while he was not aware of any investigation targeting Mr. Trump, the president spoke accurately when he said he had been wiretapped by Mr. Obama. \u201cThose two things cannot both be true unless he is suggesting that the F. B. I. was engaged in a rogue operation unsupervised by a court to wiretap Trump Tower,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence of that and no suggestion of any evidence of that. \u201d As part of the F. B. I. \u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the election, agents are looking at whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates colluded with the Russian government. After Mr. Trump made the claim on Twitter that Mr. Obama had tapped his telephone, Mr. Comey asked the Justice Department to make a statement disputing Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion. So far the Justice Department has refused to say publicly whether it went to a judge to get a secret warrant to eavesdrop on Mr. Trump, putting the department in a difficult position. Silence from the Justice Department has frustrated Mr. Comey. If the Justice Department says there was no wiretap, it undercuts the president\u2019s accusation. If there was a wiretap, it suggests that F. B. I. agents and federal prosecutors had probable cause to believe that Mr. Trump the candidate was operating as an agent of a foreign power. It is not clear why Mr. Trump thought he was wiretapped or what led him to make the claim, which was flatly rejected by James R. Clapper Jr. a former director of national intelligence, and by a spokesman for Mr. Obama. Mr. Graham and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, asked the F. B. I. last week for copies of any warrant applications and court orders \u201crelated to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump campaign or Trump Tower. \u201d Mr. Graham said Wednesday afternoon that the F. B. I. had offered to respond to the letter from him and Mr. Whitehouse in a classified briefing. Mr. Comey met behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Grassley, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.'"}, "time": 1742562118.693709}
