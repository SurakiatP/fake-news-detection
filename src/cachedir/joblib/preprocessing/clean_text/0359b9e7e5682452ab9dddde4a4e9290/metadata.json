Because nothing says women\u2019s rights like a Sharia law activist in a hijab,\u201d proclaimed MILO ironically. \u201cSeriously, this is how stupid liberals are. \u201d   \u201cHow did women become so insane, that they\u2019d march with Muslims and talk about how terrible it is to be a woman in America? They all stopped at Starbucks before marching too. Starbucks that cost more than many women on earth make in a week,\u201d he continued. \u201cLinda isn\u2019t a pretty woman, look at that schnozz, and that jaw line! Plus she has the little smirk Muslim women always have when they are pulling the wool over the eyes of western civilization. I always argue against the full burka but she could use one. \u201d \u201cYou see a lot of masculine jaw lines, especially on young female journalists,\u201d MILO concluded. \u201cSome of them are trannies of course so the jawline make sense, but others have it due to heightened levels of testosterone typically driven by aggressive masculine postures. Activists are pushy, and that raises testosterone. \u201d Written from prepared remarks. Milo wears tan shirt by UNCL, $55. White women\u2019s suit jacket by Calvin Klein, $60. White jeans by Robin, $550. Limited edition Timberlands, $180. Louis Vuitton belt, $350. Silver Versace shades, $340. Chains and pearls, too much to count.
