He spoke to his congregants about a tragedy many of them, including his daughter, had witnessed eight months earlier in the Florida sky: the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Rabbi Berger focused on one particular detail, the revelation that Challenger\u2019s seven astronauts had remained alive for the   fall to the ocean. He called the homily \u201cFive Minutes to Live,\u201d and he likened the crew members to Jews, who are called during the High Holy Days to engage in the process of \u201cheshbon \u201d Hebrew for taking stock of one\u2019s soul. \u201cCan you imagine knowing that in a few moments death was imminent?\u201d Rabbi Berger said at the Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Tampa, Fla. \u201cWhat would we think of if, God forbid, you and I were in such circumstances? What would go through our mind?\u201d Not quite three years later, Rabbi Berger was on a flight to Chicago from Denver returning from a family vacation. The plane\u2019s tail engine exploded en route, crippling the controls, and for 40 minutes, the passengers prepared for a crash landing. The rabbi\u2019s wife, Aviva, fainted from the shock. Rabbi Berger reached across the seats and gathered the hands of his daughter Avigail, 16, and son Jonathan, 9, trying to reassure them, Avigail would later recall. The plane burst into flames after it hit the ground in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 people, including the rabbi and his wife, both in their early 40s. As Jews enter the Days of Awe, which begin at sundown on Sunday, Rabbi Berger\u2019s sermon on the Challenger has achieved a piercing and eerie kind of immortality. Between its eloquence and its prophecy, \u201cFive Minutes to Live\u201d continues to be cited, written about and delivered as a tribute, especially during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. Both the sermon\u2019s theme and its presentiment of the rabbi\u2019s death resonate with the theological essence of the High Holy Days. In his sermon, Rabbi Berger plucked several   sentences of the liturgy, rearranging them for heightened effect: \u201cWho shall live and who shall die? Who shall attain the measure of a man\u2019s days and who shall not? On Rosh Hashana, it is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur, it is sealed. \u201d \u201cPeople are hungry for guidance in living a life that matters,\u201d said Rabbi Edward Bernstein of Temple Torat Emet in Boynton Beach, Fla. \u201cRabbi Berger, in his words, inspired people to action. And his death made those words holy. \u201d Judaism is hardly unique among world religions in urging its believers to undertake a moral inventory. Catholics participate in confession, formally called the sacrament of reconciliation, while Muslims call the process of repentance by the Arabic word \u201ctawbah,\u201d which means \u201cturning back. \u201d What is unusual in the American Jewish idiom is that heshbon   is addressed by rabbis on the two holidays each year when synagogue attendance grows exponentially. Mindful of another autumn ritual, Rabbi Berger called it \u201cthe World Series. \u201d Kenneth Berger, who grew up in suburban Philadelphia, was ordained by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and took on the pulpit of Rodeph Sholom in 1983. There he made his reputation as a trusted confidant for congregants in crises who could also   into donning a Big Bird costume to entertain the children. He boiled down Judaic erudition to aphorisms like \u201cThere\u2019s no roof overhead unless you build it. \u201d Invariably chewing a straw and clutching a pen, he drafted his sermons on a yellow legal pad, and then read them over the phone to his father in Pennsylvania. When the rabbi\u2019s words really connected to his synagogue audience, he would permit himself a brief moment of ego, telling his children, \u201cI hit a home run. \u201d On Sept. 16, 1986, the day Rabbi Berger delivered \u201cFive Minutes to Live,\u201d the Challenger tragedy was fresh in the minds of his congregants. From that shared memory, Rabbi Berger extrapolated in both prosaic and profound directions. He touched on the ordinary ways that people forget to express love for their families, blithely assuming there will always be another day. He recounted the story of a Jewish father, facing imminent death during the Holocaust, who bestowed a final kiss on the young son he was sending away to safety. \u201cThat scene still haunts me,\u201d Rabbi Berger said as the sermon closed, returning to the Challenger. \u201cThe explosion and then five minutes. If only I  \u2026     If only I  \u2026     And then the capsule hits the water, it\u2019s all over. Then you realize it\u2019s all the same  \u2014   five minutes, five days, 50 years. It\u2019s all the same, for it\u2019s over before we realize. \u201c\u2018If only I knew\u2019  \u2014   yes, my friends, it may be the last time. \u2018If only I realized\u2019  \u2014   yes, stop, appreciate the blessings you have. \u2018If only I could\u2019  \u2014   you still can, you\u2019ve got today. \u201d After Rabbi Berger and his wife died on July 19, 1989, his brother Samuel and    Trisanne stepped in to take care of the family. The rabbi\u2019s middle child, Ilana, then 13, had been at camp at the time of the crash. Avigail spent a month in a coma from her injuries, awakening to the absence of her mother or father at her bedside. Jonathan suffered lesser injuries. Samuel Berger found the text for \u201cFive Minutes to Live\u201d while cleaning out his brother\u2019s office. The sermon made its way to Avigail, who laminated it and keeps it in her jewelry box. The sermon also took on its public life. Rabbi Michael Swarttz of Temple B\u2019nai Shalom in Braintree, Mass. quoted large portions of it in his homily on Yom Kippur in 1989. Rabbi Larry Pinsker of Congregation Beit Tikvah in Baltimore assembled a \u201cbook of remembrance\u201d about Rabbi Berger, in which many contributors mentioned the sermon. Rabbi Mel Glazer of Colorado Springs, Colo. included part of the sermon in his 2013 book, \u201cA GPS for Grief and Healing. \u201d Twice in the last two years, Rabbi Bernstein in Florida has referred to \u201cFive Minutes to Live\u201d in online essays  \u2014   one on the 30th anniversary of the Challenger tragedy, the other after the mysterious disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines flight in 2014 over the Indian Ocean. \u201cI find it in hindsight even more moving than when I heard it,\u201d said Marty Solomon, who was president of Rodeph Sholom in 1986. \u201cAs much as anything else, it\u2019s a living legacy from Kenny. It\u2019s universal and it will be forever. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562286.752659}
