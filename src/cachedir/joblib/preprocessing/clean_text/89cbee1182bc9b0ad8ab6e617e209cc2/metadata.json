Sunday, on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAM Joy,\u201d talk show host Jerry Springer suggested that White House Chief Strategist and former Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon \u201chas a philosophical goal\u201d to \u201cdo away with a multicultural America,\u201d which is why he and President Donald Trump go after the courts and the media.  \u201cBannon has a philosophical goal, and that is, as I said before, to do away with a multicultural America. He wants America to be basically Christian and white. So keep out the Mexicans, keep out the Muslims, etc. ,\u201d Springer explained. The \u201cJerry Springer Show\u201d host also said Twitter is like a \u201cdrug\u201d for the president. \u201c[Trump] can\u2019t get the mainstream media, because obviously, they won\u2019t respect him,\u201d Springer added. \u201cSo, therefore, he goes to the things he can control. That\u2019s the tabloid journalism or the Twitter account. So, Trump gets his drug, and Bannon gets the goal of doing away with mainstream media. \u201d Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo'"}, "time": 1742563103.4624424}
