He even shared his bows with the other cast members also exiting the show, including Phillipa Soo and the Tony winner Leslie Odom Jr. But then the theme song to \u201cThe West Wing\u201d kicked in from the orchestra pit. Mr. Miranda giggled and took a couple of shy bows, only to turn around and be embraced then pushed back to the front of the stage by Christopher Jackson, who plays George Washington, for a proper bow. Still, the curtain call lasted no more than two and a half minutes, despite fervent applause, which had been consistent throughout the night. The opening number received multiple standing ovations, as did many others. But Mr. Miranda and other performers would pause for only a minute each time before moving the show forward. Afterward, in the pouring rain, hundreds and hundreds of fans filled West 46th Street, waiting for Mr. Miranda to emerge from the stage door at the Richard Rodgers Theater. Instead, Mr. Miranda appeared, \u201cEvita\u201d  on a balcony atop the theater\u2019s marquee. Holding an umbrella and waving to fans, he paced from one side of the marquee to the other, occasionally stopping to hold his left hand over his heart to show gratitude. Then he was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s over, folks,\u201d a police officer yelled as he tried to keep the crowd out of the street. \u201cThere\u2019s no more. \u201d Despite the rain, many people were reluctant to leave, greeting other cast members at the stage door and holding out for another possible appearance by Mr. Miranda. Inside, he had gotten his hair cut, now that he no longer needed it long for the role. Fans had begun to wait for him much earlier in the day. An hour before the 8 p. m. curtain, hundreds of people flanked the stage door to watch cast members and V. I. P.s come and go, and others stood across the street. Many didn\u2019t even have tickets. \u201cHamilton\u201d merchandise abounded:   posters and even a woman\u2019s clutch that read \u201cTalk Less,\u201d the advice Aaron Burr gives Hamilton throughout the show. Around 7:10 p. m. Ms. Soo  \u2014   who plays Hamilton\u2019s wife, Eliza  \u2014   entered through the stage door, escorted by her fianc\u00e9, the actor Steven Pasquale. He later walked out and approached a police officer, Mike Sullivan, who was standing near the box office and has been assigned to the theater\u2019s block for six years. \u201cThank you for everything,\u201d Mr. Pasquale said to him. Mr. Sullivan shook his hand, smiled and said, \u201cOf course. \u201d Nearby, at the front of the   line, was a family of four from Florida. They had bought their tickets in February when their daughters, Katie and Sarah Lafferty, fell in love with the cast recording. And their father, Mike, expected the show to be good, he said, because \u201cthe first lady says it\u2019s the best art she\u2019s ever seen in her life. \u201d So Mr. Lafferty looked ahead at a   block of tickets. This weekend just happened to be the cheapest option. Not so much for recent ticket buyers. Clara Lacey, a    from Los Angeles, flew to New York to see Mr. Miranda\u2019s final performance, and her family bought her a single ticket just a few hours before the show. They paid about $1, 500. Once the house opened at 7:30 p. m. winners of the \u201cHamilton\u201d ticket lottery  \u2014   a small number of coveted $10 seats are distributed through an online system  \u2014   could claim their prizes. Among them were a young actress, Haleigh Ciel, and her friend Byron Chang. Like many of the other winners, they were excited to have finally won and gotten a chance to see Broadway\u2019s hottest show. But they had no idea this was Mr. Miranda\u2019s farewell. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Ms. Ciel said. \u201cNow I feel so incredibly honored. \u201d Others did know, and they were understandably excited for the night. Michelle Foronjy, who works at a Toyota dealership on Long Island, said she screamed when she found out that she had won the lottery and expected to be squeezing her boyfriend\u2019s hand with excitement all night. She was still holding on to him as they left the theater. Celebrities came through the box office doors at a steady pace. Jennifer Lopez, who recently collaborated with Mr. Miranda on a benefit song to aid those affected by the Orlando massacre, attracted attention with the flashes of paparazzi, as did John Kerry with his security detail. (Abigail, a   dog, noticed them but seemed unfazed.) Spike Lee came for his eighth \u201cHamilton\u201d performance. Mariska Hargitay showed up for the 10th time. No one seemed as devoted as Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who said this was her 24th time, including performances Off Broadway at the Public Theater. Ms. O\u2019Donnell lamented the cast departures, and Ms. Hargitay in particular was preparing for an emotional evening of saying goodbye to Mr. Odom. \u201cThere are going to be a lot of tears,\u201d she said. \u201cOh no, I\u2019m starting to cry just saying that. \u201d Among the stragglers was Charlie Rose, as well as two young women  \u2014   one of whom, as she was walking through the lobby doors, looked at her ticket and said, \u201cThese aren\u2019t great seats. \u201d Her companion replied: \u201cWho cares? We get to see it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562066.869687}
