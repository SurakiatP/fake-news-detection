First it was with respect to Russian interference. They tried to deny  \u2014   the Trump folks did, that Russia was behind this, now they\u2019ve been forced to admit that. Then they tried to say that it was not for the purposes of trying to help Donald Trump, they were just trying to sow confusion and they were targeting both sides. And now, folks in the government have concluded that it was actually to try to tip the election Donald Trump\u2019s way. And now, with respect to the FBI, we see that Jim Comey\u2019s actions are sufficiently questionable that the internal watchdog at DOJ thinks that they merit an independent review. So, I think Donald Trump is just trying to cling to whatever legitimacy still is in effect here. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563184.2445}
