It is yet another example of the agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. And they are now aiming children. Last year, I published an article entitled The Agenda Behind Bruce Jenner\u2019s Transformation where I explained how Jenner\u2019s sex change was intentionally publicized and celebrated because it was part of a larger agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. This agenda is even more obvious and insidious this year because there\u2019s a conscious effort to reach children. A child with the word \u2018Transgender\u2019 stamped across the screen. This sums up what mass media has been about these past years. Click to enlarge Although \u2018Amy\u2019 is played by an actress, the story claims that she used to be boy named Ben. Click to enlarge CBBC\u2019s series Just a Girl is the latest baffling attempt at normalizing, trivializing and even celebrating the completely unnecessary process that is childhood sex change. Freely available online on CBBC\u2019s website, the series even teaches children about taking hormones and puberty-halting drugs. Do we truly know the effects of such drugs on one\u2019s developing body and brain chemistry. Of course not. Why is this radical and aberrant process promoted to children? Do children need to know about hormone blockers? AND WHERE ARE THE PARENTS?! Click to enlarge In my humble opinion, parents who subject their children to radical treatments such as hormone blockers and sex change surgery should be trialed for child abuse. Instead, these things are actually encouraged in shows aimed at children and society is following suit. Some NHS clinics (such as the Tavistock Centre in North London) have been prescribing hypothalamic blockers to children as young as nine. In another case, such as a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother\u2019s care as \u2018she was raising him as female\u2019. This is what the elite wants to see: Confused children wondering if they should change sex. HOW ABOUT YOU GO OUTSIDE AND RIDE A BIKE OR SOMETHING? Here are quotes taken from Just a Girl . In Just A Girl, Amy says: \u2018When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.\u2019 She adds: \u2018My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn\u2019t going to come to school in boys\u2019 clothes any more, but girls\u2019 clothes. I wasn\u2019t Ben, I was Amy.\u2019 Later Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh \u2013 a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl \u2013 that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took \u2018ages\u2019 to get them after \u2018loads of tests and talks at the clinic\u2019. \u2018Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,\u2019 she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: \u2018Liam thinks I\u2019m just a girl, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m trans. And what\u2019s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I\u2019m still me, aren\u2019t I?\u2019 This last bit appears to be taken straight from a neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) handbook. The goal: To confuse young minds about sex and gender.
