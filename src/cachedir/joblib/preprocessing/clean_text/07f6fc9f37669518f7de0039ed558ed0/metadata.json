[1] \\nIts prevalence is indicative of the significant price Americans pay for pain \u2014 it\u2019s a leading cause of disability and major contributor to health care expenses and disability compensation. \\nAlso revealing, people suffering from pain were significantly more likely to have used a complementary health approach compared to people without pain \u2014 nearly 42 percent versus 24 percent, respectively. \\nThe reason wasn\u2019t addressed by the study, but time and again, conventional medicine fails to relieve many people\u2019s pain. \\nCongressional testimony from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) stated that Americans consume 80 percent of the pain pills in the world, [2] and in a survey of more than 2,000 pain patients in the U.S., most said they were taking a dangerously addictive opioid pain medication. [3] \\nResearch suggests, however, that these drugs work for only about three months, after which changes in your brain may lead to increased feelings of pain along with added emotional upset, including feelings of hopelessness and desperation. [4] \\nMany pain sufferers have tried virtually every treatment that conventional medicine has to offer \u2014 medications, injections, surgery and more \u2014 only to find that their pain hasn\u2019t gotten better and they may be struggling with treatment-induced side effects as well (one of the worst of which is opioid addiction ). \\nAt that point (and for many far sooner), it\u2019s only natural that you would begin to seek other options, which brings many people to holistic, complementary or \u201calternative\u201d health care options for relief. Science-Backed Natural Pain Relief Options \\nA recent study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings evaluated several complementary approaches for pain relief. [5] The options that follow have been scientifically proven to help with relief, according to the report. \\nAcupuncture \\nOne of the most common uses for acupuncture is in treating chronic pain. One analysis of the most robust studies available concluded that acupuncture has a clear effect in reducing chronic pain, more so than standard pain treatment. [6] \\nStudy participants receiving acupuncture reported an average 50 percent reduction in pain, compared to a 28 percent pain reduction for standard pain treatment without acupuncture. It\u2019s likely that acupuncture works via a variety of mechanisms. \\nIn 2010, for instance, it was found that acupuncture activates pain-suppressing receptors and increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter adenosine in local tissues [7] (adenosine slows down your brain\u2019s activity and induces sleepiness). \\nMassage Therapy \\nA systematic review and meta-analysis, published in the journal Pain Medicine, included 60 high-quality and seven low-quality studies that looked into the use of massage for various types of pain, including muscle and bone pain, headaches, deep internal pain, fibromyalgia pain and spinal cord pain. [8] \\nThe review revealed that massage therapy relieves pain better than getting no treatment at all. \\nRelaxation Techniques \\nBreathing exercises, guided imagery, meditation and other relaxation techniques may provide relief, especially from pain from tension headaches and migraines. \\nResearch by an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Herbert Benson, found that people who practice relaxation methods such as yoga and meditation long-term have more disease-fighting genes switched \u201con\u201d and active, including genes that protect against pain and rheumatoid arthritis. [9] \\nExercise \\nAmong people who had experienced back pain , those who exercised had a 25 percent to 40 percent lower risk of having another episode within a year than those who did no exercise. [10] \\nStrength exercises, aerobics, flexibility training and stretching were all beneficial in lowering the risk of back pain. \\nMotor control exercises (MCE), which help to improve coordination of muscles that support your spine,11 may also help. One systematic review found MCE led to reductions in pain and disability and improvements in perceived quality of life compared with minimal intervention. [12] \\nYoga , which is particularly useful for promoting flexibility and core muscles, has also been proven to be beneficial if you suffer from back pain. \\nPeople suffering from low back pain who took one yoga class a week had greater improvements in function than those receiving medicine or physical therapy. [13] The Yoga Journal has an online page demonstrating specific poses that may be helpful. [14] \\nMedical Marijuana \\nThere are cannabinoid receptors in your brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, immune system and more. Both the therapeutic and psychoactive properties of marijuana occur when a cannabinoid activates a cannabinoid receptor. \\nResearch is still ongoing on just how extensive their impact is on our health, but to date it\u2019s known that cannabinoid receptors play an important role in many body processes, including metabolic regulation, cravings, pain, anxiety, bone growth and immune function. [15] \\nSome of the strongest research to date is focused on marijuana for pain relief. In one study, just three puffs of marijuana a day for five days helped those with chronic nerve pain to relieve pain and sleep better. [16] \\nAlso revealing, in states where medical marijuana is legal, overdose deaths from opioids like morphine, oxycodone and heroin decreased by an average of 20 percent after one year, 25 percent after two years and 33 percent by years five and six. [17] Turmeric for Pain Relief \\nTurmeric was once most known for being a flavorful and colorful addition to curry, but in the scientific world, turmeric has earned a reputation for being a multi-faceted healer. Turmeric contains curcumin, which has notable anti-inflammatory properties. \\nIt can inhibit both the activity and the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX), as well as other enzymes that have been implicated in inflammation. \\nA 2006 study found that a turmeric extract composed of curcuminoids (curcumin is the most investigated curcuminoid) blocked inflammatory pathways, effectively preventing the launch of a protein that triggers swelling and pain. [18] \\nTurmeric has been found to significantly improve post-operative pain and fatigue, [19] and in a study of osteoarthritis patients, those who added only 200 milligrams (mg) of curcumin a day to their treatment plan had reduced pain and increased mobility. \\nTime magazine even published the story of one doctor who marveled at one of his older hip patient\u2019s lack of pain and remarkably swift recovery from surgery. The patient took turmeric regularly, and the results so impressed the physician that he began taking the supplement himself. [20] Essential Oils for Pain Relief \\nEssential oils are concentrated, aromatic plant extracts that have been used for thousands of years for emotional, cosmetic, medical and even spiritual purposes. One of their most popular uses is also for relief of chronic and acute pain. \\nThere are a number of ways to use essential oils , including via aromatherapy. Lavender aromatherapy, for instance, has been shown to lessen pain following needle insertion [21] while green apple scent significantly relieves migraine pain . Other essential oils noted for pain relief, including relief from joint pain, include: [22] Lavender'"}, "time": 1742562128.1388323}
