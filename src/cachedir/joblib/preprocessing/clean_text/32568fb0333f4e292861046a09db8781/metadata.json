Hinton was touring the renovations of the future Outsiders House museum. The rundown Craftsman bungalow was where the Curtis brothers  \u2014   Darry, Sodapop and Ponyboy  \u2014   lived in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie based on Ms. Hinton\u2019s book \u201cThe Outsiders. \u201d The book, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, was arguably one of the most influential young adult books of its time, and leading this tour was the   fanboy Danny O\u2019Connor, 48, who made his own contribution to   history as a member of the 1990s   group House of Pain. Mr. O\u2019Connor, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif. bought the Outsiders House for $15, 000 in 2016, determined to turn it into a museum. During the recent tour, Mr. O\u2019Connor was showing Ms. Hinton a   hard cover of \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d pointing out a wide paper sash wrapped around the jacket that read in bright orange, \u201cA remarkable novel about teenagers, for teenagers, by a teenager. \u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor has been on a quest to find artifacts to include in the museum, amassing a collection of memorabilia from the movie, vintage photographs and    editions of the book. Next on his search list, he told Ms. Hinton, 68, was a   tub like the one    Rob Lowe (Sodapop Curtis in the movie) stepped out of with just a towel wrapped around his waist. \u201cAll the girls love that scene,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said. No matter that the book is 50 years old, or that the movie was filmed in this part of town more than three decades ago. Once you\u2019re a fan of \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d you\u2019re always a fan of \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d which is why when Mr. O\u2019Connor posted about the tub on Facebook, it was shared over 220 times. Soon there will be a tub. Since \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d was first published in 1967, over 15 million copies have been sold. It is a constant on   and   reading lists and has been translated into 30 languages. Fanfiction. net counts 8, 100 stories based on the book. The hashtag #staygold, which is inspired by a Robert Frost poem that appears in the book, is attached to more than 300, 000 Instagram posts. Search the internet for \u201cstay gold\u201d and you\u2019ll find both the name of a cafe on the Jersey Shore and a Swedish rock band\u2019s debut album. Ms. Hinton fields daily questions on Twitter from fans who ask, \u201cWhat do you think when people say \u2018Stay golden\u2019 instead of \u2018Stay gold\u2019?\u201d (Answer: It makes her cringe.) That \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d has permeated the culture so deeply is still somewhat surreal to even Ms. Hinton. \u201cThe rest of my books I wrote, but \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 was meant to be written. I got chosen to write it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I can deal with it. \u201d Ms. Hinton, who still lives in Tulsa, goes by Susie. In 1966, Ms. Hinton\u2019s editor, Velma Varner, suggested she use her   initials out of concern that her given name, Susan Hinton, would \u201cthrow some of the boy readers off. \u201d She continued to use the initials, even in more recent publications. When Ms. Hinton was 16, after failing creative writing in her junior year of high school, she wrote \u201cThe Outsiders. \u201d The teacher who failed her was not happy that Ms. Hinton liked to mention this in every interview. She sold the book when she was 17. It was published when she turned 18. It has, quite literally, always been part of her life. For Ms. Hinton, the book is something of a time capsule of her own emotionally driven teenage angst. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it still resonates with teens, because they feel like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYour feelings are over the top. You\u2019re feeling and seeing injustice, and you\u2019re standing up against it. \u201d In \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d justice comes by way of class warfare between the greasers, a gang of poor teenage boys, and the Socs, the rich kids from the other side of town. What may be most remarkable about the greasers is their ability to show great affection and emotion despite the   cultural norm of the 1960s. In almost every chapter, someone is crying or on the verge of tears. \u201cYou\u2019d be   to find a book where boys are this emotional,\u201d said Daniel Kraus, books for youth editor at Booklist, a review magazine published by the American Library Association. \u201cThey\u2019re crying, they\u2019re embracing, they\u2019re holding each other in bed. \u201d This adds to the greaser mythology, Mr. Kraus said. Jennifer Buehler, an English education professor at St. Louis University, believes that the greasers\u2019 experience, and their need to be seen as human, is similar to what many marginalized groups today are also trying to claim. \u201cThe fact that the character development is so strong in this book plays a crucial part in its power and its enduring relevance,\u201d she said. While Professor Buehler believes other factors contribute to the book\u2019s endurance  \u2014   the universal title and the seemingly genderless author  \u2014   she credits librarians and teachers for supporting the book from the start. In 1988, an influential award further cemented the canonical status of the book, she said, when it received the first Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults. \u201cSo even though \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 was 21 years old, and the movie had some life, there\u2019s something about that literary award from the world of librarians and library service that helped teachers along their way. \u201d For fans, it seems, the book\u2019s longevity is based on its relationships. Recently, the connection between Johnny Cade and Dallas Winston spawned a subset of fan fiction called slash, in which two male (or two female) characters are involved romantically. Some fans on Twitter in October became confrontational when Ms. Hinton disagreed with their interpretation that the relationship between Johnny and Dallas was a romantic one. \u201cI have no problem with anyone interpreting my books anyway they want,\u201d Ms. Hinton said. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting these letters that are, \u2018Just say you wrote it gay and I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u2019 Well, your satisfaction isn\u2019t at the top of my priorities. Fifteen years old in Tulsa, Okla? The word was not even in common use. So, no. \u201d It\u2019s possible that this new shift is simply an additional sign that \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d continues to influence young readers. That after five decades, it shows no indication of becoming dated. \u201cI\u2019m as amazed as anybody else that it\u2019s lasted as long,\u201d Ms. Hinton said. \u201cSo many people say to me after reading it, \u2018I\u2019m looking at people differently now than I used to,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s all quit judging each other. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628533.902561}
