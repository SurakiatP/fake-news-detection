The American Hair Loss Association notes that women, as well, experience hair loss, as a result of a number of different causes. As a result of these reasons, treatment for hair loss in women is not as readily available as it is for men. \\nTo remedy this, many individuals have turned to home remedies to prevent and treat hair loss, with varying results. One that has caught the attention of both hair loss patients and researchers in the past 20 years is the use of guava leaves. The sweet fruit, native to Mexico, Central and South America is a nutritious and delicious fruit that is increasingly being called a superfood because of it\u2019s incredible contents and components. Why Guava Leaves for Hair Loss? \\nGuava leaf is extremely high in a variety of different types of vitamin B, including many of the nutrients needed for hair health. Thiamine: A deficiency of thiamine, or vitamin B1, can lead to hair loss , so it\u2019s important to make sure that your diet for healthy hair includes thiamine. It\u2019s a water-soluble vitamin that is included in many different hair products to maximize absorption in the scalp. Riboflavin: Vitamin B2 or riboflavin, is a building block vitamin that finds and repairs damaged cells, including the DNA that causes hair to thin and fall out. Cooking riboflavin can damage some of it\u2019s health benefits, so it\u2019s important to include the cooking fluid when using this vitamin for hair health. Niacin: Vitamin B3 helps to convert food into energy, and helps to increase the blood flow to the scalp and provide better nutrient and oxygen flow to the scalp. It enhances circulation and improves the structure and shape of the blood cells. Folate: Folic acid, or vitamin B9, can cause hair loss in individuals who are deficient in the nutrient. It also helps to form red blood cells. Pantothenic acid: A lack of vitamin B5 can cause hair loss by weakening the hair follicles. When you have enough, your scalp can help the follicles work properly, relieve the flaking and itching that come along with dandruff, and can encourage new hair growth. Pyridoxine: Vitamin B6 is vital for converting testosterone into the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that attacks hair follicles. A deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause an increase in DHT and can cause hair loss. Vitamin A: This fat-soluble antioxidant protects hair follicles from damage done by free radicals, and helps cells reproduce \u2014 including the cells necessary for hair growth and maintenance. Deficiencies can cause your hair to become dry and brittle, and may be the reason for hair breaking at the ends or roots. Antimicrobial benefits: Guava leaves have been shown to have many different antimicrobial properties that can help to combat any infections or skin conditions that can cause hair loss. They clear up the remnants of the bacteria on the scalp and help to heal the skin, which allows healthy hair to grow. \\nGuava, also known as guyaba, also has high levels of vitamin C \u2014 more than in most citrus fruits. It\u2019s got a rich content of flavonoids, like quercetin, polyphenols, and other important plant chemicals. It is often made into jams and jellies a process made easier because of the high levels of pectin, a dietary fiber, that may play a role in root hair growth and cellular function. Other Health Benefits of Guava Leaves: Diabetes: In east Asia, individuals are using guava leaves to treat diabetes due to the anti-hyperglycemic properties of the extract. In Japan, for example, Guava Leaf Tea, or Bansoureicha, has been approved as a Food for Specified Health Use and is commercially available to help individuals lower elevated blood glucose, along with other conditions. The approval in Japan took place in 2000 as a result of several studies showing the ability of the Guava Leaf Tea to effectively help to combat high blood glucose and sugar intake for individuals with Type 2 diabetes or experiencing pre-diabetic symptoms. High Cholesterol: A 1993 study shows that in a single-blind trial, 145 men ate a similar diet, with 72 taking a soluble fiber and increased-potassium diet that included guava. Following four months of monitoring, the individuals who consumed the guava experienced a reduced blood pressure and decrease in calcium and triglycerides. As a result of the high potassium and soluble fiber content of guava, the fruit may be an effective way to lower high blood pressure and blood lipids. Diarrhea: In some studies , guava has been shown to block some of the pathogens that cause diarrhea. While there hasn\u2019t been extensive research done and published in peer-reviewed journals, there is some evidence that guava leaf extract has helped to improve the number of daily stools, the duration, pain, and spasms in patients with infantile viral enteritis. It\u2019s believed that the components of guava leaf can smooth muscle fibers, which prevents the movement of the intestines and capillary permeability. Other health benefits: Many claims and studies have been done that show at least some positive effect in everything from weight loss and metastatic cancers to staph infections and common colds. Again, extensive research hasn\u2019t been conducted, but these early studies show that there is at least some connection between guava leaves and improved health.
