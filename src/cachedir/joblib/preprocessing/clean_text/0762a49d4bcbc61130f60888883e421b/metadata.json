I won\u2019t make a big to-do about it since I\u2019m willing to wager most folks don\u2019t remember me anyway. All you have to know is that I\u2019m an Atheist and a fiscally conservative, socially liberal Republican who detests the Tea Party with a fiery passion. I don\u2019t always agree with full-fledged conservatives or liberals, but I do believe we can at least tolerate each other just enough to live side-by-side. \\nSo, what brings me back after such a long absence? Believe it or not it\u2019s not politics. It\u2019s something I hold even more close to my heart: my aforementioned Atheism. See, I stumbled upon this article here courtesy of the kind folks at TodayChristian.net . It\u2019s appropriately titled \u201c10 Questions For Every Atheist\u201d and was posted on their web site back in July with the subheading \u201cSome Questions Atheist Cannot Truly and Honestly REALLY Answer! Which leads to some interesting conclusions?\u201d. \\nLook, I won\u2019t lie. I stopped reading right there. I mean\u2026some questions Atheist (not Atheist s , mind you) cannot truly and honestly REALLY (for added emphasis) answer? Interesting conclusions? In the words of my generation, \u201cChallenge accepted!\u201d I decided I was going to respond right then, right there. Game on. Without any further delay, let\u2019s get on with it\u2026 \\nQuestion #1: How Did You Become an Atheist? \\nRight off the bat we start with a question that no Atheist would have any trouble answering. Like me personally, I simply started thinking for myself around age 13; asking very serious, very real questions about the world we live in. Would an all-merciful god allow children to go hungry? Would an all-powerful god allow innocent people be tortured and killed? Soon I discovered that I had quite a few questions and no real answers. \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d, \u201cThy will be done\u201d, \u201cGod will one day vanquish evil\u201d; these are not real answers. If it\u2019s any god\u2019s will for the world to be as horrible as it is and has been, then I wouldn\u2019t believe in it even if I knew it existed. That would be like having a sports hero you discovered was a child pornographer. Any decent human being would stop believing in that hero. \\nQuestion #2: What happens when we die? \\nOur loved ones mourn while we are buried, burned or donated to science. We lose all of our senses, our ability to think. We cease to exist. It\u2019s a pretty scary thought. One that often quite literally makes me bolt up awake at night having to shake the thought off. The thought being, \u201cI am going to die one day and then that\u2019s it.\u201d Scary as it is, it makes me appreciate this life more even if I continue to only live it about a quarter of the way to its fullest. At least I\u2019m enjoying myself. \\nQuestion #3: What if you\u2019re wrong? And there is a Heaven? And there is a HELL! \\nThen I\u2019m wrong; and God is either all-merciful like religious folk claim or he/she/it is a total jerkass. I do like how \u201chell\u201d is in ALL CAPS in this question as if it\u2019s supposed to be scary, though. Cute. Also, the punctuation is wrong; and, you never start a sentence with \u201cand\u201d. \\nQuestion #4: Without God, where do you get your morality from? \\nEmpathy mainly. Empathy is a human trait, not a religious one. Logic is another source of my morality; as is reason. I\u2019d also like to point out that so far these are really easy to answer\u2026 \\nQuestion #5: If there is no God, can we do what we want? Are we free to murder and rape? While good deeds are unrewarded? \\nOkay, I first noticed this with Question #3: this is actually three questions in one which I think is cheating. Would it be so wrong for Today Christian to call this article \u201c 14 Questions For Every Atheist \u201c? It\u2019s like they chose 10 because it sounds stronger. Kind of sounds like the same reason why there are Ten Commandments . \\nEither way, let\u2019s start with the first one. We can do whatever we want within the confines of the law of the land. Man\u2019s law, that is. You\u2019ll notice that if I sleep with my neighbor\u2019s wife \u2013 which I might; I am a heathen , after all \u2013 I won\u2019t go to prison for it. Nor will I go to prison for looking at my buddy\u2019s PlayStation 4 and thinking, \u201cAw, I want one!\u201d \\nThe second one? I could cite the law answer again, but this question deserves a more human answer. What kind of monster wants to murder and rape people? Is your archaic book the only reason you don\u2019t murder and rape? Do you constantly have to fight those urges \u2013 only winning out when you spot your Holy Bible on the book shelf and remember that if you do those things you\u2019ll end up in hell? If the answer is no, then you wouldn\u2019t murder or rape people either. That\u2019s called humanity and \u2013 again \u2013 empathy . \\nFinally, \u201cWhile good deeds are unrewarded?\u201d If the only reason you do good is for a pat on the back and recognition, then you\u2019re not moral. You\u2019re a creep. A needy creep. \\nQuestion #6: If there is no god, how does your life have any meaning? \\nOur lives are defined by the good we do for others (with or without recognition, to reference the previous question), our families, our friends, etc. I don\u2019t need an invisible space daddy to tell me what my life means. I give my life meaning every day in one way or another. I want to be a writer who entertains people through literature, film, the occasionally whacky joke, etc. Making people laugh, smile, think, and the like \u2013 even if that dream fails \u2013 is the definition of my life. If I can make one person enjoy their day every day, then my life is complete. I did that. I gave it that meaning. By myself . I didn\u2019t even have an instruction book! You can\u2019t even put together IKEA furniture without an instruction book (and an AI helper, and a rocket ship, and a\u2026) and yet I\u2019ve figured out my life\u2019s meaning without one. \\nQuestions #7: Where did the universe come from? \\nWe don\u2019t know. That\u2019s something religion folks don\u2019t seem to understand. Saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d isn\u2019t an admission of defeat. We just don\u2019t know. Yet. Maybe we\u2019ll never know. There are brilliant minds working on it; but, until we have cold hard proof that a space magician created everything we aren\u2019t going to blindly believe it. There are theories. Quite a few of those theories are logical in a scientific sense. Will we ever prove it? That\u2019s a damn big thing to prove. That being said, only the biggest, most self-indulgent egomaniacs of the scientific community do what hardcore religious people do and say their theory is 100% for sure without being able to absolutely prove it time and time again. \u201cGod just went click\u201d is both simplistic and embarrassingly naive. I say that without trying to sound condescending. However, it\u2019s a simple case of \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d Or when I\u2019m otherwise able to verify it. \\nQuestion #8: What about miracles? What all the people who claim to have a connection with Jesus? What about those who claim to have seen saints or angels? \\nUgh! Another question that\u2019s actually three questions within a question. Okay, fine\u2026 You\u2019re aware mental illness is a thing? Okay, I\u2019ll be less jerk-ish. \\nThis makes me think of people who claim or are related to or otherwise know people who claim to have had a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d or NDE. The problem with that whole thing is that it\u2019s suspiciously similar to the effects the centrifuge test has on the men and women training to be astronauts or fighter pilots. Those folks experience the same visions \u2013 often of saints, angels, dead relatives, etc. NDE\u2019s are nothing more than the brain vividly hallucinating sights, sounds, and the \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d as blood rushes from the brain to other parts of the body as it struggles to both maintain equilibrium and struggle to keep living . \\nThrow in people who claim to see UFOs, Bigfoot, Slenderman, El Chupacabra, and Michael Bay\u2019s talent to this next part: some people make stuff up for attention. It\u2019s true. Or for financial gain. Or just for the goddamn fun of it. Dishonest people exist . Everywhere . \\nAs for people who claim to have a connection with Jesus? They\u2019re probably hearing voices in their head. That\u2019s mental illness . If a voice in my head tells me it\u2019s a good idea to go to a random child\u2019s birthday party, cold cock the clown in the chin, poo on the cake, and make love to the child\u2019s mother on the picnic table in front of the whole party, then I too would claim Jesus told me to do it since I? really wouldn\u2019t want to go to jail or the asylum . \\nTo wrap up Questions #8a, 8b, and 8c: miracles. Aren\u2019t those the same things that have become strangely scarce now that cameras and other recording devices exist? \\nQuestion #9: What\u2019s your view of Dawkins, Hitchens and Harris? \\nThey could be less militant. Look, my fellow heathens, I\u2019m a whole-hearted Atheist. I do not believe in any gods or supernatural beings of any kind and I fully understand the atrocities often carried out in the name of religion. That being said, I don\u2019t automatically leer down at those who are faithful. It\u2019s true that I used to leer down on people who were. That is until I was with my now ex-girlfriend (we broke up over stuff other than religion, mind you). She mellowed out my Atheism on account of the fact that she was raised Roman Catholic and still remained pretty spiritual in one sense or another as an adult while she also just happens (happened?) to be a wonderful person. Now, Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris (you\u2019ll notice I use the Oxford comma in my writings, but to each their own) are brilliant, funny, and kind of a jerk, respectively. I understand how militant Dawkins is and Hitchens was; but, I have a hard time believing that if a faithful person respectfully approached them as a human being and simply wanted a light, brief conversation that they\u2019d be or would have been anything but appreciative of the respect shown. Harris? Who knows? I think he\u2019s kind of a jerk. He\u2019s shown himself to be so in the past and I\u2019m not even talking about the Real Time thing with Ben Affleck . I don\u2019t think that he was behaving at all bigoted on that occasion. \\nQuestion #10: If there is no God, then why does every society have a religion? \\nBecause every society has roots that go back to a people who knew nothing and tried their best to explain things like fire, lightning, the sun, the moon, etc. That\u2019s how religion started: by people who knew nothing . That evolved (wink, wink) into people who wanted power which has now evolved (nudge, nudge) to people who want money; especially here in the United States. \\nThe Tea Party \u2013 which I will never be affiliated with despite being a Republican \u2013 is basically owned by people (namely the Kochs) who are using those people\u2019s faith as a method of moral, \u201cspiritual\u201d corruption. The Kochs and the politicians they own \u2013 which are voted into power by the people they control through this hysteria which is primarily faith-driven \u2013 don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s asshole about the well-being or happiness of the \u201cTea Patriots\u201d or \u201cTea Baggers\u201d or anyone for that matter. They wouldn\u2019t piss on you if you were on fire; mostly because they are working to privatize pissing on people who are on fire and they\u2019d really rather you paid for that service. \\nBy the way, ever noticed how each society\u2019s religion is different? That there is no single religion? It\u2019s almost as if each society made up their own shit along the way\u2026 \\nHere\u2019s My Final Thought \\nLook, being an Atheist isn\u2019t about being an elitist. Hell, Atheists all have different lifestyles, different hobbies, different daily routines, different tastes, preferences, opinions, political views, alignments; for Christ\u2019s sake we have different favorite movies, shows, musicians, genres, sexual positions, drugs, doctors, lawyers, ways to make fun of Michael Bay, etc. Atheism isn\u2019t a singular entity. It is a vast, diverse, wonderful place where all are welcome to discuss or even disagree so long as they discuss and disagree politely. \\nThe only thing all Atheist groups share is that we don\u2019t believe in god, the devil, Zeus, Odin, healing crystals, the medicinal uses of wind chimes or any of that stuff. We\u2019re happy to live peacefully with you if you\u2019re happy to live peacefully with us. The only reason Atheists tend to appear so combative is because pretty often? we are the ones under attack and so we are always on guard . Be it by the laws religious politicians push or name-calling on Facebook or willful ignorance about the state of the country and world or seeing good people suffer throughout the world we find ourselves and our views threatened simply because we choose not to worship on our knees. We choose instead to live on our feet. We help others not because we are told it is moral by a deity, but because we feel it\u2019s the right, just, human thing to do. \\nLet us know your thoughts at the Liberal America Facebook page .
