[They go right up to the line, trying not to cross it, by, for example, vamping with a realistic photo of a decapitated Trump or calling the president a \u201cpiece of s \u2014  \u201d while hosting a show on CNN.  The media are orchestrating a bloodless coup, but they\u2019re perfectly content to have their   shock troops pursue a bloody coup. This week, one of the left\u2019s foot soldiers gunned down Republican members of Congress and their staff while they were playing baseball in Virginia. Democratic Socialist James Hodgkinson was prevented from committing a mass murder only by the happenstance of a member of the Republican leadership being there, along with his   Capitol Police protection. Remember when it was frightening for the losing party not to accept the results of an election? During the third debate, Trump refused to   agree to the election results, saying he\u2019d \u201clook at it at the time. \u201d The media responded in their usual   style: A \u2018HORRIFYING\u2019 REPUDIATION OF DEMOCRACY  \u2014   The Washington Post, Oct. 20, 2016, DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY  \u2014   Daily News (New York) Oct. 20, 2016 DANGER TO DEMOCRACY  \u2014   The Dallas Morning News, Oct. 20, 2016, ONE SCARY MOMENT IT ALL BOILED DOWN TO   \u2026     DEMOCRACY  \u2014   Pittsburgh   Oct. 21, 2016, \u201c(Shock) spiked down the nation\u2019s spinal column last night and today when the Republican nominee threatened that this little election thing you got there, this little democratic process you\u2019ve got here, it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s fine, but he doesn\u2019t necessarily plan on abiding by its decision when it comes to the presidency. \u201d  \u2014   Rachel Maddow, Oct. 20, \u201cTrump\u2019s answer on accepting the outcome of the vote is the most disgraceful statement by a presidential candidate in 160 years. \u201d  \u2014   Bret Stephens,   editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal, \u201cI guess we\u2019re all going to have to wait until Nov. 9 to find out if we still have a country  \u2014   if Donald Trump is in the mood for a peaceful transfer of power. Or if he\u2019s going to wipe his fat a \u2014   with the Constitution. \u201d  \u2014   CBS\u2019s Stephen Colbert, Oct. 19, 2016, \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented for a nominee of a major party to themselves signal that they would not accept  \u2014   you know, respect the results of an election. We\u2019ve never had that happen before.   \u2026     This really presents a potentially difficult problem for governing   \u2026    \u201d  \u2014   MSNBC\u2019S Joy Reid, Oct. 22, 2016, \u201cThis is very dangerous stuff   \u2026     would seriously impair our functioning as a democracy.   \u2026     This is about as serious as it gets in the United States. \u201d  \u2014   CNN\u2019s Peter Beinart, Oct. 20, 2016, \u201cObviously, it\u2019s despicable for him to pretend that there\u2019s any chance that he would not accept the results of this election it would be  \u2014   in 240 years you\u2019ve never had anybody do it.   \u2026    \u201d  \u2014   CNN\u2019s Van Jones, Oct. 20, 2016, Then Trump won, and these very same hysterics refused to accept the results of the election. Recently, Hillary announced her steadfast opposition to the winning candidate using a military term, saying she\u2019d joined the \u201cResistance. \u201d Imagine if Trump lost and then announced that he\u2019d joined the \u201cRESISTANCE. \u201d He\u2019d be accused of trying to activate   militias. Every dyspeptic glance at an immigrant would be reported as fascistic violence. But the media seem blithely unaware that the   \u201cResistance\u201d has been accompanied by nonstop militaristic violence from liberals. When Trump ripped up our Constitution and jumped all over it by failing to concede the election three weeks in advance, CNN ran a segment on a single tweet from a random Trump supporter that mentioned the Second Amendment. Carol Costello: \u201cStill to come in the \u2018Newsroom,\u2019 some Trump supporters say they will refuse to accept a loss on Election Day, with one offering a threat of violence. We\u2019ll talk about that next. \u201d In CNN\u2019s most fevered dreams about a violent uprising of Trump supporters, they never could have conceived of the level of actual violence being perpetrated by Americans who refuse to accept Trump\u2019s win. (See Hate Map.) It began with Trump\u2019s inauguration, when a leftist group plotted to pump a debilitating gas into one Trump inaugural ball, military families were assaulted upon leaving the Veterans\u2019 Inaugural Ball, and attendees of other balls had water thrown on them. Since then, masked, armed liberals around the country have formed   organizations to beat up conservatives. In liberal towns, the police are regularly ordered to stand down to allow the assaults to proceed unimpeded. The media only declared a crisis when conservatives fought back, smashing the   beta males. (\u201cBattle for Berkeley! \u201d) There is more media coverage for conservatives\u2019 \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d toward powerful minorities   \u2014   such as using the wrong pronoun  \u2014   than there is for liberals\u2019 physical attacks on conservatives, including macings, concussions, and hospitalizations. And now some nut Bernie   confirms that it\u2019s Republicans standing on a baseball field, before opening fire. In the media\u2019s strategic reporting of the attempted slaughter, we were quickly told that the mass shooter was white, male and had used a gun. We were even told his name. (Because it was not \u201cMohammed. \u201d) But the fact that Hodgkinson\u2019s Facebook page featured a banner of Sanders and the words \u201cDemocratic Socialism explained in 3 words: \u2018We the People\u2019 Since 1776\u201d apparently called for hours of meticulous   by our media. Did reporters think they could keep that information from us forever? The fake news insists that Trump\u2019s White House is in \u201cchaos. \u201d No, the country is in chaos. But just like Kathy Griffin and her Trump decapitation performance art  \u2014   the perpetrators turn around in   innocence and blame Trump.'"}, "time": 1742562139.057924}
