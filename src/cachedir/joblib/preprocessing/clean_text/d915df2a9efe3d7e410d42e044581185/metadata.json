Take Ignatius J. Reilly\u2019s rejoinder to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway\u2019s \u201c5-point plan to defeat Islam,\u201d as Trump and his team conceived of it (and Juan Cole wrote of it): \\n\\nTouch\u00e9. \\nAnother point of contention on the comment boards last week had to do with how to evaluate WikiLeaks\u2019, and by extension Julian Assange\u2019s, latest release of documents in the Pedesta emails. Though some commentators like Naomi Klein and Glenn Greenwald have spoken up about particular aspects of WikiLeaks\u2019 current m.o., in the thread under Alexander Reed Kelly\u2019s Truthdigger of the Week column on Assange , reader JJG noted how, like him or not, Assange and his organization are providing a public service that professionals working in the mainstream press (who are supposed to be skilled in curating and redacting sensitive material) are not generally delivering on these days: \\n\\nWe\u2019ll give Opa Westphal the last word this time, ending on an up note (in terms of the shout-out to other commenters) and a cautionary note at the same time. This one was posted under Chris Hedges\u2019 latest column , \u201cHow Power Works\u201d:'"}, "time": 1742564505.3614876}
