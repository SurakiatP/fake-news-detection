And while some parents see all the cake, candy and salty snacks as a harmless indulgence during a festive season, others object to any unhealthy food in the classroom. Now the federal government is stepping in to help address the issue of classroom food. Federal school nutrition rules from the Department of Agriculture approved this past summer now require school districts participating in federal lunch or breakfast programs to come up with a nutritional standard for all foods and drinks offered to children at school, including those served by parents at classroom parties and treats awarded by teachers as prizes for a correct answer. The new standards won\u2019t go into effect until the   school year, but right now, school district wellness committees around the country are debating which foods and drinks, if any, should be barred at the classroom door. While it\u2019s too soon to say how most districts will respond to the federal mandate, there\u2019s room for improvement in many classrooms. According to a national survey of school district wellness policies conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, most districts don\u2019t have standards for the foods and drinks served at classroom parties. Although nearly one in four districts discourage teachers from giving food as a reward, only 13 percent prohibit the practice. One option for districts is to simply adopt the   \u201cSmart Snacks\u201d rules that govern snacks and drinks sold to children through vending machines and school  . The rules went into effect in 2014, and are familiar territory to most school districts. Adopting the Smart Snacks rules for classroom food would also steer parents toward   items instead of homemade, reducing the risk of harm to   children. \u201cMany will use Smart Snacks because that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. But depending on a given community\u2019s nutritional ethos, the Smart Snacks rules could be seen as too lenient or too stringent. Unless otherwise exempted, homemade birthday cupcakes would be out, but many highly processed snacks, including some with considerable amounts of added sugar, would still be permissible. For instance, a Trix cereal bar, with 150 calories and more than 50 percent whole grain oats, would pass muster, even though the second and third ingredients are corn syrup and sugar. At the other end of the spectrum, districts could set a lax standard that intentionally does little or nothing to change the status quo. After the Smart Snacks rules were adopted, for instance, some states took advantage of a loophole to allow frequent sales of junk food for school   to continue. But that may not happen this time, since the federal rules require a wide range of stakeholders, including parents, to participate in the drafting process. \u201cWellness policies won\u2019t be decided by the state, but instead by local committees that will include teachers, school officials and members of the community,\u201d Ms. Wootan said. The new federal rules do require each school to appoint a staff member to help oversee the new healthy eating rules. And while states will audit a district\u2019s wellness policy every three years, they will review only a district\u2019s goals and its plan to implement them. In other words, says Ms. Wootan, \u201cThey won\u2019t be going into every classroom on Halloween to see what\u2019s happening. \u201d Parents can also have a voice in decisions made at their child\u2019s school. Individual schools have the option to institute classroom policies that are stricter than their district\u2019s standard. \u201cIf parents at a given school really want to take this issue on, they could,\u201d Ms. Wootan said. The National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity has created a useful clearinghouse of wellness policy guidance and resources from leading public health organizations. Jodi Helman, who used to live in Stamford, Conn. said she believes more rules are needed. She said her daughter\u2019s previous elementary school took a decidedly lax approach to classroom food. \u201cThe amount of junk food was outrageous,\u201d she recalls. \u201cCandy was given out daily as rewards. The classrooms would have at least one party a week, sometimes two if it fell during a holiday. \u201d But her family recently moved to Barrington, R. I. where their new school has \u201ca   policy\u201d toward unhealthy food in the classroom. \u201cNo candy rewards, no cupcakes for birthdays, no holiday parties with food,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kids in Barrington live a healthy lifestyle, without even knowing it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562281.339429}
