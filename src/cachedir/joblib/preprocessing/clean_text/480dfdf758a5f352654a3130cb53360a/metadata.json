He had arrived in the States a few hours earlier from London, where he had been promoting his   movie \u201cFences,\u201d and also talking about what everyone was talking about: the politics of the day. Mr. Washington told the Bagger he understood the surge of anger that had fueled Brexit and President Trump\u2019s ascendence, and now he wanted to talk solutions. But first, he wanted grapefruit juice and eggs. He had squeezed in a few hours of   and ambled into the Park Hyatt\u2019s restaurant looking a little rumpled still. After settling in, he also discovered two holes in his big woolly gray sweater. As commanding a presence as his onscreen personas suggest, Mr. Washington, who is 62, also carries a hint of the   professor. This is the same fellow, after all, who showed up to accept a lifetime achievement award at last year\u2019s Golden Globes having forgotten both his speech and his glasses. But Hollywood adores Mr. Washington, who, armed with charisma and that killer smile, effortlessly charmed the Globes crowd anyway. Promoting his movie, Mr. Washington has been pushing to elevate awareness of August Wilson, the Pulitzer   playwright who wrote \u201cFences\u201d and adapted it for film. Mr. Washington also has strong opinions on the political turmoil that, invariably, has come to dominate the awards season. Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency was a result of people\u2019s frustrations, Mr. Washington said, but the focus now has to be on finding people work and bridging the bitter national divide. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say, \u2018We\u2019re right, you\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You can be angry the next four years, and so what?\u201d Mr. Washington said. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse movement with progress. It can lead to progress it\u2019s a vital part of progress. But it still has to be, \u2018What are we going to do about it? \u2019\u201d Mr. Washington certainly has the platform to speak out. In January, he received his seventh Oscar nomination for acting, further cementing a Hollywood royalty status that needed no help. The latest nomination, for his lead turn in \u201cFences,\u201d was roundly expected, as were the movie\u2019s other nominations, for best film (Mr. Washington was a producer) best adapted screenplay and best supporting actress, for Viola Davis, who is considered a lock to win. But Mr. Washington\u2019s peers delivered a whopping surprise last month at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which usually foretell Oscar winners. Throughout the season, Casey Affleck has been scooping up best actor prizes for his performance in \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d and he was predicted to collect the guild\u2019s trophy, too. Instead, it went to Mr. Washington, who took the stage wagging his head in disbelief, before deploying a winning strategy  \u2014   disarm them, then own them. \u201cI\u2019m a   man, I\u2019m supposed to have faith but I didn\u2019t have faith,\u201d he noted onstage. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, you know that young boy\u2019s going to win, Denzel, you ain\u2019t gonna win.\u2019 So I didn\u2019t even prepare. \u201d Then, he listed America\u2019s most famous playwrights, making clear who he believes merit inclusion in the pantheon. \u201cTennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Eugene O\u2019Neill, Edward Albee, August Wilson,\u201d he said. Set in the 1950s, \u201cFences\u201d centers on Troy Maxson (Mr. Washington) a     baseball great and garbage collector, and his homemaker wife, Rose, played by Ms. Davis. Onscreen, Mr. Washington and Ms. Davis share a rich, affectionate familiarity, for good reason: They starred in the play\u2019s 2010 revival, a Broadway smash that landed each of them a Tony Award. \u201cFences\u201d is the sixth of Mr. Wilson\u2019s   \u201cPittsburgh Cycle,\u201d which explores   lives in each decade of the 20th century. Mr. Washington is working on bringing the remaining nine plays to the screen, for HBO, a plan no doubt helped by the success of \u201cFences\u201d: It has earned $54 million domestically so far. After meeting the Bagger, he was off to see Ruben   the actor, director and playwright, who had written a first pass at a script for one play in the cycle, \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom. \u201d \u201cAs a custodian of August Wilson\u2019s estate, in terms of his plays, it\u2019s important for me to promote \u2018Fences\u2019 to the hilt,\u201d Mr. Washington said. (He is producing the plays in collaboration with the  estate.) \u201cNot for me to win an award, but for it to be as successful on every level so that we can make the rest of them, you know? No business, no show. \u201d Getting \u201cFences\u201d to the screen was a   ordeal. It was optioned in the late \u201980s but was delayed partly because Mr. Wilson insisted on having an   director. Mr. Wilson died of cancer in 2005, at 60, and four years later, the powerhouse producer Scott Rudin, who had by then acquired the film rights, sent the screenplay to Mr. Washington, wanting him to star in and direct it. Mr. Washington replied that he wanted to perform it onstage first, so Mr. Rudin made it happen. \u201cI think Denzel is by a mile the greatest living American actor,\u201d Mr. Rudin wrote in an email, and added, \u201cThere is no movie of \u2018Fences\u2019 without him  \u2014   just as there was no way to present it onstage without him. \u201d Throughout the run, audiences routinely made clear their intense connection with Mr. Washington, hissing at him when his character\u2019s infallibilities were made plain: \u201cDenzel, how could you?\u201d It would take nearly five more years for Mr. Washington to feel ready to tackle the film. Four of the five main actors had appeared onstage with him, too  \u2014   \u201cWe\u2019re a tight band, we know the music,\u201d he said  \u2014   including Ms. Davis, a given. \u201cThis is where the actor meets the role,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope she has other great roles. But this is the role. \u201d (The Bagger asked about Ms. Davis\u2019s rawest scene, where, as she weeps, thick snot runs from her nose. Mr. Washington said he had thought about digitally removing it but concluded that Wilson showed ordinary people, warts and all. \u201cWhy clean it up?\u201d he asked.) Did he share Mr. Wilson\u2019s belief that the film could have had only a black director? \u201cYou have to be able to understand the culture,\u201d he replied. \u201cScorsese could have directed \u2018Schindler\u2019s List,\u2019 but there\u2019s a cultural difference. This is rooted specifically in   culture. \u201d Had the film come out a year earlier, it would have possibly reshaped Oscars history. Last year, controversy erupted again after all of the nominated actors ended up being, for the second year in a row, white. Yet Mr. Washington said, fervently, that the success of \u201cFences,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which also have Oscar nominations and black stars, cannot be viewed as, or reduced to, correctives to #OscarsSoWhite. \u201cThey call Wilson the American Shakespeare,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not fulfilling any quota. \u201d And as important as it is for people to speak up, Mr. Washington said, it\u2019s just as important for black artists to keep striving for that breakthrough. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep plugging you\u2019ve got to keep working at it, you\u2019ve got to keep writing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: \u2018If it ain\u2019t on the page, it ain\u2019t on the stage. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562589.8978221}
