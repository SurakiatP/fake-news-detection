Iger insisted that ABC News has been entirely on the level in its coverage of the 2016 campaign and President Trump. He said: ABC News has reported to me, directly or indirectly, for almost 25 years. I\u2019m an expert on ABC News, and I can stand here today, look you in the face, and say I\u2019m proud of the efforts of ABC News. I respect ABC News, and I believe they work very, very hard to present news in an extremely fair way. There are always going to be people  \u2014   yourself included and perhaps the president  \u2014   who are going to believe that it is not being presented in a manner that\u2019s consistent with their own beliefs. There\u2019s an indictment made about the press simply because some of the press do not necessarily tow the line with positions being taken by others. Danhof, whose organization buys stocks in firms so it can attend shareholder meetings and ask tough questions, pointed out that Iger sidestepped the toughest parts of his query on Wednesday. The CEO simply ignored the part of his question that dealt with George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton White House aide and now ABC News personality. Stephanopoulos was found in the Wikileaks hacks of the Democratic National Committee to have colluded with the Clinton campaign on story ideas, editing questions and lines of attack on Peter Schweizer, who wrote the book Clinton Cash a New York Times bestseller that detailed conflicts of interest and other misdealings by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Danhof said of Iger: How he lined up his response was telling. He wouldn\u2019t address the question. He was sticking his head in the sand. His response was that I was making this up. But this has reached a nexus. Will his network continue to ignore or mock the millions of Americans in flyover country, or will we work to make his networks more inviting to other points of view? Right now, he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want us as customers. Iger was even more determined when it came to ESPN, the sports giant that has announced in recent days it plans another round of layoffs because of massive financial losses that some attribute to its sharp leftward ideological turn. In his questioning, Danhof mentioned an exchange between two   personalities for the network about how, if they said, \u201cComing up, why Donald Trump is awesome,\u201d they would \u201cnot last until the first commercial. \u201d Iger insisted the network exhibited no bias. \u201cThe charge that ESPN is exhibiting significant political bias in its programming is just completely exaggerated,\u201d Iger said. \u201cOne small communication and blowing it up into something that sounds a lot larger than it is. Watch ESPN and you\u2019re not going to see political bias at ESPN. \u201d Critics say there is, in fact, a lot of bias at ESPN. They point to Caitlyn Jenner winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, the network\u2019s endorsement of Black Lives Matter at the ESPY Awards,  \u2019s aggressive coverage of the Women\u2019s March on Washington in January, and the firing of Doug Adler  \u2014   a tennis commentator  \u2014   after he referred to the \u201cguerrilla effect\u201d of Venus Williams moving closer to the net on second serves at the Australian Open. There is also daily bias from commentators such as Michael Wilbon and Tony Kellerman. And then there is Kevin Blackstone, an   sportswriter who appears on ESPN talk programs and once referred to the Star Spangled Banner as a \u201cwar anthem. \u201d Curt Schilling, the former big league pitcher who was fired in April 2016 after he tweeted out support for the North Carolina law that required people to use the bathroom of their anatomical sex, scoffed at the notion ESPN is unbiased. \u201cWe recognize Abby Wambach and her stance on the gay lifestyle in the sports world, but not Milo Yiannopoulos and his gay perspective as a victim of molestation,\u201d Schilling said in an email to Breitbart News. \u201cWe recognize that every issue Stephen A. Smith has in sports is based on black and white, not talent. But we don\u2019t recognize Ben Carson, a conservative man from the worst of the worst backgrounds who never allowed color to taint his world perspective. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562080.836675}
