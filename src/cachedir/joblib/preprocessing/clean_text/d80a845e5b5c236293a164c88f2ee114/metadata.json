Suzy Kelly, the council member who sponsored and promoted the proposal, explained: \u201cAs our founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence, our inalienable rights come from our God, not our government. Displaying \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 in City Hall, or any government hall where elected officials enact legislation, makes perfect sense.\u201d \\nThe phrase appears to have origins in the fourth stanza of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d: O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved homes and the war\\'s desolation, Blest with vict\\'ry and peace, may the Heav\\'n-rescued land Praise the Pow\\'r that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: \"In God is our trust.\" And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave O\\'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. \\n\"In God we trust\" also echoes the Bible: Psalm 118:8: \u201cIt is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.\u201d Psalm 40:3: \u201cHe put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the LORD and put their trust in Him.\u201d Proverbs 29.25: \u201cFear of many will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.\u201d \\nOn the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the motto, the U.S. Senate reaffirmed it, while five years later the House passed a resolution reaffirming it as well, with just nine members opposed. \\nBut some disagree. In March, the board of commissioners in Saluda, North Carolina, voted unanimously not to display \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d in its city hall, claiming that it would offend and \u201costracize\u201d some with non-Christian or secular beliefs. \\nAttorney and atheist Michael Newdow appears to have made a living bringing lawsuits challenging the motto, along with the words \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance. Back in January, for instance, he filed one, claiming that the motto violates the \u201cseparation\u201d of church and state and that his belief in nothing is \u201csubstantially burdened because he is forced to bear on his person [presumably, the paper currency he carries in his wallet with the offending phrase printed on it] a religious sentiment that causes him to sense his government legitimizing, promoting and reinforcing negative and injurious attitudes not only against Atheists in general, but against him personally.\u201d \\nThe outcome of that lawsuit apparently is still pending, but if precedents hold, he will once again be out of luck. In 1970 Stefan Ray Aronow filed the first lawsuit against the motto, Aronow v. United States . The court ruled that Aronow didn\u2019t have standing to sue but decided to address his complaint anyway. Wrote the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d have nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. \\nThe Establishment Clause in the First Amendment \u2014 \u201cCongress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion\u201d \u2014 was successfully defended years earlier by the Supreme Court in 1952 in Zorach v. Clauson . Writing for the majority, Justice William Douglas stated: We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being\u2026. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamation making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; \"So help me God\" in our courtroom oaths \u2014 these and ... other references to the Almighty ... run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies ... [including] the supplication with which the Court opens each session: \"God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\" \\nSuzy Kelly and other members of the City Council of Chesapeake have been inundated with expressions of support for their decision. \"When I speak with people,\" said Kelly, \"they often indicate how they feel our country has turned away from its founding principles. This vote has given hope to many.\" \\n\\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.
