Yup, there can be no doubt this was an inside job by the Russians,\u201d concluded Dave Richards, spokesperson for The Best League In The World. \\nIn scenes eerily similar to violence seen at Euro 2016, English football fans were minding their own business when Russian hooligans parachuted into the Olympic Stadium to cause trouble. \\n\u201cJust like the greasy Italians and Spaniards coming over here forcing our players to dive, this is another example of the morally incorruptible force of English football tradition being besmirched by things like video evidence,\u201d Richards added. \\nWhile no concrete evidence of Russian involvement in the fighting last night at the Olympic Stadium was found, staunch supporters of the infallible nature of the Premier League said they were under no obligation to find any. \\n\u201cTypical Russians, innit,\u201d confirmed Richards. \\nThe FA have already confirmed that they did not possess the powers to ban Russian fans from the game and so would take no further actions, and also admitted they were still exhausted for kicking racism out of football.'"}, "time": 1742564049.106568}
