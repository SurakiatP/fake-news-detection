Christian Miller, the club\u2019s political affairs director, disagreed. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to, A, get us heckled a lot and, B, get no one to sign up,\u201d he said. The Trump posters stayed in the box. For decades, College Republicans have drawn ridicule from  \u2014   and defined themselves against  \u2014   the more liberal masses on college campuses. But this year has been especially nightmarish for C. R. s, as they call themselves. The nomination of Donald J. Trump, who has attacked their conservative heroes and esteemed alumni, has prompted widespread mockery from their liberal classmates, dissension from within and something of an identity crisis. While some College Republican leaders profess an appreciation for the   voters that Mr. Trump has awakened, many in the preppy Vineyard Vines set are wondering if Mr. Trump is transforming the party they hope to inherit into one in which they are unwelcome. \u201cThey tend to be   traditional Republican conservatives, and so you know there is a little bit of a mismatch there,\u201d said Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns. Mr. Rove\u2019s career in politics started as a   national chairman of the College Republicans who won the position in 1973 over opponents supported by Roger J. Stone Jr. and Paul Manafort, both of whom went on to become advisers to Mr. Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s a tension there,\u201d he said. That tension, tangible on campuses across the country, threatens to change the nature of both the organization that has long trained the party\u2019s leaders and the party they are being trained to lead. Since 1923, when Calvin Coolidge became the first former College Republican to become president, the list of the group\u2019s alumni reads like a who\u2019s who of the Republican establishment. Besides Mr. Rove, there is Lee Atwater, the former Republican National Committee chairman, and Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform. Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition, was a College Republican, and so was the     Jack Abramoff. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose visage the George Washington chapter displayed on its table, was a member. So was Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and numerous elected Republican officials across the country. Mr. Trump was never interested. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said with a shrug when asked in an interview if he had ever considered joining the club. \u201cI was very much into the world of real estate. \u201d At Mr. Trump\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, Grayson Sessa, the vice president of the school\u2019s College Republicans, said he was dismayed by the nominee\u2019s   and hoped the party\u2019s values could withstand him. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great feeling,\u201d he said. At Yale, the chapter\u2019s endorsement of Mr. Trump led to a mutiny, with departing members forming the Yale New Republicans and Yale Undergraduate Conservatives Against Trump. And at Harvard, alma mater of countless Republican leaders, the club\u2019s president, Declan Garvey, 21, said that between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, \u201cI would have to vote for Hillary. \u201d But Karis Lockhart, the chairwoman of the University of Central Florida chapter, whose parents met as College Republicans, said that those who could not bring themselves to vote for Mr. Trump were being overly sensitive. She argued that Mr. Trump would bring in new voters who would help in other races on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s dumbing it down for people who don\u2019t want the numbers and statistics,\u201d she said approvingly. Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination prompted the Central Florida\u2019s chapter to post a letter on Facebook urging students \u201cto not get discouraged\u201d by Mr. Trump. Some did, and left the club. \u201cMy job is to bring everybody back on board to the Republican Party, whether or not they love Trump,\u201d said Cade Marsh, the College Republicans\u2019 state chairman in Florida, who wears \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d shirts and wants to run for president in 2032. (His email handle is Cade2032POTUS, using the acronym for president of the United States.) Today, the College Republican National Committee claims to have around 250, 000 students in nearly 1, 800 chapters. It is a nonprofit political action committee with   power and shares its research on millennial voters with the Trump campaign, specifically the findings of its survey \u201cGrowing Up G. O. P. ,\u201d the cover of which features hands cradling a plant sprout. \u201cIf you become a College Republican in college, then you are Republican for the rest of your life,\u201d said Mr. Norquist, the former member. \u201cNobody learns anything about politics after they are 21. \u201d The task of reconciling Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent with the bewilderment of conservative students falls to Alex Smith, the current national chairwoman of the College Republicans. She works in an office on K Street in Washington that is decorated with framed \u201cRove\u201d and \u201cYouth for Nixon\u201d pins, a blues album featuring Mr. Atwater and letters from Mr. Rove. Ms. Smith, 27, is telegenic and   ready, the very picture of   message discipline. In an interview, she repeatedly tried to veer the conversation to Mrs. Clinton, whom she calls the first college Republican to win the Democratic nomination. (Mrs. Clinton was a   Goldwater Girl, a supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 1964.) Ms. Smith said that Mr. Trump\u2019s preference for Twitter and Instagram suited her members. \u201cIn a lot of ways, he speaks like a person of my generation,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHe brings more people in. \u201d But was it not strange to work for the election of a candidate who had ripped her heroes to shreds, who disagreed on core Republican values? Ms. Smith looked at the tape recorder on her desk. \u201cYou could turn it off?\u201d she asked. The George Washington chapter had its own struggles in absorbing the rise of Mr. Trump. When it released a statement in June congratulating him on winning the nomination, it drew backlash from its   members and from the College Democrats with whom they share an office on campus. \u201cIt was a really bad summer,\u201d said Ms. Scott, the membership director. Allison Coukos, the chapter\u2019s communications director, who, like Ms. Scott, is undecided on whether to vote for Mr. Trump, said, \u201cThey were like, \u2018How can you support someone who is a racist, who hates women, who is a bigot?\u2019 \u201d In an attempt at damage control, the group published a letter on Facebook clarifying that it had not endorsed Mr. Trump. Ms. Scott said the Trump fans in the club responded by calling them \u201cpathetic\u201d and mocked them for creating a \u201csafe space. \u201d At the club fair this month at George Washington, many of the dozens of   freshman who stopped by the College Republicans table expressed relief when Ms. Scott explained that the group had, in fact, not supported Mr. Trump. But Tom Crean, a freshman who joined the club, wished they had. \u201cIt is their job to promote whoever is at the top of the ticket,\u201d Mr. Crean, 18, said. \u201cIt\u2019s undercutting the party. I would change it by being a   person in the organization. By being an apologist. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561928.5202684}
