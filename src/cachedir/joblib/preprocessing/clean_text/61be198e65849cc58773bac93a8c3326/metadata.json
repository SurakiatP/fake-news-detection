The scooter puttered through Heiqiaocun, or Black Bridge Village, before stopping at the vast industrial space used by Mr. Sun. The area is outside 798, the district that in the 2000s transformed a cluster of abandoned factories into one of Asia\u2019s art hot spots. Black Bridge Village, for now, is right on the cusp of that gentrification. Pi Animation, which Mr. Sun founded in 2006 when he was a new graduate, is at once grungy and  . Upstairs, studio staff members used powerful computers to create two monumental works that took more than a year: \u201cMythological Time\u201d (2016) a multimedia piece unveiled Nov. 4 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and \u201cReconstruction of the Universe,\u201d a commission by the luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet, which can be seen now at Art Basel Miami Beach. The Audemars project  \u2014   a digital film made of tens of thousands of   woodblocks  \u2014   used the work of more than 100 assistants, including students working  . It is being shown at a pavilion Mr. Sun planned for Miami Beach, with a swooping bamboo roof and short films projected onto glowing spheres. But, at least in his studio, Mr. Sun\u2019s reality was a world away from international museums and beachside art fairs. With two major deadlines in front of him, he worked furiously, sitting on a sagging old sofa surrounded by overflowing ashtrays and empty beverage containers. There were no luxuries in his workspace  \u2014   just a weight bench and a few stalls of squat toilets in the back. Mr. Sun, the son of factory workers, said there was no point in cleaning up. \u201cA new   rail will be built right through my studio  \u2014   not anyone else\u2019s, mine,\u201d he said wryly, thrusting two beefy arms out to show where the government planned to construct its next big project. He shrugged. \u201cMy studio will be destroyed, and I will move. \u201d Mr. Sun, 36, is preoccupied with the idea of inevitable change. The themes of time, impermanence and shifting views of history come up repeatedly in his work, which is filled with beautifully drawn Chinese dragons and tigers, as well as dystopian images like menacing Red Guards or factories belching   smoke. In his view, everything  \u2014   the news on television, governments, art studios  \u2014   is temporary. Even his studio is named for \u03c0, an \u201cirrational number\u201d that could be calculated for infinity without coming to a finite conclusion. Mr. Sun\u2019s \u201cMythological Time\u201d depicts his hometown, Fuxin in Liaoning, a frigid province wedged between North Korea and Inner Mongolia. It is part of the Guggenheim\u2019s \u201cTales of our Time\u201d exhibit featuring    artists from greater China. \u201cIt is a very, very, very poor   area,\u201d Mr. Sun said of Fuxin. \u201cIt used to be important and had one of China\u2019s biggest mines of its type, but not anymore. It\u2019s almost like there is a ring around the northern part of the world  \u2014   that goes through Fuxin, through parts of Russia, through parts of America  \u2014   where coal has left people poor. \u201d Mr. Sun sometimes travels to Fuxin, where he sits outside with a pad of paper \u201cto draw its factories, its mountains, its backyards. \u201d (Like a filial Chinese son, he helped move his family to a more temperate climate.) Xiaoyu Weng, a curator of Chinese art at the Guggenheim, explained how Mr. Sun used two   works to depict   Fuxin as just a blip over the course of millenniums. \u201cIt\u2019s an animated history of his hometown, overlaid with mythological figures and animals,\u201d Ms. Weng said by telephone from New York. \u201cHe imagines how coal mining was originally formed. \u201d \u201cSun Xun is unique among his generation of artists in that he has a very profound and complex interest in history,\u201d Ms. Weng said. \u201cHe has the ability to take a Chinese issue and make it relevant to the global condition. He\u2019s talking about changing landscapes, urban environments, energy sources  \u2014   all controversial topics  \u2014   and expressing it artistically. \u201d Mr. Sun seems to have little nostalgia for his hometown, but he is obsessed with his own family\u2019s sad history, especially because the family\u2019s own telling of it is so different from the history he was taught in school. \u201cThe story of my family is the story of China over the past 100 years,\u201d he said. Mr. Sun comes from a military family. His   fought for China\u2019s Qing dynasty against the Japanese empire. His grandfather fought for the Kuomintang, the forces that later fled to set up the Republic of China in Taiwan, a   democracy that still has tense ties with Beijing. \u201cHe had a ticket to Taiwan, but decided to stay in China,\u201d Mr. Sun said of his grandfather, showing how one decision shaped his family for generations. His grandfather fell on the wrong side of history when the Communists took power, and Mr. Sun\u2019s parents were punished for it. \u201cMy father experienced the Cultural Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause his own father was involved in the Kuomintang, he could not go into the military and was sent to a factory. He was frightened of the Red Guards. He slept with an ax under his pillow. \u201d Mr. Sun then stopped, abrupt and  . \u201cI\u2019ve said too much,\u201d he said, waving his hand dismissively at the recording of our interview. \u201cThe revolution was just one small point in time. \u201d Much of Mr. Sun\u2019s work has to do with the way politics and history are distorted. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in history books. I don\u2019t believe in the news, whether it\u2019s from America or Taiwan or Japan or Korea. This is why I travel so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI only believe what I see with my own two eyes. My art asks questions, and I just keep looking. \u201d Mr. Sun is only the second artist to be given an Audemars Piguet Art Commission, a project the Swiss watchmaking company started in 2014. (The first was Robin Meier, a Swiss artist and musician.) Mr. Sun\u2019s latest work, \u201cReconstruction of the Universe,\u201d was originally to have its premiere at Art Basel Hong Kong in 2015, but its production was too unwieldy to finish in time. Mr. Sun drew original illustrations, and then had student helpers carve them into soft basswood  \u2014   a process that required an enormous amount of time and skill. Tens of thousands of woodblocks were carved, printed and then scanned each woodblock made up one frame of a   film. The final product plods along at 15 to 18 frames per second, or about the rate of a   silent film. There is no direct narrative or story, just images like a flying violin with wings or the Great Wall of China surrounded by crumbling towers. What at first looked to be a haunted house turned out to be the Audemars Piguet Museum in Switzerland. (The idea of \u201ca museum for time\u201d in some distant, alpine land seemed particularly interesting to Mr. Sun). Winka Angelrath, Audemars\u2019s   art exhibitions manager, explained the choice of Mr. Sun. \u201cWe liked that he was using traditional techniques, like ink painting and woodcutting, and turning them into digital animations,\u201d Ms. Angelrath said. \u201cHe is making something new out of something old. \u201cThere are shared themes: complexity, precision, time. \u201d Ms. Angelrath had flown from Geneva to Beijing to check on Mr. Sun\u2019s progress. She walked around his vast space, admiring the enormous amount of artwork he had created. After she left for her luxury hotel downtown, Mr. Sun packed up for the day. He walked through an unlit warehouse to his black car and then careened down an unlit street to eat at the kind of restaurant where you sit on the floor, drink cold beer and eat chicken skins on sticks. He noted, while driving past sushi joints and fitness centers, how quickly his neighborhood was changing, but said that was not necessarily a bad thing. \u201cThey will tear it down, but I will just make a more beautiful studio,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what they call development. \u201d \u201cReconstruction of the Universe,\u201d Art Basel Miami Beach, through Sunday. \u201cTales of Our Time,\u201d Guggenheim Museum, New York, through March 10.'"}, "time": 1742561942.0163717}
