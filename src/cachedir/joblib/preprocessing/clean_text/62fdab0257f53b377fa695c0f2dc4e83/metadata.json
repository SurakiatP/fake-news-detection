[Attorney Mark Geragos filed the $100 million proposed   lawsuit in California Sunday on behalf of client and festival attendee Daniel Jung, Billboard reports.  The claim alleges that Fyre organizers  \u2014   namely, the rapper Ja Rule and    entrepreneur Billy McFarland  \u2014   attempted to \u201cfleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water \u2014  and without regard to what might happen to them after that. \u201d Ticket buyers  \u2014   some of whom spent up to a reported $200, 000 on the most luxurious festival accommodations  \u2014   arrived at the Island of Exumas on Thursday to find a festival site in disarray, with unfinished infrastructure and stages, disaster relief tents in place of luxury villas, and \u201cgourmet\u201d bread and cheese sandwiches in a cafeteria organizers had promised would be staffed by a celebrity chef. The festival  \u2014   which had been heavily promoted for months by models and influential social media personalities including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Hailey Baldwin  \u2014  had been billed as a unique \u201ccultural experience,\u201d with planned performances from   and the rappers Tyga and Desiigner, and opulent ticket packages offering the ability to charter a yacht. The festival\u2019s official video promised the island was once owned by legendary drug kingpin Pablo Escobar.  But guests who made it to the island reported seeing wet, soggy tents, a lack of security and food, and even stray animals roaming the campgrounds. After organizers cancelled the event Friday, attendees struggled to schedule return flights home as the Island of Exumas\u2019 tiny airport was overrun with   travelers. In the lawsuit, Geragos alleges that the festival was \u201cmore like The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,\u201d according to Billboard. The suit alleges fraud, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, with Geragos charging that the island was not \u201cprivate,\u201d as had been advertised, and had never been owned by Escobar. The lawsuit also claims that Rule and McFarland knew the festival would be a catastrophe and warned   promoters not to attend. \u201cThey called all the   names and the modeling agencies and told them not to come,\u201d a source told the New York Post\u2018s Page Six over the weekend. \u201cThey were just like, \u2018Oh, come next weekend when all the kinks have been worked out.\u2019 This was before the chaos even started. \u201d Organizers issued a statement to Billboard claiming \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the festival, but promised full refunds and VIP accommodations to next year\u2019s event, which they said would take place at a \u201cUnited States beach venue. \u201d \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience the past   has caused and we look forward to making a considerable donation to the Bahamas Red Cross Society as part of our initiatives,\u201d the organizers wrote. \u201cWe need to make this right. And once we make this right, then we will put on the dream festival we sought to have since the inception of Fyre. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562381.5116677}
