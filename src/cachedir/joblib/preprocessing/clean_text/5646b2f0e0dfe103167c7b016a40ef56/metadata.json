Donald Trump\u2019s campaign couldn\u2019t have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated, but the Republican candidate\u2019s campaign manager just put the final nail in Clinton\u2019s coffin. \\nIn the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it, but she delivered more than viewers were expecting. In a statement that didn\u2019t just decimate Hillary\u2019s campaign, she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence. \\nWhen the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed, there\u2019s a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation, and it\u2019s almost guaranteed to end in incarceration. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days. Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday, is what Conway said on Fox News: \\n\u201cWhat we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does, put Hillary first\u2026we can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out.\u201d \\nCall it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks, James O\u2019Keefe, and now the FBI, who are all working together to bleach this \u201cstain\u201d from the White House, but things just aren\u2019t looking good for Hillary who had it coming. Hopefully, the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president, make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two. \\nThe investigation now is entirely different than the first, considering the fact that it was reopened. For that reason alone, Hillary shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable about the outcome.'"}, "time": 1742563960.4830737}
