[School administrators Meg DeMarco and Darris Saylors both quit their jobs after being confronted by police over the missing funds, The Daily Mail reported.  Saylors, who worked in the Dean of Students\u2019 office, allegedly bought tablets,   computers, phones, and electronic sex toys, reports say. For her part, DeMarco, who was the Harvard Law School\u2019s Director of Student Affairs until 2013, was confronted about the theft at her new job at Babson College. DeMarco, 33, admitted to \u201cmaking mistakes\u201d in the job. \u201cI never intended to harm the university. I\u2019m very sorry and will do everything in my power to rectify the situation,\u201d she told CBS affiliate WBZ TV. Officials accuse DeMarco of using a school mobile card reader to transfer money into her personal account and then altering records to cover her tracks. She also bought a large amount of electronic items, investigators said. Police subpoenaed Apple Corp. and discovered items had been shipped to DeMarco\u2019s home. Harvard announced a change in procedure after the reports. \u201cAs a result of this matter, the Law School implemented additional layers of controls governing the use of its credit accounts and purchasing protocols,\u201d the school said in a statement.
