{"duration": 0.13705086708068848, "input_args": {"text": "'In a move that is likely to roil the art world, and that attests to the increasingly collaborative relationship between private dealers and auction houses, Brett Gorvy  \u2014   long considered the master broker of contemporary art at Christie\u2019s  \u2014   is leaving after 23 years to join forces with Dominique L\u00e9vy, the founder of a powerful Madison Avenue gallery. It will now be known as L\u00e9vy Gorvy. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a coup,\u201d the San   art adviser Mary Zlot said. The pair, she said, \u201cwill add that much more firepower\u201d to the marketplace. Mr. Gorvy, the Christie\u2019s chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art, is widely credited with fortifying the auction house\u2019s reputation for securing A+ quality work and for aggressive deal making, which allowed it to become the market leader in postwar and contemporary sales. Since Mr. Gorvy\u2019s appointment to that position more than a decade ago, Christie\u2019s has achieved the three highest prices at auction: $179. 4 million for Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Femmes d\u2019Alger (Version \u2018O\u2019)\u201d in 2015 $170. 4 million for Amedeo Modigliani\u2019s \u201cNu Couch\u00e9\u201d (Reclining Nude) that same year and $142. 4 million for Francis Bacon\u2019s triptych, \u201cThree Studies of Lucian Freud,\u201d in 2013. His move signals the growing alliance between auction houses and dealers where they used to distrust each other as competitors, these days they work together to secure the highest prices for sellers and the   pieces for buyers. Dealers use auction houses for their international reach, and auction houses use dealers to connect with clients who wish to sell at public auction or through private auction sales. Auction houses also work with dealers to establish   guarantees, the minimum bids at which lots are promised to sell. Mr. Gorvy is the latest executive to move between auctions and private sales. In 2014, Amy Cappellazzo, after 13 years with Christie\u2019s, left to start an art advisory business, which was acquired by Sotheby\u2019s in January. According to Sotheby\u2019s, private sales have almost doubled over the last year. In 2013, a prominent Sotheby\u2019s auctioneer, Tobias Meyer, also left, to become a private art adviser. About 16 percent of Christie\u2019s business is now in private sales, it said, and Mr. Gorvy has been active in expanding that division at the auction house, which is privately owned by the French luxury goods magnate   Pinault. As a specialist, Mr. Gorvy said: \u201cYou go talk to a client and you say, \u2018I\u2019m going to deliver, because I know this painting, I know who\u2019s going to buy this painting.\u2019 I was able to persuade people to sell pictures at times when people were not necessarily even thinking of selling the pictures because of my total belief in my ability and my team\u2019s ability to do that. \u201d In a joint interview at Ms. L\u00e9vy\u2019s home, Mr. Gorvy said he decided to leave Christie\u2019s a year ago because he wanted to start a new chapter. \u201cAt the age of 52, you have one more opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I hate change, there\u2019s a certain moment when you know in your heart that the time is right. \u201d \u201cYou look at the Roger Federers\u201d of the world, he added, referring to the tennis champion. \u201cAt what point do you basically take it to another level?\u201d Jussi Pylkkanen, the global president of Christie\u2019s, said he was sorry to see Mr. Gorvy leave. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for us,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply respected both by collectors and the people who have worked with him. \u201d At the same time, Mr. Pylkkanen added, Mr. Gorvy has created a strong bench that includes specialists like Loic Gouzer, Laura Paulson, Francis Outred, Sara Friedlander and Alex Rotter (who left Sotheby\u2019s in March and will become chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s Americas). Having explored several options, including going out on his own, Mr. Gorvy said he was ultimately compelled by Ms. L\u00e9vy\u2019s \u201cboutique mentality of what a dealer is,\u201d in the tradition of Leo Castelli, Pierre Matisse and Anthony d\u2019Offay  \u2014   \u201c  galleries who understood new markets. \u201d In addition, he said, Ms. L\u00e9vy  \u2014   who also serves as an art adviser and has galleries in London and Geneva  \u2014   represents some of his favorite artists, including the Italian artist Carol Rama, whose estate recently joined the gallery. He admires Ms. L\u00e9vy\u2019s emphasis on female artists and her exhibition program, including her drawings show this year her Calder miniatures show last year and her first show in 2013 about the resonance among Lucio Fontana, Yves Klein and Cy Twombly. \u201cMuseums are not doing these things,\u201d Mr. Gorvy said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to the galleries. They can\u2019t afford to do it. \u201d (He also respected Ms. L\u00e9vy\u2019s discretion. \u201cI could never get out of Dominique what the Sotheby\u2019s offers were or the Phillips offers,\u201d he said, referring to the bids made by rival auction houses for artists\u2019 works. \u201cShe basically held the line. \u201d) Ms. L\u00e9vy, who is 48, said she had long wanted to team with Mr. Gorvy, whom she knew from her time at Christie\u2019s nearly 20 years ago. \u201cI admire his knowledge,\u201d Ms. L\u00e9vy said. \u201cWe\u2019re both collectors. We both love the art. \u201d Ms. L\u00e9vy has been on her own since parting with Robert Mnuchin in 2012, opening her gallery in 2013 in a landmark 1930s former bank building on Madison Avenue and 73rd Street. In June, she said she was taking over the entire space. That expansion, to be completed in January, helped to seal Mr. Gorvy\u2019s decision. \u201cHere is someone I feel an incredible kinship with,\u201d he said, \u201cwho also has the perfect space. \u201d Mr. Gorvy is leaving at a time when Christie\u2019s is trying to dominate market share even as it also tries to build profits. Because Christie\u2019s is not a public company, no one knows how much of its margins it gives away through guarantees. Mr. Gorvy gained a reputation for winning prime consignments with little regard for profits, a portrayal he said was inaccurate. \u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m about market share,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m much more interested in, did I have the best paintings?\u201d As it happens, Mr. Gorvy said, he grew unhappy at Christie\u2019s three years ago precisely because of the intense competitive pressure. \u201cIt was a crazy world, the market was ugly, it was all deal, deal, deal,\u201d he said. \u201cHuge risk was taken on board to maximize the market. You were pushing things to the highest level, and it was incredibly stressful. It was a very tough period from the personal side when you love art and you love exhibitions and the main driver is your passion and your pursuit of excellence. \u201d More recently, Christie\u2019s has had to rein in spending to adapt to a softening market. Some in the art world have assumed that Mr. Gorvy felt constrained by the   of his bosses, but he said he agreed with this approach. \u201cThe last thing that I want is to have a company, which is not actually a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a business. We are not art historians. We are not curators. \u201d Mr. Gorvy said he\u2019s confident that Christie\u2019s will be fine without him. \u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d he said. \u201cI walked into a vacuum. I\u2019m not leaving a vacuum. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561976.9740856}
