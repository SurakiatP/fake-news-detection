It was like driving into hell,\u201d said Rain Moore, 32, a lieutenant with the Sneedville Fire Department, about an hour and a half away. Mr. Moore said he arrived early Tuesday and, while fighting the fire in the darkness, saw orange flames burning from the center of trees, indicating a strong intensity. Fueled by high winds and a drought in Tennessee, the fires damaged about 150 buildings and forced thousands to evacuate. Three people died and 14 others were injured, officials said Tuesday afternoon. More than 14, 000 people left Gatlinburg, and others were evacuated from nearby Pigeon Forge as well as other parts of Sevier County, in the eastern part of the state, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. More than 10, 000 people had been left without power in Sevier County. \u201cThis is the largest fire in the last hundred years of the state of Tennessee,\u201d Gov. Bill Haslam said on Tuesday afternoon. Dramatic videos shot by residents and shared online showed flames lining the edge of the highways used for evacuations. The fires, the result of human error, started in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and were spread by winds that reached 87 miles per hour on Monday night. Greg Miller, the chief of the Gatlinburg Fire Department, said the authorities expected winds of about 60 m. p. h. overnight Tuesday, but were hopeful that rain would come first. Officials did not say how the three who died were killed. Gatlinburg\u2019s mayor, Mike Werner, was among those who lost his home, he said on Tuesday. He also lost his business of more than three decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a devastating time for us and for Gatlinburg,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, as I said earlier this morning, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re resilient and we\u2019re going to make it. \u201d By early Tuesday evening, a thick,   haze cut visibility in Gatlinburg to only a few city blocks. The fire had hopscotched around the resort town of 3, 900 people and 60, 000 hotel beds, flattening some buildings while leaving others next door or around the block untouched. Emergency vehicles, lights flashing, cruised past   cars and gutted businesses as a city spokeswoman took reporters on a tour of the destruction. The town, located at the base of Great Smoky Mountains National Park about 50 miles from Knoxville, relies heavily on tourism. Pigeon Forge, home to Dolly Parton\u2019s Dollywood theme park, is among the premier tourist destinations in the region. On Twitter, the National Park Service announced that officials had \u201cclosed all facilities in the park due to the extensive fire activity, and downed trees. \u201d Pete Owens, a spokesman for Dollywood, said in a statement that the park had not been damaged but that more than a dozen cabins managed by the company had been damaged or destroyed. Ms. Parton said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the destruction: \u201cI am praying for all the families affected by the fire and the firefighters who are working so hard to keep everyone safe. \u201d The fires spread through Tennessee as much of the South has been enduring a crippling drought, even though rainfall this week offered some relief. The United States Drought Monitor reported last week that 60 percent of Tennessee was in \u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d drought, the two most severe ratings. Wildfires, once a seasonal phenomenon, have become a consistent threat, partly because climate change has resulted in drier winters and warmer springs, which combine to pull moisture off the ground and into the air. The authorities closed Route 321 at the Rocky Top Sports World, barring access into downtown Gatlinburg. About 700 people gathered on Tuesday morning inside the complex\u2019s main building, a   center on the   campus: mountain men with gray beards and canes alongside several people in blue surgical masks. One man was too choked up to talk, his tiny   bull mix shaking inside his battered camouflage jacket. Dozens of Red Cross volunteers and firefighters tended to people who seemed shellshocked. \u201cI got my family, man,\u201d said Greg Lanham, 36, who fled the flames around 8 p. m. Monday with his wife, Kara, 32, and their three children. The family moved from Henderson, Tenn. three months ago. Mr. Lanham, a maintenance worker, and Ms. Lanham, a maid, both worked at Sidney James Mountain Lodge, which survived the fire but remains closed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Mr. Lanham said. \u201cWe took what little money we had in our pockets and found a place to stay. \u201d The family did manage to save their dogs, Gizmo, a Pekingese, and Scruffy, a   Russell mix, along with their kitten, Snowball. Standing at the sports complex\u2019s food counter, where Red Cross volunteers served free coffee, hot dogs, burgers and fries, and boxes of fried chicken, Ms. Lanham joined her family and, crying, told her husband: \u201cIt\u2019s gone. It\u2019s all gone. \u201d \u201cWe did lose everything,\u201d Mr. Lanham said. \u201cWe got the clothes on our back. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562304.2101529}
