Friday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) the 2016 Democratic   nominee, told show host Chris Cuomo there was \u201cno legal justification\u201d for President Donald Trump\u2019s action against Syria a night earlier, which was a military strike against a Syrian air base in response to the nation\u2019s use of chemical weapons earlier in the week.  Kaine said although he agreed from a \u201cmoral standpoint\u201d with the decision, there was no \u201clegal justification\u201d for Trump\u2019s decision because he did not come to Congress first. \u201cThere is no legal justification for this,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI think from a moral standpoint  \u2014   absolutely, I agree with Senator Rubio. It was the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do  \u2014   to try to deter Bashar   from war crimes and remember, I voted to use military action against Syria in August of 2013. Senator Rubio voted against it back then when Bashar   did the same thing. But I said the president has to come to Congress. And Donald J. Trump, citizen Trump back then said exactly the same thing. A president has to go to Congress. He should not have done this without coming to Congress. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561974.803159}
