Erdogan long coveted Mosul. He may think now\u2019s his chance to seize the city and its lucrative oil reserves, claiming it\u2019s a buffer zone against Kurdish fighters, similar to his northern Syria occupation. According to Syrian parliamentarian Hohammad Kheir Akam, \u201c(t)he US has opened a southern side of Mosul (corridor) to the terrorists to\u201d let thousands of its fighters enter Syria. US-led coalition warplanes easily spot their convoys. Yet they\u2019re allowed to move freely \u2013 America supporting terrorists it claims to oppose. Iraqi Ansarullah al-Nujaba Movement spokesman Hashem al-Moussavi said \u201cWashington is still continuing its military support for the terrorists in\u201d his country, airdropping them weapons and other supplies. \u201cOur forces have filmed US aircraft while dropping military aids for\u201d ISIS terrorist fighters, he said. Iraq\u2019s Hassan Abdel Hadi said government forces are concerned about US aerial attacks, impeding their advance to ISIS-controlled areas. \u201cUnfortunately, there are still some people in Iraq who have been deceived by the US-led coalition, while Washington supports ISIL and is trying to compensate for the damage done\u201d to their fighters by government forces, he explained. Last Friday, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov said US-led coalition warplanes struck a funeral procession. \u201cDozens of Iraqi civilians died, including women and children,\u201d he explained. \u201cRussian reconnaissance pinpointed two jets conducting airstrikes on Daquq, located 30 kilometers to the south of Kirkuk, where, according to our data, there are no ISIS fighters,\u201d \u2013 a willful war crime. They\u2019re \u201calmost a daily routine for the (US-led) international coalition. Too often weddings, funerals, hospitals, police stations, and humanitarian convoys are being hit by the coalition warplanes.\u201d Russian General Sergey Rudskoy said \u201c(w)e are closely monitoring the situation around Mosul. So far we see no substantial progress in liberating this city from\u2026ISIS\u201d since operations began on October 16 \u2013 because no effort is made to do it. Last week, a coalition airstrike targeted a mosque south of Kirkuk, killing over a dozen women and children. A southern Mosul girl\u2019s school was struck. US-led coalition warplanes were operating in the area, clearly responsible for what happened. On October 25, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry reported over 60 civilians killed, over 200 others injured on airstrikes on residential areas in Mosul \u2013 locations where no ISIS fighters were present. So far, no fighting inside Mosul was reported. By the time, so-called liberating forces enter the city, ISIS fighters will be gone \u2013 redeployed to Syria to combat government troops and civilians. Moscow letting this happen without resistance so far makes the battle to liberate Syria harder. Is an offensive planned to rectify this blunder, compounded by failing to launch airstrikes against al-Nusra terrorists in eastern Aleppo since October 18? According to General Rudskoy, Russian Aerospace forces are monitoring the situation in the area of the Syrian-Iraqi border day and night with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and other reconnaissance means.\u201d \u201cRussian planes are on patrol missions in the airspace and are ready to immediately deliver strikes against terrorists.\u201d Aerial operations \u201cin a 10-km zone around Aleppo\u201d remain suspended. \u201cThe moratorium\u2026will be extended.\u201d The longer Russia delays full-scale aerial operations against US-supported terrorists infesting eastern Aleppo, the harder the struggle ahead to liberate the city and all key parts of Syria.
