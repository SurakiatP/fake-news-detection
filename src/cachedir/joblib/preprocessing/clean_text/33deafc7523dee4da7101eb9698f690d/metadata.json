S. airstrike last year on a hospital in Afghanistan. Its   report described a chain of human errors and equipment and procedural failures that led a gunship to repeatedly fire on the hospital, which was run by Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 people. Sixteen U. S. personnel were punished, but Doctors Without Borders and other groups insist that the episode should be handled as a war crime. _____ 3. Our Cairo bureau chief, Declan Walsh, was able to enter the   Syrian city of Aleppo, where   fighting resumed after weeks of relative calm. \u201cDeath,\u201d he writes, \u201ccan fall from the sky in any corner of the city at any time. \u201d Here are some of the photos from his Instagram feed. _____ 4. A few market markers: U. S. stocks finished down for the week, but Facebook shares soared after the company reported profits triple those of a year ago and proposed a new stock class to maintain Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s control. Apple\u2019s stock dropped after it revealed falling iPhone sales in China and disappointing earnings. And Twitter\u2019s price fell as well, after it again fell short of revenue projections. Two of our top tech writers discuss the developments here. _____ 5. Puerto Rico appears likely to default on a $422 million debt payment on Monday.

Above, the Capitol in San Juan. _____ 6. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing because you\u2019re getting a piece of this thing you helped build. \u201d That was a longtime employee of Chobani, the Greek yogurt maker, after his boss surprised 2, 000 workers by making them  . Stock packages, prorated by tenure, will collectively be worth up to 10 percent of the company\u2019s worth when it goes public or is sold. (Neither appears imminent.) _____ 7. For a special report, a New Yorker named Geri Taylor allowed a reporter to share the ups and downs of her life as she faces Alzheimer\u2019s with grace, fortitude and humor. She told friends recently that she and her husband live in the present. \u201cThere\u2019s none of that where you postpone saying something because he\u2019s in a bad mood or something,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I can\u2019t remember to postpone something. \u201d _____ 8. Leicester City  \u2014   pronounced    \u2014   is viewed as soccer\u2019s version of Cinderella. The team\u2019s unexpected success this year has it on the verge of an English Premier League title.
