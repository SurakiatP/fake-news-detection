On her, behalf, however, long-time Hillary aide Huma Abedin has told the FBI she was not aware any of her emails were on the laptop investigators seized as part of its probe info Anthony Weiner\u2019s investigation. \\nAccording to Politico , the FBI engaged in a back and forth over the weekend with Abedin or her attorney, when Abedin explained the situation. \\n\u201cShe says she didn\u2019t know they were there,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation said. This is a sensitive topic for Abedin and the Clinton campaign, because on previous occasions, Huma \u2013 under oath \u2013 disclosed that all the emails in her possession had been accounted for and handed over to the FBI. \\nAs CNBC adds ,\u201dthere are a number of scenarios that would explain how the emails got onto the laptop without Abedin\u2019s knowledge, including that they were somehow automatically backed up from the cloud. But investigators will want to know how this happened and if there is any indication that Abedin misled them about the existence of emails. It is a large project. Agents determined there were as many as 650,000 emails on the laptop, dating back years. The number of emails related to the Clinton investigation is likely to be much smaller. On Saturday, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Abedin had been fully cooperative with the FBI investigation. \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows anything more than what we\u2019ve seen in the press to date,\u201d Podesta said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019m sure\u2026if people\u2014proper authorities want to ask her questions, they\u2019ll ask her questions, but she\u2019s been fully cooperative in this investigation.\u201d \\nThe FBI is now filtering the emails using a software program that will separate out any emails that investigators have not seen before. Those will be kept in a separate file and will be examined by FBI agents to see if they contain classified material or information relevant to the Clinton probe. It is not clear what FBI Director James Comey will do with the information once the FBI obtains it. Standard practice is for the FBI not to comment on investigations \u2014 but this is not a standard situation. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d the source said. \\nIt is possible that Comey could indicate publicly what the FBI finds before Election Day next week, but that decision has not been made yet.'"}, "time": 1742561826.6413772}
