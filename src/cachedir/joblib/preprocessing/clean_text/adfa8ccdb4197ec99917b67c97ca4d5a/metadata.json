{"duration": 0.08812260627746582, "input_args": {"text": "'\u2014 Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 \\nRemington Research\\'s summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become \"increasingly competitive\": \\nLast week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. \\n\u201cThe presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen,\u201d said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group \\nOther state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey\\'s announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. \\nThe fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight\\'s Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 \\nRadio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could \"have a potentially huge impact\" on Election Day: \\nTrump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It\u2019s quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump\u2019s way. But that\u2019s provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he\u2019s been prone to do. Then there\u2019s the matter of Trump\u2019s emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. \\nIf Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign\u2019s final week. The hope is that there\u2019s enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton\u2019s corruption than worried about whether Trump\u2019s fit for office. \\nFiveThirtyEight currently has Trump\\'s odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI\\'s re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day.
