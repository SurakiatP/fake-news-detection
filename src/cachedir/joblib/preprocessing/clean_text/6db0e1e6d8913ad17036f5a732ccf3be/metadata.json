That seems hard to believe. After all, you would have thought that those secret Trump backers would have come out of hiding during Hillary Clinton\u2019s bad week in September. Even then, Hillary never dropped below 54 percent in the FiveThirtyEight average \u2013and Nate Silver\u2019s model responds fairly strongly to sharp changes in good polls. \\nA much more plausible scenario comes from Lyz Lenz, a freelance writer who is also one of the embedded liberals at her evangelical church in her small Iowa town. In a revealing piece for Marie Claire, Lenz tells us that there are a considerable number of born-again women who are backing Hillary\u2013but just keeping quiet about it. \\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Hillary has been one of the religious right\u2019s pet hates for almost three decades. This was true long before Bill Clinton was ensnared in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, for which many born-agains still haven\u2019t forgiven him. Additionally, in much of the evangelical world, women are expected to follow their husband\u2019s lead in virtually all matters\u2013including politics. \\nAdd it up, and it\u2019s no wonder that a number of evangelical Hillary supporters feel they have to stay in the closet\u2013and even feign support for Trump. This is particularly true in red-tinted small towns across America. Lenz describes this as the \u201cspiral of silence\u201d\u2013fear of being shunned when you voice an unpopular opinion. \\nLenz saw this first-hand. When she went to caucus for Hillary, she was surprised to see her friend \u201cMelody,\u201d the former head of a Christian non-profit and one of the most respected leaders in her town\u2019s evangelical circle, was also heading for the Hillary section. Over the next few months, she\u2019s met several other women in her town who are secretly backing Hillary. \\nOne of them, \u201cJennifer,\u201d works at a faith-based non-profit that helps women in need. The prevailing mentality there is that the GOP is \u201cthe only acceptable choice\u201d on election day. For that reason, she has to bite her tongue even when one of her coworkers shares nasty anti-Hillary memes on Facebook. Most of the time, she lets her colleagues believe she\u2019s supporting Trump as well, since most evangelicals assume that \u201cothers are like them.\u201d My girlfriend can attest to this; she once told me that when she went to her precinct at the time\u2013a church\u2013she mused about how everyone in line would react if they knew she was voting for Obama. \\nEven in households where both spouses back Hillary, the prospect of getting bombarded with twenty questions is enough for some women to keep their support for Hillary secret. One of them, \u201cSusan,\u201d has gotten in a number of knock-down, drag-out arguments with friends, co-workers, and family members who can\u2019t understand how her husband can support Hillary. As a result, she feels she doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe energy to go there\u201d and reveal she supports Hillary as well. \\nFortunately, these closet Hillary voters aren\u2019t alone. A number of private \u201cSecret Hillary Clubs\u201d have mushroomed on Facebook, and offer support and encouragement for Hillary supporters in fire-engine red areas. One woman in this club, \u201cAmy,\u201d remembers how her parents frequently called Hillary a \u201cliar\u201d or a \u201cbitch\u201d when she appeared on TV. Since she still lives near them in Ohio, she finds it \u201cvery difficult to openly support Hillary.\u201d \\nHowever, the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes seems to have prompted more evangelical women to speak out against Trump. For instance, one of the first evangelical leaders to blast Trump\u2019s debauchery was author and speaker Beth Moore. She made her feelings loud and clear in an epic tweetstorm on October 9. Wake up, Sleepers, to what women have dealt with all along in environments of gross entitlement & power. Are we sickened? Yes. Surprised? NO \\n\u2014 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 Try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don\\'t think it\\'s that big a deal. \\n\u2014 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 I\\'m one among many women sexually abused, misused, stared down, heckled, talked naughty to. Like we liked it. We didn\\'t. We\\'re tired of it. \\n\u2014 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 \"Keep your mouth shut or something worse will happen.\" Yes. I\\'m familiar with the concept. Sometimes it\\'s terrifyingly true. Still, we speak \\n\u2014 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 \\nRussell Moore (no relation to Beth), the president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission and a prominent member of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d crowd,\u201d told The Daily Beast that a number of evangelical women have privately told him that they were \u201chorrified\u201d and disgusted how so many Christian leaders continued to rally behind Trump. Many of them, Russell Moore said, have spent years teaching girls to \u201cfind their identity in Christ and not in an American culture that sexualizes and objectifies them,\u201d and are disgusted that their male counterparts are still backing a man who seems to be doing both. \\nIn some circles, however, the opening began long before 2016. My low-key charismatic church in Charlotte, for instance, is split almost down the middle politically; the sizable klatch of liberals there\u2013including yours truly\u2013don\u2019t feel pressured to keep our views in the closet. I started dating my current girlfriend during the primaries, and she was a Bernie Sanders supporter. When I first brought her to my church, no one raised an eyebrow at her Bernie bumper sticker\u2013or my Hillary sticker. Hopefully this is a sign that evangelical women who are leaning toward the Democrats can finally come out of the shadows.
