They did not have opportunities, they were relegated to the back of the line. \u201d \u201cAnd this was a country that  \u2014   to be honest  \u2014   was built on the promise of white prosperity above everything else. And for a lot of people, when they hear that message, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 deeply encoded in that message is a return to a time where white Americans can assume a certain amount of prosperity,\u201d she added.
