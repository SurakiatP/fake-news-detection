But the movie\u2019s plucky intimacy shines through that fog. It\u2019s a portrait, not a tribute  \u2014   though as the documentary reminds us, every portrait is in some way a tribute to something. The film, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens and Alexis Bloom, debuts on HBO Saturday night after the cable network moved up its premiere from March. That decision is hard to begrudge. As this movie makes evident, these two were no strangers to making headlines. Ms. Reynolds was well known to one generation for, in part, the tabloid bonanza surrounding her when her husband Eddie Fisher skipped out with her best friend, Elizabeth Taylor. Several other generations have grown up surrounded by all things Princess Leia, memorably played by Ms. Fisher in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d films. \u201cBright Lights\u201d finds mother and daughter living in separate houses in what they call \u201cthe compound. \u201d Ms. Fisher takes a souffl\u00e9 out of her oven and carries it on a tray down the path to her mother\u2019s house. \u201cI usually come to her,\u201d Ms. Fisher says. She pauses. \u201cI always come to her. \u201d Who wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019s Debbie Reynolds, movie star and cabaret performer. Ms. Reynolds rose to fame with cheery, wholesome roles, and even in her 80s could turn on that pert sunniness in a split second, so smoothly you\u2019d never know it was an act  \u2014   except that this is a documentary, and it includes the footage of just before this light clicks on. \u201cIt\u2019s not my best day,\u201d she sighs, sounding weary and a little   as she and Mr. Stevens discuss where exactly the camera will be. And then  \u2014   bing!  \u2014   there she is, as perky as a kindergarten teacher. Because the gently quirky celebrity documentary is an enjoyable if standardized format, the potency of \u201cBright Lights\u201d sneaks up on you. If it were just about its subjects\u2019 huge, starry lives, that really would be enough for a documentary. But it also smartly, and subtly, pushes its audience to ask two of modern pop society\u2019s central, uncomfortable questions: First, are famous people \u201creal\u201d people? And second, am I becoming my mother? By the time Mr. Stevens and Ms. Bloom start filming, this almost cosmic   between mother and daughter seems to have resolved itself to a wry but balanced mutual orbit. Though both women seem a little reluctant to admit it, the similarities between them abound. Ms. Fisher\u2019s house is decorated eclectically, with memorabilia and silly knickknacks everywhere. Ms. Reynolds\u2019s collection is far more orderly: She was among Hollywood\u2019s great archivists and had hoped to open a museum, but instead is resigned to auctioning off many of her pieces, including Marilyn Monroe\u2019s famous   dress from \u201cThe Seven Year Itch\u201d and a pair of Judy Garland\u2019s   shoes from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz. \u201d \u201cI like my ghosts,\u201d she tells her daughter. Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious, and she\u2019s frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar. We see both archival and    footage of Ms. Fisher in manic phases, and she\u2019s articulate, artful even, about her  . \u201cOne mood is the meal the next mood is the check,\u201d she says. But she too knows how to flip the switch. She refers to her appearances at fan conventions as \u201cthe lap dance,\u201d but engages with her fans nonetheless. A woman cries. Little girls in their Princess Leia costumes beam. Their heroine gamely poses for photo after photo, signing every manner of memorabilia. It\u2019s not so different, really, from her mother\u2019s cabaret act. That nightclub act comes up several times in \u201cBright Lights,\u201d including footage of a    Carrie being summoned to the stage to sing \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water. \u201d Her bold alto voice and sassy   almost, but don\u2019t quite, belie that she\u2019s a barely cooperative teenager desperate to rebel. Ms. Fisher says she rejected singing more or less to spite her mother. Six or so years after that nightclub performance, she married Paul Simon. You know. The guy who wrote \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water. \u201d It\u2019s all so Hollywood, so poetic, so dramatic. Despite their extraordinary circumstances, much of the family banter among Ms. Reynolds her son, Todd Fisher and Ms. Fisher seems like ordinary talk. Adult siblings agonize over an aging parent\u2019s finances and  . Mother and daughter have the same shoes. Brother and sister exchange knowing \u201cwell, that\u2019s Mom\u201d shrugs. There\u2019s no people like show people, but Hollywood families are, somehow, still just families.'"}, "time": 1742561954.4734173}
