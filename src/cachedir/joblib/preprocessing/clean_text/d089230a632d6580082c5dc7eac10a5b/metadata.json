All in 140 characters or less. As news organizations grapple with covering a commander in chief unlike any other, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account  \u2014   a bully pulpit, propaganda weapon and attention magnet all rolled into one  \u2014   has quickly emerged as a fresh journalistic challenge and a source of lively debate. How to cover a president\u2019s pronouncements when they are both provocative and maddeningly vague? Does an   tweet amount to a planned shift in American policy? Should news outlets, as some readers argue, ignore clearly untrue tweets, rather than amplify falsehoods further? In interviews on Tuesday, political editors and reporters said that, for now, they planned to apply the same news judgment they would apply to any statement by a powerful leader, even as some acknowledged that social media allows Mr. Trump to reduce complicated subjects to snappy, and sometimes misleading, slogans and sound bites. \u201cReporting complex policy issues out of tweets, I would say that\u2019s not ideal,\u201d said Carrie Budoff Brown, the newly installed editor of Politico, adding: \u201cWe have to treat it as one piece of a bigger reporting puzzle that we have to put together. \u201d But fundamentally, she said, the thoughts of a   are inherently newsworthy  \u2014   as long as journalists also provide readers with the right context, like whether a proposal is feasible or legal, or correct a baseless claim. \u201cThis is the way he\u2019s communicating with millions upon millions of people, and as journalists we can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d Ms. Brown said. Some readers disagree. On social media, there have been calls for news outlets to boycott covering Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets entirely. Critics say that any coverage elevates unsubstantiated assertions and murky policy suggestions. \u201cMedia would be wise to stop   of Trump\u2019s tweets  \u2014   they distract, distort and debase,\u201d Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of The Nation, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. The historian Fred Kaplan declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time to ignore his tweets,\u201d echoing others who wondered whether Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative statements were a deliberate effort to distract journalists. Part of the concern is that Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts can have a ripple effect in the media ecosystem. Producers of morning shows and newspaper assignment editors wake up to   statements from the future leader of the free world those remarks sometimes dominate coverage for hours. Even if journalists insert caveats or clearly label a statement as false, the remarks still reach a large audience. But many veteran journalists argue that keeping the public in the dark about their president\u2019s comments would be a worse sin. \u201cAnything that a president would say  \u2014   even if it was libelous or scandalous  \u2014   it\u2019s the president talking, and I think you report it,\u201d said Chris Wallace, the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host who moderated this year\u2019s third presidential debate. \u201cUnder any definition, it\u2019s news, whether it\u2019s sensible or not, factual or not, productive or not. \u201d Mr. Wallace recalled that as a reporter in Washington, he reported   from President Ronald Reagan as he boarded a helicopter to Camp David. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this is like Donald Trump making a statement on the way to the helicopter,\u201d Mr. Wallace said of the  \u2019s tweets. Handling Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account has been a hot topic in big newsrooms. Matthew Purdy, a deputy managing editor at The New York Times, said on Tuesday that the Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks had to be assessed one by one. \u201cClearly his tweets are a window into policy decisions or his state of mind,\u201d Mr. Purdy said in an interview. \u201cJust because he tweets it doesn\u2019t make it news. But just because he tweets it doesn\u2019t make it frivolous either. \u201d Steven Ginsberg, senior politics editor at The Washington Post, agreed. \u201cMy view, frankly, is that everybody is getting way too caught up with the fact that he\u2019s tweeting,\u201d he said, adding that even if Mr. Trump \u201cshouts something on a street corner, I think it\u2019s worth taking up on its own merits. \u201d \u201cIn this postelection period, anything he says in any way you have to consider it and you have to weigh whether it deserves a story,\u201d Mr. Ginsberg said. At some publications, the calculus about coverage is more about the resources on hand. At The Los Angeles Times, covering every Twitter post would prevent reporters from focusing on other political issues, like the future of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a smaller staff than some other folks do, so I\u2019m sure there have been ones that we\u2019ve passed on,\u201d said David Lauter, the paper\u2019s Washington bureau chief. Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets have become particularly intriguing. Typically,   hold news conferences after the election  \u2014   but Mr. Trump has not, offering few opportunities for journalists to question him about plans for his administration. (He has granted interviews to \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.) \u201cThese pronouncements on Twitter are the only available evidence of what the man is thinking, or wants us to think he\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, a former political activist who has criticized press coverage of Mr. Trump. There is also a novelty factor. American presidents, aware that their words carry gravity and consequence worldwide, are typically circumspect in their remarks, opting for dry statements and withholding major proposals until a legislative or legal framework is in place. Mr. Trump seems to relish doing the opposite, as he did throughout the election season. Jack Shafer, who writes about the media for Politico, said that journalists could ultimately best serve the public by being judicious in the way they report on Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets. \u201cI think that you starve the troll by just pointing out that the troll is lying and the troll is trolling,\u201d Mr. Shafer said. \u201cDon\u2019t ignore him, but hold him accountable when he tweets for effect. \u201d Some have speculated that come January, Mr. Trump may rely less on Twitter, once he moves into the White House and has the Oval Office and West Wing briefing room at his disposal. But asked about this on Tuesday, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, issued a reply: Don\u2019t bet on it. \u201c  Trump has amassed an incredible social media following, one he used very effectively throughout the campaign to communicate his message,\u201d Ms. Hicks said in an email. \u201cHe intends to continue utilizing this modern form of communication, while taking into account his new role and responsibilities may call for modified usage. \u201d For now, Ms. Hicks declined to say if Mr. Trump would move his musings to the White House\u2019s official @POTUS Twitter account. As of Tuesday, @POTUS had 12. 3 million followers. And @realDonaldTrump? 16. 3 million.'"}, "time": 1742628364.2445674}
