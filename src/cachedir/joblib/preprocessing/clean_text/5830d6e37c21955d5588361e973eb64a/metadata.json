Does this grandmother know all the words to Lose Yourself\u2026? Who cares, it\u2019s all clicks\u201d said one entertainment website owner. \\n\u201cOnce we worked out the old three dots and a question mark formula, then we knew we were set for life. People just can\u2019t help but click on that. It\u2019s like catnip for the bored mind\u201d. \\nIt is believed that the success of the formula is so great, that all news will come in that format in the near future. Already, Brian Dobson is working on his delivery of news headlines such as \u2018Were there many people killed in the Middle East today\u2026?\u2019 and \u2018Did the government get the 8th amendment sorted out\u2026?\u2019.'"}, "time": 1742562466.768494}
