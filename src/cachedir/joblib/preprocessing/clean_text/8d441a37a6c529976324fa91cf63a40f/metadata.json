According to Billboard, Cornell will perform with his former Audioslave bandmates Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk at the event, marking the band\u2019s first appearance together in 11 years.

Bad Presidents make for great music. Join us as we get loud and stand together to defend our rights, our country, and our planet. \u201d Tickets for the event are reportedly already sold out, though the full concert can be   on the Prophets of Rage Facebook page.
