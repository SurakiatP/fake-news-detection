[Addressing the decision Thursday afternoon in City Hall, de Blasio repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, deflecting reporters\u2019 questions by responding \u201cthe issue has been exhaustively investigated\u201d and told reporters this would be the final time he would discuss this matter.  \u201cIt simply confirms what I\u2019ve said all along and I was obviously pleased to see the issue closed,\u201d de Blasio said in a combative news conference with reporters. \u201cMy staff, my colleagues and I have acted in a manner that was legal and appropriate and ethical throughout. What matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year and no charges have been brought and this is the end of the matter. \u201d De Blasio has been the subject of multiple federal and state investigations since taking office in 2014. Federal investigations centered around the mayor\u2019s    scheme with donors who contributed to his 2013 mayoral election campaign, while the state focused on de Blasio\u2019s fundraising operation of his unsuccessful efforts to help Democrats regain control of the State Senate in 2014, along with his 2013   nonprofit campaign \u2018Campaign for One New York.\u2019 The surprise Thursday morning announcement from both federal and state prosecutors, issued just minutes apart, announced that neither would bring any criminal charges against the mayor or his aides. In a statement released Thursday morning, acting U. S. Attorney Joon H. Kim, said a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d was conducted regarding the mayor soliciting donations from those who sought political favors and found \u201cdifficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit. \u201d The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office announced its decision in a   letter to the state Board of Election. The critical and detailed letter of the \u201cextensive investigation\u201d  resulted in the conclusion not to bring charges since the mayor and his aides relied \u201con the advice of counsel. \u201d However, Vance emphasized the lack of an indictment didn\u2019t constitute \u201can endorsement of the conduct at issue. \u201d When questioned about Vance assessment that criticized his action, de Blasio said he doesn\u2019t \u201cshare their assessment. \u201d \u201cThey have an assessment, I don\u2019t share their assessment,\u201d de Blasio responded. \u201cThey had to make a judgment on whether anything inappropriate happened and their judgment was it did not. \u201d The move to conclude de Blasio parallel criminal probes came just days after Preet Bharara, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was fired by President Trump. Bharara led the   investigation into the mayor fundraising after a lead investigator at the state Board of Elections asked prosecutors to investigate whether de Blasio broke the law by funneling campaign contributions to Democratic state Senate candidates through state committee groups to evade donation contribution limits. Just last month, de Blasio met with Bharara voluntary for four hours regarding the probe. The meeting was considered to be the final step in determining whether or not charges would be brought. Since the meeting with Bharara, de Blasio repeatedly refused to go into detail about what was discussed due to the matter being an active investigation. Now with the investigation closed, half the questions the mayor faced during Thursday press conference were about disclosing the details of the interview. \u201cWhat matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year and no charges have been brought and this is the end of the matter,\u201d de Blasio responded. De Blasio refused to comment on whether it was a coincidence that Bharara was fired just days before the investigation was dropped and his personal feelings towards the former U. S. attorney. \u201cAgain, I am not going to comment on [Bharara] at this moment,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cPersonally, I appreciate him and his office conducting a diligent investigation and made the determination on a timely basis. \u201d Regarding his    scheme of donors calling him for a favor, de Blasio defended the issue, arguing that it is \u201cnormal\u201d for him to receive concerns from any individual and approach the city agencies to \u201cassess the situation. \u201d If anyone brings an issue to me, an elected official, community leader, a business person, an individual, we pass that to an agency to assess the situation to come up with a determination,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cI think it is normal for an elected official to receive concerns from people and pass them along for an agency to assess. That\u2019s how we have done things, that\u2019s how we will continue to do things. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563217.3139353}
