And, understandably, my female followers wanted to see an article written with them in mind. Now, I\u2019ve never inhabited a female body in this lifetime, and am ill equipped to say what works best for women. So I enlisted the help of my thousands of female readers by asking them a series of questions. I started by asking them what their favourite sex toy was. There were a few forerunners (all of which are mentioned near the end of this article), but the name that popped up (by FAR) the most frequently was the Magic Wand . Once the winner (by critical mass/popular vote) was established, I dove into the deeper questions. The Magic Wand (which was apparently originally intended to be a massage device) is most often used by women as a vibrator to achieve clitoral and/or combination orgasms. It used to be called The Hitachi Magic Wand, but the product was rebranded to just being called the Magic Wand in recent years. \\nThe following women that I quoted range in age from 20-60, and they live all around the world. Some of them asked that I used their real names, and others asked that I used a changed/anonymous name. \\nEnough with the logistics, let\u2019s get into it. If you\u2019ve ever considered upgrading your sex life with the Rolls Royce of women\u2019s sex toys, then this is the article for you. How Does The Magic Wand Feel? \\n\u201cIt\u2019s physically impossible not to cum. It\u2019s like being on a roller coaster\u2026 when it drops you, your body naturally has to scream. You couldn\u2019t sit there in silence even if you wanted to.\u201d \u2013 Jennifer D. \\n\u201cFeels intense, for me it\u2019s usually the one I go to for a quicker, more immediate orgasm (like trying to get a quickie in while the toddler naps!).\u201d \u2013 Allison D. \\n\u201cThe intensity is unlike anything else I\u2019ve ever experienced. I haven\u2019t used a different toy since purchasing. Intense, toe curling orgasms that can be as quick or long as you wish. And no batteries!\u201d \u2013 Rachel K. \\n\u201cThe Magic Wand feels VERY intense. What I do is build myself up manually until I am ready for the sensations it produces\u2013I\u2019ve never just gone to it from the start, that would be too much. I use it directly on my clitoris, starting on the low setting. For me, it begins to produce orgasm almost immediately\u2013however, it\u2019s different than using my hand, with a defined peak and decrescendo. \\n\u201cThe orgasm is instantaneous\u2026 the Magic Wand basically \u2018forces\u2019 my body onto a higher plane of pleasure. It takes me much longer to reach my peak, which means that I can orgasm for as long as I can handle it!\u201d \u2013 Annika C. How Do You Use The Magic Wand? \\n\u201cYou plug it in, apply the head of it to your clitoris, and begin seeing stars.\u201d \u2013 Alisha T. \\n\u201cI use it by myself and with my partner. He actually finds it really sexy.\u201d \u2013 Kassidy P. \\n\u201cI like changing up my position when using it. I like using it while I\u2019m on my knees with one hand on my headboard. Or when I\u2019m standing with the Magic Wand laying flat over the bed so I can prop my leg up and maneuver my body in the right position. I love changing up the position because it reiterates how powerful the toy is. \\nAside from switching up positions, when close to my orgasm, I change the pressure of the toy. Because it is such a powerful vibration, I try to hold it firmer and longer, even after my orgasm is finished. It almost feels torturous and there is something sexy about that. I also find it prolongs the orgasm and builds me up for the next one. The toy is so strong that the immediate reaction is to move it when your body is peaking. I found a lot of pleasure in seeing how far I can take it, holding it in the same position until I\u2019m squirming around uncontrollably. \\nUsing with a partner is also fun. I love being teased by it \u2013 over top of my panties or being tied up so I can\u2019t squirm away when the vibrations get so intense. I think it\u2019s a great toy to use solo and with someone else.\u201d \u2013 Rachel K. Any Specific Things That You Have To Consider While Using It? \\n\u201cYes \u2014 it is a bit loud so if you have roommates or thin walls, this is something you\u2019ll want to consider when purchasing.\u201d \u2013 Erica K. \\n\u201cI had an orgasm the very first time I tried to give myself one as a teenager and I\u2019ve been having them ever since. I never EVER had trouble on that front. So, for me, this is something I use if I have a lot of tumescence built up, haven\u2019t been with anyone in awhile, or just need to dull my very high libido for a day or two. I\u2019ll use it maybe once a month, and I\u2019ve gone months without touching it.\u201d \u2013 Annika C. \\n\u201cYes. Sometimes the lowest setting on the Magic Wand is still too intense for me, and I use this dial to bring it down considerably.\u201d \u2013 Amanda T. Pros And Cons Of The Magic Wand? \\nThe pros and cons were quite consistent from all of my interviewees across the board. Mainly (pros) that it\u2019s powerful, effective, and durable\u2026 and (cons) bulky, has a cord, and not very pretty looking. \u2013 Pros Of The Magic Wand \\n\u201cThe Magic Wand is great for high-intensity direct clitoral stimulation.\u201d \u2013 Erica K. \\n\u201cIt gets the job done, I don\u2019t have to charge it or replace batteries, it\u2019s super effective!\u201d \u2013 Allison D. \\n\u201cI would say both the pros and cons of this are derived from the fact that it makes you come fast.\u201d \u2013 Ostara C. \\n\u201cI bring the Magic Wand to every group sex session my partner and I have because it takes the pressure off the guys for having to make a girl (who\u2019s vagina they\u2019ve never met) cum.\u201d \u2013 Alexa R. \\n\u201cThe Magic Wand is responsible for the realization that I can squirt, as well! What I\u2019ve found is that the sensations will build and build, and in order to really reach the peak, I have to ejaculate first. It\u2019s truly out of this world!\u201d \u2013 Annika C. \\n\u201cPros for me are that those times when the little vibrator isn\u2019t getting me to an orgasm, the \u201cbig guy\u201d usually can. So if I WANT an orgasm and can\u2019t seem to get to it (usually masturbating) I can USUALLY get it with the big guy.\u201d \u2013 Lauren A. \\n\u201c1) It\u2019s super durable, 2) it\u2019s super powerful so with a dimmer it gives me maximum flexibility since I do have partners who like more intensity than I do, 3) Because it is a fairly well known product, it\u2019s easy to find accessories and attachments that make it more fun, 4) It actually works pretty well as a neck massager.\u201d \u2013 Joy D. \u2013 Cons Of The Magic Wand \\n\u201cThe downside is how bulky they are. Not easy for travel.\u201d \u2013 Anne R. \\n\u201cMy biggest thing with it is that it is STRONG. And personally, that\u2019s not always a good thing. When I first got it I would use it over a cloth or something so that it wasn\u2019t directly on my clit. And still I would orgasm and then have not fun tingly clit for ages after.\u201d \u2013 Lauren A. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit medical looking. Part of me wishes they came in fun colours. There\u2019s nothing really \u201ccute\u201d about it.\u201d \u2013 Rachel K. \\n\u201cI do prefer, for myself, to come more naturally and with something less POWERFUL (it really is very strong) as I like my clit to be sensitive. But sometimes I just want to cum and that\u2019s the toy to do it. But rarely do I use it right against my skin anymore. And when I have to press it really hard against myself, I know I\u2019ll have a sore clit for a few days (and not be able to masturbate again) so I have to want that orgasm a lot.\u201d \u2013 Heather S. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little addictive in a way, I find that if I use it too often I\u2019m less sensitive for using my other toys or manual stimulation or even if hubby goes down on me. Also, have to be careful not to get the inside of the white part wet when washing it.\u201d \u2013 Allison D. \\n\u201c1) It\u2019s big & not cordless so that\u2019s a little inconvenient, 2) without a dimmer switch it\u2019s too intense so might not be for everyone out of box, 3) the wand head is fairly big so if you are someone who likes more precision it\u2019s unwieldy.\u201d \u2013 Joy D. \\n\u201cThe cord may not be long enough. For me personally, it\u2019s not always as intense as I\u2019d like it to be.\u201d \u2013 Erica K. \\n(Editor\u2019s note: the cord is about 6 feet/2 metres long) Who Would You Recommend The Magic Wand To? \\n\u201cI would recommend it to any woman who likes to orgasm.\u201d \u2013 Lauren A. \\n\u201cI would recommend it to anyone. I don\u2019t have orgasms from penetration so I\u2019d especially recommend it to women who are on the same boat.\u201d \u2013 Kassidy P. \\n\u201cI\u2019d recommend this to anyone who wants to level up their pleasure and really explore their sexuality independent of a partner, but with the caveat that it\u2019s powerful and you don\u2019t want to become too dependent on it!! I use it independently of a man. I\u2019ve had two rabbits and neither of them came close. I adore a man\u2019s dick so much, there could be no substitute. I think that\u2019s another reason I love the Wand\u2013it\u2019s not like a dick!\u201d \u2013 Annika C. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve already recommended it to most of my friends (with the exception of the ones who aren\u2019t very sexual/kind of prudish). I would recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful orgasm\u2026 this is a fantastic way to achieve that!\u201d \u2013 Allison D. \\n\u201cI read a lot online before purchasing this. Lots of people said it\u2019s not the best starter toy. I disagree. I think any woman or couple looking to enhance their orgasms would find great value in this toy.\u201d \u2013 Rachel K. \\n\u201cI would recommend The Wand to anyone: wether you\u2019re new to vibrators or simply new to toys like the wand. Most women consider it their go-to.\u201d \u2013 Erica K. Are There Any Specific Attachments You Would Recommend Picking Up With The Magic Wand? \\n\u201cI got this dimmer switch for it which makes it way more usable for me personally. I do like it as a toy for play with a partner though!\u201d \u2013 Joy D. '"}, "time": 1742561726.5132544}
