As an investigative journalist, I once spent months working on a series of articles about what happens to the estates of people who die without wills. It can be ugly. In New York City, politically connected lawyers, judges and contractors can, as our reporting team found, feed on these unguarded estates like leeches on flesh at a nudist camp lake. In one typical case, my colleagues and I at The New York Post found that a Queens Surrogate\u2019s Court judge had appointed three lawyers connected to the local Democratic Party as \u201cguardians\u201d of potential heirs to the estate of a   childless woman. Ostensibly in search of heirs, they spent part of the deceased woman\u2019s $670, 000 estate on a junket to Puerto Rico for themselves, a court employee and their spouses. In the end, the   lawyer siphoned off $116, 025 in fees, while the dead woman\u2019s 14 cousins received inheritances of $33, 150 each. We worked our tails off on these articles back in 1998. At the end of the workday, I would return to the   apartment I had bought downtown for around $100, 000 a year earlier. Single, I would sort through my mail, reading paycheck stubs noting that I was dutifully funneling 5 percent of my paycheck into a 401( k) matched by my employer. And if I had been run over by a taxi (or a vengeful Queens lawyer) and killed, the same vultures would be free to feed on my estate  \u2014   because I was just like one of the unfortunates we had written about. I didn\u2019t have a will. Nineteen years later, I still don\u2019t. I\u2019m not alone. More than 50 percent of adults do not have a will, according to Chas Rampenthal, general counsel of LegalZoom. Certain people never reach one of those obvious points in their lives to write one. If you are unmarried in middle age, do not have children and have never had a devastating disease or brush with death, making plans for what happens to your stuff if you\u2019re not around may not feel pressing. But then you hit a milestone birthday, or a relationship becomes more committed, or your niece starts talking about attending an expensive art college  \u2014   or all of the above, and the hotelier Ian Schrager and his partners start erecting a luxury   across the park from your Lower East Side tenement. All of a sudden, you may realize that you are sitting on serious money that could matter to someone you care about. What to do? For Elias Colombotos, a painting contractor in Queens with no children, this moment came when his parents died, eight weeks apart, in 2012. Both had prepared very clear wills and other papers. In the case of his father, who had Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia, a health care proxy and other instructions left no doubt as to what to do about inserting a feeding tube. The answer was no. With his mother, the will revealed that she had, in clear and legally   language, disinherited him and his siblings  \u2014   although she had left money to her grandchildren. Soon after, Mr. Colombotos, now 57, called a lawyer to have his own will and other papers drawn, at a cost of $600. \u201cThat experience with my mother made me feel like this is an important thing to do right,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized how painful it could be, how much strife it could cause. \u201d Mr. Colombotos was very specific. He will be cremated. For now, some of his money will be split between two charities and the rest among his friends. His prized Yamaha acoustic guitar will be left to his sister, because it was such a moment of grace for them, when  \u2014   both childless  \u2014   he and she played music together at a beach house after their parents died. The experience had another beneficial effect for Mr. Colombotos: It pushed him to be more proactive in his dating life. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I love someone and feel safe enough with them to make them my beneficiary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a nice feeling. \u201d Whether it\u2019s best to make a simple handwritten will, to use an online legal service or to call a lawyer to make estate paperwork is a continuing debate. When I called lawyers, they said (not surprisingly) that using a lawyer is best. And when I called LegalZoom, with the online option, Mr. Rampenthal said, \u201cWe are talking about prices that start at $149 for a will bundle and $199 for living trust plans, which is often less than most lawyers charge for an hour of their time. \u201d The resulting documents, he said, are designed to stand up in any state. Jon Biondo, a veteran estates lawyer in New York, said he charges $750 for a basic estate package. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most satisfying purchase,\u201d he said, explaining one reason people put it off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work until you die. \u201d A search of a mobile app store for wills and trusts yielded   results. How to Write a Will for $2. 99 promises that it \u201cincludes some very helpful information for setting goals\u201d and tips on \u201chow to write a handwritten will. \u201d I pictured myself with a quill pen and parchment deeding some of my baseball cards to a childhood friend I hadn\u2019t seen since I was 9. The headline on the only review was, \u201cNot Worth It. \u201d Another New York estates lawyer, Anne Litwin, said there were some tricks of the trade that good lawyers knew. One is the best way to disinherit someone. \u201cIt\u2019s better to almost disinherit them than to totally do it,\u201d Ms. Litwin said. For instance, if you have an estate of $1 million, you could leave a closely related but troublesome family member $25, 000, and combine that with a   clause saying that if anyone challenges the will in court, they lose their inheritance. \u201cYou need to dangle something in front of them to incentivize them not to protest,\u201d Ms. Litwin said. But even a lawyer can\u2019t make sure every final request is honored. Lorraine Massey, a grandmother and entrepreneur known for popularizing   products, said she redid her estate after she sold her share in a company of which she was a founder. She asked her lawyer, she said, if she could specify in her will that no funeral director or anyone else straighten her hair for her final repose. The lawyer told her no, because by the time the will would be read, it would most likely be after the funeral. Her best strategy would be to repeat the request to her loved ones over the years. I decided I would go with the lawyers. The best way to start before visiting a lawyer is to write down what you want to leave to whom, said Joe Rosenberg, who teaches an estates class at the City University of New York School of Law. In my case, a copy of an early draft of the script from the \u201cFestivus\u201d episode of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d signed by Jerry Stiller, is typical of my weird collectibles. Others include: a videotape of the first television commercial aired in the new millennium, originally broadcast somewhere in the South Pacific a promotional boxing card from the night Laila Ali made her professional debut a knife Ferran Adri\u00e0 used to cook a Satchel Paige autograph and a nearly complete run of back issues of Heeb and Omni magazines. I don\u2019t want a junk dealer hired by Surrogate\u2019s Court coming in and dumping these gems. I decided that an old journalism chum, Gersh Kuntzman, author of a book on Chrismukkah, gets the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d script (even though I think I\u2019ll outlive him, because he eats too many hot dogs). It\u2019s a start. Sherry Amatenstein, a therapist and editor of \u201cHow Does That Make You Feel? True Confessions From Both Sides of the Therapy Couch,\u201d said that for years, she has advised patients to make wills, even though she never reached a life milestone that prompted her to do so. \u201cI have a condo, I have artworks, I have a dog, I have people I care about,\u201d she said. As a friend of mine, she promised me that when I\u2019m done with my will, she\u2019ll do hers. \u201cI think it\u2019s an act of love to do a will,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re trying to make life easier for those we leave behind. \u201d So, O. K. I\u2019ve started the process. My friend Kiri gets the Adri\u00e0 knife. I promise I\u2019ll finish writing the rest of the damn thing soon.'"}, "time": 1742562232.437714}
