[The    musician and record producer conceded as much in an interview with Variety when asked about an incident in which a couple walked out of a concert in Los Angeles due to comments he made about President Donald Trump.  \u201cNo,\u201d Rundgren said when asked if it bothered him. \u201cIf I had the power, I\u2019d say: If you\u2019re a Trump supporter, don\u2019t come to my show, because you won\u2019t have a good time. And also, I don\u2019t understand your frickin\u2019 values. Because I\u2019m not singing about that. If you don\u2019t understand that basic thing, you\u2019re just fooling yourself. \u201d The \u201cHello It\u2019s Me\u201d singer was talking to the magazine to promote his latest album, White Knight, which is filled with collaborations with artists such as Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Trent Reznor and Joe Walsh. One song on the album, \u201cTin Foil Hat,\u201d is a direct jab at Trump, written and performed with Steely Dan   Donald Fagen. The lyrics reference Trump\u2019s   descent down an escalator at Trump Tower to announce his presidential run, and add that Trump tweets \u201clike a teenage girl\u201d and \u201cputs the \u2018pluto\u2019 in \u2018plutocrat. \u2019\u201d Rundgren is currently on a   tour, with multiple dates in Florida and Texas, states that Trump won during the 2016 campaign. But the musician told Variety that Trump supporters \u201cwill likely be offended\u201d if they attend his concerts. \u201cLet the buyer beware! I mean, if you can\u2019t take a joke, or you can\u2019t admit that you\u2019ve made a mistake, you don\u2019t belong with the rest of us,\u201d he said with a laugh. Elsewhere in the interview, Rundgren explained that music is the most \u201cplagiaristic\u201d art when compared with other forms, because there are only so many ways musicians can arrange a limited amount of notes together. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the western   scale. That\u2019s essentially 11 notes. So you\u2019re eventually going to run out of melodies, just by the pure mathematics of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the whole art of making music is trying to obscure the fact that this is a melody from another song and has just been changed in subtle enough ways that you don\u2019t recognize it. \u201d Read Rundgren\u2019s full interview with Variety here.
