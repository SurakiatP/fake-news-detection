During the presidential campaign, the South   comic remarked that Donald J. Trump reminded him of an African dictator, mused over the mystifying complexities of the Electoral College system and pointed out the weirdness of states voting on recreational marijuana. In the countdown to and aftermath of the election, Mr. Noah has grown more comfortable at moving back and forth between jokes and earnest insights, between humor and serious asides  \u2014   the way he\u2019s done in his   act, and now, in his compelling new memoir, \u201cBorn a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood. \u201d By turns alarming, sad and funny, his book provides a harrowing look, through the prism of Mr. Noah\u2019s family, at life in South Africa under apartheid and the country\u2019s lurching entry into a postapartheid era in the 1990s. Some stories will be familiar to fans who have followed the author\u2019s   act. But his accounts here are less the polished anecdotes of a comedian underscoring the absurdities of life under apartheid, than raw, deeply personal reminiscences about being \u201c   \u201d in a country where his birth \u201cviolated any number of laws, statutes and regulations. \u201d The son of a Xhosa mother and a   father, Mr. Noah recalls that \u201cthe only time I could be with my father was indoors\u201d: \u201cIf we left the house, he\u2019d have to walk across the street from us. \u201d It was dangerous, as a   child, to be seen with his mother as well: \u201cShe would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn\u2019t hers. \u201d He spent much of his time at home: \u201cI didn\u2019t have any friends. I didn\u2019t know any kids besides my cousins. I wasn\u2019t a lonely kid  \u2014   I was good at being alone. I\u2019d read books, play with the toy that I had, make up imaginary worlds. I lived inside my head. To this day you can leave me alone for hours and I\u2019m perfectly happy entertaining myself. I have to remember to be with people. \u201d Language, he discovered early on, was a way to camouflage his difference. His mother knew Xhosa, Zulu, German, Afrikaans, Sotho and used her knowledge \u201cto cross boundaries, handle situations, navigate the world. \u201d She made sure that English was the first language her son spoke because \u201cif you\u2019re black in South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. \u201d \u201cEnglish is the language of money,\u201d Mr. Noah goes on. \u201cEnglish comprehension is equated with intelligence. If you\u2019re looking for a job, English is the difference between getting the job or staying unemployed. \u201d A gifted mimic, Trevor learned to become \u201ca chameleon,\u201d using language to gain acceptance in school and on the streets. \u201cIf you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn\u2019t look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you. \u201d Mr. Noah offers a series of   snapshots of life in the township of Soweto, where his maternal grandmother lived, and where, he recalls, \u201c99. 9 percent\u201d of the residents were black, and his light skin made him a neighborhood curiosity. He remembers: \u201cThe township was in a constant state of insurrection someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to be suppressed. Playing in my grandmother\u2019s house, I\u2019d hear gunshots, screams, tear gas being fired into crowds. \u201d To save money, Mr. Noah recalls, his mother perfected the art of coasting their old, rusty Volkswagen downhill \u201cbetween work and school, between school and home,\u201d and enlisting her son\u2019s help in pushing the car when the gas ran out. One month, he says, money was so short that they were forced to subsist on bowls of wild spinach, cooked with mopane worms, \u201cthe cheapest thing that only the poorest of poor people eat. \u201d By high school, Mr. Noah writes, he had become an enterprising businessman, copying and selling pirated CDs he and his business partners would soon segue into the D. J. business, throwing raucous dance parties in Alexandra, \u201ca tiny, dense pocket of a shantytown,\u201d known as Gomorrah because it had \u201cthe wildest parties and the worst crimes. \u201d After Mr. Noah\u2019s father moved to Cape Town, his mother married an auto mechanic, whose English name, Abel, recalled the good brother in the Bible, but whose Tsonga name, Ngisaveni, says Mr. Noah, meant \u201cBe afraid. \u201d Those names would turn out to be a harbinger of his stepfather\u2019s dual personality  \u2014   charming and eager to be liked on the surface, but, as Mr. Noah recalls, highly controlling, and capable of violence. In the end, \u201cBorn a Crime\u201d is not just an unnerving account of growing up in South Africa under apartheid, but a love letter to the author\u2019s remarkable mother, who grew up in a hut with 14 cousins, and determined that her son would not grow up paying what she called \u201cthe black tax\u201d  \u2014   black families having to \u201cspend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past,\u201d using their skills and education to bring their relatives \u201cback up to zero,\u201d because \u201cthe generations who came before you have been pillaged. \u201d It\u2019s the story of a fiercely religious woman, who attributes her miraculous survival from a gunshot wound to the head (inflicted by Abel) to her faith a woman who took her son to three churches on Sunday (as well as a prayer meeting on Tuesday, Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday) even when there were dangerous riots in the streets and few dared to venture out of their homes. The names chosen for Xhosa children traditionally have meanings, Mr. Noah observes: His mother\u2019s name, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, means \u201cShe Who Gives Back\u201d his cousin\u2019s name, Mlungisi, means \u201cThe Fixer. \u201d His mother, Mr. Noah writes, deliberately gave him a name, Trevor, with \u201cno meaning whatsoever in South Africa, no precedent in my family. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not even a biblical name,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s just a name. My mother wanted her child beholden to no fate. She wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628526.4959052}
