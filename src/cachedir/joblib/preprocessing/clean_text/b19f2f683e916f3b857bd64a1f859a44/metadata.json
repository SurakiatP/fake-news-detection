C.  \u2014   President Donald Trump, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in the Oval Office, said that the Academy Awards failure on Sunday evening was due in large part to Hollywood\u2019s obsessive focus on politics \u2014  attacking him, generally speaking. [Trump told Breitbart News in the exclusive interview that the Oscar fail may have been avoided had Hollywood\u2019s finest focused less on attacking him and more on getting the event\u2019s details right.  \u201cI think they were focused so hard on politics that they didn\u2019t get the act together at the end,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cIt was a little sad. It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn\u2019t feel like a very glamorous evening. I\u2019ve been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad. \u201d The Oscars comprised just one part of a lengthy interview, which ranged in topics from healthcare to tax cuts to immigration to trade and more. The rest of the interview is forthcoming here on Breitbart News. At the Oscars on Sunday evening, the Academy Award for Best Picture was read out by presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as being for La La Land \u2014  not the actual winner, Moonlight. The flub \u2014  already being dubbed the worst in the Academy Awards\u2019 history \u2014  has forced accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to apologize after overseeing the   process for 83 years. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,\u201d the firm said in a release, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThe presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation. \u201d The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Erik Hayden explained the  : In years past, the firm has provided two sets of winners\u2019 envelopes in briefcases that are sent to the Dolby Theatre, one briefcase for either side of the stage. In what was was supposed to just be a memorable movie reunion, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway ended up fumbling the presentation of best picture, as they were apparently holding the best actress envelope instead. Not only did Dunaway read off La La Land as the best picture winner, the confusion wasn\u2019t fixed until after several members of the Lionsgate movie\u2019s team had already spoken. \u201cI opened the envelope and it said \u2018Emma Stone, La La Land.\u2019 That\u2019s why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny,\u201d Beatty clarified, laughing nervously. The awful mistake came after hours of   by the Hollywood elites, who hammered the president in joke after joke. Now, the president has got the last laugh as he hammers Hollywood for its epic fail. More from President Trump\u2019s exclusive interview with Breitbart News is forthcoming.'"}, "time": 1742563160.661499}
