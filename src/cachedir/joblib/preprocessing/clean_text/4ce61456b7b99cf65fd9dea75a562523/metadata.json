I\u2019ll be calling a meeting in a minute to tear strips off some people\u201d Deveney confirmed. \\nEmployees at SplattTrap, who really needed to focus on their work, were told to up their charity donations to \u20ac50 each as part of Fancy Dress Friday as the current total \u2018wasn\u2019t worth boasting about on social media\u2019.'"}, "time": 1742562072.2957273}
