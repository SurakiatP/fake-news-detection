[Maduro, a former bus driver who served as his predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s foreign minister, has long enjoyed using his television program In Contact with Maduro to broadcast his dance moves. As the current crisis in Venezuela intensified, however  \u2014   with a ceaseless wave of protests beginning a month ago, in response to Maduro\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s attempt to dissolve the National Assembly and install itself as the national legislative body  \u2014   Maduro has appeared dancing on Venezuela\u2019s airwaves with increasing frequency.  Below are five times this year  \u2014   four times this month!  \u2014   that the head of state of one of the world\u2019s most volatile nations danced on television while his people demanded his ouster: May 3: Dance Celebration of Move to Draft a New Constitution, Narnia VS Venezuela pic. twitter.   \u2014   Yusnaby P\u00e9rez (@Yusnaby) May 3, 2017,  On Wednesday, Maduro appeared before the National Election Center (CNE) to formally demand the establishment of a \u201cConstituents\u2019 Assembly,\u201d which would draft laws in lieu of the   National Assembly and create a new national constitution from scratch. To celebrate his power move, Maduro danced before the head of the CNE on television, flanked by   officials. One video of this dance went viral on social media: a video apparently taken in Caracas of a television broadcast of Maduro\u2019s dance, which then pivots from the television to the window, where armored tanks are visibly confronting unarmed protesters below: April 26: \u201cEveryone Must Know How to Dance\u201d During a national event last week, Maduro mandated that all Venezuelans dance as part of a political effort to construct a greater socialism. \u201cThe youth of the Revolution must know how to sing, love, and dance to construct a peaceful and happy Revolution,\u201d he decreed. \u201cWe must all dance. Whoever does not know how needs to learn. \u201d The comments appeared to be part of a promotion of a new dance initiative meant to distract students from protesting Maduro\u2019s government, which he had announced that week: April 23: The \u201cSalsa and Urban Heart\u201d Initiative to Bolster the Bolivarian Revolution, Maduro announced that initiative on Sundays with Maduro, his weekly television program. The initiative is meant to channel youth energy into frivolous dancing, rather than organizing an   movement on the streets. The nation\u2019s student population has been at the heart of the opposition protests, as young Venezuelans who have lived most of their lives under socialism have largely rejected the destruction of their country under Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro. Maduro announced that the initiative was intended to provide opportunities to young students to \u201cexpress themselves\u201d in a healthy way. While the head of state typically dances salsa in public  \u2014   he loves the genre so much he also hosts a radio program called Salsa Time  \u2014   in this video, he attempted to dance to   music along with breakdancers: April 21: Dancing in Lab Coats,  On April 21, Maduro appeared on television wearing a lab coat and what appears to be a stethoscope dancing salsa with his wife, legislator Cilia Flores. This particular episode of his weekly program elicited severe criticism over Maduro\u2019s mockery of the protesters, including a man who confronted an armored tank wearing nothing and holding a Bible and protesters who were forced to flee into a toxic sewer to avoid being attacked by military tear gas canisters in Caracas: February 18: Patriotic Congress of Youth Dance, Thursday afternoon in Caracas, and Maduro declares the start of Carnival  \u2026    . pic. twitter.   \u2014   Nathan Crooks (@nmcrooks) February 16, 2017,  In a less recent episode that appeared to embarrass his vice president, the   \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d Tareck El Aissami, Maduro appeared on television to celebrate a socialist youth assembly meant to bolster loyalty for his dictatorship. Amid the celebration, Maduro announced the start of the national Carnival festivities. \u201cWe declare the launch of Carnival and we are going into the streets to dance,\u201d he announced before the music began and he did as he promised.
