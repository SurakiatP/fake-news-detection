The decision came two days after the N. C. A. A. announced that it would move championship games for the coming year, including six in the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament, touching off contentious debate between opponents of the law, who praised the N. C. A. A. for taking a stand, and supporters of the law, who said the association was inappropriately inserting itself into politics. \u201cThe A. C. C. Council of Presidents made it clear that the core values of this league are of the utmost importance and the opposition to any form of discrimination is paramount,\u201d Commissioner John Swofford said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is one of principle. \u201d The A. C. C. \u2019s action was not only another blow to the state, but one sure to hit home in every sense: Four of the conference\u2019s 15 members are in the state, and the conference has its headquarters in Greensboro. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about native North Carolinians, and particularly those of us who grew up in the A. C. C. this is a pretty powerful statement against the birthplace of that conference,\u201d said J. Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, N. C. The law, commonly referred to as House Bill 2 or H. B. 2, nullified local government ordinances establishing   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and requires people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that correspond with the genders listed on their birth certificates. The statute is the subject of federal lawsuits. James P. Clements, the president of Clemson, said: \u201cThe decision to move the   championships out of North Carolina while H. B. 2 remains the law was not an easy one, but it is consistent with the shared values of inclusion and nondiscrimination at all of our institutions. \u201d In recent days, athletic directors at North Carolina\u2019s four A. C. C. member universities  \u2014   the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina State Duke and Wake Forest  \u2014   issued statements expressing concern about the law or its effects. In a joint statement, the chancellors of U. N. C. and North Carolina State, Carol L. Folt and Randy Woodson, said Wednesday: \u201cWe appreciate the Council of Presidents\u2019 reaffirmation of the A. C. C. \u2019s strong commitment to diversity and inclusion,\u201d adding, \u201cHowever, we regret today\u2019s decision will negatively affect many North Carolinians, especially in the affected host communities. \u201d Hours after the A. C. C. announced its move, Gov. Pat McCrory, who is seeking   this fall, used a statement to repeat, verbatim, 67 of the words he used Tuesday to comment about the N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision. Mr. McCrory, on Tuesday and Wednesday, said he encouraged \u201call public and private institutions to both respect and allow our nation\u2019s judicial system to proceed without economic threats or political retaliation. \u201d Mr. McCrory did not specifically criticize the A. C. C. but this week, he described the N. C. A. A. as \u201ca     monopoly\u201d that had not demonstrated respect for  . The speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said the decisions by the N. C. A. A. and the A. C. C. were \u201cvery unfortunate. \u201d \u201cNo one ever wants to lose events under any circumstances, but these organizations are certainly entitled to host their events wherever they choose,\u201d Mr. Moore, a Republican who supports H. B. 2, said. \u201cThe truth remains that this law was never about and does not promote discrimination. \u201d Mr. McCrory\u2019s Democratic rival, Roy Cooper, the state\u2019s attorney general, said in a video released Wednesday that the governor had shown \u201cno leadership. \u201d \u201cThis is not just about sports,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cThis is about communities in North Carolina suffering real economic blows. \u201d The conference, which said it would announce future sites, has just a few weeks to relocate its first affected championship, for women\u2019s soccer, which had been scheduled to take place in Cary beginning Oct. 30, and less than three months to find a new venue for its marquee event, the football championship game, scheduled for Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte on Dec. 3. Six other championships featuring sports like men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming and diving, men\u2019s golf and baseball are scheduled to be held at   venues. The men\u2019s A. C. C. basketball tournament, frequently held in the state, was already set to be staged at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Some championships hosted by specific universities will not be affected, like the men\u2019s and women\u2019s   championships at North Carolina State. Beyond those championships and   A. C. C. games, the other major college sports event set to take place in the state is the Belk Bowl, which will pit an A. C. C. football team against one from the Southeastern Conference on Dec. 29 in Charlotte. The Charlotte Sports Foundation, which hosts the Belk Bowl and the A. C. C. football championship, said in a statement Wednesday that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the football title game was moving, adding, \u201cWe recognize the economic impact moving the game and its events have on the Charlotte area. \u201d Frank Kay, a spokesman for the host organization, said there were no talks about relocating the Belk Bowl. Mr. Swofford had presaged the A. C. C. \u2019s decision in a statement late Monday night, saying that the N. C. A. A.\u2019s action \u201ccontinues to build upon the negative impact\u201d the law \u201chas already had on the state\u201d and adding that he personally felt the law should \u201cbe repealed as it\u2019s counter to basic human rights. \u201d Charlotte, which is North Carolina\u2019s largest city and which Mr. McCrory governed as mayor for 14 years, has been especially hard hit by the fallout from the law. In addition to the A. C. C. title game, the National Basketball Association\u2019s 2017   Game was withdrawn from the city this summer in reaction to the law. Charlotte\u2019s municipal efforts to strengthen legal protections for transgender people were part of what prodded the General Assembly to pass H. B. 2. \u201cThe cancellation of the 2016 A. C. C. football championship is a blow to Charlotte\u2019s visitor economy and is irreplaceable at this late date,\u201d said Tom Murray, the chief executive of the Charlotte Regional Visitors\u2019 Authority, which estimated that the A. C. C. \u2019s 2015 football title game had an economic impact of more than $32 million. But the mounting economic toll spreads far beyond Charlotte, ensnaring cities like Greensboro and Cary, which is just outside Raleigh and had been scheduled to host N. C. A. A. championships in baseball, lacrosse, tennis and soccer. Mayor Nancy Vaughan of Greensboro, whose father was a longtime A. C. C. official, said in an interview Tuesday, \u201cWe are in the process right now of bidding games and tournaments for the next four years, so we are really looking at the possibility of a   drought. \u201d Scott Dupree, the executive director of the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance, said that for sports events in North Carolina, this week has been \u201cunprecedented and historically bad, probably the worst ever in terms of lost business and damage to our brand. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562190.839519}
