Embassy in Tel Aviv against President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary halt on refugees while the government revamps its flawed security screening process. [Here are some of the screaming headlines about the miniscule protest:  L. A. Times: \u201cProtesters in Tel Aviv compare Trump immigration order to Israeli refugee policies. \u201d Jerusalem Post: \u201cIsraelis protest Trump travel ban, citing history of Jewish refugees. \u201d I24 News: \u201cProtesters \u2018fight back\u2019 against US, Israel\u2019s refugee and immigration policies. \u201d Times of Israel: \u201cAt Tel Aviv protest, activists hear echoes of Israeli policy in Trump\u2019s refugee ban. \u201d The L. A. Times article was also picked up by Yahoo! News. Despite the headlines, the articles themselves could not hide the small size of the protest, prompting questions as to why the news media would find the gathering newsworthy in the first place. The L. A. Times conceded the crowd consisted of \u201cseveral dozen demonstrators. \u201d The Times of Israel put the number at \u201csome 40 protesters. \u201d  The Jerusalem Post also cited about forty demonstrators. The turnout is particularly disappointing for Tel Aviv, a city known for its ability to mobilize massive numbers of   protesters. Trump\u2019s executive order halts visas for 90 days for \u201cimmigrants and  \u201d from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq. The order further suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering and lowered the ceiling to 50, 000 for refugees allowed to enter the U. S. during Fiscal Year 2017. Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
