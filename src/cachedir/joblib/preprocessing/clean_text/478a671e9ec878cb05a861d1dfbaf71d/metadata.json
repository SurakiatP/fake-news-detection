The hackers inserted a picture of the gorilla Harambe on the site, and exposed what appeared to be explicit photos of the actress, along with pictures of her driver\u2019s license and a passport, and images of her with stars like Rihanna, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. The website was taken offline after the hack, which was initially reported by TMZ. An email to a representative for Ms. Jones was not immediately returned on Wednesday. The website, which had contained information about her comedy career and her past work in film, appeared to have been retooled to display the personal photos and information. There was no way to independently confirm that the photos were of Ms. Jones and whether the identification documents were real, but the address on the driver\u2019s license appeared to correspond with information about Ms. Jones that is available through public records. Ms. Jones, 48, had spent much of the past month battling online trolls who sent her a stream of racist imagery, pornography and abusive language. She briefly left Twitter, but later returned to tweet about the Rio Olympics. In the hours after Ms. Jones\u2019s site was taken offline,   defenders offered public support. \u201cThese acts against Leslie Jones are sickening,\u201d the musician Questlove wrote in a post on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s racist  sexist. It\u2019s disgusting. This is hate crimes. This ain\u2019t \u2018kids joshing round.\u2019 \u201d Others, including Paul Feig, the director of the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d film, the comedian Patton Oswalt and the singer Katy Perry defended the actress on Twitter. Brendesha Tynes, a professor of education and psychology at the University of Southern California who specializes in social media and cyberbullying, said in an interview that part of what was fueling the attacks against Ms. Jones was a \u201cserious   woman problem in the U. S. \u201d Dr. Tynes noted the criticism levied at the Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas while she was competing in Rio, and said, \u201cEven the slightest perceived infraction leads people to get bullied. \u201d Ms. Jones herself had stood up for Ms. Douglas while in Brazil. Sameer Hinduja, the   of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of Criminology at   University, applauded Ms. Jones for standing up to those who have victimized her over the past several months. \u201cShe was an advocate for others that have been victimized and haven\u2019t spoken up, and that has led to more attention, and has, perhaps indirectly, led to policy change on Twitter\u2019s part,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to the company\u2019s taking action against some of the accounts that had hurled racist insults at Ms. Jones. He added that Ms. Jones\u2019s willingness to remain an active   presence may have made her a more tempting target for bullies and hackers. \u201cSome of those that cyberbully attempt to identify something that you\u2019re particularly sensitive about, and because they know that it will get under your skin,\u201d Dr. Hinduja said. \u201cOr they\u2019re just biased and intolerant, as perhaps was the case considering the racial hatred in some of the attacks on Leslie Jones. \u201d Dr. Tynes said that the hack on Wednesday felt particularly harrowing after Ms. Jones had seemed to prevail over those who attacked her earlier this summer, elevating her public presence by using social media sites such as Twitter and Snapchat prolifically during the Olympics. \u201cI have to say, as a human being, it\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Dr. Tynes said. \u201cAs a researcher, I haven\u2019t seen in the adolescents I study anything this heinous. \u201d She said that attacks like these could have serious consequences on a victim\u2019s mental health, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that people will once again rally behind her, show her love, and hopefully serve as a buffer against some of the potentially negative consequences,\u201d Dr. Tynes said. \u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words, but I do know that people will rally behind her once again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628596.7796793}
