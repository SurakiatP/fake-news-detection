In winning the presidency, Donald J. Trump proposed a grand hypothesis: that the federal government can be managed like a business. \u201cIf we could run our country the way I\u2019ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of,\u201d he told voters in the final presidential debate. It\u2019s a theory that has been suggested, to various degrees, by almost every president in the last century, from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama. What\u2019s different this time is the vigorousness of the experiment. With his inauguration on Friday, and a cabinet that is likely to include three billionaires, five former chief executives and some of the business world\u2019s most accomplished leaders, Mr. Trump is poised to test, perhaps once and for all, if good governance and crafty deal making are really similar skills. But, as anyone who has spent time in a laboratory can attest, experiments are messy. Separating the signals from the noise takes diligence. And in this case, so much will depend on the savviness of those woeful billionaires who had it so good, and now will be guinea pigs thrust into a maze that has overwhelmed so many test subjects before them. \u201cRunning an agency is very, very different from running a company,\u201d said Carlos M. Gutierrez, who was commerce secretary under George W. Bush after serving as chief executive of Kellogg\u2019s. \u201cSome of the skills do transfer, but you have to be careful figuring out which ones. In government, you can\u2019t fire anyone. Your board of directors is 535 people in Congress, and half of them want to see you fail. \u201d One of the first challenges will be figuring out what \u201cbusiness leadership\u201d means when so many of capitalism\u2019s tools  \u2014   firing misbehaving employees giving raises to those who overperform  \u2014   aren\u2019t allowed by federal rules. \u201cC. E. O.s who come in saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to show everyone how it\u2019s done,\u2019 are the ones most likely to fail,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. One problem has always been that while the business world rewards leaders for an intense focus on a singular goal  \u2014   maximizing profits as efficiently as possible  \u2014   government yearns for the opposite: pleasing the largest number of people with methods that offend the fewest. And while competition is usually a good thing within business, inside government, it\u2019s often more corrosive, as the partisanship of the past decade demonstrates. \u201cYou succeed in Washington by collaborating,\u201d said Henry M. Paulson Jr. who was widely lauded as Treasury secretary for Mr. Bush and, before that, as chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Businesspeople tend to see competition as a means to find the best solutions, a sorting device that pushes the smartest ideas ahead. But many of the trickiest government issues, like immigration or tax reform, involve dozens of agencies, as well as lawmakers and lobbyists, who must be persuaded to cooperate. Intelligence in government is almost always a humble, group activity. \u201cYou can\u2019t just think about your own agency, or your own goals,\u201d Mr. Paulson said. \u201cYou have to please both sides of the aisle, while making sure you\u2019re not outshining other officials, and persuading employees who don\u2019t have to obey your orders. And you have to adjust to having a boss, the president, instead of being the boss. It takes a lot of humility. \u201d Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks might have an easier time making the transition than others. Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil and the choice for secretary of state, is among the nominees who have spent their careers involved in the    operations of complicated firms that span continents. \u201cTillerson has basically been a politician for the last 20 years he\u2019s just been doing it for the nation of Exxon,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who became Treasury secretary during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term after leading the aluminum company Alcoa. \u201cHe\u2019s negotiated with foreign governments, he\u2019s had more than 80, 000 employees. You don\u2019t run a company that size by telling people what to do. You learn how to persuade them to follow your vision, to accommodate all kinds of different agendas and personalities. \u201d Other cabinet secretaries have spent their careers mostly as investors, not as direct managers. Hedge fund and private equity professionals like Steven T. Mnuchin, likely to be the next Treasury secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been tapped as education secretary and Wilbur L. Ross, the expected commerce secretary, have largely devoted their lives to buying and selling companies. And so there are questions about how well they will make the shift to jobs that demand a    focus on the smallest details of governance. Mr. Ross, whose confirmation hearing was held on Wednesday, presents a fascinating test subject. As an acquirer of steel mills, coal mines and other heavy industries, he has amassed a personal fortune worth billions. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had businesses that actually operated in some 23 countries,\u201d Mr. Ross said at the hearing. \u201cWe have been on the ground in all of the major trading partners of this country. \u201d Usually, when Mr. Ross buys a new company, he follows a pretty successful script: He shows up, says a few words and then hands operations to professional managers who know how to run things  \u2014   and who know he will fire them if they fail. However, when Mr. Ross takes the oath of office, that script will change. He will be whisked off to the executive wing of the Commerce Department and walked past long rows of barren offices. (The furniture of political appointees is removed during each presidential transition, and  \u2014   spoiler alert  \u2014   it often takes weeks for new desks and bookcases to arrive.) If he can find enough chairs, he might call a meeting of the few employees milling around (his deputies and key department heads need senatorial approval, which might take a few months). He will be handed dozens of binders explaining how his department does everything from monitor weather satellites to administer patents, and admonished to study up. (Congress loves humiliating cabinet members who haven\u2019t done their homework, and explaining that you are an excellent delegator, alas, fails to impress on Capitol Hill.) If Mr. Ross hopes to fly to one of the department\u2019s satellite offices, he will have to decide if he wants to complete the reams of paperwork needed to use his own jet, or go coach, as secretaries in previous administrations were encouraged. \u201cPerception matters a lot in Washington,\u201d said Karen G. Mills, who always flew in the cheap seats as administrator of the Small Business Administration after a career in finance left her with more than $40 million. \u201cI did, however, try to avoid the middle seat. \u201d If Mr. Ross is lucky, by the end of his first day, someone will have shown him where the bathrooms are. There\u2019s a risk, however, that the agency\u2019s permanent staff\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 goal will be to find ways to sabotage each new cabinet secretary as soon as they walk through the door,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who was a campaign adviser to Mr. Trump. \u201cAll those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. There won\u2019t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them. \u201d Worst of all, though, is that at the end of his tenure, no matter how hard Mr. Ross works or how much he sacrifices, a large part of his success  \u2014   as well as that of the other secretaries and this experiment as a whole  \u2014   will be outside his control. Ultimately, the most important variable in testing this hypothesis will be Mr. Trump himself. What kind of management style will he adopt? Will he be an operator or a delegator? Will he change as president, or simply relocate and remain C. E. O. in chief? How a president behaves filters into the cabinet, and senior officials, no matter how talented or powerful they once were, become an appendage of their new boss  \u2014   a hard demotion for any former master of the universe. If Mr. Trump can\u2019t manage the presidency, then no one working for him is likely to succeed. And vice versa. So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation, pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires. They are sacrificing themselves so that all of us might learn. And, in case they are wondering: The bathrooms are down the hall and around the corner. You\u2019re responsible for replacing the toilet paper if you\u2019ve used the last of the roll.'"}, "time": 1742564514.3135493}
