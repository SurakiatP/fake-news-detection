First, Hillary is in favor of increasing the H1B Visas to satisfy her corporate supporters. Secondly, if the TPP passes, foreign corporations can bring in their own workforce and pay them less than an American worker, especially since most make less than $3 an hour. In fact, a foreign corporation can go to arbitration if it feels not enough foreign workers are being let in. Next, we allow about a million new legal immigrants in each year. And then those legal immigrants can call for other family members. Next, she says she will bring in thousands of refugees, with everybody competing for those great retail/consumer/financial jobs. We're aiming to be as congested as China, only poorer.\\nThen behind the TPP, she'll be pushing for the TTIP. That should pretty much wrap things up for us.\""}, "time": 1742628435.4676733}
