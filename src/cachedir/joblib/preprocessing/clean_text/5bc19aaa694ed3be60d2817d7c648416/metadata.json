Wade. [The march in Washington, D. C. this past weekend \u201c[d]espite its lip service to \u2018diversity,\u2019\u201d \u201cturned out to be just another front for the abortion lobby, promoted by Planned Parenthood and its cronies,\u201d reported Breitbart News. It was \u201cnothing more than a front for the U. S. abortion lobby\u201d that \u201cquashed attempts of   feminists to participate. \u201d  Breitbart News reported that the event pitched as a \u201c\u2019grassroots effort,\u2019 in reality, [was] a massive   choreographed assembly paid for by major donors such as George Soros and Planned Parenthood. \u201d The list of \u201cPartners\u201d of the event in the nation\u2019s capitol included: Catholics for Choice, the Center for Reproductive Rights, The Coalition of Nasty Women, EMILY\u2019s List, Free the Nipple, GLAAD, NARAL   America Foundation, National Abortion Federation, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Institute for Reproductive Health, Pussyhat Project, and Planned Parenthood. Although only   women were allowed to officially participate in the march, Breitbart News reported that the president of America\u2019s largest organization of   youth \u201ccrashed\u201d the march. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, wrote on her Facebook page  \u2014   \u201cYeah so they wouldn\u2019t let us in their march so we just ran ahead and got in the front. \u201d She did so after she posted a photo of her group holding a banner \u201cAbortion Betrays Women: # . org. \u201d This weekend   women, men, and families will be traveling from all over the state to attend the 2017 Texas Rally for Life on the south steps of the Texas Capitol in Austin. According to the event website, www. TexasRallyforLife. org, more than 57 million unborn children have been aborted since that 1973 U. S. Supreme Court decision.

Melissa Ohden, an abortion attempt survivor and the author of the book, \u201cYou Carried Me,\u201d is the keynote speaker at the rally this Saturday. \u201cThe Texas Rally for Life commemorates the tragic Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. That decision struck down Texas law protecting unborn babies from abortion, a law that had been on the books since 1865. We expect thousands of Texans from across the state to converge at the Capitol in Austin to show the Legislature and the media that Texas is  . More than 40   organizations across the state have formed a host committee to sponsor and promote this event. Texas Alliance for Life is proud to be one of them,\u201d Joe Pojman, Ph. D. executive director for Texas Alliance for Life told Breitbart Texas.

Texas State Representative Briscoe Cain (  Park) told Breitbart Texas, \u201cOn Saturday, Texans  will be gathering on the Capitol grounds to march united against the abortion cartel. I stand with them in the Texas Capitol. \u201d Many of the representatives in Texas are   and Texas has been a leader in passing   legislation. As reported by Breitbart Texas last June, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision which was a significant blow to Texas abortion law by striking down Texas House Bill 2 (HB 2). In a   decision, the nation\u2019s highest court struck the legislation signed into law in 2013. The case of Whole Woman\u2019s Health et al. v. Hellerstedt overturned provisions that Texas representatives said were designed to improve the quality of care for women and improve the sanitary conditions of surgical centers used to provide women\u2019s health services.
