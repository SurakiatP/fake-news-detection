Well, she\u2019s got some bad news for, dare I say it, Commander in Chief Donald Trump. \\nVia UsualRoutine \\n\\nBaba Vanga, who\u2019s known to her followers as the \u2018Nostradamus of the Balkans\u2019, has claimed Obama is the last President of the United States of America. Vanga allegedly called the election of Barack Obama as well, predicting the 44th president of the United States would be an African American \u2013 also making the chilling claim that he would be the \u2018last U.S. president\u2019.\\nUsually, I\u2019d be happy to dismiss the reaction to Vanga\u2019s prophetic prediction as the public clinging onto a ray of hope in today\u2019s new political climate, but actually, the blind mystic has a pretty great track record with her visions. The prophetess, who died aged 85 in 1996, is alleged to have made hundreds of predictions about the future with an 85 per cent accuracy rate, from her home in Petrich, Bulgaria.\\n\\nThese prediction include climate change and the melting of the polar ice caps, which she allegedly foresaw back in the 1950s, saying: \u201ccold regions will become warm \u2026 and volcanoes will awaken\u201d.\\nVanga\u2019s followers also say she predicted the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, warning a \u2018huge wave\u2019 would descend on a \u201cbig coast, covering people and towns and [causing] everything to disappear under the water\u201d. Back in 1989 she warned that the \u2018American brethren\u2019 will be attacked by \u2018two steel birds\u2019, a possible reference to the Twin Tower attacks in 2001.\\n\\nShe also warned that a group of Muslim extremists would invade Europe by 2016, foreseeing a \u2018great Muslim war\u2019 that would be kick-started by the Arab Spring in 2010 and play out in Syria, eventually resulting in the establishment of a caliphate by 2043 with Rome at the center. According to The Mirror she claimed this \u20182016 invasion by Muslim extremists\u2019 across Europe would mean the continent would \u2018cease to exist\u2019 by the end of the year. She specifically said: \u201c[Extremists] would use chemical warfare against Europeans.\u201d\\nVanga\u2019s political predictions take on a new poignancy posthumously; could her assertions about the elusive 45th President equate to predicting an assassination attempt, or simply that Donald Trump is, as previously expected, a cyborg?\\nBaba Vanga for President? Anyone?\\n'"}, "time": 1742561647.334378}
