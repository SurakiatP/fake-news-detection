A view of the Dome of the Rock Mosque in the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, Monday, May 2, 2016. \\nWhile the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a \u201cMuslim holy site of worship\u201d was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. \\nAnd the Muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1,300 years, but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which they\u2019re pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. \\nIsraeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam, was tantamount to denying Israel\u2019s absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem \u201cwas and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.\u201d \\nThe al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory.

The survivors of that genocide are in Palestine and scattered throughout the region. \\nWhen the Jews were finally driven out of Palestine, for treachery and terrorism, the great majority of them went North into Eastern Europe. Some scattered into other regions of the Middle East and North Africa, where they integrated and lived among the other tribes before and after the transition to Islam. The J6ws that went into Europe, over the centuries, were driven from state to state because of their conspiracies, treachery, arrogance, usury and all of the other characteristics they exhibit today in Palestine and on Wall and Fleet Streets. \\nAfter the Jewish \u201ckingdom\u201d in Canaan was defeated, by the Assyrians in 351 BCE, the Jews never were allowed to rise to power again. Their >600 year reign in Canaan was marked by oppression of non-Jews, marauding and attacks on the most heavily traveled trade route in the world. After 66 BCE, for a time, Rome made the error of trying to allow the Jews limited self-rule, which ended in rioting, conspiracy and terrorist attacks by the J6ws on both Romans and the other tribes of Palestine. \\nFrom the time of the final defeat of the last Jewish terrorists in 135 CE, until the early 20th Century, Palestine was one of the most peaceful regions of the world. It benefited from a lack of obvious oil resources \u2013 avoiding attention from Western greed. The only upsets during that almost 2000 years were the defeat of the Byzantines (the remnants of the Roman Empire), the European \u201cCrusades\u201d, a couple of Asian incursions and a few tribal squabbles. \\nBy 1900, Palestine was one of the most productive agricultural regions of the Middle East and a major exporter of citrus and olives. Its \u201cJaffa Brand\u201d oranges were famous throughout the world (I\u2019ve never eaten one. But, I have a crate with most of the paper label in my office). \\nThe Jew claim that all of the land they obtained in Palestine was purchased is ludicrous. They went to some FORMER land owners of the DEFUNCT Ottoman Empire and paid them something to sign bills of sale to land they didn\u2019t own and had probably never seen. \\nI read one report by a British officer in the Palestine Mandate. His unit was sent to investigate an attack on a small Palestinian town. They found the ENTIRE POPULATION of the town slaughtered, many of the bodies mutilated and most of the women and girls raped, with some tortured. The animals, including house pets, had all been killed and many mutilated. After further investigation, the British Army concluded that the massacre had been carried out by Irgun terrorists and that Menachem Begin almost certainly led the slaughter. This is the sort of sub-human that Jews \u201celect\u201d as their Prime Minister. \\nThe Zionists have the delusion that they can re-write history to suit their cult. They are sadly mistaken. Lonny \\nNot contrary to you being a racist @$$hoIe, you spend every day of your life whining about Jews for several hours a day. tapatio \\nNO, JEW-BOY, I SPEND PART OF MOST DAYS HELPING TO BRING ABOUT THE DAY WHEN THE DISEASE, OF WHICH YOU ARE PART, IS ERADICATED AND HUMANS CAN HAVE PEACE AND DECENCY. Lonny \\nYou spend part of your days hating Jews and the other part blowing jihadis, tapaDILDO. Hating Jews doesn\u2019t make you decent. It makes you a racist lowlife. Kagey1 \\nMint Press, you disingenuously fail to state the true objection of Israel to the UNESCO vote. That it fails to also include the Jewish origins of the site. In fact, the resolution appears to state that Jerusalem is only holy to Muslims. It negates the prior Jewish and Christian connections. That is the objection, not the inclusion of the later Muslim connection. tapatio Lonny \\nTapaDILDO still trying to get negative attention from Jews. Little crybaby never got enough attention from mommy. tapatio \\nSince the Jews invaded and committed GENOCIDE in Canaan/Palestine about 3000 years ago \u2013 yup, they were there before Muslims or Christians. The Christians appeared 2000 years ago and the Muslims came 1400 years ago. But, since the Jews\u2019\u201cclaim\u201d to Palestine is based on their genocide of the Canaanite kingdom after the Jews were driven from Egypt, that claim would seem to be shaky at best. \\nAnd, ancient Judaism became functionally extinct at tel Megiddo in 135 CE \u2013 1881 years ago. The \u201cJews\u201d that we see today are the descendants of Eastern European barbarians who were converted to Judaism by the few survivors of their terrorist war against Rome. \\nToday\u2019s Jews and their ancestors NEVER saw Palestine until Rothschild\u2019s Zionist disease. The FEW (about 17,000) Jews that lived in Palestine before Zionism were ALL Europeans, living on European charity \u2013 mostly in Jerusalem. They were ultra-orthodox whose entire function was to \u201cstudy\u201d the Torah and pornographic Talmud \u2013 the NEVER worked. \\nHumanity really needs to comprehend fully that this cult, that has been driven from more than 100 countries in the last 2000 years is NOT \u201cPERSECUTED\u201d. JUDAISM IS A TOXIC CULT-URE THAT LIVES ON THE BLOOD OF OTHERS \u2013 VAMPIRES, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, VOLTAIRE AND OTHERS. \\nGREAT JEWISH LEADERS \\nThere goes Tapadildo inventing a fake history again, as always. \\nJews didn\u2019t invade. Jews lawfully immigrated under the Ottomans and so did the Arabs. \\nJews committed no genocide there. The Arab population grows at one of the fastest rates on the planet. \\nThere hasn\u2019t been a Canaan for 3500 years\u2026 but you\u2019re whining about it as though it was last week. No mention of all the genocides against non-Muslims over the last 1400 years? How about the ones this year? \\nHating Jews has turned you into a frothing lunatic, obviously. DumbTwat. ivanacardinale \\nYOU ARE GREAT!!! WITH THIS, YOU JUST SHUT UP LOONY TUNES!!! tapatio \\nThanks, but don\u2019t count on that shutting up Lonny. They are assigned to sites and he probably won\u2019t quit unless he quits/is fired from his job. Lonny \\nWhy don\u2019t you lead by example and show everyone how to shut-up, TapaDILDO. \\nNah, you thrive on several hours\u2019 worth of negative attention from Jews every day. ivanacardinale \\nHe might be one of those Mossad trollies, being paid to do the job, the social media counterattack Lonny \\nYou might be one of those racistCUNTS\u2026 Wait, \u201cmight?\u201d\u2026 sorry.

Who do you claim it belongs to, racistCUNT? \\nJews were also \u201cPalestinians\u201d and were \u201cPalestinians\u201d longer than any Arabs were, racistCUNT. ivanacardinale \\nSo, you are palestinian then!!! Is in your DNA!! Lonny \\nJews are the actual Palestinians, racistCUNT. It\u2019s in your DNA to be a racistCUNT. tapatio \\nNO Jew has more than a trace of Semitic DNA. That was almost eradicated at tel Megiddo in 135 CE. The traces that exist in SOME Jews are from the terrorists that managed to escape from Megiddo (all men) and breed with the barbarians of Southeastern Europe. \\nThe Iranian and other native Middle Eastern Jews are not Semitic, but Persian, Ethiopian, etc., so far as I know and I taught anthropology for 35 years. Lonny \\nTapaDILDO and his 1.5 terabytes of insane Jew-hate. Too funny. moosehorn \\nSo the sorry sad son of wxxre that you are admits that Palestinians exist? Lonny \\nSorry, stupid\u2026 did you think you wanted to engage in a conversation about what constitutes a \u201cPalestinian\u201d? moosehorn \\nLol, you are a sorry stupid piece of crap. Lonny \\nSays the phuqqstain who couldn\u2019t engage in a topic if his worthless life depended upon it. moosehorn \\nIvana was right by referring to you as loony toones. Lonny \\nI\u2019m right by referring to you as a dumbschitt. tapatio \\nYou already showed us what you had for lunch today, TapaDILDO. moosehorn \\nYou keep proving that you are a mentally challenged Axxhole. Lonny \\nThe day you offer a mental challenge to anyone is the day you stop being a phuqqstain and graduate into average idiocy. moosehorn \\nBravo, couldn\u2019t come up with a better description. Lonny \\nOf what pours into your Jew-hating mouths. tapatio \\nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/77ca2bb6a1767c6776e94afaf505f28bad3b6bb346e4d3d500d1dd0f010ddc9a.jpg moosehorn \\nI bet your parents are siblings, such stupidity and ignorance is but the result someone conceived by incest. Lonny \\nI bet that\u2019s a jihadiQoqque banging against your tonsils. Such blowing skills are the result of someone who\u2019s practiced a lot. tapatio \\nNo \u201cmight\u201d about it. He/she/it is a hasbara troll, either working out of Palestine (and paid with money stolen from the American taxpayer) or is some Jewish escuincle working out of his mama\u2019s Brooklyn apartment. Lonny \\nThere \u2018s a definite about this: You are one dumb Jew-obsessed, racist @$$hoIe. tapatio \\nIt\u2019s obvious. So is the lunacy and stupidity behind this obsession. tapatio \\nBTW, discussions in other venues STAY on those venues. ivanacardinale \\nWell, then America belongs to the native, original peoples, so, the rest of us should start packing their bags and go back to where we come from. Same thing with Europe. It was a Roman Empire, so, Europe belongs to the Italians then. Can the \u201cisraelis\u201d stop the crap of ancient documents? in which world they think they are living? During thousands of years everybody invaded, killed and squattered each other. So, if we go for history, NOTHING BELONGS TO NOBDY!! Michael Hess \\nThe supreme irony is that Islamophobes are always going on about how backwards Muslims are wanting to protect their culture going back to ancient times, yet Hasbarians do the same thing. \\nMeanwhile, as the article states, there is simply nothing at all that is controversial in this resolution, the scandal is as made up as Benghazi and Ambassador Stevens and Hillary. \\nThe fact is, there was no state of Israel prior to May 14th, 1948. So these people need to get it out of their heads because you cannot claim sovereignty to a single dunam of land before that. Of course, as more people learn that Palestine was an officially and legally created country twenty-four years before Israel, things are getting far more interesting. \\nWorse yet still for Israel, the rogue state has no legal hold over Jerusalem at all in the real world not rules by little fragments of papyrus and religious imagery back when people did not bathe and thought that the stars were oil lamps that someone lit up each night. \\nUN Security Council resolution 476 and about eighteen others prove that Israel holds no legal sovereignty in Jerusalem whatsoever, this is precisely why the US Embassy Act of 1995 is waived every six months because by moving the embassy, that would put the US in violation of more than several Security Council resolutions. Lonny \\nSorry, moron. You are always lying about Jews. Who\u2019s criticizing Arabs for protecting their culture? You mean, when there are those among them who ATTACK OTHER cultures that you think is an attack on Islamic culture? You think it\u2019s a preservation of Islamic culture when ISIS began perpetrating a genocide on the Yzidis? \\nThere is something controversial, numbnutted goatface\u2026 They refuse to use the Jewish terms for the places, even though those are the terms which have been the prolific ones for thousands of years. \\nThe fact is, goatfaced Jew-hater\u2026 Israel was around 2000 years ago, so there was a state of Israel before May 14, 1948, and Jews have been praying at the Western Wall for millennia. And they certainly had sovereign land there historically. You really are one heck of a Jew-hating loser, goatface! \\nIsrael has plenty of legal hold over Jerusalem in the real world, goatface. See how it exercises its legal hold? Who are you claiming it belongs to? You know who REALLY never had sovereignty over a single dunum of the land over there? Palestinian Arabs. \\nYour misapplication of what you think are laws are not credible. And misusing the 4th Geneva Convention is what is not valid. ivanacardinale \\nYou puke violence through your words, and also ignorance. Violence is the weapon of the people that has no reason. We know very well the history of that land. And you seem to invent it. And I laugh when i read every year about \u201cIsrael Independence\u201d. From whom got the independence? From which Empire? the Palestinian? the Roman? the ottomans? or from the UN? Most countries has battle for years for independence against an empire. Israelis got it through what? as far as we know, you are being called the haggana? Lonny \\nActually, the only reason people puke around you is they see your face. \\nViolence is what you use to defend yourself, stupid. You come on here and attack me\u2026 I never attacked you\u2026 and then you want to pretend you\u2019re innocent on top of it! What a dumb hypocrite! \\nYou clearly don\u2019t know the history if you think there wasn\u2019t a Jewish kingdom there before. \\nIsrael got independence from a region which hadn\u2019t been sovereign in 2000 years. The last people who ruled it were the Ottomans, and very temporarily the British. There were no nation-states in that region at the time. Suddenly, there were, because that\u2019s how the Allies set it up after beating Germany and the Ottomans. \\nDidn\u2019t know that, did you? \\nBefore there was even a Hagganah, the Jews were struggling for independence there, and even when it was under Ottoman rule they asked for independence. \\nYou don\u2019t know much of anything. Now, prattle back at me and pretend that I\u2019m violent, when you\u2019re the ignorant one who opened up their mouth at me first. tapatio \\nEasy-bake monkey, STFU.

BELOW IS THE HEBREW TEXT FROM FEIGLIN\u2019S FACEBOOK PAGE. THIS CREATURE IS TYPICAL OF THE JEWISH ANIMALS THAT HAVE INVADED PALESTINE. \\nTRANSLATION OF FEIGLIN\u2019S FACEBOOK POST\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \\nWith God\u2019s Help Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Mr. Prime Minister, We have just heard that Hamas has used the ceasefire to abduct an officer. It turns out that this operation is not about to be over any too soon. The failures of this operation were inherent to it from the outset, because: a) It has no proper and clear goal; b) there is no appropriate moral framework to support our soldiers. What is required now is that we internalize the fact that Oslo is finished, that this is our country \u2013 our country exclusively, including Gaza. There are no two states, and there are no two peoples. There is only one state for one people. Having internalized this, what is needed is a deep and thorough strategic review, in terms of the definition of the enemy, of the operational tasks, of the strategic goals, and of course, of appropriate necessary war ethics. (1) Defining the enemy: The strategic enemy is extremist Arab Islam in all its varieties, from Iran to Gaza, which seeks to annihilate Israel in its entirety. The immediate enemy is Hamas. (Not the tunnels, not the rockets, but Hamas.) (2) Defining the tasks Conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters. (3) Defining the strategic goal: To turn Gaza into Jaffa, a flourishing Israeli city with a minimum number of hostile civilians. (4) Defining war ethics: \u201cWoe to the evildoer, and woe to his neighbor\u201d In light of these four points, Israel must do the following: a) The IDF [Israeli army] shall designate certain open areas on the Sinai border, adjacent to the sea, in which the civilian population will be concentrated, far from the built-up areas that are used for launches and tunneling. In these areas, tent encampments will be established, until relevant emigration destinations are determined. The supply of electricity and water to the formerly populated areas will be disconnected. b) The formerly populated areas will be shelled with maximum fire power. The entire civilian and military infrastructure of Hamas, its means of communication and of logistics, will be destroyed entirely, down to their foundations. c) The IDF will divide the Gaza Strip laterally and crosswise, significantly expand the corridors, occupy commanding positions, and exterminate nests of resistance, in the event that any should remain. d) Israel will start searching for emigration destinations and quotas for the refugees from Gaza. Those who wish to emigrate will be given a generous economic support package, and will arrive at the receiving countries with considerable economic capabilities. e) Those who insist on staying, if they can be proven to have no affiliation with Hamas, will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. f) When the fighting will end, Israeli law will be extended to cover the entire Gaza Strip, the people evicted from the Gush Katif will be invited to return to their settlements, and the city of Gaza and its suburbs will be rebuilt as true Israeli touristic and commercial cities. Mr. Prime Minister, This is the a fateful hour of decision in the history of the State of Israel. All metastases of our enemy, from Iran and Hizballah through ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood, are rubbing their hands gleefully and preparing themselves for the next round. I am warning that any outcome that is less than what I defined here means encouraging the continued offensive against Israel. Only when Hizballah will understand how we have dealt with Hamas in the south, it will refrain from launching its 100,000 missiles from the north. I call on you to adopt the strategy proposed here. I have no doubt that the entire Israeli people will stand to your right with its overwhelming majority, like myself \u2013 if only you will adopt it.

When almost EVERY culture finds Judaism toxic, JUDAISM IS TOXIC . \\nEvery expulsion of Jews below was preceded by widespread and extreme crime and abuses BY JEWS. The Jews have been expelled from more than 100 countries. Listed below are ONLY expulsions that could be directly linked to RAMPANT JEWISH CRIME. They had NOTHING to do with \u201cpersecution\u201d of Jews. However, often, innocent Jews suffered because of guilt by association with their predatory culture. \\nThe expulsions of Jews were acts of SELF-PRESERVATION by non-Jewish cultures. \\nExpulsions of Jews\""}, "time": 1742628594.515233}
