She approached Comey directly when she learned about the information and ordered him to stand down, saying he was violating Department of Justice policy. \\nAccording to her, it would \u201cinterfere with the election.\u201d \\nJames Comey, however, was apparently sick and tired of being bossed around. He stared back at her and declared that he had a duty to Congress and the American people to let them know what is REALLY going on. \\nComey said, \\n\u201cI ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE MISLEADING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE WE NOT TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD.\u201d \\nSo thank you, FBI Director Comey, for finally growing a pair and standing up to the Hillary Clinton and Obama machine. Now the American people know the TRUTH about Hillary Clinton, and that will end her reign of terror. \\nIf you want to show Comey your support, then share this out so everyone can see that the man is a hero just in case Obama uses some dirty trick to try and sabotage him too\u2026 '"}, "time": 1742561899.464758}
