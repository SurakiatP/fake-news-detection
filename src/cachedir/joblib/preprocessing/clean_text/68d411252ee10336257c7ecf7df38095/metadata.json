Perhaps their living preferences have shifted. Or the demands of the labor market have, and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting. Maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring. Or the benefits of cities themselves have improved. \u201cThere are all sorts of potential other amenities, whether it\u2019s cafes, restaurants, bars, nicer parks, better schools,\u201d said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. \u201cBut a huge piece of it,\u201d she said, \u201cI think is crime. \u201d New research that she has conducted alongside Keren Mertens Horn, an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and Davin Reed, a doctoral student at N. Y. U. finds that when violent crime falls sharply, wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into   and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods. Their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities, falling crime has a comparable effect, spurring gentrification. And it highlights how, even if many Americans  \u2014   including, by his own words,   Donald Trump  \u2014   inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring, the opposite   trend has brought   change to cities. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment,\u201d Ms. Ellen said. \u201cThat has repercussions far beyond what we think of. The homicide rate has gone down  \u2014   that\u2019s directly the most important consequence. But there are all sorts of repercussions as well. This really has been a sea change. \u201d Nationally, violent crime peaked in 1991. It fell precipitously for the next decade, then more slowly through the 2000s (and there\u2019s a whole other set of theories about why that has happened). While homicides have increased recently in some cities, rates remain far below what they were 25 years ago, including in Chicago. (Another    reality check, while we\u2019re at it: Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that homicides in his new home in Washington were rising by 50 percent, apparently citing the previous year\u2019s crime statistics. At that time in July, though, the rate in the city was already falling compared with 2015, and by year\u2019s end, it was down by 17 percent.) The new research looked at confidential geocoded data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, and more recent American Community Surveys, to identify the neighborhoods where more than four million households moved. Using citywide violent crime data from the F. B. I. the scholars tracked the changing probability of different demographic groups moving into central cities, as opposed to suburbs, as crime fell.   and   movers  \u2014   and to a lesser degree, whites  \u2014   appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups.   and minority households, for instance, didn\u2019t become more likely to move to cities as they grew safer. That may reflect the fact, Ms. Ellen suggested, that   families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime. Or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have. A household facing racial discrimination, high housing costs or the need to be near supportive family members simply has fewer options  \u2014   and less leeway to be choosy  \u2014   than the     households that this research identifies. \u201cWhen cities feel safer, that opens people\u2019s eyes,\u201d Ms. Ellen said of the willingness of new groups to consider these neighborhoods. It\u2019s entirely likely that the arrival of more affluent residents affected crime, too  \u2014   either by increasing opportunities for property crime in the short term, or by adding eyes on the street and pressure on the police in the long run. Because this research looked at moves that occurred after crime was already falling, the authors believe the movers were reacting to changes in crime and not simply causing it themselves. But the relationship between crime and gentrification in particular is complex. Wealthier residents may bring new tensions to neighborhoods, fearing  \u2014   and reporting  \u2014   criminal activity where none exists. And such demographic change in cities could play a role in pressuring the police to pursue tactics that feel unduly aggressive to the people who preceded the newcomers. This study also doesn\u2019t offer evidence that existing residents were displaced by the new arrivals. Many of the urban neighborhoods studied had lost population, so they had room to grow again without pushing existing residents out. But the possibility that these trends portend higher housing costs and more housing demand in the future in poorer, minority neighborhoods adds a cautionary note, Ms. Ellen said, to the declining crime trend.'"}, "time": 1742564515.3573139}
