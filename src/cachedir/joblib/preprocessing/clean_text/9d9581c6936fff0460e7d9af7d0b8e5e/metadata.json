That kitchen definitely isn\u2019t kosher, even though the family that gathers around it  \u2014   the three adult children of an ailing father, Lou Fischer  \u2014   are outspoken  . Irritable and animated, the Fischers come vibrantly alive in this young playwright\u2019s funny, bruising, searching voice. The play, a Roundabout Theater Company production that opened on Wednesday night, begins in 2000 in an    neighborhood of Washington. The Camp David summit meeting has failed, ushering in the collapse of the   peace process. The renewed intifada seems removed from the    worries of Lou (Larry Bryggman) his children and their spouses and offspring. But world events have a funny way of inviting themselves into this   Colonial. Rocks thrown a world away encourage deeply personal reflections of what it means to be a Jew in America at the turn of the 21st century. The Fischers are a mostly secular clan, and Mr. Levenson doesn\u2019t deck them with Jewish markers  \u2014   there are no skullcaps and no bagels, no briskets and no bris. These characters don\u2019t kvetch or kvell, at least not in those terms. The younger daughter, Sharon (Maria Dizzia) a teacher, used to take Lou to temple, but her observance has dwindled since she discovered her boyfriend and the cantor entangled on her new duvet. Her great regret: \u201cNow I have to get it \u201d she tells her brother, Michael (Jeremy Shamos). The older daughter, Holly (Kate Walsh of \u201cPrivate Practice\u201d) a homemaker and design hobbyist, goes to services only on High Holy Days. Michael, a professor of Jewish studies, doesn\u2019t go at all. If Michael is the least religious character, he is also the one most consumed by questions of Jewish identity. He has just finished writing an incendiary book arguing that the persistence of the Holocaust in the minds of American Jews has hollowed out Jewish life. Michael, who hurls his words like so many Molotov cocktails, insists that the Holocaust has made contemporary Judaism \u201ca religion and a culture of, frankly, death and death worship,\u201d and recommends forgetting it. (This point and others owe a debt to Norman G. Finkelstein\u2019s 2000 book, \u201cThe Holocaust Industry. \u201d) These claims don\u2019t sit well with Lou, a World War II veteran who helped liberate Dachau. In a   conversation with Michael, he describes, simply and feelingly, what he saw there and why he can\u2019t and won\u2019t forget. \u201cFor you, history is an abstraction,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for us, the ones who survived this century, this long, long century, there are no abstractions anymore. \u201d This speech, poignantly delivered by Mr. Bryggman, elicited spontaneous applause. But so did the earlier and wholly contradictory tirade loosed by Mr. Shamos. No one in Mr. Levenson\u2019s play gets to make the definitive statement. Not even Mr. Levenson. Like other intellectually rigorous plays about to open  \u2014   J. T. Rogers\u2019s \u201cOslo,\u201d Paula Vogel\u2019s \u201cIndecent\u201d and Lynn Nottage\u2019s \u201cSweat\u201d  \u2014   \u201cIf I Forget\u201d speaks to both the head and the heart. No condescending sense of    here. The problems of what we should remember and what we should forget, who we should be and how we should love seem to confuse Mr. Levenson, too. (The current renewal of   rhetoric and the threats to Jewish spaces have only made the play\u2019s quandaries ring louder.) When it comes to big questions, and smaller ones, too, every character makes reasonable arguments  \u2014   even flaky Holly, even   Sharon  \u2014   and also unreasonable ones. Sorting through that welter of competing claims is a real hassle. And a great gift. But focusing too intently on the play\u2019s stimulating politics risks scanting its humor and its family dynamics. Mr. Levenson has a longtime interest in strained relations between parents and children  \u2014   you can find it in his debut play, \u201cThe Language of Trees,\u201d and in his book for the hit Broadway musical \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d Yet he has never created a clan as quick to wound and quick to reconcile as the Fischers. \u201cIf I Forget\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. The plot, which turns on a question of real estate, takes its time arriving and mostly hangs around to facilitate debate. (And in these debates all the most penetrating arguments go to the men.) That Michael would publish his controversial book just as he\u2019s up for tenure strains credibility, and a later subplot about credit card fraud is even more unlikely. Under Daniel Sullivan\u2019s sensitive direction, the ripe interstitial music nudges emotion too obviously and the ending, which shifts the play into magical realism, makes its themes too explicit. (Mr. Levenson has never been one to wear his metaphors lightly.) But the script and the remarkable actors make you embrace the Fischers  \u2014   however quarrelsome and distractible and fumbling they may be. Watch Michael (in Mr. Shamos\u2019s astonishing performance) and Holly (in a tough and comic turn from Ms. Walsh) play siblings who tear each other apart, then make the same wavering gesture to end the quarrel. Watch Michael and his wife (Tasha Lawrence) and Holly and her husband (Gary Wilmes) and son (Seth Steinberg) reveal layers of injury and devotion. Watch them all stand in the   and warble \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d  \u2014   a family unable to agree on pretty much anything, yet still somehow in unison.'"}, "time": 1742562637.1707733}
