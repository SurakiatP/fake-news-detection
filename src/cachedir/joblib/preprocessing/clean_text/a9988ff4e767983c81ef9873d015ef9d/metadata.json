[In one of the most notorious religious liberty cases in recent years, Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, were found guilty of discrimination in 2013 of for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a   couple because it violated the tenets of their Christian faith.  The court sentenced the Christian couple to a fine of $135, 000 for the \u201cemotional damage\u201d they had allegedly caused the lesbian pair. Rachel   and Laurel   had accused the Kleins of \u201cmental rape,\u201d adding that they had suffered a \u201closs of appetite\u201d and \u201cimpaired digestion\u201d from the ordeal, which remarkably led to simultaneous \u201cweight gain. \u201d In 2015, Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian slapped a gag order on the Kleins, following the couple\u2019s interview with Family Research Council\u2019s Tony Perkins. During the interview, Aaron said among other things, \u201cThis fight is not over. We will continue to stand strong. \u201d \u201cThe Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries hereby orders [Aaron and Melissa Klein] to cease and desist from publishing, circulating, issuing or displaying, or causing to be published   \u2026     any communication to the effect that any of the accommodations   \u2026     will be refused, withheld from or denied to, or that any discrimination be made against, any person on account of their sexual orientation,\u201d Avakian wrote. \u201cThis effectively strips us of all our First Amendment rights,\u201d wrote the Kleins on their Facebook page. \u201cAccording to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech. \u201d \u201cWe lost everything we loved and worked so hard to build,\u201d she said. From the beginning, the Kleins have made it clear that they have never refused service to anyone based on sexual orientation, but their religious convictions did not permit them to participate in a gay wedding, which they believe to be immoral. \u201cWhen we opened our bakery, we loved serving all customers who came into the shop, regardless of their identity or beliefs. My cakes were my canvas,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cMy bakery wasn\u2019t just called \u2018Sweet Cakes Bakery,\u2019 it was \u2018Sweet Cakes by Melissa\u2019 because I pour my passion and heart into each cake I make. My faith is a part of that. \u201d Although the Kleins\u2019 situation is bleak, shifting winds in Washington may give cause for a modicum of hope. The Obama administration sent regular signals that religious liberty would be made to bow before lifestyle choices, but the Trump administration seems to be reversing previous White House hostility toward religious faith. In late 2016, the   Chairman of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) attacked proponents of religious liberty, suggesting that religion is simply a cover for bigotry, prejudice, and discrimination. Martin R. Castro stated that the phrases \u201creligious liberty\u201d and \u201creligious freedom\u201d are nothing more than \u201ccode words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia or any form of intolerance. \u201d According to Tim Schultz, the president of the 1st Amendment Partnership, the Obama administration seemed to view religion as an enemy standing in the way of their policy objectives. \u201cThey view religious freedom as a kind of inconvenient speed bump on the way to those objectives in some way,\u201d Schultz said. This has not been the tone taken by the new administration. In his very first executive order after assuming office, President Trump sought to \u201cease the burden\u201d of Obamacare by granting exemptions wherever possible to those unduly constrained by the law. Trump\u2019s move followed a long and contentious battle between the Obama administration and the Little Sisters of the Poor, who were being coerced into providing services to which they morally objected. This week, dozens of conservatives and   groups signed a letter urging President Trump to sign an executive order to protect the religious liberty of people and organizations that have been harassed by the federal government for expressing their beliefs on traditional marriage, the sanctity of life from birth to natural death, and other moral issues. The Oregon Court of Appeals is expected to issue an opinion on the case of the Christian bakers sometime in the next few months. Follow Thomas D.
