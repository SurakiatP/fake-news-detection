He was 77. The cause was multiple myeloma, his daughter, Rachael Waller, said. The novel came out of the blue. Mr. Waller, on leave from teaching business at the University of Northern Iowa, was shooting pictures with a friend along the Mississippi River in the early 1990s when he decided to make a detour and photograph covered bridges in Madison County, Iowa. He was an enthusiastic guitarist and singer, and years earlier he had written a song about the dreams of a woman named Francesca. An idea stirred. Two weeks later he had completed the manuscript of \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County. \u201d It told the tale of Francesca, a    Italian war bride on an Iowa farm whose life takes an unexpected turn when Robert Kincaid, 52, a   photographer, stops by one day to ask directions to the Roseman Covered Bridge. She is temporarily alone, her husband and two children away at the state fair. Francesca and Robert discover that they are kindred spirits, athirst for love, and a torrid affair commences. It lasts just four days  \u2014   but four days unlike any other. \u201cGod or the universe or whatever one chooses to label the great systems of balance and order does not recognize \u201d Kincaid tells her in a   letter. \u201cTo the universe four days is no different than four billion  . \u201d Many critics found the characters unconvincing, the sentiments sappy and the writing overripe. Kincaid, who called himself \u201cone of the last cowboys,\u201d was fond of delivering statements like \u201cI am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea. \u201d Millions of readers, however, found Mr. Waller\u2019s story of reawakened love deeply moving. The Orlando Sentinel spoke for them when it wrote, \u201cThis lyrically written first novel is as perfect as a tear  \u2014   and don\u2019t be surprised if you shed a few upon reading it. \u201d Oprah Winfrey, who broadcast a special edition of her television show from Madison County, called it \u201ca gift to the country. \u201d \u201cBridges\u201d leapt to the top of the   lists and stayed there, eventually outselling \u201cGone With the Wind. \u201d It took root on The New York Times\u2019s list and remained there for three years, becoming, as Entertainment Weekly put it, \u201cThe Book That Would Not Die. \u201d The film, released in 1995, starred Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood and was directed by Mr. Eastwood. It was also reincarnated as a Broadway musical in 2014, starring Kelli O\u2019Hara and Steven Pasquale. Robert James Waller Jr. was born on Aug. 1, 1939, in Charles City, Iowa, and grew up in nearby Rockford, about 125 miles northeast of Des Moines. His father was a    wholesaler and a local magistrate. His mother, the former Ruth Welch, was a homemaker. He won a basketball scholarship to the University of Iowa but transferred in his freshman year to Iowa State Teachers College (renamed the State College of Iowa in 1961). While an undergraduate, he married Georgia Wiedemeier, whom he had met at a dance in Iowa City. The marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Linda Bow, and a granddaughter. Mr. Waller earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business education in 1962 and a master\u2019s in education in 1964 before pursuing graduate work at Indiana University\u2019s school of business. He was awarded a doctorate of business administration in finance in 1968. His thesis was on the American guitar industry. He returned to his undergraduate alma mater, renamed the University of Northern Iowa in 1967, and taught management and economics there. In 1980 he was appointed dean of its business school. On the side he began writing travel and nature essays for The Des Moines Register\u2019s Sunday edition. These were collected in \u201cJust Beyond the Firelight: Stories and Essays\u201d (1988) and \u201cOne Good Road Is Enough\u201d (1990). Fed up with teaching, Mr. Waller took an unpaid leave of absence in 1990 and obtained a $200, 000 grant from the state to study the future of the region. His report, \u201cIowa: Perspectives on Today and Tomorrow,\u201d was published in 1991. With \u201cBridges\u201d still riding high, Mr. Waller recorded an album, \u201cThe Ballads of Madison County,\u201d and in 10 days wrote his second novel, \u201cSlow Waltz in Cedar Bend,\u201d about the love affair between an economics professor and a colleague\u2019s wife. With a first printing of a million copies, it, too, shot to the top of the   lists. Seeking solitude, Mr. Waller moved to a   ranch in Alpine, Tex. southeast of El Paso. The high desert country provided the setting for his novels \u201cPuerto Vallarta Squeeze: The Run for el Norte\u201d (1995) and \u201cBorder Music\u201d (1995). Both sold well, but not spectacularly. Mr. Waller decided to revisit the scene of his first novel in \u201cA Thousand Country Roads: An Epilogue to The Bridges of Madison County,\u201d published in 2002. It continued the adventures of an older, lonelier Kincaid, who hits the road again and, at one point, finds his way back to   territory. In his next novel, \u201cHigh Plains Tango\u201d (2005) Mr. Waller passed the generational baton to Kincaid\u2019s son, a master carpenter who battles to stop development on the site of an Indian burial ground in South Dakota. Mr. Waller\u2019s last novel, \u201cThe Long Night of Winchell Dear\u201d (2006) was a taut, atmospheric thriller about a retired professional poker player and a fateful night at his ranch in the Texas desert. The romantic flame ignited by \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d was slow to die. \u201cI receive letters each week from people who have read it and are moved by the story,\u201d Mr. Waller told Book Page in 2005. \u201cAt one time, I received 50 to 100 letters per week. Now it\u2019s more on the order of five. The last I knew, 350 marriage ceremonies had been celebrated at Roseman Bridge. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563106.203826}
