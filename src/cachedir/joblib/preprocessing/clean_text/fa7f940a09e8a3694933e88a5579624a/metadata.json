[He said he was doing so after several \u201cleftwing activist groups\u201d filed false accusations against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics, but that he would stand aside from the Russia investigation until it is resolved.  He said in a statement he was temporarily handing over the investigation to committee members Rep. Mike Conaway ( ) Trey Gowdy ( ) and Tom Rooney ( ). Gowdy led a congressional investigation into the September 2012 terrorist attack on the U. S. consulate in Benghazi. House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) said he continued to have trust in Nunes. \u201cDevin Nunes has earned my trust over many years for his integrity and dedication to the critical work that the intelligence community does to keep America safe. He continues to have that trust, and I know he is eager to demonstrate to the Ethics Committee that he has followed all proper guidelines and laws,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is clear that this process would be a distraction for the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in our election. Chairman Nunes has offered to step aside as the lead Republican on this probe, and I fully support this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cChairman Mike Conaway, a senior member of the Committee, will now lead this investigation in the House. I am confident that he will oversee a professional investigation into Russia\u2019s actions and follow the facts wherever they lead. \u201d The accusations come after Nunes last month announced he saw evidence that members of President Trump\u2019s transition team had their names \u201cunmasked\u201d  \u2014   or revealed  \u2014   during the course of U. S. intelligence surveillance on foreign targets. Unmasking refers to revealing the identities of Americans who are otherwise protected from having their identities known when they are incidentally caught up in surveillance. A private conversation held between Trump\u2019s   National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was illegally leaked to the Washington Post in February. Earlier this week, blogger Mike Cernovich, Bloomberg View, and Fox News revealed it was former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice who had requested the unmasking. Rice did not deny doing so, but said it was not politically motivated and denied leaking anything. \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody,\u201d she said Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports. \u201d \u201cThe allegation is that somehow Obama Administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes. That is absolutely false. I was the national security advisor. My job is to protect the American people and the security of our country,\u201d she said. Nunes\u2019 full statement: \u201cSeveral leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U. S. citizens and other abuses of power. \u201cDespite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee\u2019s Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter. I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims. \u201d  '"}, "time": 1742563526.0151358}
