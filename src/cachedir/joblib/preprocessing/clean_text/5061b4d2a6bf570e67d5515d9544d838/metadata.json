Shaun King wrote in the New York Daily News that the acquittal was an example of \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d \\nLiberal race-baiters have jumped to the fore in the wake of the acquittal to make such claims without any understanding of the case. \\nAccording to King, if these had been Black Lives Matter activists, they wouldn\u2019t have been acquitted. Neither would Muslim-American activists in King\u2019s racist world. \\nKing claimed that BLM protesters would be treated very differently: \\nImagine just for a moment that heavily-armed Black Lives Matter activists took over a federal building. It\u2019s doubtful that such a siege would last longer than a day. By and large, unarmed, non-violent peaceful black protestors are arrested on sight when they even block the entrance to a federal building. Many are still facing charges for such simple acts of civil disobedience to this very day and they did nothing like what the Bundy clan did in Oregon. \\nSet aside the fact that King has no clue about what the Bundys did and why they did it \u2014 if he did he would understand why his comparison doesn\u2019t hold water \u2014 he also doesn\u2019t realize that we don\u2019t have to imagine much here in relation to BLM activists. \\nWere BLM protesters \u201cnon-violent\u201d when they blocked major highways? How about when they beat an innocent white man? What about the rampant looting of innocent store owners in the wake of officer involved shootings? Then there are the police officers whose lives have been ruined, despite the fact that the shootings were found to have been justified, because race-baiters jumped to conclusions and incited violence to further their agenda. \\nWe see an enormous amount of lawlessness committed in the wake of officer-involved shootings that has nothing to do with the \u201ccause\u201d\u2014 which is roundly debunked by the facts \u2014 but people like King still defend it. \\nWhen a black man is killed by police, the police are condemned before the facts are in and even after it\u2019s shown that a particular shooting was justified. \\nI wonder if King and other race-baiters cared as much when Oregon militia leader LaVoy Finicum was killed in an officer-involved shooting. That\u2019s not to say whether it was justified or not, but that never stops the racial grievance mongers from protesting and rioting, does it? What\u2019s the only difference there? Oh, Finicum was white. \\nHere\u2019s what King had so say about how Muslim activists would be treated: \\nOr imagine that an armed group of Muslim-American activists took over a federal building. I\u2019m not talking about immigrants or people on the terrorist watch list, but just good, old fashioned American students who happened to be Muslims. Do you think they\u2019d be allowed to continue their takeover for 41 days? Do you think they\u2019d be acquitted at trial? Those young men would likely be taken to Gitmo. I\u2019m not even kidding. \\nReally? So that\u2019s why this country allows in refugees that we can\u2019t properly vet and refuses to monitor known radical mosques\u2026because things are so biased against Muslims? \\nApparently King has never heard of things called hate crime laws or affirmative action \u2014 two things that represent the true \u201csystemic racism\u201d plaguing this country. \\nWhat kind of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d did the more than 80 white people killed \u2014 including women and children \u2014 in the Waco siege have, Mr. King? \\nPeople like King really do live in a fantasy land of alleged racism, that is self-imposed by their inability and/or unwillingness to critically think for themselves. Then again, there\u2019s a lot of money to be made in peddling racial division based on lies, so it certainly could be that as well\u2026 '"}, "time": 1742561788.211989}
