But the excitement came with an admonition \u201cto be a good winner\u201d and not to gloat about his win at school. \u201cKindness is the No. 1 thing in our house,\u201d said Alana Roethle, 37, a mother of four children ranging in age from 4 to 9. \u201cWe were talking about this in the morning, that we love everybody, even if they don\u2019t share our political views, even if they don\u2019t love Jesus. \u201d The   morning was different for Amber Karamat, 47, of Anaheim, Calif. Her      son was devastated by the news. \u201cWill Trump still let me be an American?\u201d he asked his mom, who cried as she recounted the story. \u201cI feel helpless. I said, \u2018No one can take that away from you, sweetie. You were born an American. \u2019\u201d Perhaps more than any other election in recent memory, the Trump versus Clinton campaign was a family affair. Girls donned \u201cThe Future is Female\u201d   and canvassed neighborhoods with their mothers to support Hillary. Parents supporting Trump imagined a better economic future for their children, and talked to them about gun rights and safe borders. Often, the election news cycle forced parents to navigate tricky topics like bullying, profanity and sexual harassment. A   Clinton ad reminded us \u201cOur children are watching. \u201d And now, in the days after the election, parents on both sides of the vote struggle to put the bitter election fight into perspective and find teachable moments in the sometimes unpleasant aftermath. Amber Deyle, 37, of Emmons, Minn. and her husband, Dan, watched the election results roll in with their two sons, ages 6 and 10. \u201cWe were really excited,\u201d she said, noting gun rights as a critical issue. \u201cHunting is important to our family. Not only were we raised on it, but it helps us teach our children where food comes from. \u201d But she and her husband had some hard conversations with their boys about Mr. Trump, she added, \u201cbecause of some of the things he had said about women and minorities and things like that. But at the same time, we also had to explain to our children what Benghazi was. \u201d Daniel Roberts, a    father of two daughters in Montclair, N. J. and a Clinton supporter, took his younger daughter, 10, to vote with him. Mr. Roberts, a high school football coach and a patient navigator at a hospital, is black and his wife is white, and their daughters are biracial. After the results came in, his younger daughter was upset that a woman didn\u2019t win and worried about the racist sentiments she\u2019d been hearing. \u201cMy wife and I talked about it a lot and told her to keep aiming high, and reach for the stars. \u201d His older daughter, 14, was not so easily comforted. \u201cMy daughter wants to be a doctor. She\u2019s a smart girl, and she knows it\u2019s a tough field. She understands that she\u2019s already starting one step behind as a woman. \u201d Mr. Roberts said he\u2019d never seen her so dejected. \u201cSeeing her mood after the election, the dad in me came out and I felt for her. It almost made me cry. \u201d Parents on both sides of the election say the result has triggered conversations at home that are equally focused on civics and history as well as values and acceptance. Carrie Chavis, a    mother in Austin, Tex. voted for Mrs. Clinton, but most of her neighborhood voted for Mr. Trump. Her sons expressed disbelief when Ms. Chavis told them that Mr. Trump had won the election. Her oldest son was taunted at school when classmates learned he supported Mrs. Clinton. But even though Ms. Chavis is sad about the result, she used the moment to remind her sons about the value of democracy. \u201cI told them that we are so lucky that we get to vote for who we want as president, and we should be so thankful,\u201d she said. In Pelham, N. Y. Cherie Corso, a Trump supporter, had similar conversations with her    daughter, Julia, who helped her volunteer for the Trump campaign and cried with happiness when he won. But she also struggled at school, where most of the other students supported Mrs. Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s been getting backlash,\u201d Ms. Corso said. \u201cMy advice to her is, \u2018He\u2019s the winner, O. K.? He won, the people have spoken, you don\u2019t have to defend Donald Trump, you don\u2019t have to say anything. \u2019\u201d Julia said most Trump supporters at her school don\u2019t admit it. \u201cEverybody whispers,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I say something about how he\u2019s not that bad, people yell at me. I don\u2019t blame them because it\u2019s something they feel passionately about. \u201d Jason Benedict, 46, a registered Republican and the father of a boy in elementary school in Scotch Plains, N. J. voted for a   candidate. He reminded his son \u201cto be kind to his friends who may be upset by this decision. \u201d \u201cNo matter who the president is, what\u2019s really important is that he try his hardest every day to be nice to people, be helpful, and that everyone is entitled to their own life and opinions,\u201d he said. Valerie Kummer, 32, a Republican from Watford City, N. D. watched her children leave for school on Tuesday morning chanting \u201cTrump\u201d because they were excited to cast their ballots in the school\u2019s mock election. Ms. Kummer said she reminded them throughout the campaign \u201cabout loving other people and loving differences. \u201d For the first time in his life, Ben Goldstein, 39, a rabbi and father of three young children in Los Angeles, voted for a Democrat for president. The first thing his    daughter asked him when she woke up on Wednesday was, who won the election? \u201cI told her that Donald Trump won and explained that we live in an amazing country where people disagree and get to decide who is president. I told her that I hope he does such a great job that I end up voting for him in four years,\u201d he said. His daughter seemed to accept that explanation, but Rabbi Goldstein is concerned about the damage the divisive campaign has already done. \u201cInstead of vilifying him and all his followers, we can take this opportunity to look in the mirror and see how we contributed to the rhetoric of the past few years. How do we treat those with whom we disagree? What do we do with their arguments?\u201d he said. In some families, children disagreed with their parents\u2019 choice for president. Elise Breth, a    mother of two in Orlando, Fla. is a Trump supporter, as is her    son. But her    daughter supported Mrs. Clinton. She \u201cthought Hillary hung the moon because she\u2019s female, and that\u2019s who her friends at school were supporting,\u201d Ms. Breth said. \u201cEven though I support most of Trump\u2019s policies, I am proud of my daughter for recognizing that a strong, independent woman can be anything she wants to be. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562169.180594}
