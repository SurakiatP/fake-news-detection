Trump on Tuesday tempered some of his most extreme campaign promises, dropping his vow to jail Hillary Clinton, expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change. But in a   hourlong interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times  \u2014   which was scheduled, canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules  \u2014   Mr. Trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the American presidency. He said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his White House, conceding that the Trump brand \u201cis certainly a hotter brand than it was before. \u201d Still, he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his businesses, which would be run by his children. He defended Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, against charges of racism, calling him a \u201cdecent guy. \u201d And he mocked Republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign. In the midday meeting in the   boardroom of The Times\u2019s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Mr. Trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job. \u201cIt is a very overwhelming job, but I\u2019m not overwhelmed by it,\u201d he said. He displayed a jumble of impulses, many of them conflicting. He was magnanimous toward Mrs. Clinton, but boastful about his victory. He was   about some of his positions, uncompromising about others. The interview demonstrated the volatility in Mr. Trump\u2019s positions. He said he had no interest in pressing for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the Clinton Foundation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don\u2019t,\u201d he said. On the issue of torture, Mr. Trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of waterboarding after talking with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve never found it to be useful,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added that Mr. Mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism suspects: \u201c\u2018Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I\u2019ll do better. \u2019\u201d \u201cI was very impressed by that answer,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Torture, he said, is \u201cnot going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking. \u201d Mr. Trump repeated that Mr. Mattis was being \u201cseriously, seriously considered\u201d to be secretary of defense. \u201cI think it\u2019s time, maybe, for a general,\u201d he said. On climate change, Mr. Trump refused to repeat his promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in Paris, saying, \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely. \u201d Despite the recent appointment to his transition team of a fierce critic of the Paris accords, Mr. Trump said that \u201cI have an open mind to it\u201d and that clean air and \u201ccrystal clear water\u201d were vitally important. He held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas. He vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in Washington, where attendees gave the Nazi salute and criticized Jews. Asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel laws, Mr. Trump offered no specifics but told the group, \u201cI think you\u2019ll be happy. \u201d Despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the \u201cfailing New York Times,\u201d Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution, which he called \u201ca great, great American jewel, world jewel. \u201d He did, however, say he believed The Times had been too tough on him during the campaign. Pressed to respond to criticism in other areas, he was defiant. He declared that \u201cthe law\u2019s totally on my side\u201d when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws. \u201cThe president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d he said. He said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings. He said that he would \u201clike to do something\u201d and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government. He noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children, which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. He insisted that he could still invite business partners into the White House for    photographs. He said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do, including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses. \u201cIf it were up to some people,\u201d he said, \u201cI would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. \u201d Mr. Trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with Nigel Farage, the U. K. Independence Party leader, to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms. Mr. Trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. \u201cI might have brought it up,\u201d Mr. Trump said, then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest. Mr. Trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his    Jared Kushner, in a White House job. But he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make Mr. Kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the Middle East. \u201cThe president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wants, but I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But he said that Mr. Kushner, who is an observant Jew, \u201ccould be very helpful\u201d in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \u201cI would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Kushner \u201cwould be very good at it\u201d and that \u201che knows the region. \u201d \u201cA lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it\u2019s impossible  \u2014   you can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI disagree. I think you can make peace. \u201d \u201cI have reason to believe I can do it,\u201d he added. Mr. Trump spoke only in general terms about foreign policy. He said the United States should not \u201cbe a nation builder,\u201d repeated his line from the campaign that fighting the war in Iraq was \u201cone of the great mistakes in the history of our country,\u201d and said he has some \u201cvery definitive\u201d and \u201cstrong ideas\u201d about how to deal with the violent civil war raging in Syria. He declined to say what those ideas are despite several requests to do so. \u201cWe have to end that craziness that\u2019s going on in Syria,\u201d he said. The   said that he had talked with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since winning the election, but he did not elaborate. He said it would be \u201cnice\u201d if he and Mr. Putin could get along, but he rejected the idea that any warming of relations would be called a \u201creset,\u201d noting the criticism that Mrs. Clinton received after her attempts at bettering relations between the countries failed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use that term after what happened,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump made a forceful defense of Mr. Bannon, whom he named as his chief strategist and who has drawn charges of racism and  . This summer, Mr. Bannon called Breitbart News, the website he led, \u201cthe platform for the \u201d a white nationalist movement. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bannon had been dismayed at the reaction to his hiring. \u201cI\u2019ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist or \u201d he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even think about hiring him. \u201d Mr. Trump added: \u201cI think he\u2019s having a hard time with it because it\u2019s not him. I think he\u2019s been treated very unfairly. \u201d He also defended Breitbart, which has carried racist and   content, saying it was no different from The Times, only \u201cmuch more conservative. \u201d Mr. Trump said he hoped to develop a \u201cgreat   relationship\u201d with President Obama, with whom he said he had an unexpected rapport. \u201cI really liked him a lot, and I am a little bit surprised that I am telling you that I really liked him a lot,\u201d he said. And Mr. Trump gloated about defying the polls and the expectations of his own party to win the presidency, and boasted of how he had taken his revenge on Republicans who kept him at a distance and then lost their own races. He said that one of them, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, would \u201clove to have a job in the administration. \u201d \u201cI said, \u2018No, thank you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said of Ms. Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat to Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. \u201cShe refused to vote for me. \u201d He also criticized Representative Joe Heck of Nevada, who vacillated over supporting Mr. Trump after an    recording surfaced in which Mr. Trump bragged in lewd terms about grabbing women without their consent. \u201cHe went down like a lead balloon,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Heck. \u201cI said, \u2018Off the record, I hope you lose. \u2019\u201d He said Republican leaders felt indebted to him for his surprise victory. \u201cRight now,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re in love with me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561698.88819}
