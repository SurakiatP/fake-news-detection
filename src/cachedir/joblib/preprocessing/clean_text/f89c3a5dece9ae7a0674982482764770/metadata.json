The interior secretary, Sally Jewell, and other federal officials are scheduled to attend a listening session next week in New York, during which supporters of such a park will make their case. The advocates include Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Representative Jerrold Nadler, both Democrats from New York. \u201cWe are excited about this, and we do think that the president should move forward on it,\u201d said Kristen Brengel, the vice president for government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association. The scheduled meeting was reported by The Washington Post. Robert Atterbury, a spokesman for Mr. Nadler\u2019s office, said the National Park Service has completed a \u201creconnaissance survey\u201d on the Greenwich Village land, known as Christopher Park, a routine step before making any recommendation to the president. White House officials said no decision had been made. President Obama has the power to create national monuments, as he has done repeatedly during his two terms. The push to create a national park or monument near the Stonewall Inn is intended to recognize the protests that erupted at the Manhattan bar after the police raided it in summer 1969. Those spontaneous protests by primarily gay men who frequented the bar are viewed by many as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement (though historians have noted the movement began before Stonewall). The bar has been granted landmark status by the city, even as it continues to serve as a watering hole that caters not only to the area\u2019s gay residents, but also to tourists from around the world, gay or straight. \u201cStonewall deserves to be remembered,\u201d said Brian Sullivan, a former bartender at the tavern who returns almost daily. \u201cWhen I started coming here, gay people were disowned by their families, so this is the place where we formed a new gay family of our own. \u201d Mr. Sullivan, 57, leaned against the bar\u2019s   edifice as he recalled some of the history he had witnessed there, from harrowing police raids to resolute speeches by the drag queen Marsha P. Johnson. \u201cThis is the mecca it\u2019s where it all started,\u201d he said. Chad Walter, a market researcher who plays for the Stonewall billiards team, said he hoped a monument would strengthen the continuing gay rights movement. \u201cPeople are still being discriminated against all across the country,\u201d Mr. Walter, 39, said. \u201cThis adds legitimacy it tells people that even the government agrees this movement is important and historic. \u201d Advocates of creating a national park near the Stonewall Inn have been working to build support for years. They are hoping that members of the public will turn out at the meeting next week to encourage Mr. Obama to act before he leaves office in January. The Parks Conservation Association has collected about 20, 000 signatures on petitions that have been sent to the White House. But even as advocates are urging the president to act, New York lawmakers  \u2014   led by Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Nadler  \u2014   are trying to build support for legislation that could create the national park if the president chooses not to. Marc Brumer, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand, said they were making \u201cgood progress\u201d on the legislation, which he said had recently picked up support from Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the right to marry the person you love, or the repeal of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u2019 we\u2019ve come so far in the push for equal rights,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s past due for a national monument honoring the legacy and events that took place at Stonewall and the L. G. B. T. rights movement in our country. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564390.5434487}
