It was not the only one: Almost his first action on arrival was a symbolic visit to the Western Wall, the eternal Jewish shrine in Jerusalem. Medvedev chose this gesture to underscore the comment he made last week: \u201cRussia never denied Israel\u2019s or the Jewish people\u2019s rights in Jerusalem and in its holy sites, and the subject has been blown out of proportion.\u201d The Russian prime minister was therefore demonstrating Moscow\u2019s recognition for Jewish rights in Israel, Jerusalem and its holy places \u2013 most of all Temple Mount \u2013 not just for the Palestinians. It was a message directed by the Kremlin to extremist Muslim organizations, which have set themselves the goal of \u201cliberating Jerusalem from Israeli occupation.\u201d On the broader level, Putin through Medvedev was telling the world, and the US in particular, that Russia was ready to act as peacemaker between the Arab world and Israel, with greater flexibility on the Jerusalem question than Washington has exhibited.'"}, "time": 1742628409.993752}
