[If you\u2019re feeling a wee bit insecure about your prospective Xbox barbarian, I have some bad news. Microsoft is reportedly forcing the creators of Conan Exiles to castrate the character creation system in the upcoming port of their popular survival game. No, you will not be able to ensure you are as   (or not) as you imagine your shirtless savage should be. In fact, you very well might not have a visible penis at all.  Funcom Creative Director Joe Bylos said that \u201cXbox has been pretty clear with us that it\u2019s not going to fly. \u201d Even so, there remains hope that the oily, burly manly men of the greater Cimmerian zip codes won\u2019t be entirely neutered. According to Bylos, \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be off by default I think. I don\u2019t know if partial nudity might be OK. \u201d He\u2019s a little bit more hopeful for the continued existence of bare breasts, but the developers \u201chaven\u2019t spoken to Xbox\u201d about them specifically. \u201cThey do allow breasts in some of their games, but the penises definitely won\u2019t be there. \u201d The game is already facing a possible ban in Japan due to the depiction of uncensored genitalia, but they \u201chaven\u2019t heard anything\u201d definitive yet from the region. Bylos played coy about the popularity of the game\u2019s naked avatars, expressing surprise at \u201cthe attention, the viralness[sic]\u201d of the game\u2019s customizable full nudity. He claims that the developers thought that players \u201cwould just sort of see it and laugh and move on,\u201d in clear defiance of all known laws of the Internet. To be fair, we don\u2019t definitively know that any of them have used the Internet before. Will the team be forced to tuck, or will the offending members be removed entirely? For now, the fate of their collective virtual manhood rests firmly in Phil Spencer\u2019s hands.
