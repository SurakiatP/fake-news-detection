[\u201cWe would be perfectly OK if we weren\u2019t able to get an agreement, but I\u2019m sure that we will,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Peston On Sunday. \u201cOur partners and friends around the EU desperately want this thing to work. They don\u2019t want more misery they don\u2019t want to fall out with the UK\u201d he said.

David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, assured the public that \u201cThe whole of Whitehall every single [government] department\u201d was working on a contingency plan in case a   agreement cannot be negotiated. Davis told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that he shared the Foreign Secretary\u2019s view that a \u201cno deal\u201d situation was not \u201cremotely likely\u201d on Sunday morning, however, emphasising that \u201cThe whole government   \u2026     have been engaged with every country in Europe and of course the [EU] institutions\u201d. #Brexit secretary David Davis says government is working on contingency plan if deal can\u2019t be reached with EUhttps:  .  #marr pic. twitter.   \u2014   BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) March 12, 2017,  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s in absolutely everybody\u2019s interests that we get a good outcome\u201d. Addressing rumours that Remainer MPs are plotting to claim a veto over Brexit by backing House of Lords amendments to the government\u2019s bill authorising the activation Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which formally begins the exit process, Davis asserted that this would not be democratically acceptable. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is either house of Parliament reversing the decision of the British people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a veto [  \u2026    ] The decision has been made. The British people made the decision on June 23rd last year. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564098.1802871}
