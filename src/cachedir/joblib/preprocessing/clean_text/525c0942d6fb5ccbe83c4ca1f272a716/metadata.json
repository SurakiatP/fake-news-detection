The Republican request, five days after the department closed a yearlong investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information in the emails, threatens to shadow her through the campaign and perhaps even into the White House if she is elected. In a letter Monday evening, House Republicans asked the Justice Department to determine whether Mrs. Clinton had \u201ccommitted perjury and made false statements\u201d during her appearance in October before a special House panel on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The letter was signed by Representatives Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who leads the Oversight Committee, and Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who leads the Judiciary Committee. The Justice Department declined to comment on the request. In a Twitter post, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, called the Republican request \u201canother futile, partisan attempt to keep this issue alive now that the Justice Dept has declared it resolved. \u201d Mrs. Clinton has said she regrets the decision to use a private email server for official communications as secretary of state, but she has defended the truthfulness of her public remarks. Legal analysts said that while it appeared unlikely the F. B. I. would ultimately find enough evidence to prosecute Mrs. Clinton on charges of lying to Congress, there might be enough to warrant opening an investigation. That alone could prove damaging to her campaign. Republicans have seized on a number of contradictions between what Mrs. Clinton told Congress about her private email server and what the F. B. I. found in its investigation. Mrs. Clinton told the House Select Committee on Benghazi, for instance, that she had turned over all her \u201c \u201d emails to the State Department and that \u201cnothing\u201d in the more than 60, 000 emails routed through her private server \u201cwas marked classified at the time I sent or received it. \u201d The F. B. I. investigation found that, in fact, there were \u201cthousands\u201d of   emails that her lawyers did not turn over, and that a handful of emails were marked classified at the time  \u2014   although the State Department now says they should not have been. Still, it would be difficult for prosecutors to show that she intended to mislead Congress  \u2014   a high legal bar  \u2014   and that she should be criminally prosecuted for it. In eight hours of testimony during a marathon   session of the Benghazi committee, Mrs. Clinton was careful to hedge a number of answers about her email system by saying that she was basing her statements on information from her lawyers. \u201cThere\u2019s not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that she\u2019d be convicted of anything,\u201d Rusty Hardin, a prominent Texas lawyer, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Hardin won an acquittal of the baseball pitcher Roger Clemens in 2012 when the Justice Department  \u2014   acting on a similar referral from Congress  \u2014   accused him of lying to Congress about his use of steroids. Mr. Hardin said that \u201csomewhere in that 11 hours, there might be something that turned out wasn\u2019t accurate, but she\u2019d have to be certifiably insane to intentionally mislead them when there\u2019s a criminal investigation going on. \u201d Michael Bopp, a Washington lawyer who has examined similar referrals from Congress, said that criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton appeared doubtful because of the difficulty in establishing whether she intended to lie to Congress, rather than simply making statements that later proved untrue. \u201cI do think they\u2019re going to feel obligated to open an investigation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will be difficult to bring a case. \u201d Republicans sent a separate letter on Monday to James B. Comey Jr. the F. B. I. director, criticizing his decision not to seek criminal charges in the case and asking him to explain his thinking. For Democrats, the threat of another   investigation was more evidence of what they see as a partisan witch hunt meant to derail Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe F. B. I. said there was no case, but the Republicans just try and keep it alive,\u201d Henry Waxman, a former Democratic congressman from California, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Waxman, who sought a Justice Department investigation in the Clemens case, predicted that prosecutors would decline to move forward against Mrs. Clinton and that Republicans would then \u201ccomplain that the Justice Department is acting on political reasons. \u201d Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the   Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said that Republicans \u201care now completely unloading on Secretary Clinton with everything they\u2019ve got  \u2014   right before the presidential conventions. \u201d It is fairly unusual for members of Congress to refer cases to the Justice Department for criminal investigation. One of the last major referrals came in 2014, when the   House Ways and Means Committee voted to seek a criminal investigation against Lois Lerner, who was a central player in accusations that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative nonprofit groups. After an investigation, the Justice Department declined last year to bring charges against her or anyone else. At a hearing last week before the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Comey was asked by Republicans whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s public statements  \u2014   both to Congress and elsewhere  \u2014   appeared to contradict what the F. B. I. had found. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, said to Mr. Comey that based on those contradictions, \u201cisn\u2019t it a logical assumption she may have misled Congress, and we need to look at that further?\u201d \u201cI can understand why people would ask that question,\u201d Mr. Comey said. He drew guffaws from some Republicans when he said that while he believed Mrs. Clinton had testified truthfully to the F. B. I. in a closed interview this month, his investigators had not examined the separate question of whether she lied under oath to Congress in her testimony. Mr. Comey told Mr. Chaffetz that such an inquiry would require a formal referral from Congress. \u201cYou\u2019ll have one,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll have one in the next few hours. \u201d Like many things in Congress, the referral did not move quite as quickly as predicted. It took the Republicans two business days to put in their demand  \u2014   which, for Congress, was still pretty fast.'"}, "time": 1742562560.8848872}
