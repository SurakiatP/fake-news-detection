In a bewildering end to the show, \u201cLa La Land\u201d was first announced as the winner before its jubilant cast and crew were interrupted with a scarcely believable correction. \u2022 Emma Stone won best actress for \u201cLa La Land. \u201d Casey Affleck won best actor for \u201cManchester by the Sea. \u201d \u2022 \u201cLa La Land\u201d won six Oscars, including best director, best original score and best song (denying   Miranda an EGOT in the process). The film had 14 nominations, tied for the most ever. \u2022 Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show. \u2022 Here\u2019s a red carpet slide show and a fashion review. LOS ANGELES  \u2014   In an epic flub that drew gasps of horror  \u2014   and joy  \u2014   at the Dolby Theater here, Faye Dunaway mistakenly named \u201cLa La Land\u201d best picture at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night, but in reality \u201cMoonlight\u201d won the top prize. The producers of \u201cLa La Land\u201d were still thanking their families and fellow artists when the interjection came that \u201cMoonlight\u201d had in fact won, as everyone wondered if that was a joke. But it wasn\u2019t, and the \u201cLa La Land\u201d people quickly exited the stage as producers and stars of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d just as stunned as everyone else, walked on. Warren Beatty and Ms. Dunaway had presented the best picture award. When Mr. Beatty opened the envelope, he took an extended pause before showing the card to Ms. Dunaway, who then announced \u201cLa La Land\u201d as the winner. \u201cI want to tell you what happened,\u201d Mr. Beatty said in the chaotic moments after \u201cMoonlight\u201d was announced as the winner. \u201cI opened the envelope, and it said \u2018Emma Stone, La La Land.\u2019 That\u2019s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny. This is \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 the best picture. \u201d \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the story of a young, gay, black man, won three statuettes in total, including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor. \u201cVery clearly, even in my dreams this could not be true,\u201d said Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight. \u201d \u201cBut to hell with dreams, I\u2019m done with it, because this is true. Oh my goodness. \u201d Held up as an escapist,    antidote for the times, the   \u201cLa La Land\u201d won six Oscars, including statuettes for Damien Chazelle\u2019s directing and Ms. Stone\u2019s acting, during a jaunty ceremony that swung between   and political acrimony  \u2014   before its wild ending. \u201cIt threw me more than a bit,\u201d Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting actor for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d said backstage. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to go up there and take anything from somebody, you know?\u201d PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that handles the Oscars balloting, took responsibility for the mixup. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 \u2018La La Land,\u2019 Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Oscar viewers for the error,\u201d the firm said in a statement. \u201cThe presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened. \u201d ABC News tweeted out a photo that showed that the envelope in Mr. Beatty\u2019s hand read \u201cActress in a Leading Role. \u201d After the show, Ms. Stone said on ABC that she had held onto the envelope with the card bearing her name after she won best actress. In a blog post published on Medium this month, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, explained the process of handling the envelopes for the Oscars. Mr. Cullinan wrote that he and Ms. Ruiz each had a full set of envelopes and stood on opposite sides of the stage, where they handed envelopes to presenters. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound very complicated,\u201d Mr. Cullinan said, \u201cbut you have to make sure you\u2019re giving the presenter the right envelope. \u201d Here are other notable moments from the show: \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d the true story of a heroic World War II medic, won Oscars for sound mixing and film editing, a category that is often predictive of the best picture winner. Kenneth Lonergan won the best screenplay statuette for his \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d the story of a grieving New England handyman. Casey Affleck, who played the lead role in Mr. Lonergan\u2019s film, beat Denzel Washington (\u201cFences\u201d) for best actor. \u201cI\u2019m just dumbfound I\u2019m included,\u201d Mr. Affleck said. The supporting acting prizes went to Viola Davis for her work in \u201cFences,\u201d about a Pittsburgh family in the 1950s, and Mr. Ali for his portrayal of a sympathetic drug dealer in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which also collected the adapted screenplay Oscar, for Mr. Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney. \u201cAll you people out there who feel like there\u2019s no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected, the academy has your back, the A. C. L. U. has your back, we have your back  \u2014   and for the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said from the stage. Among the nominees leaving with nothing: \u201cLion,\u201d an adoption   with six nominations, and the box office hit \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d which had three nods. As expected, Ms. Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar  \u2014   her first  \u2014   for playing a   housewife in \u201cFences. \u201d (She won best actress at the 2010 Tony Awards for playing the same role onstage. She was the one who decided to drop to the supporting category for the Oscars.) An intense, nearly overcome Ms. Davis touched on her family, her industry \u201ccheerleaders,\u201d the film\u2019s director (Mr. Washington) graveyards, dashed dreams and the playwright August Wilson, who adapted his \u201cFences\u201d for the screen and whom Ms. Viola praised as someone who \u201cexhumed and exalted the ordinary people. \u201d The night\u2019s first award went to Mr. Ali, who tearfully thanked the cast and crew of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and his own family. \u201cPeace and blessings,\u201d he said, avoiding a repeat of the pointed comments he made at previous awards shows about the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban. After two years when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized as racist for overlooking black actors and films about   experiences, this year\u2019s nominee list was remarkably diverse. Six black actors received nominations, a record. The foreign film and documentary races were notably relevant this year. Among foreign films, the German satire \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d initially had the momentum. But Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban put the spotlight on Iran\u2019s entry, \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d whose director, Asghar Farhadi, said that he would boycott the ceremony in protest  \u2014   a decision that may have ultimately helped his film win. Anousheh Ansari, an   businesswoman, accepted the award for \u201cThe Salesman\u201d and read a message from Mr. Farhadi. The note said that he was not attending in solidarity with immigrants \u201cwho have been disrespected by the inhumane law,\u201d referring to the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban. Among nonfiction films, Ava DuVernay\u2019s   look at mass incarceration, \u201c13th,\u201d was campaigned for aggressively by Netflix, and the civil   \u201cI Am Not Your Negro\u201d surged late in the season. But the nearly             \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d was named best documentary. In accepting the award, Ezra Edelman, the film\u2019s director, dedicated the Oscar to Nicole Brown Simpson, Ronald Goldman and \u201cthe victims of police violence, police brutality, racially motivated violence and criminal injustice. \u201d Mr. Kimmel, an Everyman schtick carefully in place, opened his monologue by asking viewers, both conservative and liberal, to come together in a calm conversation. \u201cIf we could all do that we could make America great again, we really could,\u201d he said, to applause. Mr. Kimmel, appearing confident and calm  \u2014   and with the   audience, munching on Red Vines and Junior Mints, now firmly on his side  \u2014   soon took sharper aim. In a reference to President Trump, Mr. Kimmel said, \u201cRemember last year, when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?\u201d As the ceremony went on, organizers played up Hollywood glamour and paid homage to Academy Awards history. Music interludes were taken from the scores of \u201cTop Gun\u201d and \u201cTootsie. \u201d Shirley MacLaine appeared as a presenter, joking that the standing ovation was \u201cthe nicest reception I\u2019ve had in 250, 000 years. \u201d At one point, Mr. Kimmel trotted out a tour bus full of unsuspecting tourists, to mixed results. But politics was a consistent topic. Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, presenting best animated film to \u201cZootopia,\u201d said, \u201cAs a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I am against any form of wall that wants to separate us. \u201d Left to bridge the gap between people watching from their sofas in Kansas City and the theater filled with coastal elites was Mr. Kimmel. In a moment that certainly checked the populist box, the busload of unsuspecting Hollywood tourists, selfie sticks aloft, found themselves ushered into the Dolby Theater, and shuffled before Hollywood   and the world. The bit, which went on at some length, drew a polarizing response on social media, with some viewers criticizing Mr. Kimmel for exploiting the tourists and mocking an Asian woman\u2019s name. Later, Mr. Kimmel joked that President Trump had not tweeted about the show. So Mr. Kimmel typed out a tweet to the president on his phone: \u201cHey @realDonaldTrump u up?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563165.0664146}
