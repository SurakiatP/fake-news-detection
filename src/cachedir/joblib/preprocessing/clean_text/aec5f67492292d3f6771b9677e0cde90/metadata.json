The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration. By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination. Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley\u2019s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its    approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions \u201care so   it pains us all\u201d and that \u201cit is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. \u201d Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. \u201cWe must stand with those who are affected,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the   man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He   obliged. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a refugee,\u201d Mr. Brin said, according to a Twitter post by the Forbes writer Ryan Mac. The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did. That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple   whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his   had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam. \u201cLike many of you, I\u2019\u2019m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Friday. Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges. \u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa. Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that \u201con every level  \u2014   moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.  \u2014   this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. \u201d Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is. \u201d Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. \u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products  \u2014   Google, Apple, Airbnb  \u2014   has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors. \u201d The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that \u201c  or   of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia,\u201d an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a   December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be there for you,\u201d Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha   24, an   software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. \u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them. \u201d The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned. \u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support. \u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values. \u201d Microsoft was not the only company to become bolder in a few hours. Around 10 a. m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying \u201copen doors bring all of US together. \u201d By 6 p. m. he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy was \u201ca direct obstacle to our mission. \u201d It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company\u2019s product  \u2014   a platform for free speech  \u2014   and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s, as a director on Facebook\u2019s board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump\u2019\u2019s campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team. That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers  \u2014   largely immigrants  \u2014   began a   work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order. Uber did not follow suit. Instead, it posted on Twitter that it was suspending surge pricing at Kennedy Airport. That prompted accusations that it was trying to break the strike, which the company awkwardly denied in another Twitter post. On Sunday morning, its competitor Lyft said it was donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years \u201cto defend our Constitution. \u201d On Sunday afternoon, Uber sharpened its criticism of the ban, calling it \u201cwrong and unjust. \u201d Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent   incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen. \u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come. \u201d Mr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p. m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.'"}, "time": 1742562871.8335376}
