[According to the prosecution, the woman \u201cexpressed a disparaging view of refugees\u201d on Facebook. She stands accused of having taken to the social media website in early July 2015 to make the \u201cderogatory\u201d post, alleging that migrants \u201cset fire to cars, and urinate and defecate on the streets\u201d.  Prosecutors in Sweden say the woman\u2019s message violates the nation\u2019s law on incitement to racial hatred (Hets mot folkgrupp, or HMF) a crime with carries a maximum penalty of four years. The accused admitted that she wrote the post but denied committing any criminal act. The evidence against her consists of a screenshot from Facebook, according to local media. People took to Flashback, the net\u2019s largest Swedish language forum, to criticise the state\u2019s decision to prosecute the pensioner, with one poster lamenting the accused \u201chas fallen into the clutches of the politically correct\u201d. A user with the screen name \u2018Nospheratu\u2019 pointed out that the original idea behind HMF was \u201cto prevent   propaganda by political parties\u201d against demographic groups, with lawmakers \u201chaving 1930s Germany in mind\u201d whilst passing laws. The user slammed the law for being used to \u201cprosecute old ladies on the bus\u201d criticising immigrants. Another slammed Sweden for hypocrisy, accusing the nation\u2019s media and politicians of condemning restrictions on freedom of speech and expression in other countries \u201cwhile themselves engaging in the worst kinds of witch hunts of dissidents\u201d. Sweden\u2019s Justice Minister Morgan Johansson cited freedom of speech when he rejected Gothenburg police chief Erik Nord\u2019s suggestion that the country deports Islamic   migrants, after the Islamist terror attack in Stockholm last month. \u201cWe have freedom of speech in Sweden. This means people have the right to hold repulsive opinions here,\u201d said Johansson. \u201cBut there are always limits  \u2026     For example when it comes to hate speech,\u201d added the minister, who called Nord\u2019s policy suggestion \u201cproblematic\u201d and demanded the police chief \u201cexplain himself\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742564266.441165}
