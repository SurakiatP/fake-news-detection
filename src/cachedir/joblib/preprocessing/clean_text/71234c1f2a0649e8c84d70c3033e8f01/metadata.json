Should she present herself to the immigration authorities Wednesday morning for a scheduled   risking deportation? Or should she stay in the church, one of the few places federal agents do not go, almost surely resigning herself to months or years trapped inside? \u201cTonight, I have to think,\u201d Ms. Vizguerra said. \u201cBecause I promised my children  \u2014   and it was a promise  \u2014   that it was going to be very difficult to remove me from this country. I have already fought so long to be here now is not the time to give up. \u201d It has been a difficult week for Ms. Vizguerra, 45, one of millions of undocumented immigrants contending with an uncertain future in the Trump administration. After she was convicted several years ago of using fake documents, Ms. Vizguerra, who has spent 20 years working in the United States, was ordered out of the country. But she was granted at least five postponements of deportation, and in December, her lawyer, Hans Meyer, asked for another. Nothing happened. She was due for a regular   at the local office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday, and as the day crept closer, Ms. Vizguerra realized the possibility that she could be whisked onto a plane and separated from her three   children: Zury, 6, Roberto, 10, and Luna, 12. Their care would fall to her husband, Salvador, 45, who works long hours as a driver for a tile company, and an older daughter, Tania Baez, 26, a preschool teacher with three children of her own. Unlike her younger siblings, Ms. Baez is not a citizen by birth, but she has a work permit under the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Trump criticized during the campaign but has not moved to end. The last week or so has thrust the family into a state of extended emergency. On Feb. 5, Ms. Vizguerra called a family meeting over dinner, banning electronics from the table to convey the seriousness of the matter. The family cats, Miranda and Zayra, meowed as she explained the plan. If officials were to come to the home in the days before the meeting at the I. C. E. office, no one should answer the door, she said. If they gained entry, Luna, a reedy middle schooler with braces, should use her phone to film the events. Roberto should open the emergency contact list in his phone and begin to call family friends and advocates. And Zury, the youngest, should go straight to her parents\u2019 bedroom, close the door and stay there. \u201cI told them, \u2018I know it\u2019s going to be difficult for you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Vizguerra said. \u201c\u2018I want you to be brave. \u2019\u201d Three days later, the packing began, with the children stuffing their mother\u2019s leggings, sweaters and shampoos into suitcases and boxes. Terrified by the prospect of familial separation, Ms. Vizguerra began to consider taking refuge at the First Unitarian Society church in Denver, whose congregants previously gave sanctuary to another immigrant. She reminded Luna which drawers belonged to which child and told her it would be her job to make sure her siblings dressed properly. She showed her where the extra soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste were kept. Then Ms. Vizguerra stocked the refrigerator with microwave dinners, something even a    could make. Ms. Baez, the oldest daughter, has begun contemplating caring for three more children. \u201cI completely understand his side,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump. \u201cBut he grew up entitled. He\u2019s never lived in poverty. He\u2019s never lived in fear. \u201d \u201cI just think if he walked an immigrant\u2019s life,\u201d she added, \u201che\u2019d change his mind. \u201d Ms. Vizguerra came to the United States from Mexico in 1997. She worked as a janitor and a union organizer, and she later owned a moving and cleaning business. In 2009, she was caught with fake identification that her lawyer said she had acquired in order to work. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, setting off a chain of events that led to the deportation order. In the Denver area, she is a   advocate for immigration overhaul. Ms. Vizguerra\u2019s situation  \u2014   first the government ordered her to leave, then it allowed her to stay  \u2014   is reflective of   immigration policies that his critics called muddled and inconsistent. And even as Mr. Obama allowed some people to stay here, he deported millions of others. \u201cI am hoping,\u201d said Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman and a prominent critic of illegal immigration, \u201cthat the \u2018Trump raids\u2019 will eventually net the numbers Obama rounded up in his raids. \u201d Mr. Trump has done away with the Obama administration\u2019s policy of prioritizing the most serious criminals for deportation, making anyone with a record a candidate for quick removal. Now Ms. Vizguerra and others like her are worried that immigration officials will no longer give them a pass. On Tuesday night, she slept in the church basement with her three youngest children, to avoid the risk of arrest at home. At that point, she still had not decided whether to show up at her I. C. E. meeting. \u201cMy intuition,\u201d Ms. Vizguerra said, \u201ctells me that if I go in, I\u2019m not coming out. \u201d When the time came on Wednesday, she decided not to go. Then Mr. Meyer, her lawyer, learned that Ms. Vizguerra\u2019s request for another \u201cstay\u201d of her deportation had been rejected. Ms. Vizguerra\u2019s supporters held a news conference outside the I. C. E. office, and she telephoned in. With the phone pressed against a megaphone, she explained why she did not show up: \u201cIn my heart,\u201d she said in Spanish, \u201cI knew that they would deny me a stay. \u201d As of Wednesday evening, she was still at the church, staying in a room she helped prepare three years ago, when she and other immigrant advocates thought it would be a good idea to create a safe space for people facing deportation. She chose the yellow paint for the walls. The room holds two beds, a lamp propped on a cardboard box, and a Valentine from her youngest daughter. \u201cI could be here days, months, maybe even years,\u201d she said. Under federal policy, immigration officers are supposed to avoid entering churches and other \u201csensitive locations,\u201d unless they have advance approval from a supervisor or face \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d that require immediate action. There was no sign of I. C. E. agents Wednesday evening outside the church. Shawn Neudauer, a spokesman for I. C. E. would not say what the agency planned to do next.'"}, "time": 1742628540.0525002}
