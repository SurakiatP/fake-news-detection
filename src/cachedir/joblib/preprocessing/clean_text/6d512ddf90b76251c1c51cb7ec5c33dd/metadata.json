On Friday morning the two put on the gloves to go another round. \\nThe conversation starts out innocently enough, with a discussion about new economic numbers that show the economy is growing and getting stronger. Great news for Americans \u2014 except those like Donald Trump, who are looking to benefit politically from the lie that record numbers of people are suffering. Then host Carol Costello plays a clip of Trump telling an Ohio rally that he wants to do something about the inner city \u201cghettos.\u201d She observes to Pierson that many black Americans would observe that Trump is not looking at \u201cthe whole of the black population.\u201d \\nPierson responds that some members of the black community have been consulting with Trump about the problem. The look on Rye\u2019s face when she says that is classic. When she gets a chance to respond, she says, \\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that when we have conversations like this they\u2019re rooted in facts. Let\u2019s talk about what Donald Trump could be saying to black people that would resonate and be based in truth.\u201d \\nRye goes on to explain how people like Trump, who have access to capital, don\u2019t seem to appreciate that everyone can\u2019t get their hands on money to improve their lives. Then she talks about Trump\u2019s history as a real estate mogul, who has actually contributed to the creation of the \u201cghettos\u201d which he now says he wants to fix. \\nPierson responds that Trump has worked with members of the black community, including Jesse Jackson, to help members of the black community create and build businesses. That promotes a hearty laugh from Rye. Costello notes that Rye was a former director of the Congressional Black Caucus, as she asks her to respond. Pierson cuts in, remarking \u201cAnd [she] ran it [the CBC] into the ground.\u201d At that point, the two women drop all pretense of liking each other and the battle is on. Rye unloads on Pierson with a barrage of facts that her poor little Trump-addled brain was probably having difficulty processing. And when Costello tries to rein her in, Rye hits Pierson with a comment right out of Trump\u2019s playbook. Referring to the charge she \u201cran the CBC into the ground,\u201d Rye says: \\n\u201cThat\u2019s slander. I could sue you, Katrina!\u201d \\nHere\u2019s the latest round in the Rye-Pierson war of words, via YouTube: \\nFeatured image via screen capture Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562082.8287227}
