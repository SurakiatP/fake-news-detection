I. treatment, Doctor Strange has never been a superstar of the Marvel Universe  \u2014   more like an endearing benchwarmer with a knuckleball personality and a wacky Cloak of Levitation. He arrived unheralded in 1963 in Strange Tales No. 110 as a     feature to the Human Torch. He was a slight,   afterthought dreamed up by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, who are better known for creating the Amazing  . Conceived at first in the cornball tradition of comics necromancers like Mandrake the Magician and Mr. Mystic, Doctor Strange gradually staked out a singular position as a master of the mystic arts and, eventually, Sorcerer Supreme. And unlike most Marvel heroes, who rely on their fists, he uses magic to defend Earth from malign, otherworldly threats like the   Dread Dormammu and the nefarious Nightmare. He finally got his own comic book in 1968, but it was canceled the next year. Not even Doctor Strange\u2019s mighty enchantments could overcome poor sales, a sad hallmark of his      career. But now potential vindication is near. \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d opens Friday, Nov. 4, with Benedict Cumberbatch starring. Based on my many decades of   study, here are 10 things you should know before you see the movie. Magic, after all, can be exhilarating but befuddling. 1. HE\u2019S A REAL DOCTOR Before draping his cape and waggling his fingers, Stephen Strange was a talented yet arrogant surgeon, driven by ego and ambition. So he\u2019s your man, whether you\u2019ve got a bad ticker or, as Jason Aaron wrote in the recent graphic novel \u201cThe Way of the Weird,\u201d \u201cyour daughter started cursing in Latin and walking like a spider. \u201d 2. HE\u2019S AN ALLITERATION ADDICT This is really the writer Stan Lee\u2019s fault, but Strange can\u2019t speak without racking up   points. His many munificent mutterings include: the Shadowy Shades of the Seraphim, the Seven Rings of Raggadorr and  \u2014   who can forget?  \u2014   the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth. 3. HE\u2019S GROOVY, MAN! In the 1960s and early \u201970s, he did have a certain counterculture cachet. In T. Rex\u2019s \u201cMambo Sun,\u201d Marc Bolan sang, \u201cOn a mountain range, I\u2019m Doctor Strange for you. \u201d A 1965 psychedelic concert in San Francisco was called \u201cA Tribute to Dr. Strange,\u201d  and he showed up on the cover of the Pink Floyd album \u201cA Saucerful of Secrets\u201d (1968). 4. HE\u2019S A MERRY PRANKSTER, TOO Speaking of the counterculture, the doc also appeared in \u201cThe Electric   Acid Test,\u201d Tom Wolfe\u2019s nonfiction chronicle of the   trip taken by the novelist Ken Kesey and his   Merry Pranksters. Mr. Wolfe wrote of Kesey reading comic books, \u201cabsorbed in the plunging purple Steve Ditko shadows of Dr. Strange. \u201d The writer Roy Thomas later returned the favor, giving Mr. Wolfe a   in Doctor Strange No. 180 in 1969. 5. HE LIVES IN THE VILLAGE (OF COURSE) Stephen Strange\u2019s   Sanctum Sanctorum sits in Greenwich Village at 177A Bleecker. Presumably it\u2019s not too far from his preferred watering hole, the   Bar With No Doors. 6. HE\u2019S A MAGICAL LADIES MAN Sure, he routinely saves the world  \u2014   if not the universe  \u2014   but Strange is also something of a cad and a hound. He\u2019s been known to make out with any entity that\u2019s vaguely female in form, including insectlike  . Really, he\u2019s more likely to be killed by a spurned girlfriend than by one of his archenemies. 7.  HE\u2019S NO ALI He prefers to hurl spells, incantations and mystic bolts, but Doctor Strange will engage in physical combat if he has to. He knows martial arts, but his weapon of choice (in this fleshly plane of existence) is a baseball bat wrapped in enchanted barbed wire. 8. HE KNOWS SUPERNATURAL BONDAGE One disturbing element during Strange\u2019s Ditko years ( ) was how often Clea, the doctor\u2019s love interest, was drawn bound and in poses of submission. But the Ditko biographer Blake Bell explained in \u201cStrange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko,\u201d that in the years he worked on the character, Mr. Ditko shared a studio at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street in Manhattan with Eric Stanton, a fetish artist. Stanton was best known for his bondage work on comic strips like \u201cSweeter Gwendolyn\u201d and \u201cConfidential TV. \u201d Maybe something stuck with Mr. Ditko. 9. HIS MENTOR WAS NOT TILDA SWINTON In the coming movie, Doctor Strange\u2019s mentor, the Ancient One, is played by a beguiling if tough Tilda Swinton. In the comics, Ancient is male, an archaic Asian relic who owns an I\u2019    face that looks like a fossilized prune. Ms. Swinton\u2019s version is Celtic, and the change was one of a number of developments that led to renewed controversy over Hollywood\u2019s whitewashing of Asian characters. 10. HIS DEFINING ARTIST WAS STEVE DITKO Though he stopped drawing the character in 1966, Steve Ditko is still the definitive Doctor Strange artist. For four years Mr. Ditko imagined Strange\u2019s netherworlds,   dimensions and   phantasmagorias. (It\u2019s hard to believe upon reading Doctor Strange that Mr. Ditko also once drew the   bulk of the Incredible Hulk.) As the comics historian Dean Mullaney has written of Ditko, \u201cHe took the ethereal and made it tangible. \u201d And two books have just been published that provide full access to Mr. Ditko\u2019s dreamscapes. \u201cDitko Unleashed\u201d (IDW) is the generously illustrated catalog for a Ditko retrospective on display through Jan. 8 at the Casal Solleric museum in Mallorca, Spain, while the \u201cDoctor Strange Omnibus\u201d (Marvel) reprints his full, epic run on the character. As the Marvel artist John Romita Sr. who succeeded Mr. Ditko on   told Mr. Bell, \u201cNo one could do Doctor Strange like him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562185.7054415}
