Trump campaign planning \"talk radio blitz.\" Recruiting volunteers to call shows with talking points. https://t.co/eWR5qLKRjR \\n\u2014 Real Charlie Sykes (@SykesCharlie) October 31, 2016 \\nFrom the Trump campaign\u2019s call to action: \\nTrump Talk Radio Blitz 2016 Help get Donald Trump elected! Please sign up below to volunteer to call into talk radio over the final days of this Presidential campaign and tell Wisconsin\u2019s voters why you support Donald Trump. We are looking for volunteers to sign up as a Trump Talk Radio Blitz Call Captain and/or a Trump Talk Radio Blitz Caller. \\nThank you for your willingness to help elect Donald Trump and Mike Pence this very important election year! \\nWhat will these call captains do? Oh, \u201cmonitor\u201d other the show and discussions, give talking points \u2014 you know, propaganda: \\nI am willing to help! (check all the apply) I am willing to serve as a Trump Talk Radio Blitz Call Captain, taking responsibility to monitor and recruit other callers for one or more talk radio programs between now and election day \\nI am willing to be a Trump Talk Radio Blitz Caller and select one or more 15 minute segments for local talk radio shows to call into and promote Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \\nCall \u201cCaptains\u201d will be in charge of entire shows to make sure the Trump message gets out and \u201cmonitor\u201d discussions lest anyone bring any facts to the air: \\nCall Captains will sign up to be responsible for an entire talk radio program or programs between now and the election to 1) help recruit callers to call in and promote Donald Trump\u2019s campaign throughout the program for that day, 2) remind Trump Talk Radio Blitz Callers who have sign up of their commitment to call into the show, 3) help ensure your Trump Talk Radio Blitz Callers are prepared to discuss the show\u2019s topics, 4) monitor the show and the discussions, and 5) report your successes back to the campaign. \\nPaid for by the Trump campaign: \\nI mean, it\u2019s working so well for the Trump spokespeople, especially those propaganda artists embedded on a certain cable network. Why not organize non-professionals to give the same talking points and disseminate them in a way that appears \u201corganic\u201d. LOL, I kid. If you\u2019ve run into these people in a comment section or forums you know they have the campaign message down so exactly as to be a screaming siren of talking points. \\nSo when you hear screaming tinfoil about fake polls and accusations that Hillary Clinton committed treason even though she was actually cleared, you needn\u2019t worry that your entire country has gone insane. \\nThis is the last gasp of a sinking campaign trying to fool the voters with media propaganda dished out by \u201cvolunteers\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742628483.0222108}
