The Bushes, like other patriotic establishment figures, always honor the troops, and count the sacrifices. Typically, they are stoic and praiseworthy of everything the military does. But underneath the surface, one has to wonder what is really going on inside the disturbed mind of George W. Bush \u2013 whose orders for an illegal war in Iraq, and a broader War on Terror in Afghanistan and elsewhere resulted in the deaths of thousands of U.S. troops, tens of thousands of wounded or injured and potentially more than a million civilians dead. \\nDoes he feel remorse? Guilt? Has he admitted to his personal responsibility for what happened to their lives? Or do his paintings reveal a morbid sense of power over the lives of men and women whom he can only reflect upon and humanize after the fact? Considering that the Iraq war was based upon a provable lie \u2013 or false intelligence if you prefer to lie to yourself \u2013 something seems very off about honoring victims who wouldn\u2019t have been harmed if Bush himself hadn\u2019t authorized the actions that took place under his watch. \\nGeorge W. Bush Paints Portraits Of The Veterans Who Were \u201cInjured Carrying Out My Orders\u201d \\nby John Vibes\\nThis Veterans Day, former president George W. Bush revealed one of his favorite hobbies and talents, painting portraits. However, there was an extremely disturbing twist.\\nThis week, Bush posted a photo to his official Instagram account, showing himself in an art room painting portraits of the veterans who were injured carrying out his orders. He was even brazen enough to describe the situation in those exact words.\\nIn the caption below the photo, Bush said,\\nOver the past several months, I\u2019ve painted the portraits of 98 wounded warriors I\u2019ve gotten to know \u2013 remarkable men and women who were injured carrying out my orders. I think about them on #VeteransDay and every day. Their paintings and stories will be featured in PORTRAITS OF COURAGE \u2013 a book and special exhibit \u2013 next spring, and I am donating all my proceeds to @thebushcenter and our Military Service Initiative\u2019s work to honor and support them. Click link in bio for more info.\\nIs this a slap in the face to the veterans who Bush sent to be injured and die in senseless wars, or does he actually have remorse for the part he played in the conflicts?\\nThe portraits will also be featured in a book that will be released by the former president and will tell the stories of the veterans depicted in the paintings.\\nFor some reason, despite the fact that Bush said he painted 98 veterans, the official \u201cportraits of courage\u201d series consists of a total of 66 images, according to the website. \\n66 is a bit of a strange number for them to select, don\u2019t you think?\\nThe paintings in the book will be the subject of a special exhibit at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas on the campus of SMU that will be open to the public from March 2, 2017 through October 1, 2017.\\nThis article was written by John Vibes and originally published at Activist Post.com . \\nJohn Vibes is an author and researcher who organizes a number of large events including the Free Your Mind Conference .
