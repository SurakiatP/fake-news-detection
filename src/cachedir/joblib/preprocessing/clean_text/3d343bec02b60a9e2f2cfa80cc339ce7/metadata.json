A new plot twist in a Washington drama: Two White House officials helped Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, view the secret reports that showed incidental surveillance of the Trump campaign. Several U. S. officials identified the pair as Ezra   the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, who works at the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. In the evening, we learned that Michael Flynn, the   national security adviser, had offered to talk to congressional investigators, if he is granted immunity. _____ 2. President Trump spent part of the day inciting fellow Republicans. \u201cThe Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don\u2019t get on the team,  fast,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The bloc\u2019s foiling of the health care bill has rekindled the civil war between the party\u2019s establishment and   conservatives like Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, above. In the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence cast the deciding \u201cyea\u201d vote on a measure to allow states to block funding to clinics that perform abortions. _____  3. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is heading to his first NATO meeting, after meeting with the Turkish president. Mr. Tillerson showered praise on the Turkish government, which has been accused of authoritarian tactics. But he got an earful over U. S. support for Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria. _____ 4. Just two months into the Trump presidency, the U. S. military is becoming more involved in a string of complex wars that lack clear endgames  \u2014   and often endanger civilians. In the latest case, Mr. Trump relaxed engagement rules for counterterrorism strikes in Somalia, preparing to escalate the campaign against the   Islamist group  Shabab. Above, a child in a cholera center in Baidoa, Somalia, just a few miles from Shabab territory. _____ 5. Uproar on opposite sides of the world. In South Korea, the ousted president, Park   was arrested on criminal charges of bribery and abuse of power. And in Venezuela, there was a big step toward   rule under the leftist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as his loyalists on the Supreme Court effectively dissolved the elected legislature. _____ 6. North Carolina\u2019s legislature passed a bill to repeal its \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d and the governor immediately signed it. The repeal, ending public bathroom rules aimed at transgender people, does not satisfy many critics. And it\u2019s not yet clear whether it will reverse a national backlash from companies, entertainers and sports leagues  \u2014   most notably the N. C. A. A.  \u2014   that boycotted the state, calling the law discriminatory. _____ 7. \u201cSometimes I think they\u2019ll come again, even here. I have nightmares  \u2014   they\u2019re coming to kill me, they\u2019re coming to kill me. \u201d That    girl is one of 130, 000 people who fled the Islamist militants of Boko Haram, only to find themselves stuck along a barren desert highway in Niger, near the Nigerian border. It\u2019s a literal road to nowhere. Begun by a Chinese oil company, construction stopped two years ago after attacks spiked. _____ 8. A vanguard of prosecutors across the country has jettisoned the traditional  \u2019  approach and embraced alternatives to harsh punishment. Some are facing a backlash from law enforcement groups and more conservative politicians. Among them is Aramis Ayala, the new chief prosecutor in Orlando, who announced this month that she would no longer seek the death penalty. _____ 9. A first for the space industry: SpaceX launched a commercial satellite into space with the boost of a partly used rocket, a feat that may open an era of cheaper space travel. And it might be able to be used again, because the rocket returned in one piece, landing on a floating platform in the Atlantic. _____ 10. A revival of the 1978 musical \u201cZoot Suit\u201d is a smash hit in Los Angeles, where fans have been showing up decked out in vintage gear. The production, which was also adapted for film, is a fantastical reimagining of the   Sleepy Lagoon murder case in 1942, in which   youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge. \u201cWe still have some of the same problems,\u201d said Leka Im, above left with her twin sister Lekit. \u201cThis is something we all need to see to understand L. A. \u201d _____ 11. Finally, dive into a futuristic whodunit: \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a   movie adaptation of a Japanese comic book, in theaters this weekend. The director, Rupert Sanders, discusses a scene featuring Scarlett Johansson, who plays a   character who physically walks through a geisha robot\u2019s digital memories to figure out how the robot was hacked.
