(Photos by AFP) \\nUS Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton\u2019s policy towards Syria would \u201clead to World War III\u201d, arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into an armed confrontation with Russia. \\nTrump made the warning in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, following Clinton\u2019s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria earlier this month. \\n\u201cWhat we should do is focus on ISIL (Daesh). We should not be focusing on Syria,\u201d Trump said. \\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \\nOn October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. \\nClinton also described the situation in Syria as \u201cincredibly complex\u201d since the intervention of Russia. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at an early vote rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek, Florida, on October 25, 2016. \\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fighting Syria anymore; you\u2019re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,\u201d Trump said. \\nThe Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. \\n\u201cAssad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,\u201d Trump said. \\nRussia might down US planes \\nMeanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton\u2019s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. \\nSpeaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton\u2019s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. James Clapper, the US director of National Intelligence, speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations, on October 25, 2016 in New York City. \\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they \u2014 if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cI take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they \u2014 why they did that,\u201d Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. \u201cThe system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It\u2019s very capable. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.\u201d \\nDuring the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. \\nA foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups \u2014 each supported by one foreign country or another \u2014 fighting the Assad government. \\nSince 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. \\nInstead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the country\u2019s infrastructure. \\nIran has been offering Syria advisory military help. Russia, another Syrian ally, has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in Syria at a request from Damascus. \\nThe foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.'"}, "time": 1742562959.745136}
