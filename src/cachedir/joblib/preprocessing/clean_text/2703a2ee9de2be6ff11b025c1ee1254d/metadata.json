And the FBI demonstrated with taking down the former head of the CIA [David Petraeus in 2012] over classified information given to his mistress that almost no one was untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that. \u2018No one can resist us,\u2019\u201d Assange told the Australian journalist during the 25-minute interview. \u2018This is treason\u2019: Clinton\u2019s email server reportedly exposed to hackers of 5 spy agencies \u201cBut Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI\u2019s investigation. So, there is anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak.\u201d FBI director James B. Comey threw a spanner into the presidential race that threatened to become a Clinton procession last week, when he claimed that the agency had potentially obtained new information pertaining to Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server, set up shortly after she became Secretary of State in 2009, when they obtained the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the ex-husband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner was being investigated for an unrelated sexting offense. Clinton has categorically denied mishandling classified information by using a vulnerable personal email address for State Department business. Fox News has alleged that the FBI has obtained new evidence from Weiner\u2019s computer that shows that Clinton was \u201cvery likely hacked.\u201d The right-wing network has also claimed that there is a \u201chigh priority\u201d FBI investigation into whether favors were exchanged by Clinton for donations to her husband\u2019s foundation, though other media have refuted these claims, saying that an earlier investigation into the Clinton Foundation, which cleared the power couple, remained closed. Assange: Clinton & ISIS funded by same money, Trump won\u2019t be allowed to win (JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE) Assange, whose WikiLeaks website has over the last ten months released three sizable batches of emails, relating to Clinton herself, the Democratic National Committee, and her campaign manager John Podesta, said the FBI has cause to investigate Clinton. \u201cThere\u2019s a thread that runs through all of these emails. There is quite a lot of \u201cpay-to-play,\u201d as they call it \u2013 taking\u2026 giving access in exchange for money for many individual states, individuals and corporations. Combined with the cover-up of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails while she was Secretary of State this has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI [to investigate] increases,\u201d Assange said. Regardless of whether Clinton ever faces charges, Assange asserted that Clinton was beholden to corporate and political entities that have been hidden from the electorate during the race to the White House. \u201cShe\u2019s this centralizing cog, so that you\u2019ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs, and major elements of Wall Street, and intelligence, and people in the State Department, and the Saudis, and so on. She\u2019s is the, if you like, the centralizer that interconnects all these different cogs. She\u2019s smooth central representation of all that, and all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States,\u201d stated Assange, who said that the leaked emails presented a clear picture of this nexus of influences. Assange also insisted that despite his image, projecting hope and change, President Barack Obama became \u201cvery close to banking interests\u201d during his own initial White House campaign in 2008. \u201cIn fact, one of the most significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed \u2013 and half the [first] Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from Citibank. It is quite amazing,\u201d Assange said. \u2018Libya was Hillary\u2019s war\u2019 According to Assange, Clinton\u2019s emails reveal a masterplan, hatched months before the West\u2019s intervention in Libya in March 2011, to make it the signature conflict of her tenure as secretary of state, and a podium from which to realize her presidential dreams. Assange: WikiLeaks did not receive Clinton emails from Russian govt (JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE) \u201cLibya more than anyone else\u2019s war was Hillary Clinton\u2019s war. Barack Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person who was championing it? Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s documented throughout her emails,\u201d Assange said. \u201cThere\u2019s more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails we published just about Libya. It\u2019s not about that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state something that she would use to run in the general election for president. So late 2011, there\u2019s an internal document called the \u201cLibya Tick Tock\u201d that is produced for Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s all the\u2026 it\u2019s a chronological description of how Hillary Clinton was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state.\u201d But the scheme not only failed on a personal level, after Clinton was largely blamed for allowing a jihadist ransacking of a US compound in Benghazi in 2012, but also continues to haunt the country, which remains in a state of civil war, and Europe. \u201cAs a result, there [have been] around 40,000 deaths within Libya. Jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in. That led to the European refugee and migrant crisis, because not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people then fleeing Syria, destabilization of other African countries as a result of arms flows,\u201d said Assange. Over the course of the interview, Assange also expounded on his views on Donald Trump, the relationship between WikiLeaks and Russia, and his plan to leave the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has lived as a legal fugitive since 2012. The full transcript of the interview is available below. Assange: Clinton is a cog for Goldman Sachs & the Saudis (JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE VIDEO & TRANSCRIPT) Published time: 5 Nov, 2016 05:59 Edited time: 5 Nov, 2016 21:53 Australian journalist and documentary maker John Pilger (L) and Julian Assange, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of WikiLeaks \u00a9 Reuters / Dartmouth Films Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special, courtesy of Dartmouth Films, in which he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails released by WikiLeaks this year. John Pilger, another Australian \u00e9migr\u00e9, conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy, where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Last month, Assange had his internet access cut off for alleged \u201cinterference\u201d in the American presidential election through the work of his website. \u2018Clinton made FBI look weak, now there is anger\u2019 John Pilger: What\u2019s the significance of the FBI\u2019s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? Julian Assange : If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively America\u2019s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA [General David Petraeus] over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI\u2019s investigation, so there\u2019s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We\u2019ve published about 33,000 of Clinton\u2019s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half \u2013 30,000 \u2014 to herself, and we\u2019ve published about half. BREAKING: #Assange : #Clinton resisted #FBI , and now they\u2019re out for payback (WATCH FULL JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE ON RT) Then there are the Podesta emails we\u2019ve been publishing. [John] Podesta is Hillary Clinton\u2019s primary campaign manager, so there\u2019s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. [These emails are] combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, [which] has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. \u2018Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks\u2019 JP: The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. JA: The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. WikiLeaks has been publishing for ten years, and in those ten years, we have published ten million documents, several thousand individual publications, several thousand different sources, and we have never got it wrong. \u2018Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton\u2019 JP: The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. I\u2019m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. JA: And twelve million dollars from Morocco \u2026 JP: Twelve million from Morocco yeah. JA: For Hillary Clinton to attend [a party]. JP: In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, that\u2019s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. JA: There\u2019s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it\u2019s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. JP: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. JA: Under Hillary Clinton, the world\u2019s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, [worth] more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. JP: Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. JA: Yes. JP: That\u2019s extraordinary. \u2018Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition\u2019 JA: I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? She\u2019s a centralising cog. You\u2019ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. WikiLeaks emails shows Citigroup\u2019s major role in shaping Obama administration\u2019s cabinet She\u2019s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. She\u2019s the smooth central representation of all that, and \u2018all that\u2019 is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It\u2019s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. JP: Didn\u2019t Citybank supply a list \u2026. ? JA: Yes. JP: \u2026 which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet. JA : Yes. JP: So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? JA: If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. Assange \u2018sorry for Clinton as a personality\u2019 (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films) JA: So I think you can\u2019t properly understand Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. \u2018Libya is Hillary Clinton\u2019s war\u2019 JP: Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us \u2013 told you \u2013 about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clinton\u2019s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? \u2018A very different kind of warfare\u2019: Clinton team on Benghazi committee leaks in #PodestaEmails JA: Libya, more than anyone else\u2019s war, was Hillary Clinton\u2019s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; there\u2019s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that we\u2019ve published, just about Libya. It\u2019s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state \u2014 something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa \u2014 previously people fleeing those problems didn\u2019t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: \u2018What do these Europeans think they\u2019re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There\u2019s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. \u2018Trump won\u2019t be permitted to win\u2019 JP: You get complaints from people saying, \u2018What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the Whitehouse?\u2019 Assange, Comey & Clinton: The Assange Twilight Zone (E354) JA: My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he\u2019s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn\u2019t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies\u2026 big foreign money \u2026 are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. JP: There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, \u2018Well, why doesn\u2019t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?\u2019 JA: We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. JP: Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? JA: [Let\u2019s talk about] Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, [which Hillary Clinton called] \u2018deplorable and irredeemable\u2019. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly \u2014 through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies \u2014 represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. \u2018US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status\u2019 JP: I\u2019d like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and [political asylum] in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we\u2019re doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuador\u2019s support for you? Pro-Hillary US State Dept \u2018behind Assange internet cutoff\u2019 \u2013 WikiLeaks activist to RT JA: Let\u2019s let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than \u00a312.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now there\u2019s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds \u2014 so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election [campaign], the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. [It means] that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; [they] try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. JP: Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. JA: I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared [by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne]. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won\u2019t happen]. JP: People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. JA: Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they\u2019re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, I\u2019m a bit institutionalised \u2014 this [the embassy] is the world .. it\u2019s visually the world [for me]. JP: It\u2019s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn\u2019t it? JA: It\u2019s the world without sunlight, but I haven\u2019t seen sunlight in so long, I don\u2019t remember it. JP: Yes. JA: So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children \u2014 they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. That\u2019s a hard, hard adaption which they didn\u2019t ask for. JP: Do you worry about them? JA: Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. \u2018I am innocent and in arbitrary detention\u2019 JP: Some people would say, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?\u2019 JA: The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. [So it\u2019s] me and the U.N. versus Sweden and the U.K. Who\u2019s right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that [those countries] must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, \u2018What\u2019s going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? [Assange] says that you should recognise his asylum.\u2019 [And here is] Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to [recognise the UN ruling], so leaving open their ability to extradite. I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesn\u2019t suit the Western establishment narrative \u2013 that yes, the West has political prisoners, it\u2019s a reality, it\u2019s not just me, there\u2019s a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts [that it should call] the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They don\u2019t call them political prisoners in China, they don\u2019t call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they don\u2019t call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. JA: Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? JP: Yes, it\u2019s different. JA: The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. [The rhetoric] is trying to avoid [the truth that ] the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.
