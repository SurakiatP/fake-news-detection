Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. \\nMaking matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. \\nThe videos, shot by ACORN slayer James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s group Project Veritas Action, show Foval on camera saying his agents \u201cinfiltrate\u201d Trump events. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the friggin\u2019 legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf****er.\u201d He adds, \u201cwe\u2019re starting anarchy here.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563889.587588}
