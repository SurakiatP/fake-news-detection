NASA released images Friday taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) that show what appeared to be scorch marks near the area where the craft was supposed to have touched down, implying that it may have exploded on impact. \\nProject scientist Jorge Vago suggested that ExoMars\u2019 parachute and heat shields may have deployed prematurely, and the thrusters, which are supposed to engage for 30 seconds, shut after three seconds due to a software glitch. \u00a9 Photo: Pixabay Mars \\'Ain\\'t No Limit\\': Elon Musk Envisions Future Colonization of Space \\nHe told Nature, \"My guess is that at that point we were still too high\u2026And the most likely scenario is that, from then, we just dropped to the surface.\" An investigation is ongoing, and data gleaned over the near future will determine whether ExoMars is intact, but the ESA said all of the craft\u2019s main goals had been achieved and the mission was a success, despite the unexpected impact. \\n\"As it is, we have one part that works very well and one part that didn\u2019t work as we expected,\u201d said Vago. \u201cThe silver lining is that we think we have in hand the necessary information to fix the problem.\" \\nThe ESA had a similar experience in 2003 when the British-led Beagle 2 mission disappeared attempting to make a Christmas Day landing on Mars. ...'"}, "time": 1742563711.4451032}
