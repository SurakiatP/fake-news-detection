I always mention the figure from 0.8 percent to 1 percent of the GDP growth that is not achieved\u2026 annually. That\\'s why the words that the sanctions are insignificant are not true. They have a significant impact on our economy, growth and living standards,\" Kudrin told reporters. \\nThe former minister added at the same time the sanctions were not effective as a political tool. \"It is another matter that [the sanctions] as the political tool do not function, do not work. I agree with this. It has not influenced our policy at all,\" Kudrin added. \\nFollowing the the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, the European Union and the United States accused Moscow of meddling in Kiev\u2019s internal affairs and imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia, as well as decreasing the general level of cooperation with Russia. The Russian authorities have refuted the allegations, warning that the Western measures are counterproductive. ...'"}, "time": 1742628416.3534884}
