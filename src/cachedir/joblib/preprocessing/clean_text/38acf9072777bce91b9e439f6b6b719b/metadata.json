If anything, these leaks have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the two-party system is an illusion and the whole construct is one huge pay-for-play corporate sham. Obamacare was always meant to destroy the private health care system and usher in single-payer, government run socialist medicine. It was designed that way\u2026 and it\u2019s \u201cworking\u201d. Related: Link In this particular e-mail, we get to see just how fake and fraudulent our government is. Your health determines how valuable of an asset you are and it\u2019s the main reason why we see \u201chealth tracking apparel\u201d and \u201chealth scores,\u201d designed by and for prominent health insurance companies in order to track your health data in-between doctor visits. Remember this quote by demon spawn Nancy Pelosi? \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t telling you something at the time, maybe this will\u2026 Picture: Link In an email thread dated September 26, 2015 between Hillary and her senior policy adviser, Ann O\u2019Leary, titled \u201cMemo on Cadillac Tax for HRC,\u201d Hillary wrote, \u201cGiven the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I\u2019ll support repeal w \u2018sense of the Senate\u2019 that revenues would have to be found. I\u2019d be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA.\u201d Do you still have any doubts? Sadly, there are those who have benefited from the ACA, but to a greater extent, many have seen the exact opposite of what was promised. Higher rates, less coverage, new doctors, etc\u2026 A Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can\u2019t afford the \u201caffordable\u201d health care? And the American people will look at this like a \u201cvictory\u201d when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. Which reminds me, when was the last time that the people had a victory? This just goes to show you that what is good for the goose isn\u2019t always good for the gander. They knew that going in and only after the fact, can we realize this. They wanted the ganders\u2019 money while the goose that benefits (through subsidiaries), cries to defend the ACA, making the rest of us look insensitive and unfair. Good plan\u2026 They\u2019re all working together, folks. Obamacare was always meant to fail \u2014 on purpose \u2014 to bring in a single-payer, government-controlled socialist medicine system. Don\u2019t believe me yet? Back in 2013, Senator Harry Reid had this to say about the ACA\u2026 Sen. Harry Reid: Obamacare \\'Absolutely\\' A Step Toward A Single-Payer System When I speak to conservatives about health care policy, I\u2019m often asked the question: \u201cDo you think that Obamacare is secretly a step toward single-payer health care?\u201d I always explain that, while progressives may want single-payer, I don\u2019t think that Obamacare is deliberately designed to bring about that outcome. Well, yesterday on PBS\u2019 Nevada Week In Review , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) was asked whether his goal was to move Obamacare to a single-payer system. His answer? \u201cYes, yes. Absolutely, yes.\u201d The plan to undermine your health and sufficiency is so diabolical and disgusting, that many would simply refuse to believe such a thing. Well, there it is folks. They don\u2019t give a damn about you or your well-being and will do anything in their power to see that decisions about your health are made by them in the future. For me personally, the ACA has increased my premium by 300%, causing me to drop what was offered by my employer and settle with less coverage for more money using the \"marketplace.\" Is this where I get to say... Thanks Obama?'"}, "time": 1742563418.8344567}
