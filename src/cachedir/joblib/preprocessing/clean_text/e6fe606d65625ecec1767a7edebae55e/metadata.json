Trump on Thursday accused Hillary Clinton of guiding a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that has rigged the economy against the working class, language that some suggested echoed   themes. Mr. Trump made the accusation in a speech in West Palm Beach, Fla. in which he also defended himself against several accusations of sexual harassment, published by The New York Times and others. Early in the speech, he said that a global elite had \u201cstripped\u201d the United States of its wealth in order to line the pockets of corporate and political interests. \u201cThe Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,\u201d he said, referring to the group that has, most recently, published thousands of hacked emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. The remarks drew criticism from some who said they resembled prejudicial language used by  . \u201cWhether intentionally or not, Donald Trump is evoking classic   themes that have historically been used against Jews and still reverberate today,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the   League, a group that fights discrimination, said in a statement. Mr. Greenblatt said the group feared that white supremacists might see the comments as tacit encouragement. \u201cMr. Trump focused on the very issues and themes that obsess conspiratorial  : They believe that there is an elite group of Jews who control the media, the government, and banking, and who are trying to destroy white America,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also believe that most of Hillary Clinton\u2019s donors are Jewish. \u201d The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Others drew a more direct comparison between Mr. Trump\u2019s words and those of  . In the speech, Mr. Trump also accused the \u201cClinton machine\u201d of wielding control over the news media, as well. \u201cThe most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press,\u201d he said to jeers from the audience. While the allegations were aimed at Mrs. Clinton, who is a Methodist, Jews have long been accused of conspiring to control institutions like banks and the media in order to amass wealth and power. In 1931, for example, the author A. N. Field described the creation of the American Federal Reserve as the moment the \u201c  engine of control\u201d enslaved the United States, according to the   League. That conspiracy theory has survived the ensuing decades and, even today, such   beliefs remain prevalent around the world, according to A. D. L. polling. In West Palm Beach on Thursday, reporters covering Mr. Trump returned to a table reserved for the press to find a sign bearing a swastika and the word \u201cMEDIA\u201d scrawled on it, Jim Acosta, a senior CNN White House correspondent, reported.'"}, "time": 1742564548.103277}
