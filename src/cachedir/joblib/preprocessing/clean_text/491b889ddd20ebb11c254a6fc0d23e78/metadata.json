Congress is demanding more information from James Comey and the Bureau by Monday. President Obama and The Department Of Justice say that Comey did not notify them before sending his letter to Congress. The New York Times reported that Obama\u2019s Department Of Justice still has not granted approval for the FBI to review the emails that were allegedly found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. \u201cWe do not have a warrant,\u201d a senior law enforcement official said. \u201cDiscussions are under way [between the FBI and the DOJ] as to the best way to move forward.\u201d Could this be a brilliant, somewhat sneaky, move by Comey? The question has been raised: A serious journalist, of which there are few today, would wonder if this isn\u2019t precisely WHY Comey went public @thegarance @maggieNYT pic.twitter.com/kwFum9LNO7 \\n\u2014 DanRiehl (@DanRiehl) October 30, 2016 \\nThe ball is now clearly in The Department of Justice\u2019s court. With both Hillary and Congress demanding the information now, the DOJ will have to issue the required warrant. Otherwise, Comey can claim to have done his job without fear of repercussions from the American public or the court system. \\nIt is true that Obama\u2019s DOJ has not investigated The Clinton Foundation and they discouraged Comey from looking into Hillary\u2019s email problems. Justice Dept. Strongly Discouraged Comey on Move in Clinton Email Case https://t.co/UjpRoz1OtC pic.twitter.com/WZXTn3DYqw \\n\u2014 DanRiehl (@DanRiehl) October 30, 2016 \\nComey just outran the angle. If Hillary and Congress are to get their answers, Obama\u2019s Justice Department will have to issue a warrant in order for them to get them. \\nOther factors are in play, as well. With WikiLeaks and other groups looming, and the likelihood of more damaging information on the way, Comey may not want to go down with what he views as a massive, corrupt ship. \\nWill Obama and the DOJ continue to stand behind Hillary? \\nWe will likely find out within the next WILD week.
