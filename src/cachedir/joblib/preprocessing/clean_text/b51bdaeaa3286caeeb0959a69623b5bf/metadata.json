Driving the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote were many of the same impulses that have animated American politics in this turbulent election year: anger at distant elites, anxiety about a perceived loss of national sovereignty and, perhaps most of all, resentment toward migrants and refugees. These are the themes that Donald J. Trump harnessed during the Republican presidential primaries to explosive effect, and that he aims to wield to his advantage again in his race against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump endorsed Britain\u2019s abandonment of the European Union and hailed the vote during a stop in Scotland on Friday. Veteran Republican and Democratic strategists say that Mr. Trump, and to a lesser extent, Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic contest, represent an American echo of the   politics that have swept across Europe in recent years. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental issue that all developed economies have to confront, which is that globalization and technological changes have meant millions of people have seen their jobs marginalized and wages decline,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former strategist for President Obama and an adviser to Britain\u2019s Labour Party in last year\u2019s general election. \u201cAnd so lots of folks want to turn the clock back and make America, or their country, great again. \u201d Although Mr. Trump may struggle to convert a message of national retrenchment into victory here, some of the stark divisions on display in Britain do mirror political trends in this country. The highly educated, younger voters around London who voted to remain in the European Union, for example, share some commonalities with the American urbanites who were the pillars of Mr. Obama\u2019s coalition. And Mr. Trump has triumphed with the American counterparts of the British \u201cLeave\u201d voters: older whites who lack university degrees and live in less prosperous regions of the English countryside. But beneath those generalities, there are crucial distinctions between the Brexit vote and the 2016 presidential election. In the United States, there is no recent history of electing nationalist presidents hostile to immigration, and even recent Republican presidents have celebrated new arrivals as integral to American prosperity and identity. American presidential elections are largely decided by a diverse and upscale electorate, anchored in America\u2019s cities and suburbs. These communities more closely resemble London than Lincolnshire. Minorities made up more than a quarter of the electorate in the last presidential campaign. And while Britain decided to leave the European Union through a popular vote, the White House race will be determined by the Electoral College, which is tilted toward the Democrats. Some large states with significant nonwhite populations have been out of reach for Republican candidates for much of the last three decades California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Pennsylvania have voted for every Democratic nominee since 1992. Mr. Obama also won Florida twice, and Mrs. Clinton has a lead there now in part because Mr. Trump is unpopular with Hispanics. Together those six states offer 166 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Mr. Trump is at an even greater disadvantage than other recent Republican presidential nominees because of his dismal standing with nonwhite,   and female voters. Unless he can reverse the deeply negative views such voters have of him, he is unlikely to capture the   communities around Philadelphia, Denver, Miami and Washington that are crucial to winning the White House. Joe Trippi, a Democratic political strategist who was a consultant for former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, said he expected the Brexit vote to embolden American conservatives. But their excitement, Mr. Trippi said, would be largely \u201ca false read\u201d of the results. \u201cThere are some very similar things  \u2014   a polarized electorate, nativism, nationalism were clearly big factors, and Trump exemplifies them here,\u201d Mr. Trippi said. \u201cBut there is a difference in the multiculturalism and diversity of the United States, versus nowhere near the same factors in the U. K. \u201d Despite high levels of concern about immigration and foreign trade, polls show that most Americans have so far recoiled from Mr. Trump\u2019s specific policy proposals, such as deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants. A survey published by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution on Thursday found that while Americans were closely split on the benefits of immigration and mostly said global trade was harmful, strong majorities rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to build a wall on the Mexican border and ban Muslim immigration. Further, the vote in Britain was a referendum on a European entity that was easy to rally against, while the presidential vote here is increasingly becoming a referendum on a polarizing individual. \u201cAmericans will be asked to vote for or against a person: Trump,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former press secretary for George W. Bush. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a higher hurdle. If you want to express yourself with a protest vote, you\u2019ll have to vote for Trump, and he is singularly unattractive and even offensive to a large majority of Americans. \u201d If the moment seemed to invite a triumphant, thematic victory speech by Mr. Trump on Friday, the candidate himself had other ideas. Appearing at a golf resort he owns in Turnberry, Scotland, Mr. Trump applauded the vote as an expression of national anger. But in the course of a meandering news conference, Mr. Trump dwelled on the virtues of his property there, and compared the difficulties of the American presidency to the task of refurbishing a golf course. Mr. Trump was dismissive of the economic ramifications of the referendum, and predicted that a downturn for the British pound would benefit his business. \u201cWhen the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mrs. Clinton responded with restraint, issuing a statement offering \u201crespect\u201d for the decision made by a close ally and offering assurances about \u201cAmerica\u2019s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain. \u201d The larger impact of the vote may not play out in this fall\u2019s election between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. But it will almost certainly divide the Republican Party in the years ahead, deepening the internal rift caused by the rise of Mr. Trump and his coalition. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, both widely thought to be considering presidential bids in 2020, quickly released statements that seized on the \u201cLeave\u201d vote as an illustration of the disconnect between the voters and internationalist leaders in Washington, London and Brussels. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who are both more supportive of free trade and may also be eyeing the White House, issued statements that notably did not target technocratic elites. Laura Ingraham, an influential conservative radio host who supports Mr. Trump, said both the Republican Party in America and Britain\u2019s Conservative Party had been torn apart by \u201cfights over globalism. \u201d In both cases, she said, \u201c  nationalists are seeking a major change\u201d  \u2014   so far, with some success. \u201cThe G. O. P. is becoming more nationalistic, and this trend will probably continue whatever happens with Trump,\u201d Ms. Ingraham wrote in an email before the referendum result was announced.'"}, "time": 1742562077.3279197}
