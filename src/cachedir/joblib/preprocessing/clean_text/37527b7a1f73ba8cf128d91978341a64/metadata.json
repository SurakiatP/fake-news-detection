[In 1975, 31. 9 million young people lived with a spouse, compared to just 19. 9 million in 2016, while the number of young people staying with their parents has risen from 14. 7 million to 22. 9 million, according to the U. S. Census Bureau.  Despite this vast difference, the number of young unmarried partners living together has risen from around 700, 000 to over 9. 2 million, while the number of young people living alone has also gone up from 5 percent to 8 percent. \u201cWhat does it mean to be a young adult? In prior generations, young adults were expected to have finished school, found a job, and set up their own household during their 20s \u2014  most often with their spouse and with a child soon to follow,\u201d explained the Census Bureau study. \u201cToday\u2019s young adults take longer to experience these milestones. \u201d \u201cWhat was once ubiquitous during their 20s is now not commonplace until their 30s. Some demographers believe the delays represent a new period of the life course between childhood and adulthood, a period of \u2019emerging adulthood\u2019 when young people experience traditional events at different times and in a different order than their parents did,\u201d they continued. \u201cWhat is clear is that today\u2019s young adults look different from prior generations in almost every regard: how much education they have, their work experiences, when they start a family, and even who they live with while growing up. \u201d The report also added, \u201cMore young men are falling to the bottom of the income ladder,\u201d pointing out that \u201cIn 1975, only 25 percent of men, aged 25 to 34, had incomes of less than $30, 000 per year. \u201d \u201cBy 2016, that share rose to 41 percent of young men (incomes for both years are in 2015 dollars),\u201d they continued. \u201cThere are now more young women than young men with a college degree, whereas in 1975 educational attainment among young men outpaced that of women. \u201d The majority of states with the highest number of young people staying with their parents were predominantly coastal. New Jersey took the top position with 46. 9 percent of   to    staying at home, followed by Connecticut (41. 6 percent) New York (40. 6 percent) Maryland (38. 5 percent) Florida (38. 3 percent) and California (38. 1 percent). At the bottom with the least amount of young people living with their parents was North Dakota with 14. 1 percent, following by South Dakota (19. 9 percent) Wyoming (20. 9 percent) Nebraska (22. 7 percent) Iowa (22. 8 percent) Montana (24. 1 percent) and Colorado (24. 6 percent).
