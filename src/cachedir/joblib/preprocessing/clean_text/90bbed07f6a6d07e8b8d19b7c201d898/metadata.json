In   Wells Fargo\u2019s federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, imposed additional restrictions on the troubled bank. The rules, part of which are intended to curb golden parachute packages, limit what payments Wells Fargo is permitted to make to terminated employees without explicit regulatory approval. Routine severance pay is sometimes exempted from such restrictions, but the federal rules for golden parachute pay are complex, and Wells Fargo\u2019s severance plan is not eligible for the exemption, according to Diana Rodriguez, a bank spokeswoman. Former employees at all levels of the company, from    branch workers to corporate executives, are affected by the hold. Wells Fargo\u2019s severance packages typically run from six weeks of pay to as long as 16 months, depending on the employee\u2019s length of service. The people affected are those whose jobs have been cut as part of Wells Fargo\u2019s regular business adjustments. They are not accused of wrongdoing. Workers who are fired for cause, such as those involved in the scandal, are not eligible for severance. In recent years, the bank has terminated 5, 300 employees in connection with its misconduct. The bank has asked the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval to make severance payments but has not yet received it, Ms. Rodriguez said. The payments add up to several million dollars. Wells Fargo has temporarily stopped all layoffs until it can resolve the issue. The freeze began on Nov. 21, three days after the bank was notified of the additional restrictions. But about 400 workers who were terminated right before the additional restrictions were imposed are caught in limbo. Wells Fargo has told them that their severance payments are indefinitely delayed. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for the hardship this creates for affected team members, and we are doing everything in our power to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the O. C. C. declined to elaborate beyond the highly technical   statement the agency released in November describing the additional restrictions being placed on Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has been in turmoil since September, when it admitted that thousands of its employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, had created as many as two million fraudulent accounts in the names of real customers. Some customers did not learn of the sham accounts until they began incurring fees on them. The O. C. C.  \u2014   which participated in a $185 million settlement deal with Wells Fargo that resolved several government lawsuits  \u2014   initially let the bank off fairly lightly, exempting it from some of the restrictions normally imposed on banks that break the law. Two months later, it reversed course and tightened its grip. What kind of oversight banks will face in the future is an open question. President Trump said this week that he intended to \u201cdramatically reduce federal regulations\u201d and do \u201ca big number\u201d on the   Act, the   law that increased Wall Street restrictions. Republicans have already begun floating proposals to strip funding and powers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulatory agency that, with the O. C. C. investigated Wells Fargo and drew national attention to its illegal acts. Investigators, including some hired by Wells Fargo, are still figuring out the full extent of the bank\u2019s misdeeds. In a meeting this month with Wells Fargo employees, Timothy J. Sloan  \u2014   who took over in October, after the bank\u2019s longtime leader, John G. Stumpf, was felled by the scandal  \u2014   acknowledged what a number of employees had previously said: that the bank may have retaliated against some workers who had tried to blow the whistle internally on its actions. Wells Fargo hired an outside investigator to review all calls made in the last five years to the bank\u2019s ethics hotline in which the employee gave a name. About 40 percent of those who called identified themselves, the bank said. In reviewing the records of employees who were fired within 12 months of making a call, the bank\u2019s investigator found a few cases that \u201craised questions,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a very small number, anything more than zero is too large. \u201d The bank is still researching those cases. Wells Fargo will \u201cwork with each individual\u201d on potential remedies, Richele J. Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said. \u201cWe are continuing to investigate, and whatever we find, we will make right,\u201d Ms. Messick said. Separately, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked the Department of Labor to provide an update this week on the status of its investigation of Wells Fargo. In September, Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary at the time, promised a \u201c   review\u201d of complaints filed against Wells Fargo. But a Labor Department web page on which Wells Fargo employees could report violations has abruptly disappeared, Ms. Warren noted in a letter sent on Friday. \u201cTaking down this website enables Wells Fargo to escape full responsibility for its fraudulent actions and the department to shirk its outstanding obligations to American workers,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote. That page was taken down in early January, nearly two weeks before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Stephen Barr, a Labor Department spokesman. He declined to comment on why the page had been removed. \u201cThe investigation is ongoing,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to respond to the senator, but there\u2019s no change here in the status of the review. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562210.887227}
