On Thursday, some of the nearly 130 people who once lived here returned, accompanied by firefighters, to try to retrieve a few belongings and mementos of a life that was obliterated in a few violent seconds of shaking. \u201cWhere was your bedroom?\u201d a young fireman asked a couple from under his yellow helmet. \u201cIt was where you see that white closet,\u201d the woman answered, indicating a few shelves without doors hanging open, over the hill. The sidewall of their   house collapsed down the slope, offering a glimpse of the intimacy of their lives. Italian officials now say that at least 267 people were killed in the mountain towns along the fault that erupted. But for the smallest of those places, like this one, the damage will be tallied not only in terms of the lost lives of family, friends and neighbors, but quite possibly the elimination of the towns themselves. Pescara del Tronto is gone. Perhaps five houses are left standing. And whether the place can ever be restored to the map seems an open question. The village is administratively part of the only slightly larger town of Arquata del Tronto, where 46 people are so far counted among the dead. For these largely isolated, hilltop towns in a rural region where the economy was already in decline, and where most of the permanent residents were already aging, the earthquake may be a coup de gr\u00e2ce, its own death knell. \u201cIt will be difficult for people to move back into Pescara del Tronto,\u201d Michele Franchi, vice mayor of Arquata del Tronto, said, speaking from the camp near the main town, where half the tower pinnacles collapsed. \u201cWe should even wonder whether it\u2019s wise to rebuild it right there, considering that it almost entirely came down. \u201d \u201cBut we need to move people out of tents quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cThey need to see a chance for life here to restart, where possible. \u201d Of the 300 who were in the village when the quake struck, many were people who kept weekend houses to take a break from Rome, about 95 miles away. \u201cI spent my life here,\u201d said Enza, 52, an employee from Rome whose family home has been here for decades. \u201cWe are lucky because our house did not collapse. My mom, dad and brother left safely. But our entire lives are gone  \u2014   so many friends, so many neighbors are no longer. How can we go back?\u201d Enza was in no spirit to provide her full name. Residents do not feel like talking in Pescara del Tronto. The police and rescue officials escorted the few residents who had the courage to come back the day after the tragedy, in silence. Enza came back to recover her elderly parents\u2019 medical devices and some clothes, so that they could feel somewhat less lost, she said. She was in Pescara del Tronto last weekend and went back to her work in Rome on Monday. Her brother took their parents safely into the street on Wednesday morning after the quake. The villages hit by the quake in the Marche region are along the ancient Roman road, the Via Salaria, that leads from Rome to the Adriatic Sea. Along this stretch of road, surrounded by green woods and high rocks, are now only cranes, tents and firefighters\u2019 jeeps and trucks. Officers assigned to different points of the road discouraged travelers from taking it. Pescara del Tronto has been a summer or weekend destination, but many travelers were not strictly tourists. \u201cThis place was home to me and to so many others,\u201d Enza said, breaking up in tears. \u201cNot just the physical place  \u2014   we all knew each other, so we all lost many, many members of our extended family. \u201d Enza said that, beyond the pain for lost friends and acquaintances, the worst part now was already the creeping nostalgia for a place that may have died with so many of its residents. \u201cThere used to be a stone step where we always sat down,\u201d she said, pointing to a spot now buried under collapsed beams, roofs and stone bricks. \u201cOur memories are completely erased. \u201d An ambulance passed by at full speed, sirens on, in the only narrow street leading into the town. Maybe one of her friends will become famous for being the last survivor taken out of the rubbles in Pescara del Tronto, Enza hoped. \u201cYou know, the worst is that this quake did not only take our future, but also took our past,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742563696.7229226}
