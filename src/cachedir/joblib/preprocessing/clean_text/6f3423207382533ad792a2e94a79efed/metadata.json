Though drawing a somewhat smaller audience than the first season, the show remains popular among critics and has developed a following among young viewers in particular. The series has won a Golden Globe for best drama series, and star Rami Malek won an Emmy award for his portrayal of Elliot Alderson, a security engineer-turned-vigilante hacker who leads a cyberattack on E Corp, described as \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest conglomerate.\u201d \\nIn the first season, Elliot is recruited into the hacker group \u201cfsociety\u201d by the mysterious Mr. Robot (Christian Slater). Fsociety plots to wipe out the debt records of E Corp in order\u2013\u2013in Mr. Robot\u2019s words\u2013\u2013to \u201ctake down\u201d the \u201cevil corporation\u201d and incite \u201cthe biggest revolution the world will ever see.\u201d The hack ultimately throws the global financial system into chaos. In a narrative twist, Mr. Robot is revealed to be a mental construct inside Elliot\u2019s head, based on memories of his dead father. \\nAt the start of the second season, Elliot has retreated to his mother\u2019s house, seemingly having abandoned his \u201crevolution\u201d to focus on ridding his mind of Mr. Robot. The cyberattack itself, far from \u201ctaking down\u201d E Corp, has instead caused it to consolidate its power. E Corp CEO Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer) is using the chaos created by the hack to secure a government bailout and to advance Ecoin, the company\u2019s proprietary digital currency. \\nMeanwhile, the effects of the financial crisis are largely being borne by the population itself. A credit crisis has frozen the accounts of masses of people, and most are forced to subsist on a $50 a day allowance. The economy is in freefall. Major cities have ceased trash collection, leaving mountains of garbage to pile up on city streets. E Corp banks have taken advantage of the loss of data to gouge customers for interest and loan payments that they have already paid. Large protests are a regular occurrence, and social unrest is boiling over. Taken at face value, the show depicts \u201crevolution\u201d as a cure worse than the disease, one that, at best, is the product of misguided naivet\u00e9; and at worst, inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery. \\nDarlene (Carly Chaikin) assumes leadership of fsociety. She is determined to \u201cfinish off\u201d E Corp by \u201cdestroying public confidence\u201d in the company, largely through the use of stunts and \u201csymbolic\u201d protests. Meanwhile, the killing of a key member of fsociety causes the hackers to fear that they are being targeted by the Dark Army, a shadowy group of Chinese hackers who participated in the E Corp cyberattack. At the same time, an FBI investigation led by agent Dom DiPierro (Grace Gummer) is closing in on the fsociety hackers, and the resultant panic and paranoia forms something of a throughline for the season. \\nThe first season of Mr. Robot suffered from a number of problems, not least of which was a kind of narrative hyperactivity that resulted in a maddening array of subplots, distractions and \u201ctwists.\u201d The series seemed unable to hold its attention on important matters, and the meagerness of the political content, steeped in a kind of shallow anarchism, limited its ability to say much when it did. But the first season also possessed what seemed a sincere outrage at the corporate-financial elite, the \u201ctop one percent of the top one percent\u201d who \u201csecretly run the world\u201d as Elliot says in the pilot. \\nThe second season is sharply different in tone. In place of the rapid-fire editing and the pounding, insistent soundtrack, the second season is much quieter and more slowly paced. One gets a sense that the show creators had a desire to settle down and tell a more grounded, perhaps more realistic story. \\nThey are partially successful in some places. The various scenes that take place among the E Corp elite are generally convincing, with recurring images of financial oligarchs gazing contemptuously\u2014and nervously\u2014down on crowds of protesters from high-rise offices. An atmosphere of foreboding and tension pervades. \\nIt doesn\u2019t take long, however, for the show\u2019s attempts at realism to descend into the kind of affected \u201cdarkness\u201d so prevalent in contemporary film. Characters wax pseudo-poetically on the human condition, generally expressing hopelessness and angst. Lines such as, \u201cWe\u2019re all just tightrope walking above that pit of ungodly pain that\u2019s daring us to trip up,\u201d are par for the course. The scenes themselves are underlit and gloomy, with shots scrubbed of color and framed to make the world seem inescapably isolating and cold. \\nMatters are not helped by the scenes involving Elliot\u2019s struggle with Mr. Robot, which end up becoming a tedious series of exchanges on the nature of \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201creality,\u201d \u201cillusion,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d etc. Additionally, Elliot\u2019s tenuous grasp on reality gives the show creators free reign to pull the rug out from under the audience whenever they see fit. \\nWhen Elliot states in an internal monologue that \u201cWe trust that [our senses] accurately portray the real world around us. But what if the haunting truth is they can\u2019t? That what we perceive isn\u2019t the real world at all, but just our mind\u2019s best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a fuzzy picture we will never truly make out?\u201d one is hardly surprised. T he change in tone is apparently a deliberate attempt on the part of the show creators to depict the consequences of the first season\u2019s \u201crevolution.\u201d Indeed, the fsociety hackers often express ambivalence, if not outright regret, for their actions in the first season, which everyone agrees have only made things worse.\\nIn the World Socialist Web Site \u2019s initial assessment of the show, we wrote that, \u201cThe idea of \u2018revolution\u2019 and \u2018revolutionaries\u2019 put forward by Mr. Robot is ludicrous \u2026 In general, the series appears to have little interest, despite the references to inequality, in the conditions of wide layers of the population, much less any conception that masses of people will take part in the process of changing things. This is a \u2018revolution\u2019 carried out by (and presumably for) a layer of disgruntled computer engineers and other professionals.\u201d \\nThe creators\u2019 conceptions have led them from outrage to pessimism. It is no doubt true that a cyberattack like the one depicted in the first season would likely bring about little more than increased state repression. But insofar as the show creators continue to identify these actions with \u201crevolution\u201d while refusing to see an alternative, they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself. Taken at face value, the show depicts \u201crevolution\u201d as a cure worse than the disease, one that, at best, is the product of misguided naivet\u00e9; and at worst, inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery. \\nMore than a few retrograde elements accompany all this, including the sympathetic portrayal of the FBI and an undercurrent of anti-Chinese chauvinism. \\nBy the end of the season, some of the fsociety \u201crevolutionaries\u201d have set out a plan that would include an act of violent terrorism, while others are speculating about the possibility of \u201cundoing\u201d the effects of the hack and \u201cputting everything back the way it was.\u201d One has little reason to believe that any of this will turn out well.

It appears frequently in certain kinds of imaginative fiction \u2013 from Star Trek to the Marvel comics Batman film franchise . The message is that revolutionaries aren\u2019t your friends. They don\u2019t \u2018really\u2019 want to change the world for the better. According to the trope, revolutionaries are primarily dangerous, selfish, narcissists who are, \u201ctoo cowardly\u201d (or too \u201clazy\u201d) to \u201cwork within the system\u201d for \u201creal change\u201d . grok \u2022 11 hours ago \\n\u2018More than a few retrograde elements accompany all this, including the sympathetic portrayal of the FBI and an undercurrent of anti-Chinese chauvinism.\u2019 \\nThis is indeed one of the main things about the show which repels me (aside from the usual bourgeois \u2014 and Hollywood \u2014\u2018take\u2019 on what \u2018revolution\u2019 actually is): its turning of yet another TV show with initial potential into really just another \u2018cop\u2019 propaganda show: this time portraying the FBI secret police as being (yet again) essentially the \u2018good guys\u2019. The other is the almost shocking portrayal of the chinese (hackers or their de facto chinese government backers) as being the usual \u2018inscrutable\u2019, \u2018Yellow Peril\u2019 Threat from the East\u2026 \\nOTOH some of the best elements of the show \u2014 aside from the somewhat accurate portrayal of what hacking actually is, and how it is actually accomplished (with eventual, obvious \u2018product placement\u2019\u2014 the \u2018Pwn Phone\u2019\u2014 by those who must be technical consultants to the show) \u2014 are some scenes where even the audience (I did) enters Elliot\u2019s disoriented dream state, along with him\u2026 like at the beginning of one episode where he is transported, along with his family, into a 1980\u2019s sitcom \u2014 with an apparent bloody body in the trunk of their car (c/o Mr. Robot), as they take a vacation trip down the turnpike. The author is correct about the weakness of this side of the show \u2014 leading to too many cheap \u2018Bobby-Ewing-in-the-shower\u2019 moments \u2014 but this particular one worked out exceptionally well. \\nAll-in-all, a disappointing promise, turned into yet another police propaganda show, with the big message: \u2018revolution is futile, kids!\u2019 plastered thruout.
