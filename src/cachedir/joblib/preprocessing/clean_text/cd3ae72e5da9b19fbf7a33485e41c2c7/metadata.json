He was 83. A nephew, the filmmaker Jordan   confirmed his death in a statement, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Mr. Wilder\u2019s rule for comedy was simple: Don\u2019t try to make it funny try to make it real. \u201cI\u2019m an actor, not a clown,\u201d he said more than once. With his haunted blue eyes and an empathy born of his own history of psychic distress, he aspired to touch audiences much as Charlie Chaplin had. The Chaplin film \u201cCity Lights,\u201d he said, had \u201cmade the biggest impression on me as an actor it was funny, then sad, then both at the same time. \u201d Mr. Wilder was an accomplished stage actor as well as a screenwriter, a novelist and the director of four movies in which he starred. (He directed, he once said, \u201cin order to protect what I wrote, which I wrote in order to act. \u201d) But he was best known for playing roles on the big screen that might have been ripped from the pages of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. He made his movie debut in 1967 in Arthur Penn\u2019s celebrated crime drama, \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d in which he was memorably hysterical as an undertaker kidnapped by the notorious   bank robbers played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. He was even more hysterical, and even more memorable, a year later in \u201cThe Producers,\u201d the first film by Mr. Brooks, who later turned it into a Broadway hit. Mr. Wilder played the    accountant Leo Bloom, who discovers how to make more money on a bad Broadway show than on a good one: Find rich backers, stage a production that\u2019s guaranteed to fold fast, then flee the country with the leftover cash. Unhappily for Bloom and his fellow schemer, Max Bialystock, played by Zero Mostel, their outrageously tasteless musical, \u201cSpringtime for Hitler,\u201d is a sensation. The part earned Mr. Wilder an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. Within a few years, the anxious,   popeyed Mr. Wilder had become an unlikely movie star. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as the wizardly title character in \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\u201d (1971). The film was a   disappointment, partly because of parental concern that the moral of Roald Dahl\u2019s story  \u2014   that greedy, gluttonous children should not go unpunished  \u2014   was too dark in the telling. But it went on to gain a devoted following, and Willy Wonka remains one of the roles with which Mr. Wilder is most closely identified. His next role was more adult but equally strange: an otherwise normal doctor who falls in love with a sheep named Daisy in a segment of Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask,\u201d in 1972. Two years later, he reunited with Mr. Brooks for perhaps the two   entries in either man\u2019s filmography. In \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d a raunchy,    spoof of Hollywood westerns, Mr. Wilder had the relatively quiet role of the Waco Kid, a boozy   who helps an improbable black sheriff (Cleavon Little) save a town from railroad barons and venal politicians. The film\u2019s   humor may have lost some of its edge over the years, but Mr. Wilder\u2019s next Brooks film, \u201cYoung Frankenstein,\u201d has never grown old. Mr. Wilder himself hatched the idea, envisioning a    film faithful to the look of the Boris Karloff \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d down to the laboratory equipment, but played for laughs rather than for horror. He would portray an American man of science, the grandson of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, who tries to turn his back on his heritage (\u201cthat\u2019s   \u201d) but finds himself irresistibly drawn to Transylvania to duplicate his grandfather\u2019s creation of a monster in a spooky mountaintop laboratory. Mr. Brooks\u2019s original reaction to the idea, Mr. Wilder recalled, was noncommittal: \u201cCute. That\u2019s cute. \u201d But he eventually came aboard as director and   and the two garnered an Oscar nomination for their screenplay. Serendipity played a role in the casting. Mr. Wilder\u2019s agent asked him to help find work for two new clients, and thus Marty Feldman became Frankenstein\u2019s assistant, Igor (\u201cthat\u2019s  \u201d) and Peter Boyle the monster. Madeline Kahn, whose performance as the chanteuse Lili Von Shtupp had been a highlight of \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d played the doctor\u2019s socialite fianc\u00e9e. Cloris Leachman was Frau Bl\u00fccher, the sound of whose name caused horses to whinny in fear. The name Bl\u00fccher, Mr. Wilder said in a 2008 interview with The San Jose Mercury News, came from a book of letters to and from Sigmund Freud: \u201cI saw someone named Bl\u00fccher had written to him, and I said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s the name. \u2019\u201d And Mr. Wilder certainly knew a lot about Freud. His first of many visits to a psychotherapist is the opening scene in the memoir he published in 2005, \u201cKiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art. \u201d \u201cWhat seems to be the trouble?\u201d the therapist asks. \u201cI want to give all my money away,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much do you have?\u201d \u201cI owe three hundred dollars. \u201d Soon the jokes and evasions give way to the torments of sexual repression, guilt feelings and his \u201cdemon,\u201d a compulsion, lasting several years, to pray out loud to God at the most embarrassing times and in the most embarrassing places. But never onstage or onscreen, where he felt free to be someone else. Gene Wilder was born Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee on June 11, 1933. His father, William, a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items, was an immigrant from Russia. His mother, the former Jeanne Baer, suffered from rheumatic heart disease and a temperament that sometimes led her to punish young Jerry angrily and then smother him with regretful kisses. He spent one semester at the   Military Institute in Hollywood. His mother saw it as a great opportunity in reality, it was a catch basin for boys from broken families, where he was regularly beaten up for being Jewish. Safely back home after that misadventure, he played minor roles in community theater productions and then followed his older sister, Corinne, into the theater program at the University of Iowa. After Iowa, he studied Shakespeare at the Bristol Old Vic Theater School in England, where he was the first freshman to win the school fencing championship. He next enrolled part time at the HB Studio in New York, while also serving a   Army hitch as an aide in the psychiatric unit of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Pennsylvania  \u2014   an assignment he requested because, he said, \u201cI imagined the things I would see there might relate more to acting than any of the other choices. \u201d He added, \u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong. \u201d After his discharge, he won a coveted spot at the Actors Studio, and it was then that he adopted the name Gene Wilder: Gene for Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Thomas Wolfe\u2019s \u201cLook Homeward, Angel,\u201d and Wilder for the playwright Thornton Wilder. In his first major role on Broadway, Mr. Wilder played the chaplain in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht\u2019s \u201cMother Courage and Her Children. \u201d The production ran for less than two months, and he came to believe that he had been miscast. The good news was that he met the boyfriend of the star, Anne Bancroft: Mel Brooks, who wore a pea coat the night he met Mr. Wilder backstage and told him, \u201cYou know, they used to call these urine jackets, but they didn\u2019t sell. \u201d So began the conversation that ultimately led to \u201cThe Producers. \u201d Mr. Wilder\u2019s association with Mr. Brooks led, in turn, to one with Richard Pryor, who was one of the writers of \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d (and Mr. Brooks\u2019s original choice for the part ultimately played by Mr. Little). In 1976, Mr. Pryor was   behind Mr. Wilder and Jill Clayburgh in \u201cSilver Streak,\u201d a comic thriller about murder on a transcontinental train. The two men went on to star in the 1980 hit \u201cStir Crazy,\u201d in which they played a hapless pair jailed for a crime they didn\u2019t commit, as well as \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\u201d (1989) and \u201cAnother You\u201d (1991). Mr. Wilder\u2019s first two marriages, to Mary Mercier and Mary Joan Schutz, ended in divorce. In 1982, he met the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian Gilda Radner when they were both cast in the suspense comedy \u201cHanky Panky. \u201d One evening, he recalled in \u201cKiss Me Like a Stranger,\u201d he and Ms. Radner innocently ended up at his hotel to review some script changes. The time came for her to go instead, she shoved him down on the bed, jumped on top of him and announced, \u201cI have a plan for fun!\u201d He sent her home anyway  \u2014   she was married to another man  \u2014   but before long, they began a relationship. By his account, Ms. Radner was needy, obsessed with getting married and, once they married in 1984, obsessed with having a child, a project that ended in miscarriage just months before she learned she had ovarian cancer in 1986. Of their first year of living together, he wrote: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get along well, and that\u2019s a fact. We just loved each other, and that\u2019s a fact. \u201d He left, only to find that he needed to go back. Ms. Radner died in 1989. \u201cI had one great blessing: I was so dumb,\u201d Mr. Wilder once said of her last years. \u201cI believed even three weeks before she died she would make it. \u201d In memory of Ms. Radner, he helped to found an ovarian cancer detection center in her name, in Los Angeles, and Gilda\u2019s Club, a network of support centers for people with cancer. He also contributed to a book, \u201cGilda\u2019s Disease\u201d (1998) with Dr. M. Steven Piver. Mr. Wilder himself developed  \u2019s lymphoma in 1999. With chemotherapy and a   transplant, he was in remission by 2005. In 1991 Mr. Wilder married Karen Boyer, a hearing specialist who had coached him in the filming of \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil,\u201d in which his character was deaf and Mr. Pryor\u2019s was blind. She survives him, as does a daughter from an earlier marriage. His sister died in January. Even before he became ill, Mr. Wilder had begun slowing down. He made his first and last attempt at a television series, the   and   comedy \u201cSomething Wilder,\u201d in 1994. He returned to the theater in 1997 in a London production of Neil Simon\u2019s \u201cLaughter on the 23rd Floor. \u201d In 1999 he was a writer for two TV movies in which he starred, \u201cMurder in a Small Town\u201d and \u201cThe Lady in Question,\u201d playing a theater director turned amateur sleuth. In 2001 he appeared at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut in a program of   farces. Shortly after appearing in an episode of \u201cWill  Grace\u201d in 2003  \u2014   he won an Emmy for that role  \u2014   he declared that he had retired from acting for good. \u201cI don\u2019t like show business, I realized,\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cI like show, but I don\u2019t like the business. \u201d He was by then enjoying a new career as a novelist. His \u201cMy French Whore,\u201d published in 2007, was the story of a na\u00efve young American who impersonates a German spy in World War I. (\u201cJust fluff, but sweet fluff,\u201d the novelist Carolyn See wrote in her review in The Washington Post.) It was followed by two more novels, \u201cThe Woman Who Wouldn\u2019t\u201d and \u201cSomething to Remember You By,\u201d and a story collection, \u201cWhat Is This Thing Called Love?\u201d But it was, of course, as an actor that Mr. Wilder left his most lasting mark. In his memoir, he posed a question about his life\u2019s work, then answered it: \u201cWhat do actors really want? To be great actors? Yes, but you can\u2019t buy talent, so it\u2019s best to leave the word \u2018great\u2019 out of it. I think to be believed, onstage or onscreen, is the one hope that all actors share. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564094.8584397}
