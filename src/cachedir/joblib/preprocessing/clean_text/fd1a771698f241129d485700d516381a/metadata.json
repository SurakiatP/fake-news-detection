A book BY YOU,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA permanent, beautiful, holdable,       shareable, tearstainable book. \u201d But pretty swiftly, she faced a backlash from some of the page\u2019s members, who derided the deal as a betrayal of the group\u2019s primary function as a private place for people to share personal stories. Many commenters asked whether people whose stories appeared in the book would be compensated, and how the profits would be spent. Some accused Ms. Chamberlain of crass profiteering. \u201cWhat a  ! You had the biggest group of new political activists this country has ever seen, and you chose   and profiting off that instead of harnessing that energy to make the country better,\u201d one member wrote on the page. \u201cVery disappointed,\u2019\u2019 another group member fumed. \u201cI was hoping this group would become a powerful force for activism to fight the evil we all have to face. You chose another direction and that\u2019s your right of course. But my energy and money is going elsewhere. \u201d The book, which is scheduled to be published in May by Flatiron Books, will draw on the stories and images from the group, which now has around four million members. In her original announcement on Monday, Ms. Chamberlain encouraged people who want to submit their posts and stories to contact her, and said that she would seek permission from others to use their material. In a   post addressing irate members on Wednesday, she explained that the proceeds would be used to \u201csupport Pantsuit Nation and the causes that are central to the group. \u201d She also said that the Pantsuit Nation nonprofit organizations she is forming will help raise money for other   groups, including Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Some members voiced their support for Ms. Chamberlain\u2019s plans, arguing that a book would amplify the group\u2019s message beyond Facebook. Still, others saw the deal as another big letdown after their hopes of electing a woman to the country\u2019s highest office were crushed on Nov. 8. \u201cI voted for the first female POTUS and all I got was this lousy book,\u201d one person wrote.'"}, "time": 1742562234.4716706}
