Weiner. \\nThe F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case \u2014 one federal official said they numbered in the thousands \u2014 potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. \\nFBI Director James Comey referenced these emails in his letter to Congress announcing that the Clinton case had been reopened: \u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d \\nComey wrote that while it was unclear how long it would take to conduct the investigation in light of the new information or whether or not it would prove to be \u201csignificant,\u201d he wanted to inform Congress of the development. He added: \\nIn previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. \\nAt a New Hampshire rally, Donald Trump commented on the reopened investigation and even said that the election \u201cmight not be as rigged\u201d as he had thought it was. Trump went on to praise the FBI and the Department of Justice, who he said had the \u201ccourage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d \\nWell, we might not want to go that far yet. Hopefully Trump\u2019s optimism is correct, but I\u2019m a bit more cynical. I\u2019ll believe that the wrong has been righted when I see it. \\nRight now, I\u2019m more apt to believe that the reopened investigation has an angle that is set to benefit Clinton. At this point, I find it hard to believe that anything is going to be done to actually hold Clinton accountable \u2014 not under the Obama administration and not after what we\u2019ve seen. \\nTime will tell, and hopefully my cynical side will be proven wrong.'"}, "time": 1742562075.9689844}
