Since the Tea Party wave of 2010 that swept House Republicans into power, a raucous, intransigent and loosely aligned group of lawmakers known as the Freedom Caucus  \u2014   most from heavily Republican districts  \u2014   has often landed a punch to its own party\u2019s face. Friday\u2019s defeat of the Republican leadership\u2019s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a return to form, handing an immense defeat to President Trump and embarrassing Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his own House. It also challenged the veracity of their   claims that a Republican president was all they needed to get big things accomplished. The most important question for Republicans now is whether the members of the Freedom Caucus will find themselves newly emboldened in ways that may bring the new president more defeats  \u2014   or whether Mr. Ryan will do what former Speaker John A. Boehner could not, and find a way to shred their influence for good. \u201cIf you are defined by your opposition to leadership, it\u2019s hard to be part of a governing coalition,\u201d said Alex Conant, a onetime aide to Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who was once a Tea Party star. \u201cTheir opposition to Trump\u2019s health care bill should surprise nobody who\u2019s paid attention for the last six years. Even the world\u2019s best negotiator can\u2019t make a deal with someone who never compromises. \u201d But the Freedom Caucus has never been about compromise. In 2011, it picked a huge, costly fight over Planned Parenthood. In 2013, it orchestrated a government shutdown over funding for the health care law. Then, in its most striking move, it deposed Mr. Boehner in 2015. The common thread: It has continuously been an adversary of legislation itself. But after years of opposing power  \u2014   both in the White House, which was occupied by a Democrat, and in the leadership of their own party  \u2014   the conservatives were offered a chance to negotiate directly with the president and his budget director, a former Freedom Caucus member, over the bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The members pushed and pushed Mr. Trump to the far right edges of policy, just as they have done for years on other bills. But they still could not get to \u201cyes,\u201d and therefore became part owners of the expansive health law they were trying to undo. \u201cThey made the perfect the enemy of the good,\u201d said Representative Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they can go back home and tell people they voted to keep Obamacare, voted to keep funding Planned Parenthood. \u201d Indeed, members of the Freedom Caucus  \u2014   which is supported by outside conservative groups  \u2014   have often claimed the mantle of pure conservatism, but their tactics have been seen by many in their party as uniformly counterproductive. Time after time, they undermined Republican leaders\u2019 efforts to secure wins for the conservative cause by overreaching and demanding the impossible. They have anointed Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina as their leader and principal spokesman. But they occasionally get help from three senators sympathetic to their cause: Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah. At critical times, House conservatives have forced their party to make deals with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader  \u2014   an idea anathema to most Republicans, who would seethe. This time, by negotiating with Mr. Trump on the complex issue of health care, a measure whose complexity he did not seem to fully grasp, they moved an already contentious bill further and further to the right, eliminating too many benefits to keep moderate and other conservative members on board. Even Mr. Trump was said to be taken aback by their attempts to remove things Republicans have long promised to keep, like health insurance benefits for children up to 26 years old. Given that the House and Senate majorities were built on a promise to repeal and replace Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law, many lawmakers fear electoral repercussions. \u201cIt is painfully ironic that members from safe, conservative congressional districts who can\u2019t ever quite seem to get to \u2018yes\u2019 make it harder to enact good, conservative public policy like repealing Obamacare,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former aide to Mr. Boehner. This seemed lost on many Freedom Caucus members on Friday. \u201cPart of the legislative process is working with people who have different ideas,\u201d said Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan. \u201cThis process from the beginning wasn\u2019t designed to do that. \u201d Now, health care has become such a partisan issue that voters seem to have little expectation that their elected officials will do much to solve the problem. \u201cI believe we should have more attention paid to the centrists in both parties,\u201d said Representative Ileana   Republican of Florida, one of the early moderate defectors of the bill. \u201cInstead of showing all this attention to three or four people who never vote for anything, let\u2019s do an American health plan, not a Republican or Democrat one. \u201d Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump offered up a cheerful patina on what many in Washington viewed as an unmitigated failure, one brought on by a group that had brought down the speaker, shuttered the government and needlessly delayed previous legislation with no significant accomplishments to call its own. And a new test will come soon as Republicans contemplate an overhaul of the tax code, as the fate of the health care bill throws into doubt whether any major legislation can pass in this climate. To mitigate this issue, Mr. Ryan will be charged with building the sort of outside coalitions that did not exist for the failed health care bill, which was opposed by doctors, nurses, hospitals, disease groups and conservative political action committees. \u201cThere are lessons from this debate that will be applied to upcoming issues like tax reform, infrastructure and financial reform,\u201d said Ken Spain, who served as the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s spokesman in 2010. \u201cDebates are won and lost in the districts and states, not in the cloakrooms of Congress. \u201d \u201cWinning legislative battles today,\u201d he said, \u201crequires more of an   approach. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561834.111672}
