You know, like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game. \\nIf there\u2019s anything the 2016 election showed us, it\u2019s that the American people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media. They\u2019re increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of \u201cdiversity\u201d and other nebulous ideals. They\u2019re desperate not only to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining USA. \\nIn response, the controllers of the presstitutes (the people who really run the world) are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about \u201cfake news\u201d sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control. The Internet has all but destroyed the corporate-government narrative, and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry (i.e. CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, et. al.) because they have learned the American people know how full of shit they really are. \\nSites like Return Of Kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last 50 years. Hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative \\nMake no mistake, one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and re-gaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to. Having Julian Assange and Edward Snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes . \\nFake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the Internet. We can be thankful Trump won the election rather than The Bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship, but the aggressiveness of the \u201cfake news\u201d narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down. \\nThe New York Times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the Internet. Only days after The Bitch lost the election, publisher Arthur Sulzberger published a Mea Culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to \u201chonest\u201d reporting. \\nWe cannot deliver the independent, original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers\u2026 [The New York Times promises to] give the news impartially, without fear or favor\u2026 We also approach the incoming Trump administration without bias. \\nDon\u2019t buy into it. This is what\u2019s known in Public Relations as a diversion tactic. While we focus on our seeming victory, they\u2019re already moving on to their next false narrative \u2013 so-called fake news. No sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give Trump a chance, The New York Times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power \u2013 the alt-right and alternative news web sites. \\nWhile some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the Balkans or entrepreneurs in the United States seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. \\nThey did a spurious case study on how a \u201crumor\u201d got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at Trump rallies. Never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock, stock and barrel on fake news. Almost every narrative they create is a false one. One need do no more than a Google search to discredit many, if not most of the mainstream media\u2019s stories. The hypocrisy is astounding. Pulling The Plug Facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elite\u2019s agenda of eliminating free speech online \\nWhether or not the \u201cfake news\u201d narrative gains traction, the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online, then follow through with the Hegelian Dialectic with a pre-ordained \u201csolution\u201d to \u201cmake everyone safer online\u201d and to \u201cstop the spread of false information\u201d while \u201cprotecting free speech\u201d online by destroying it. \\nLook for no less than a figurative \u201cInternet 9/11\u201d if the elite become desperate enough. \\nThey\u2019ll pull the plug on the backbone of the Internet, shutting down e-commerce and communication online for a few days, blame it on a \u201cfake news\u201d story (just like Benghazi was blamed on a YouTube video) then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporate-government narrative and gutting yet another of our Bill of Rights protections. \\nMake no mistake, Freedom of Speech is the most important of Amendments to the Constitution. Once that is taken away, it\u2019s Game Over. Obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who \u201ccling to our guns and religion\u201d and continues this narrative even after the election of Trump \\nObama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites. This is nothing more than proposing the creation of the American equivalent of Pravda in the Soviet Union, in which only the state-approved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies. Obviously, the New World Order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this, and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced \\nCheck out what The Messiah said in Berlin recently. \\nIn an age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation, and it\u2019s packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television, where some overzealousness on the part of a US official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect. If we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. \\nThe fact he is saying these things should frighten you. It should also make you angry. This statement is a PC way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up. They want us to listen to clueless \u201cjournalists\u201d who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later, yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government. \\nWe must fight back by discrediting the \u201cfake news\u201d narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake \u201cInternet 9/11\u201d designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very Libertarian Internet of today.'"}, "time": 1742563252.6024256}
