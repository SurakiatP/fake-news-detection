She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades. \\nHillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election, I am fully convinced that World War III will begin before her time in the White House is over. \\nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters, Trump recently stated that we are \u201cgoing to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton\u201d:'"}, "time": 1742564098.828833}
