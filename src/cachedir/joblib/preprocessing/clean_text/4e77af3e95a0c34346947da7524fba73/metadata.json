On the soft, wide sands of Copacabana Beach, looking out at the Atlantic. In one hand, a newspaper declaring Brazil the Olympic champion in men\u2019s soccer and volleyball, a perfect ending. In the other, a pen. It\u2019s to write     letters to naysayers who said these Games would be a disaster. The concerns about these Games were myriad, and many of them stemmed from the water. One fear was that the polluted water in the ocean, the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon and Guanabara Bay would sicken the athletes competing in it and on it. A bigger fear was that standing water would allow mosquitoes to multiply, increasing the chances that visitors would get the Zika virus and causing a global health crisis. But look how everything turned out: Mosquitoes were few because it\u2019s winter. And as far as we know, at least so far, zero athletes were affected by dirty water. Still, the water here played a leading role in how these Games will be remembered  \u2014   for reasons good and bad. At the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, Michael Phelps blessed the pool water with his greatness. Competing in his fifth Summer Games, he won his 23rd gold medal and, with his 13th gold from an individual event, passed a guy named Leonidas of Rhodes in the record books. How momentous was that? Leonides won his 12th event in 152 B. C. At 31, Phelps said he finally  \u2014   no, really this time  \u2014   had swum his last Olympic race. Now he\u2019s a dad to a baby boy, Boomer. He\u2019s got another life to live, and this one\u2019s on land. When \u201cThe   Banner\u201d played as he stood atop the medals stand for the final time, he wept. \u201cI feel fulfilled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was what I wanted. \u201d Katie Ledecky, on her way to her freshman year at Stanford, poured some of her own magic into the pool water. She set world records in the   and   freestyles, finishing so far ahead in the 800 that she was practically showered, dressed and ready to cheer for her competitors when they finally touched the wall. Fine, she wasn\u2019t that fast. She did win by more than 11 seconds, though. The pool was also a place for firsts, and for inspiration. Simone Manuel, in the   freestyle, became the first   woman to win an individual swimming event at an Olympics. She said she had gone into the race with \u201cthe weight of the black community\u201d on her shoulders. \u201cI would like there to be a day when there are more of us, and it\u2019s not \u2018Simone, the black swimmer,\u2019\u201d Manuel said. Lilly King also used the pool as a lectern, as one of several swimmers who spoke out against doping. These Olympics, after all, began under a cloud of doping. The Russians were caught in a   doping scheme, and about a third of their 400 or so athletes were eventually barred from Rio. The International Olympic Committee\u2019s president, Thomas Bach, in all of his spineless glory, could have and should have barred the whole Russian delegation but punted to the sports federations to decide. That\u2019s how Yulia Efimova, a Russian who served a drug suspension in 2013, managed to get a pass for the Games. When she finished a swim in the   breaststroke semifinals, she waved her index finger in a No. 1 sign. That didn\u2019t sit well with King, who responded by wagging her finger at Efimova. King told NBC: \u201cYou know, you\u2019re shaking your finger No. 1, and you\u2019ve been caught for cheating. I\u2019m not a fan. \u201d Later, King said she wanted to bar any athlete who had been caught doping. She was accused of being a poor sport. But you know what\u2019s really being a poor sport? Taking drugs to win. King said what so many clean athletes, for years, had wanted to. Good for her. Rio\u2019s water hosted some imperfect moments, too, and also the Games\u2019 most embarrassing ones. Two pools used for diving, water polo and synchronized swimming mysteriously turned   green. Games organizers had several different explanations, including too many people in the water, before saying it was  hydrogen peroxide mistakenly added to the water. Neither was a good excuse. Nearby, in the Olympic Park, the swimming pool  \u2014   the gleaming blue water in which the Americans had dominated during the Games\u2019 first week  \u2014   had also gone bad. Albeit metaphorically. Ryan Lochte, an American gold medalist now reviled by Brazilians and Americans alike, lied about being robbed at gunpoint when he and three teammates were out partying in Rio. He said the robber had impersonated a police officer, held a cocked gun to his forehead and demanded money. Turns out that was not exactly true. \u201cNot exactly\u201d meaning not at all. After causing an international incident, Lochte on Saturday apologized for his \u201cimmature behavior\u201d and said he \u201coverexaggerated the story,\u201d without seeming to realize that his knuckleheaded tall tale was the seed that grew into these Olympics\u2019 biggest scandal. Not easy to do, considering that the Games began with potential scandals ready to sprout from every corner. Back at the swimming pool on Friday, though, it was time for a cleansing. Give thanks to the United States women\u2019s water polo team for accomplishing that. The American players started their Games in the   pool before moving to the swimming venue for the final week. They dived into the Olympic Aquatics Stadium\u2019s   pool for the gold medal match against Italy. On the deck was their coach, Adam Krikorian, whose Olympics hadn\u2019t gone as planned. Two days before the opening ceremony, Krikorian received a text from his father. Call me now, it said. Krikorian\u2019s brother Blake had died of a heart attack while surfing. The next day, at 7 a. m. Krikorian gathered his team to break the news. He said they shouldn\u2019t worry about him or act differently around him. He said it would be unfair for his grief to distract them. \u201cHe was telling us to enjoy the moment, enjoy opening ceremonies, don\u2019t worry about me, you be you,\u201d the team captain, Maggie Steffens, said. \u201c\u2018This is your dream live it. \u2019\u201d She added, \u201cWe wanted to be strong for him, but he was strong for us. \u201d Krikorian went home and returned three days later, struggling to focus. He and his brother, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, were close. All three Krikorian brothers  \u2014   Blake, Jason and Adam  \u2014   had grown up in the pool and played water polo. Little things would make Adam crack: a song that reminded him of Blake, a memory of a moment they had spent together. In the mornings, he would stand at a pond in the athletes\u2019 village and try to empty his emotions. But so much remained: Thursday would have been Blake\u2019s 49th birthday. \u201cI just keep coming back to how my brother, who was the coolest dude in the world, would want me to be,\u201d Adam Krikorian said. \u201cAnytime I was losing focus or getting too emotional, I would think about him and what he would tell me: \u2018Man, you are wasting this moment. Go have a blast. Kick some butt. Go compete. Never give up.\u2019 When I started thinking about that, that\u2019s what gave me peace. \u201d In the final minutes of Friday\u2019s final, though, Krikorian couldn\u2019t hold back. His team was about to win, and he cried. These Olympics were hard, so hard, and so very long. Somehow, he had made it to the end to see the United States win,   and celebrate. Steffens and another player, Rachel Fattal, ran at him and tackled him into the pool. The rest of the players and coaches followed. There they were, in a giant wet huddle, letting the water wash over their teary faces as they bobbed up and down, cheering and hugging. For them, the end of these Summer Games came as such a joy. And in so many ways  \u2014   actually, for so many people  \u2014   the end was also a relief.'"}, "time": 1742563613.5536764}
