[Kelly shared a preview clip of the interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday.  In the clip, Jones defends against being called \u201cthe most paranoid man in the world,\u201d calls the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U. S. an \u201cinside job,\u201d and attempts to deflect criticism for his assertion that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic. twitter.   \u2014   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017,  In response to the preview, several Twitter users identifying themselves as family members of the 27 victims of the horrific attack tweeted directly to the Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly host to express their outrage that the anchor and NBC would give Jones a platform to discuss his views. Cristina Hassinger  \u2014   daughter of Sandy Hook Elementary principal Dawn Hoschsprung, who was killed in the attack  \u2014   and Nelba Marquez Greene, who reportedly lost a daughter in the attack, both sent messages to Kelly denouncing the interview. \u201cShame on you,\u201d Hassinger wrote. This piece of actual garbage encourages people to call my mom\u2019s death a hoax and harass other Sandy Hook families. Shame on you @megynkelly. https:  .   \u2014   cristina hassinger (@chass63) June 12, 2017,  Here you go @megynkelly  \u2014   her name is Ana Grace  . Say her   stare at this  tell me it\u2019s worth it. @nbc #SandyHook pic. twitter.   \u2014   Nelba   (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017,  Hey @megynkelly  \u2014   this is what I\u2019m talking about. Is this what you\u2019re shining a light on? #ShameOnMegynKelly https:  .   \u2014   Nelba   (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017,  As the backlash grew on social media Sunday, Kelly responded to a user who said that Jones\u2019 appearance on her show would help \u201clegitimize\u201d the radio host and commentator. Kelly replied that Jones\u2019 previous interactions with President Donald Trump were newsworthy and that her job was to \u201cshine a light\u201d on the media figure. But that explanation was not satisfactory to a number of other social media users, who called for a boycott campaign against NBC and Kelly\u2019s new show. #GrabYourWallet Take down Alex Jones and anyone who supports him.  @nbc https:  .   \u2014   Anita was here (@VennMultiverse) June 12, 2017,  When I was growing up, NBC News was my favorite TV news show. If this vile interview airs, I\u2019ll NEVER watch it again. https:  .   \u2014   Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) June 12, 2017,  This is the mother of a child murdered at Sandy Hook  \u2014   a tragedy Alex Jones says never happened. How could you @megynkelly? #shameonNBC https:  .   \u2014   Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 12, 2017,  Boycott @NBC  @megynkelly for the @RealAlexJones interview. Jones is an incendiary conspiracy theorist who makes up news to fit his agenda,  \u2014   D. Fitz Allgood \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udeb4 (@FitzAllgoodlife) June 12, 2017,  Very disappointed in @nbc giving airtime to hideous Alex Jones. Won\u2019t watch, and won\u2019t watch @megynkelly ever for providing him a platform. https:  .   \u2014   Heather Whaley (@HeatherWhaley) June 12, 2017,  @NBCNews Please, for the love of goodness  decency, do not give Alex Jones a platform on Sun. It\u2019s disrespectful to    Newtown victims.  \u2014   Nathaniel (@Hoosier2012) June 12, 2017,  A representative for NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly premiered earlier this month with a   interview with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Putin told Kelly that American media had created a \u201csensation out of nothing\u201d with allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U. S. presidential race.
