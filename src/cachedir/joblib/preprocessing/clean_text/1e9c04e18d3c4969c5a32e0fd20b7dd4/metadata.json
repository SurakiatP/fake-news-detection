Bush administration. R. Alexander Acosta, the nominee for labor secretary, also defended his decision as the United States attorney in Southern Florida to offer a lenient plea deal to a wealthy New Yorker accused of paying underage girls for sexual acts. For nearly three hours in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Acosta, 48, defended his record, explained how he might deal with budget cuts to the department and dismissed the concerns of several senators who asked how he would avoid any pressure from the president to pass policies based on politics and not on the best interest of workers. Mr. Acosta, who would be the only Hispanic in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, promised not to evaluate workers based on their political leanings. \u201cIf confirmed, I will work to enforce the laws under the department\u2019s jurisdiction fully and fairly,\u201d Mr. Acosta said in his opening pitch to senators. \u201cAs a former prosecutor, I will always be on the side of the law and not any particular constituency. \u201d Mr. Acosta, the dean of Florida International University\u2019s law school, was nominated after the president\u2019s first choice for labor secretary, the   executive Andrew F. Puzder, withdrew from consideration after coming under fire for past labor practices and domestic abuse allegations. Mr. Acosta, a former prosecutor from Miami who headed the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, appeared to be a far less contentious choice. But Democratic senators did not go easy on him. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, wanted more details on his promise not to politicize the department. \u201cI expect our next secretary of labor to be someone who can withstand inappropriate political pressure, and prioritize workers and the mission of the Labor Department over, hypothetically speaking, President Trump\u2019s business associates or Steve Bannon\u2019s frightening ideology,\u201d she said, referring to the senior White House adviser. She and other Democrats pointed to a 2008 report by the Justice Department\u2019s   investigator, which found that under Mr. Acosta his office had violated federal law and department policies by weighing political affiliations in hiring and assessing employees. Mr. Acosta acknowledged that the violations had happened on his watch but said that the report laid most of the blame on a subordinate, Bradley Schlozman. \u201cPolitical views in the hiring of career attorneys and staff should not be used,\u201d Mr. Acosta said. \u201cIf I am asked to do that, I will not allow it. \u201d Mr. Acosta had a lengthy discussion with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, on what critics said was the lenient plea deal given to Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy financier accused of paying underage girls for sexual massages. Mr. Acosta defended the deal and said it was offered based on the evidence. Mr. Epstein, he noted, was required to register as a sex offender. Mr. Acosta also seemed to question Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut the Labor Department\u2019s budget by 21 percent, saying he opposed    cuts as well as targeting specific programs. \u201cThe principle that needs to be used to guide the spending is, \u2018How successful is the program? \u2019\u201d Mr. Acosta said. He pledged to consult with local officials before making cuts to the department. He added that he hoped to help Americans \u201cfind good jobs, safe jobs. \u201d Most of the confirmation hearing was given to senators\u2019 interrogating Mr. Acosta about how much of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda he would back and how he would help fulfill the president\u2019s promises to create jobs and stop companies from moving jobs overseas. Mr. Trump \u201cran for president saying he was going to make that huge difference  \u2014   he was going to bring jobs back,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Mr. Acosta answered that he would work with other agencies, like the Department of Education, in carrying out the president\u2019s executive order directing department heads to review regulations. Two Republican senators, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, both   like Mr. Acosta, introduced and praised him as an example of the American dream. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the committee, said Mr. Acosta would be a labor secretary who \u201cunderstands how a   job is critical to helping workers realize the American dream for themselves and for their families. \u201d The Senate labor committee is expected to vote next week on whether to advance Mr. Acosta\u2019s nomination to the full Senate. The Senate Agriculture Committee is scheduled to begin a confirmation hearing on Thursday for Sonny Perdue, the former governor of Georgia, to be Mr. Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary.'"}, "time": 1742564162.395507}
