[\u201cCertainly there will be taxes that relate to automation. Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50, 000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things,\u201d declared Gates. \u201cIf a robot comes in to do the same thing, you\u2019d think that we\u2019d tax the robot at a similar level. \u201d  \u201cThere are many ways to take that extra productivity and generate more taxes. Exactly how you\u2019d do it, measure it, you know, it\u2019s interesting for people to start talking about now,\u201d he continued. \u201cSome of it can come on the profits that are generated by the   efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don\u2019t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It\u2019s OK. \u201d Gates added that \u201cyou ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed of that adoption somewhat to figure out, \u2018OK, what about the communities where this has a particularly big impact? Which transition programs have worked and what type of funding do those require? \u2019\u201d \u201cYou cross the threshold of   of certain activities all sort of at once,\u201d Gates concluded. \u201cSo, you know, warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there\u2019s quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that, certainly in the next 20 years, being thoughtful about that extra supply is a net benefit. It\u2019s important to have the policies to go with that. \u201d Billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban also claimed robots are going to \u201ccause unemployment,\u201d posting, \u201cAutomation is going to cause unemployment and we need to prepare for it,\u201d to Twitter on Sunday. Last week, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk warned that deep A. I. could potentially be dangerous to the human race, who he described as already  . \u201cOne of the most troubling questions is artificial intelligence. I don\u2019t mean narrow A. I   \u2014   deep artificial intelligence, where you can have AI which is much smarter than the smartest human on earth,\u201d proclaimed Musk during the World Government Summit in Dubai. \u201cThis is a dangerous situation. \u201d \u201cPay close attention to the development of artificial intelligence,\u201d he continued. \u201cMake sure researchers don\u2019t get carried away. Scientists get so engrossed in their work they don\u2019t realize what they are doing. \u201d In November, Musk also predicted that automated robots would lead to mass unemployment, which he claimed could eventually create a universal wage from the government.
