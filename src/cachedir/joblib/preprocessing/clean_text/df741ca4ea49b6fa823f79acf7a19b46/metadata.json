If you listened to him over these last furious hours, you heard him mention the \u201cyawning cavern of insecurity\u201d that motivates Donald Trump and other bullies. Cruz should take up spelunking. He\u2019s obviously fascinated by unfathomable depths, and with his loss in Indiana on Tuesday, his candidacy for the presidency is finished, giving him a whole lot of extra time. A new hobby is definitely in order. As we bid Cruz adieu, we should give him his due: He took a mien and manner spectacularly ill suited to the art of seducing voters about as far as they could go. He outlasted the likes of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. He outperformed Rick Santorum in 2012 and Mike Huckabee in 2008. Like him, Santorum and Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses and built from there, courting the religious right with particular fervor. But they lacked the intensity of Cruz\u2019s professed disdain for Washington, which was his other big sales pitch, made at its moment of maximum potency. He peddled extravagant piety and extreme contempt in equal measure. If that sounds paradoxical, it is, and the tension between contradictory Cruzes is what ultimately did him in. He spoke out of both sides of his scowl, itching to be the voice of the common man but equally eager to demonstrate what a highfalutin,   intellect he possessed. He wed a populist message to a plummy vocabulary. And while the line separating smart and smart aleck isn\u2019t all that thin or blurry, he never could stay on the winning side of it. He wore cowboy boots, but his favorites are made of ostrich. Two peacocks in a pod, he and Trump, and what ghastly plumage they showed on Tuesday. Trump somehow saw fit to bring up a National Enquirer story linking Cruz\u2019s father to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Cruz exploded, branding Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and \u201cserial philanderer. \u201d He also brought up an interview from many years ago in which Trump told Howard Stern that his effort to steer clear of sexually transmitted diseases was his \u201cpersonal Vietnam. \u201d Where was this rant six months ago, when the Republican field was crowded and Cruz played footsie with Trump? Back then he was wagering that Trump would fade, and he wanted to be in a friendly position to inherit the billionaire\u2019s supporters. But by Tuesday, Trump was the main obstacle between Cruz and the Republican presidential nomination, and Cruz has just one true compass: his own advancement. The nakedness of his vanity and transparency of his ambition were always his biggest problem. He routinely excoriated other politicians for   while repeatedly hogging center stage, his remarks interminable  \u2014   after his Iowa victory, for example, or when he presumptuously introduced Carly Fiorina as his running mate  \u2014   and his pauses so theatrically drawn out that you could watch the entirety of \u201cThe Revenant\u201d during some of them. He trashed \u201cthe establishment\u201d and wore its rejection of him as a badge of honor only until it stopped rejecting him and its help was his best hope to wrest the nomination away from Trump. At that point he did dizzy cartwheels over every prominent endorsement that came his way. He took great pride in an adversarial relationship with the media, decreeing us irrelevant, until he went in hunt of a fresh excuse for losing to Trump and decided over the last few days that it was all our fault. We didn\u2019t matter and then we did, depending on which estimation flattered him. He purported to be more   than his peers but pettily mocked Michelle Obama for urging schoolchildren to eat leafy greens. When Heidi Cruz is first lady, he pledged, \u201cFrench fries are coming back to the cafeteria. \u201d Heidi Cruz is not going to be first lady, so she\u2019ll need some other platform for the promotion of calorie bombs and second chins. And where in her husband was the humility that a Christian faith as frequently proclaimed as his should encompass? It wasn\u2019t evident when he stormed into the Senate in early 2013, an upstart intent on upstaging the veterans. There were flickers of it on Tuesday night, as he conceded defeat not just in Indiana but in the presidential contest, announcing that he was suspending his campaign \u201cwith a heavy heart. \u201d He articulated gratitude to those Americans  \u2014   no small number of them  \u2014   who had buoyed him. He went overboard in his praise of Fiorina, merely reminding us all of what an odd and oddly timed alliance theirs was. \u201cAn incredible, phenomenal running mate,\u201d he called her, as if they\u2019d been on some epic journey. It was less than a week long. How many phenomena could she accomplish in that time? He left Trump out of his remarks. There were no congratulations. There was no indication of whether he\u2019d publicly back Trump in the months to come. There was nothing to purge the memory of what he\u2019d said earlier Tuesday, when he described Trump as \u201ca narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen. \u201d Yes, we have, and so has he, every day, in the mirror. That\u2019s why he\u2019ll undoubtedly be back to try for the presidency again. But this bid is moribund. It\u2019s time for Cruz to rest in peevishness.'"}, "time": 1742563694.9990501}
