Y. She was 91. Her death was confirmed on Wednesday by her daughter Heidi Schuler Bright. Ms. Munsel was 17 when, in March 1943, she won a Met contract and $1, 000 after tying for first place in the eighth annual Metropolitan Auditions of the Air, a precursor to the Met\u2019s National Council Auditions, a program to discover promising young opera singers and nurture their careers. (The other   winner was Christine Johnson, who originated the role of Nettie Fowler in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \u201cCarousel\u201d when it opened on Broadway in 1945.) By November Ms. Munsel had signed a   contract with the impresario Sol Hurok for a guaranteed $120, 000. On Dec. 4, at 18, she made her Met debut as the temptress Philine in Ambroise Thomas\u2019s \u201cMignon,\u201d wearing a   ring and a crown lent to her by the soprano Lily Pons. The audience gave Ms. Munsel a standing ovation of several minutes. The critics were generally less kind. \u201cFor this part her voice is neither sufficiently big, or developed, or brilliant enough,\u201d the critic Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times. \u201cIn plain words,\u201d he said, \u201cshe was cruelly miscast, in this, one of the most exacting roles in the coloratura soprano\u2019s repertory. \u201d More than 40 years later, in a Los Angeles Times interview, Ms. Munsel said simply, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue as to what the part was about. \u201d She performed a total of 225 times at the Met, excelling as the maid Adele in Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d and earning praise from Downes for her \u201cvirtuoso singing\u201d and \u201cvery amusing acting. \u201d He declared her born for the role \u201cby personality, wit, temperament. \u201d Rudolf Bing, the company\u2019s general manager during Ms. Munsel\u2019s tenure, is said to have called her \u201ca superb soubrette. \u201d But Ms. Munsel had given up touring the moment she became engaged to Robert C. Schuler, an adman turned television producer, whom she married in 1952. Not long after returning from their   European honeymoon, she did a star turn on movie screens as Dame Nellie Melba, the   Australian soprano, in the 1953 biopic \u201cMelba,\u201d produced by the Hollywood legend Sam Spiegel. From there, she strutted her way into the Las Vegas nightclub scene, peeling off a voluminous silk skirt   at the New Frontier in 1955 to reveal a halter and bejeweled pink capris. Two years later, Ms. Munsel embarked on a television career with \u201cThe Patrice Munsel Show,\u201d a variety series on ABC, joining guests like Eddie Albert, Andy Williams, Tony Bennett and John Raitt in a mix of light opera and pop, though she admitted to hating \u201c  lyrics. \u201d It was canceled after one season. Ms. Munsel last performed at the Met in 1958 as Mimi in \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d a role she had long coveted. She then focused on motherhood, traveling and musical comedies, performing splits in the 1965 Lincoln Center Theater presentation of \u201cThe Merry Widow\u201d and occasionally turning productions of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and \u201cThe King and I\u201d into family affairs with her four children. Besides her daughter Heidi, two other children survive: another daughter, Nicole Schuler, and a son, Scott Schuler, as well as two grandsons and two  . Her husband, who in 2005 chronicled his   marriage to Ms. Munsel in the book \u201cThe Diva  I: My Life with Metropolitan Opera Star Patrice Munsel,\u201d died in 2007. Their son Rhett Carroll Schuler died in 2005. Patrice Beverly Munsil was born on May 14, 1925, in Spokane, Wash. (She later changed the spelling of her surname to Munsel at the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s request.) Her father, Dr. Audley J. Munsil, was a dental surgeon her mother, Eunice Munsil, was a homemaker and an accomplished piano player. Ms. Munsel had a lifelong comedic streak. \u201cI\u2019m sure when I emerged from my mother\u2019s womb, the doctor slapped me, I hit a high C and slapped him back,\u201d she wrote in a biographical sketch on her website. She began studying ballet and tap at 6 and soon, inspired by Walt Disney, decided that she wanted to be a professional whistler. \u201cThere were always birds whistling in the background\u201d of films like \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cSnow White,\u201d she explained, \u201cso I decided to whistle my way to Hollywood. \u201d Her parents, eager to encourage any and all of her artistic aspirations, managed to find her a whistling teacher. But it wasn\u2019t long before listening to Met radio broadcasts convinced her that her true destiny was to become an opera star. By 15 she had moved with her mother to New York, where   voice lessons were supplemented with piano, harmony, theory, French and Italian classes, as well as fencing lessons and gym workouts three times a week. Within two years Ms. Munsel\u2019s vocal coach, Giacomo Spadoni, urged her to audition at the Met, where he was chorus master, and she agreed. \u201cAfter all, at the age of 17, how long can one wait?\u201d Ms. Munsel wrote. \u201cI stepped on the stage and sang my first aria on the Metropolitan Auditions of the Air without a nerve in my body. I won, and I was on my way to fame and stardom. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564402.3149173}
