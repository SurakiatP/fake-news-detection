[\u201cNo matter who you are, where you\u2019re from, who you love, or who you worship, you deserve to belong,\u201d Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky wrote on Sunday with a link to the #WeAccept campaign, which shows the faces of people of various ages, races, and religions along with the inspiring message.  Former U. S. attorney general Eric Holder  \u2014   who was hired by Airbnb last July \u201cto help craft a     policy\u201d  \u2014   also tweeted about the #WeAccept campaign. \u201cThis is who we truly are  \u2014   We work together. We stand together. We are one nation. We are one people. @Airbnb @bchesky #weaccept together,\u201d Holder wrote to his Twitter followers. This is who we truly are  \u2014   We work together. We stand together. We are one nation. We are one people. @Airbnb @bchesky #weaccept together,  \u2014   Eric Holder (@EricHolder) February 6, 2017,  Hollywood and Silicon Valley have heavily opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program. Super Bowl Sunday saw a series of politicized commercials meant to shine a spotlight on the administration\u2019s immigration policies. But AirBnB\u2019s #WeAccept effort is a longterm campaign, and it\u2019s being spearheaded by Holder, who has already been hired by the California legislature to help lead the legal fight against Trump. In his role at the $30 billion   company, Holder is crafting the company\u2019s   and housing policy, according to Chesky. Airbnb users received an email on Monday morning detailing the company\u2019s intentions to provide housing for 100, 000 people over the next five years, including refugees. \u201cToday we\u2019re setting a goal to provide   housing over the next five years for 100, 000 people in need. We\u2019ll start with refugees, disaster survivors, and relief workers, though we want to accommodate many more types of displaced people over time,\u201d the company\u2019s founders announced. \u201cTo help people around the world facing displacement, we\u2019ll work with our community of hosts to find not just a place to stay, but also a place to feel connected, respected, and a part of a community again,\u201d Airbnb says. \u201cIn addition, Airbnb will contribute $4 million over the course of four years to the International Rescue Committee to support the most critical needs of displaced populations globally. \u201d Last year, Airbnb launched a   investigation following charges of racism from black renters who took to social media and shared stories of being turned away by hosts once their race was disclosed. The hashtag \u201c#AirbnbWhileBlack\u201d trended online. Airbnb apologized for the   discrimination complaints and began to enact a series of   policies.
