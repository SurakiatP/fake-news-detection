Nvidia has chosen to remove functionality from a Linux driver to ensure that it isn\\'t more capable than the Windows version. This really doesn\\'t sound like the action of a company that wants to get along well with Linux developers and users. So far, Nvidia hasn\\'t indicated whether this is a temporary situation, or more likely a permanent arrangement.There can be one of two obvious motives for this, which amount to two sides of the same coin. Either Nvidia doesn\\'t want to be seen to show up an embarrassing limitation in Windows or the Windows driver, or the continuing acrimony between the graphics firm and Linux is not over yet.While for most users three monitors are ample, making this a fairly niche problem, it\\'s an example of a company manipulating the marketplace. Of course controlling the flow of progress in order to sell another product is nothing new - video games makers have been doing that since the 1980s.But to control the flow of progress to favour one platform over another is playing \"technology god\" and sets a disturbing precedent.
