When it\u2019s time to sell, these can be major turnoffs for potential buyers. But, with a little creativity, many of these issues can be minimized, and you don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money to do it. THE PROBLEM Low ceilings THE SOLUTION White paint, tall window dressings and   furniture Using a lighter shade of paint on the ceilings than the walls tends to draw the eye upward and make the ceiling look higher. \u201cUse flat, not semigloss, on the crown molding, in the same shade as the ceiling,\u201d recommends Pat Christodoulou, who stages   homes in Connecticut and New York. \u201cThis gives you an uninterrupted perspective, which results in visually raising the ceiling. \u201d If you don\u2019t have moldings, she said, adding a cove molding, which begins on the wall and extends to the ceiling, will create an elongating effect. Minimalist furnishings that sit low to the floor will help increase the impression of height.    sheers will also \u201cgive the illusion of larger windows and higher ceilings,\u201d said Elizabeth Kee, a broker at CORE in Manhattan, who recently hung   curtains in a $   rental in Chelsea to \u201ccreate an optical illusion that the ceilings are soaring. \u201d THE PROBLEM Windows that face a brick wall or let in scant light THE SOLUTION Pops of bright color, strategically placed   bulbs or decorative window film \u201cAt a window that faced an alleyway or brick wall, we\u2019ve had success with placing a fixture with a daylight florescent bulb behind the curtain,\u201d said Jeff Schleider, the senior vice president of Business Development for Citi Habitats. \u201cIt gives the illusion of natural sunlight. \u201d In a small   on the Upper West Side, where all the windows faced out on an air shaft, Joseph G. Sheehan, a salesman with Bond New York, used \u201ccheery yellow drapes\u201d and sheer white curtains to dress up the windows, and bright throws, pillows and rugs to offer \u201ca nod to sunlight and brightness\u201d in the dark space. The apartment, which had originally been listed by another broker for $399, 000, went into contract for $435, 000 just two weeks after Mr. Sheehan brightened it up. Deanna Kory, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, recommends white shutters or white wooden Venetian blinds with   to   slats. \u201cAny light that hits the windows will be reflected favorably and create a lighter feeling within the apartment,\u201d she said. Another option: decorative window film, which lets in light while obscuring an unattractive view it can be found at Home Depot from about $25 for elderberry or etched lace designs. Hanging a framed   panel in front of the window offers a similar effect. If you\u2019re willing to splurge, a custom   window may be the solution. That\u2019s what a client of Madeline A. McKenna, a broker at Stribling  Associates, did more than a decade ago in a Midtown apartment with \u201ca very depressing view\u201d from the living room. It wasn\u2019t a cheap fix, she said, noting that the multipane frosted window with    inlay cost about $10, 000. But the investment eventually paid off: In 2005, the client was able to sell the apartment quickly, for about $975, 000. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to apologize or make excuses for the ugly window view onto the ugly, dark, dank air shaft. It became a beautiful centerpiece for the living room instead,\u201d Ms. McKenna said, adding that the unit sold again, in 2012, for $1. 25 million and was   in 2014, at $1. 35 million, with the same frosted window. \u201cSeems everyone likes the aesthetic. \u201d THE PROBLEM An awkward layout THE SOLUTION Rework the floor plan The Yorkville, Manhattan, duplex apartment that Jai Lee, a saleswoman at Mdrn. Residential, listed for $599, 000 in July had plenty of assets: \u201cThe bathroom was amazing, with heated floor, enormous deep, deep tub and shower heads on both sides,\u201d she said. But to get to it, \u201cyou had to walk past the open kitchen into the barely   bedroom. \u201d Down a spiral staircase from the living room was a finished basement area with a   and small adjoining den. \u201cIt certainly was not ideal,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who came up with the idea of recasting the downstairs space as an unconventional master bedroom, with the master bathroom upstairs, along with a spacious closet (in what was the old master bedroom). \u201cI started selling the idea of using the \u2018master\u2019 as your own dream   closet, with spa bathroom,\u201d she said. To help potential buyers picture her vision, she drafted a new floor plan showing the lower level as a potential bedroom with a   and adjacent office or hobby room. \u201cI made sure to only show the listing by appointment,\u201d she added. \u201cThis way I could control the narrative and envisioning process. \u201d The unit sold within a month for the full asking price. THE PROBLEM A   unit with windows facing the street THE SOLUTION Curtains, decorative film or window boxes For   homes, especially those with bars on the windows, Anna Kahn, an associate broker at Halstead Property, recommends installing window boxes. \u201cLive flowers add color and take away from the starkness of the grates,\u201d she said. Another option: \u201c \u201d curtains, which are opaque near the floor and sheer at the top, to \u201callow sunlight to enter the apartment while still providing a sense of privacy,\u201d suggested Mr. Schleider of Citi Habitats. Or consider using opaque film: \u201cWe sold an apartment with razor wire outside the bedroom windows,\u201d said Vivian Ducat, a saleswoman at Halstead, who had covered part of the window, obscuring the wire. \u201cEven though everyone opened the windows to see what was out there, they seemed satisfied that the apartment had integrity and could look good, from the look we gave it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628366.6088605}
