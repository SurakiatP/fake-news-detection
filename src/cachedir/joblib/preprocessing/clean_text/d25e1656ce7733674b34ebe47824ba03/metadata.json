FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe @CNNPolitics https://t.co/WBltG2lAK6 \\n\u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 28, 2016 \\nThe problem with the idea that the emails will save Donald Trump and the Republican Party is that Clinton was beating Trump while the FBI did their first investigation into her emails. Clinton has led Trump all through the Congressional hearings into her emails. She led Trump throughout the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton won the Democratic nomination with her emails being a story. \\nThe point is that Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails aren\u2019t a big issue to the majority of voters. The people who aren\u2019t Republicans in this election don\u2019t care about her emails. \\nWhen compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. \\nThere has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. \\nRepublicans can\u2019t get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. \\nHillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day. \\nThe voters are speaking, and they don\u2019t care about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.'"}, "time": 1742628600.7912247}
