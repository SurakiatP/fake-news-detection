On Thursday night, Prince\u2019s band the Revolution arrived on that stage for the first time since 2012 to honor, and grieve for, one of their own. For three months after his death, the group had remained silent about details of a reunion, finally confirming a   stand (which grew to include a third) in early July. \u201cI need this as much as you,\u201d the bassist Mark Brown, a. k. a. Brownmark, wrote on Facebook at the time of the announcement. \u201cSharing the music with you is what will heal. \u201d Thursday night\u2019s show, the first of the brief run, offered the crowd of 1, 500 the chance to experience Prince\u2019s music as performed by the musicians who helped define it: Wendy Melvoin (guitar) Lisa Coleman and Matt Fink (who\u2019s called Dr. on keyboards) Mr. Brown (bass) and Bobby Rivkin, known as Bobby Z (drums) as well as the   Andr\u00e9 Cymone and the lead guitarist Dez Dickerson, who had played with Prince in the years before the Revolution. The group had previously reunited at First Avenue for a benefit for Mr. Rivkin after he had a heart attack in 2012, and according to Nathan Kranz, the club\u2019s general manager, Mr. Rivkin did most of the legwork in staging the current reunions. Mr. Dickerson said there was talk of getting back together at the Los Angeles memorial for Prince in May: \u201cThings were being sorted. \u201d The shows were finally booked in  . \u201cLook at those smiling faces! That\u2019s what we want to see,\u201d Ms. Melvoin said from the stage on Thursday night, perhaps trying to nudge the mood toward celebration from something more somber, before the band surged into its opening song, \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy. \u201d She added, \u201cI expect to hear everyone singing. \u201d She got her wish, on and off the stage. With no Prince anchoring the band, group vocals  \u2014   harmonies,      \u2014   were plentiful, and Ms. Melvoin stepped up front for rockers like \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d and \u201cRaspberry Beret. \u201d With Mr. Cymone and Mr. Dickerson joining the band, they recreated \u201c1999,\u201d alternating singers on each opening line. Mr. Cymone took lead on \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d and a quick survey of the club showed that most everyone in it was singing along ditto, later, for \u201cKiss,\u201d which the Revolution played in a way that was close to the original recording, unlike their boss, who had constantly changed the arrangement. A number of guests bolstered the show. The RB singer Bilal was a welcome surprise, having not only aced the BET Awards\u2019 Prince tribute but also one at Carnegie Hall in 2013. At First Avenue, he proved a mellifluous falsetto for hire, especially on \u201cThe Beautiful Ones,\u201d whose climax he lifted with his nimble squall. Fans spied other familiar faces onstage: Susannah Melvoin (Wendy\u2019s sister, Prince\u2019s former girlfriend and the lead singer in the Family, a band he masterminded) Omar Baker, Prince\u2019s brother (resplendent in a white fedora and   shoes) the \u201cPurple Rain\u201d   Apollonia (who introduced the encore by tossing gold hoop earrings to the crowd, a motif in the movie) and Prince\u2019s   Mayte Garcia. The crowd members were largely in their 40s and 50s, many from out of town. One of the first in was Scott Bogen, a Twin Cities native who once won $1, 000 impersonating Prince for First Avenue\u2019s     contest. He has lived for the last two decades in Big Sur, where he is a volunteer firefighter, and came back here for the reunion. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting the fire for five weeks straight,\u201d he said, referring to the West Coast wildfires. \u201cMy property burned, but my house survived. \u201d Mr. Bogen said it was fortunate that the fire didn\u2019t claim the tambourine Prince signed for him in 1981. There were mementos available at the Revolution\u2019s merchandise table  \u2014   four   two hoodies  \u2014   where a line of a dozen that had assembled by 7:13 p. m. had tripled by 7:20. (The club\u2019s doors had opened at 7.) But many in the audience were wearing two   that weren\u2019t for sale: designs featuring a list of the Revolution members\u2019 names or the contents of a lunchbox in \u201cStarfish  Coffee,\u201d a song on Prince\u2019s 1987 double album, \u201cSign o\u2019 the Times. \u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine the Revolution tribute\u2019s taking place anywhere other than First Avenue. Prince had used the club as a home performance base since 1981, and it was the spot where he debuted the song \u201cPurple Rain\u201d in 1983, before it made many memorable appearances in the film the following year. A replica of the motorcycle from the movie stood where pinball machines once did. A few fans wore   of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d trench    look. Much of Ms. Melvoin\u2019s stage patter revolved around the idea of the show\u2019s being not just in Prince\u2019s memory, but for his heavenly delectation. After a cheer following \u201cAmerica,\u201d she focused on the crowd. \u201cEverybody hear that?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s help him hear this. \u201d When Ms. Melvoin and Ms. Coleman played \u201cSometimes It Snows in April\u201d as a duo, quiet and acoustic, Ms. Melvoin struggled to keep her composure it was a clear highlight, particularly when she sang, \u201cAlways cry for love, never cry for pain,\u201d to some deeply felt shouts from the crowd. At the end of the night, one thing stood out  \u2014   that the band didn\u2019t even try to copy Prince\u2019s singular guitar solos, in particular for \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d the inevitable show closer. The lack of flash for \u201cPurple Rain\u201d wasn\u2019t total (there were actual lighters in the air) but it nevertheless gave the song a rawer charge than usual. It was stark, yet fitting. Who could ever replace their man?'"}, "time": 1742564159.1241317}
