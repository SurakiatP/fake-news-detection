But with Donald J. Trump, who has been critical of the d\u00e9tente, set to succeed Mr. Obama, the fate of the thaw between the United States and Cuba is far from clear. Mr. Trump\u2019s initial response on the matter Saturday morning was a   post on Twitter. \u201cFidel Castro is dead!\u201d he wrote. A few hours later, in a statement issued by his transition team, Mr. Trump called Mr. Castro a \u201cbrutal dictator\u201d who had oppressed his own people for decades and left a legacy of \u201cfiring squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. \u201d \u201cWhile Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThough the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. \u201d The statements from the president and the   were remarkable both for their differences and their similarities. While Mr. Obama steered clear of disparaging Mr. Castro, in keeping with his efforts to essentially defang a   mutual grudge, Mr. Trump condemned him. But both also described Mr. Castro\u2019s death as a potential turning point for Cuba, and both appeared to accept as fact that its prospects for freedom and prosperity are bound up with that of the United States. During the campaign, Mr. Trump sent mixed signals about how he intended to approach American policy toward Cuba, even as Mr. Obama was using the final months of his presidency to try to codify as much of the opening as possible. While Mr. Trump said during the Republican primary race that restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba  \u2014   a step the Obama administration took last summer  \u2014   was \u201cfine,\u201d he called Mr. Obama\u2019s December 2014 agreement with President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, Mr. Castro\u2019s younger brother, a \u201cvery weak agreement\u201d that provided too many \u201cconcessions\u201d to the Cubans. \u201cAll of the concessions Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign event in Miami in September. \u201cNot my demands. Our demands. \u201d Mr. Trump announced last week that he had named Mauricio   a fierce critic of Mr. Obama\u2019s opening with Cuba who leads a   political action committee, to his transition team for the Treasury Department. The move was seen as a signal that Mr. Trump is considering unraveling the web of regulations Mr. Obama has put in place to ease trade and commercial restrictions against Cuba. Last month, Mr. Obama issued a sweeping directive setting forth a new United States policy to lift the Cold War trade embargo entirely  \u2014   a move that would require congressional approval  \u2014   and end a   of clandestine plotting against Cuba\u2019s government. And he announced that his administration was lifting perhaps the most symbolically potent aspect of trade restrictions, the $100 limit on bringing Cuban rum and cigars into the United States. Earlier, Mr. Obama had also resumed direct flights between the two countries. \u201cDuring my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends  \u2014   bonds of family, culture, commerce and common humanity,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his statement. Advocates of the opening argued that Mr. Castro\u2019s death could be a pivot point, clearing away the last emotionally charged remnants of a policy that has outlived its usefulness. \u201cSymbolically, it makes a difference,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, the sponsor of bipartisan legislation to lift the embargo. \u201cA lot of this policy for decades has not been based on sound reason. It has been based on the ghosts of the past. This could mark a major change. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen immediately, but symbolism is important in this relationship. \u201d But among Republicans, such a shift was not immediately apparent. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said that if anything, Mr. Castro\u2019s death should stiffen the resolve of those determined to oppose the Cuban government. \u201cThe dictator has died, but dictatorship has not,\u201d said Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. \u201cThe future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights. \u201d Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said, \u201cSadly, Ra\u00fal Castro is no better for Cubans who yearn for freedom. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564160.1018257}
