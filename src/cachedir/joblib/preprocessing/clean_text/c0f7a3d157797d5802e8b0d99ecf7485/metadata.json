His office released a Mexican criminal alien convicted of sexual assault despite a hold from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. [Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese told Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson that Oregon law prohibits his providing assistance to enforcing federal law during an interview conducted by Lisa Fletcher that will air on Sunday morning. \u201cThe state law is a very clear guideline for local law enforcement and sheriff\u2019s statewide,\u201d Reese explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t expend county resources or personnel towards immigration enforcement. \u201d  Fletcher countered that one state legislator is \u201cfurious about this. \u201d \u201cHe says you\u2019re not abiding by the law by not detaining some of these illegal immigrants who are held on very, fairly serious charges or who have committed fairly serious crimes, are a risk to the community,\u201d she stated. \u201cHow do you respond to him?\u201d The sheriff danced around the question, stating they hold people in their jails who \u201care accused of crimes in our communities. \u201d He says he hold criminals until a judge says otherwise. Sheriff Reese said by not acting as immigration agents he believes the country is better off. \u201cIt simply worries me that we\u2019ve spent so much time and energy building community trust and something outside of our control may damage that. \u201d Crime victims might feel otherwise. A report issued on Thursday by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials revealed that Sheriff Reese\u2019s jail released a Mexican national on February 15. Immigration officials issued an immigration detainer on March 21, 2016. The report indicates the Mexican criminal alien has a prior conviction for sexual assault. The Declined Detainer Outcome Report for the week of January   3 revealed the release by the sheriff\u2019s office of another Mexican national convicted of assault and a Tongan national convicted of amphetamine possession. Full Measure also presented an interview with immigration fugitive Francisco Aguirre, calling him the \u201cposter child\u201d for the sanctuary city of Portland. Aguirre, a Salvadoran national who fled to the U. S. as a teen. Oregon convicted the Salvadoran in 2014 for driving under the influence. Fletcher said he managed to avoid spending any time in jail for the crime, but it put him on the radar of ICE Enforcement Removal Operations officers. \u201cA month later ICE knock on my door  \u2026     tried to take me in custody. I let them know clearly that they wasn\u2019t [sic] welcome there, and they must leave the property because it was private property,\u201d Aguirre said defiantly. After the ICE officers left, Aguirre fled to Augustana Lutheran Church where he held up in a sanctuary for 81 days. Aguirre believes that despite entering the country illegally and committing another crime, he has earned the right to remain in the U. S. \u201cYou\u2019re here illegally you committed a crime, a crime that very well could have killed somebody,\u201d Fletcher stated. \u201cWhy do you deserve to stay in this country?\u201d \u201cI understand that I commit a crime by getting a DUI.  But, we all, as a human being, make mistakes, and we always deserve a second chance,\u201d Aguirre said, rationalizing his prior actions. \u201cI been contribute [sic] to the economy of this country. I been paying my taxes, since I been living in this country. I\u2019m willing to help my community whenever they need. \u201d Aguirre remains safe under Sheriff Reese\u2019s and the other elected officials of Portland\u2019s sanctuary city protections. Or, maybe not. Late in March, ICE ERO officers carried out a targeted enforcement operation in three Pacific Northwest states, including Oregon. During that operation. Officers arrested more than 80 criminals aliens  \u2014   19 of those included aliens with DUI convictions.
