Attorneys appointed by Barack Obama to resign. [Fardon became Chicago\u2019s \u201ctop federal prosecutor on Oct. 23, 2013,\u201d and has been heavily criticized for his lack of prosecution of federal gun law violations.   Fardon played up \u201chis office\u2019s role in fighting gun violence on the streets of Chicago\u201d but a Chicago   report on \u201ccourt records in October 2016 showed federal weapons charges in Chicago had actually fallen slightly over the previous five years. \u201d The   report squares with the experience of the Chicago Police Board. During a January 7 interview with NPR, police board chairwoman Lori Lightfoot said Chicago needed more federal prosecutions if they were ever to turn the tide on the city\u2019s gun crime.  Lightfoot said: We need to have more federal gun prosecutions in Chicago. Our federal partners from the U. S. attorney\u2019s office, the ATF, the FBI need to be much more invested in this overall strategy. Chicago Police Department cannot tackle this issue by itself. Sessions shifted the posture of the Department of Justice as soon as he was confirmed. He used a February 27 memo to direct the DOJ to \u201cincrease prosecutions of   violations\u201d so criminals know they will be doing time if they use guns for crime. And on March 8 he followed up by asking prosecutors to pursue \u201charsh sentences\u201d for gun crimes and other violent offenses.
