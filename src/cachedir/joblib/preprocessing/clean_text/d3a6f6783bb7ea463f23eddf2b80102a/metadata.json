[\u201cMillions of Americans rely on protections and coverage from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare,\u201d the campaign website insists. \u201cThe Republicans [sic] new bill will gut these protections and many will die. \u201d  The site then urges supporters to gather the ashes of dead people and send them along to any Republican member of Congress. The effort is the vision of college junior Zoey Jordan Salsbury, an employee of a Democrat strategy company called New Blue Interactive: @nsilverberg I made a website for sick people to send their ashes to a GOP member of congress because of this tweet: https:  .   \u2014   Zoey Jordan Salsbury (@zoeyjsalsbury) May 4, 2017,  Despite the initial claim, however, Salsbury told the Washington Post that she does not really intend to send any ashes to D. C. \u201cI have the feeling the Capitol building would actually stop\u201d the packages, Salsbury told the paper. But she did say that instead of sending the ashes to Congress, supporters should send them to the district offices back home in any particular congressman\u2019s state. Salsbury is worried that the GOP\u2019s \u201crepeal\u201d of Obamacare will impact people with   conditions, but the GOP\u2019s AHCA does not roll back any of the protections for   conditions, nor does it \u201crepeal\u201d Obamacare in any meaningful way.
