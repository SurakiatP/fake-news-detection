Supreme Court on Monday supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary travel stay. Attorneys general from 14 other states and the governor of Mississippi joined to urge the nation\u2019s highest court to reinstate the executive order. [State officials urge that President Trump was acting within his lawful authority given to him by Congress when national security, foreign affairs, and immigration policy judgments require him to exercise it.  Last month the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a lower district court\u2019s order blocking the executive action, as reported by Breitbart News. The   opinion of the court was issued on May 25. The   decision upheld the halt of the executive order by the federal district court in the District of Maryland. The U. S. Department of Justice filed a petition for writ of certiorari on June 1 asking the court to decide whether the president acted within his authority in issuing the   temporary travel ban from six   countries. The Supreme Court took the rare step on June 3, as reported by Breitbart News, in expediting review of the case. \u201cThe executive order is a tailored response to a very real threat to our national security,\u201d Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cA temporary pause on entry from countries with heightened security concerns is necessary to shore up our nation\u2019s vetting procedures. The president is fulfilling his solemn duty to protect Texans and all Americans. \u201d The states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, have joined the state of Texas in filing the friend of the court brief (amicus curiae) in the U. S. Supreme Court. A summary of the arguments made in the brief are as follows: The district court\u2019s injunction of the President\u2019s temporary suspension of entry for specified classes of nonresident aliens is remarkable. The injunction was issued despite three longstanding doctrines limiting the availability of judicial remedies for disagreement with policy decisions like the Executive Order here. First, the Constitution does not apply extraterritorially to nonresident aliens abroad seeking entry. And this Court has specifically recognized that there is no \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d to override the Executive\u2019s use of its delegated 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182( f) power to deny classes of nonresident aliens entry into this country. Second, the Order must be accorded \u201cthe strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation,\u201d because it is in [the U. S. Supreme Court opinion of] Youngstown\u2019s first zone of executive action pursuant to congressionally delegated power. Third, the Court has long accorded facially neutral government actions a presumption of validity and good faith, so those actions can be invalidated under a   analysis only if there is the clearest proof of pretext. This longstanding, exacting standard for judicial scrutiny of government motives has been recognized by this Court in multiple types of constitutional challenges. This limit respects institutional roles by precluding courts from engaging in a tenuous \u201cjudicial psychoanalysis of a drafter\u2019s heart of hearts. \u201d Moreover, they urge: Plaintiffs cannot satisfy this Court\u2019s exacting standards for showing that the Executive Order is pretext masking a religious classification. The Order classifies aliens according to nationality based on concerns about the government\u2019s ability to adequately vet nationals of six covered countries who seek entry. Not only that, but these six countries covered by the Order were previously identified by Congress and the Obama Administration, under the   program, as national security \u201ccountries of concern. \u201d The Order is therefore valid, as it provides a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d for exercising 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182( f) national security and   powers to restrict entry. The states also argued that any \u201c  statements regarding a potential future policy\u201d are \u201cfar from the clearest proof\u201d required to overcome the strong legal presumption of validity, especially as to a different policy adopted by the president after he took office after conferring with other   government officials.
