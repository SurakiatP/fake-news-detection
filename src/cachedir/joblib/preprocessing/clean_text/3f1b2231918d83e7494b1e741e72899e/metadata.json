The police in Mount Pleasant, Mich. said they were investigating the October encounter involving youths who said they were members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity at Central Michigan University and the student, Andrew Seely, 19. Law enforcement authorities and university officials found out about the hazing this week, after Mr. Seely\u2019s mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about it and posted a photograph of her son\u2019s distorted face on Facebook. \u201cHe could have been killed,\u201d she wrote, adding that he carried medicine to counteract accidental exposure to peanuts. \u201cWe will be investigating,\u201d Capt. Andy Latham of the Mount Pleasant Police said by telephone. He added that the authorities had not yet spoken to Mr. Seely, who transferred to another school, but that they were contacted on Wednesday by the family\u2019s lawyer. Ms. Seely wrote in the post that her son had a \u201cdeadly\u201d peanut allergy and had passed out at the party. When he came to, she said, he discovered that his eyes, nose and lips had ballooned because peanut butter had been rubbed on his face. Ms. Seely said he was treated at a campus clinic. He told his family only this week about the hazing, she said, after which she called the campus police, the Mount Pleasant police and university officials. Ms. Seely could not be reached by telephone on Friday. Heather Smith, a spokeswoman for the university, said the fraternity had not been active on campus since 2011 because of previous hazing. She said campus officials heard about Mr. Seely\u2019s experience through his mother\u2019s social media post. University police do not have jurisdiction over the   party, according to Ms. Smith, but the university could investigate any violations of the student code of conduct if Mr. Seely reached out. \u201cIt is a potential criminal matter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is obviously a very concerning situation. \u201d The national headquarters of Alpha Chi Rho, which said in a statement on Friday that it had revoked the chapter\u2019s charter in 2011 because of hazing, added that the people involved in Mr. Seely\u2019s case \u201cwere not members\u201d of the fraternity and \u201cacted independently. \u201d \u201cAlpha Chi Rho does not condone this type of behavior, or any form of hazing, and it stands in conflict with our mission to cultivate men of character, honor and integrity,\u201d the statement added. The television station WDIV in Detroit quoted an unidentified fraternity member as saying: \u201cWe were just trying to be funny, just guys hanging out, and we used peanut butter and put some on his face. We didn\u2019t know he was allergic,\u201d the member said. \u201cWe were not trying to harm him in any sense. \u201d Officials have been trying to stamp out the kind of campus activities and rituals that lead to Mr. Seely\u2019s allergy attack, as university and high school students find disturbingly creative ways to haze others. Students trying to join fraternities, sororities, clubs or athletic teams have been tied up, blindfolded and sexually abused. Others have been forced to binge drink until death, and others have even been fatally beaten. While there are no official government databases on hazing cases and their outcomes, university professors keep their own statistics, and put in place policies to control the practice. According to a chronology of cases kept by Hank Nuwer, a journalism professor at Franklin College in Indiana, there has been at least one hazing death every year from 1969 to 2016 at United States colleges and high schools. \u201cI would say there are thousands of hazings every day, most of which are not reported,\u201d said Susan Lipkins, a psychologist and expert on the practice. \u201cAnd each year hazing gets worse. A rookie wants to enter the group, and you become a bystander and watch others, and eventually become a perpetrator. \u201d Dr. Lipkins said that in some cases, members of banned fraternities recolonize   and operate in unofficial,   groups. She said she had no direct knowledge of Mr. Seely\u2019s case, but believed it was most likely that the group had advance knowledge that he had an allergy. \u201cIt is not a typical hazing activity,\u201d she said. \u201cOf all the hazing activities, I have not heard of peanut butter on the face. \u201d In 2012, a    drum major died after a brutal hazing ritual at Florida AM University in which he was pummeled with hands, drumsticks, bass drum mallets, straps and even an orange cone by at least 15 band members on a bus. The cause of death was \u201chemorrhagic shock caused by   trauma,\u201d the medical examiner said.'"}, "time": 1742563192.5865486}
