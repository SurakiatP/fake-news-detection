{"duration": 1.2616188526153564, "input_args": {"text": "'I. Memorializing the Greatest Generation,  Memorial Day is the day in which we remember, with solemn gratitude, all those who gave their lives in military service to our country.  Elsewhere here at Breitbart News, others have recollected the fallen as Abraham Lincoln said in eulogizing those who died at Gettysburg in 1863, \u201cIt is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. \u201d Interestingly, Memorial Day was once known as Decoration Day.  After all, it was, and is, the virtuous custom to decorate the graves of the  .  And in the name \u201cDecoration Day,\u201d we see something important for the sake of our civic life: the ability of each patriot to offer appropriate honors in his or her own way.  That is, with flowers, cards, notes, or perhaps a bit of memorabilia. Today, such personalized displays of devotion are particularly common at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the Mall in Washington, DC.  Why?  Most likely, because that war is relatively recent plenty of people alive now still feel a close connection to   warriors. Yet the passing of the years has meant that other American wars are rapidly receding from our personal memory.  For instance, we might point to World War II.  During that conflict, from 1941 to 1945, the population of the US was about 133 million.  And yet in 2010, less than 5. 5 million Americans were over the age of 85 that is, born in 1925 or earlier.  Which is to say, the number of Americans today who could have had any adult participation in the war is small \u2014  and rapidly getting smaller, as old age takes its toll. Yes, it\u2019s painful to think that all the heroism of that era is no longer with us, at least not in a personal way.   To be sure, there are many museum displays, history books, movies, and TV shows about World War II.  And yet still, there\u2019s nothing like the power of a personal reminiscence, as anyone who has ever sat at the knee of a revered elder knows full well.  It will indeed, be a sad moment when the last voice from that era is stilled.  So the least that each of can do is help to make sure that every one of those vital voices is archived in some form. Moreover, perhaps on this Memorial Day we can recall more of the voices from World War II, reaching beyond the ranks of the heroes who died in uniform.  That is, for the sake of the enlarging the historical record, we can recollect some of the memories about those who served, too, on the homefront, namely, in war production.  If their personal risk and sacrifices were less than those who fought in battle, their contributions were nonetheless enormous: As Virgil has argued many times, America\u2019s greatest comparative edge in World War II was its industrial production. For instance, in a March 17 piece, \u201cDonald Trump, Rosie the Riveter, and the Revival of American Economic Nationalism,\u201d Virgil took note of President Trump\u2019s speech, two days earlier, recalling the   plant at Willow Run, Michigan.  That was the plant that built 9, 000 bombers that we used to flatten enemy targets. And that piece brought forth an outpouring of WW2 memories from Breitbart readers, many of them recording what they had heard, over the years, from fathers, mothers, and other loved ones who lived, worked, and fought in that era.  Virgil sifted through all the comments, more than 1800 of them these left him inspired, informed, amused, and, okay, sometimes bemused. For starters, Virgil enjoyed the comments specifically about a key theme of the article, which was war production in World War II these postings were often from descendants of workers and veterans.  Let\u2019s take a look: Reader \u201cMadMen\u201d said simply, \u201cIt makes me really miss my grandparents who both worked in those factories. \u201d  Meanwhile, reader \u201cNHnative\u201d reported that one family\u2019s inheritance from WW2 includes, to this day, a devotion to sewing: My grandmother was sewing parachutes . . . She moved on to sewing the uniforms.  She\u2019s still sewing daily at age 91 on her 1953 Singer. . . .  All the girls in my family are accomplished seamstresses and it all started with those parachutes. Reader \u201cLast Ride\u201d recalled a father who is, shall we say, particularly close to the   Liberators made at Willow Run, Michigan, and other parts of the country: My dad started his career in the USAF as a   pilot just as they were being retired from service, and ended his career as a   pilot.  He loves the   and moved to Ohio to be near the USAF   museum to be able to visit one of the last ones around. He told my mom she should feel lucky that the plane could not say \u201cI do\u201d or she would have been replaced, I believe him. Meanwhile, the legendary Rosie the Riveter received much attention.  Reader \u201cFeet2Fire\u201d reminded fellow commenters that there\u2019s plenty to learn about Rosie from the website Diaryofarosie. Yet reader \u201c53Skylark\u201d raised a point of personal privilege \u2014  or, more precisely, Pittsburgh privilege \u2014  when he asserted: The iconic Rosie the Riveter was based on a woman riveter employed by Westinghouse in Pittsburgh.  In the original iconic picture she is wearing a Westinghouse employee badge.  She did NOT originate at Willow Run.  And, all of the steel for the planes, ships, tanks, bullets, etc. was made in Pittsburgh. The former steel capital of the world. To which reader \u201cJonsen\u201d replied: Rosie became a symbol of more than one woman, though.  She was a symbol for all women working at home to help the cause. (As Virgil noted, while the actual Rosie the Riveter worked at Willow Run, the larger story of \u201cRosie\u201d is complicated: The immortal \u201cWe Can Do It!\u201d image does, indeed, come from Pittsburgh.  Yet the great artist Norman Rockwell, too, added his own image of Rosie \u2014  and his model was from Vermont.) Indeed, Rosie was more than just an individual she was, and is, an archetype.  Reader \u201cTexanForever\u201d recalled: My mom was a \u201cRosie the riveter\u201d at the North American plant in Grand Prairie, Texas.  While I was in grade school in Dallas she was riveting together  \u2019s.  Being by nature very modest, she hated wearing slacks, but she did it for the war effort. Or as reader \u201cSam Houston\u201d put it: This hits home to me as my Father and Uncle were WWII Vets. My Step Mom was a Rosie the Riveter on the   Liberator, tail section, at Consolidated Air Force Plant #4 at Carswell Army Airfield in Fort Worth, Texas.  She left the dairy farm in Yantis (East Texas) for the War Effort. . . .  I am so proud of her and our Greatest Generation! The actual Rosies, of course, are mostly departed by now, which makes commenters wish all the more to savor their memory.  As reader \u201cwilliam couch\u201d recalled, \u201cIn the early \u201970\u2019s, I worked with 2 Rosies.  It was @ the plant in Rosecrans, CA. \u201d  And reader \u201cGary Eaker\u201d offered a strong summary lesson: Great image.  Rosie the Riveter.  Americans joining together to do what needs to be done to PROTECT AMERICA. We must join together. Of course, Rosie will always live on in spirit.  Indeed, as reader \u201cVypurr\u201d explained, she holds up well: \u201cRosie had more Moxie and balls than any liberal crybaby Beta male today. \u201d Yes, the Rosies had spunk reader \u201cbackhome1999\u201d recalled this anecdote of female feistiness: My Mom was one of those women.  The story she tells, she was responsible for   of the airplane to connect everything to the pilot\u2019s area, and she would finish in a few days while her male counterpart doing the same job on the other   of the airplane took up to 2 weeks finishing his side.  She asked for a raise . . . she finally made as much as a man during that time, which was unheard of.  But she did her job in   the time (and they knew it). Other commenters compared and contrasted two very different women named Rosie, often adding observations about how things have changed, for the worse, since the 40s.  One such was reader \u201cCindy\u201d: Now instead of Rosie the Riveter, we have the likes of Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Amy Schumer making more for doing worse than nothing than most of us make in a lifetime.  Long before the celebs showed their true colors, America made the yuge mistake of placing people who don\u2019t contribute to our society in a meaningful way on a high pedestal so kids would dream of becoming THAT. And speaking of popular culture, reader \u201cchicodon\u201d added: Every young person should see this.  Glenn Miller was the hottest musical act on the scene for young people in 1942.  The entire country was patriotic, including Hollywood.  It\u2019s from before my time but it was America. . . . Can you picture ANY act today doing this?  Rooting for the military? Indeed, the lyrics to the Glenn Miller song \u201cchicodon\u201d links to, \u201cPeople Like You And Me,\u201d are stirring: Say, get a load o\u2019 those guys, High in the skies, Wingin\u2019 to victoryUp and at \u2019em in the fight forPeople like you and me! Hey, get a load o\u2019 those gobs, Doin\u2019 their jobs, Keepin\u2019 the sea lanes freeJust to make the future bright forPeople like you and me! \u201cGobs,\u201d we might note, was affectionate slang for \u201cseamen. \u201d  At the same time, in that song, the vital work on the homefront was also not forgotten: We\u2019ll have to roll up our sleeves, Tighten our belts, But through the dark we\u2019ll seeThe lady with the liberty light forPeople like you and you and you, And people like me, People like you and me! Miller, we might recall, joined the US Army during WW2 at the peak of his career \u2014  and at age 38.  He died on December 15, 1944, when his airplane crashed into the English Channel he had been preparing the next leg of his famed orchestra\u2019s   tour for the troops. Of course, Miller\u2019s sacrifice was common many celebrities joined the armed services, and many more pitched in \u2014  and more than a few died. For his part, reader \u201cEuclid\u201d took note of the visual elements of Virgil\u2019s article, for which the author can claim no credit: LOOK AT THOSE PHOTOS! Black and white American men and women all working together in harmony. . . .  Look at us now!  The most divided ever among race, gender, class, age, etc! Yes, everyone found a way to pitch in back then as Trump likes to say, the blood of patriots is all the same color. Without a doubt, we were mostly inspired by patriotism back then, and yet for some, the production effort was personal.  Here\u2019s how reader \u201cKatherine\u201d recalled the war work of her grandfather please note the   kicker at the end: My grandfather was a tool and die maker for Ford, and was asked to be a foreman at the Pratt and Whitney plant in Highland Park, Michigan, which built the engines for the  . He didn\u2019t want to be a foreman, but he did it because one of his three sons who were in the service was a   bomber pilot, and he wanted to be sure his son had good engines to fly. So it\u2019s little wonder that even today, many remember the good work that was done.  For instance, reader \u201cHavegunwilltravel\u201d wrote: My father was a   pilot in WW 2.  He flew from England over Germany and he often told me that it was his airplane that brought him back every time. The   was hard to fly, no pressurization but she was tough not like what we have today, \u201cMADE IN CHINA\u201d crap.  I would like to thank all the people who worked at Willow Run who took pride in their work and built one of the greatest airplanes in the world. Another commenter, reader \u201cJake Manchester,\u201d added: I love stories about America\u2019s exceptionalism.  Imagine building one   every hour.  Now that, my friends, is American exceptionalism. Yet in those days, as reader \u201csally forth\u201d recalled, just about everyone was exceptional: It wasn\u2019t just Rosie, it was everyday citizens with victory gardens,  scrap metal drives.  Those that sold war bonds  those that bought war bonds.  It was rationing of food  gas.  Farmers  entire families produced more food. Every PATRIOTIC American was somehow involved to win the big one  bring the boys home. And yes, Virgil will say it again, a great    led us to victory.  As reader \u201cbackhome1999\u201d remembers: My Mom worked in a factory building planes for the WWII effort, and the photo of FDR reminds me of her story about FDR driving through the plant one day on her way into work and waved at her.  She helped build  \u2019s, Douglas plant, Long Beach, Calif. Virgil recognizes that not every Breitbart commenter, including reader \u201cCrazycatkid,\u201d is a fan of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  And yet we all might recall that his fellow Americans thought so highly of FDR that they elected him to the White House four times indeed, each of his presidential victories was a landslide.  Moreover, the fact that his image has been on the US dime for the last 70 years tells us something about his enduring popularity even two Republicans, Nancy and Ronald Reagan, revered him. Yet in addition to the warm glow of nostalgia from those days, there\u2019s also the chill pang of loss. Reader \u201cTexan Forever\u201d wrote: We were a nation united. . . . During this period my favorite cousin, T. J. Morrow, was a left waist gunner on a  .  In 1943 while over Germany he was killed instantly by flak.  The crippled bomber managed to limp to Belgium where the remaining crew bailed out. T. J.\u2019s body went down with the plane and was buried by a Belgian farmer.  His remains were later brought back to America. Indeed, we never forget those who gave all.  And if personal memories are now flickering out, well, the rest of us will have to step up our game and keep the remembrance going.   As reader \u201cHandsomeRogue\u201d added, \u201cIt\u2019s our American history. It\u2019s a legacy our    lived and we have \u2014  largely \u2014  failed to share. \u201d Those who hear the call to remember our history should, of course, visit grave sites and battlefields.  Yet in addition, there are other ways to gain perspective.  As reader \u201cWTP1776\u201d noted, \u201cEvery year they fly the WWII planes right over my house . . . I love hearing the dishes shake in the cupboard . . . they look so swell. \u201d In fact, learning about the winged marvels that brought victory in WW2 can be fun, as well as informative.  As another reader posted: If you EVER have the opportunity to ride in a WWII warbird and have the money, do it.  It\u2019s an experience of a lifetime.  Not just for the flight experience itself, but for at least getting a hint first hand what those young kids crewing them must have gone through in combat conditions. II. The Task Ahead, The point of Virgil\u2019s article was not only to take note of President Trump\u2019s celebration of Rosie and the Greatest Generation, but also to observe that the outlines of an American manufacturing revival \u2014  which is to say, a revival of American greatness, including military greatness \u2014  can now be seen.  And plenty of readers see it, too: Virgil lost track of the number of \u201cMAGAs\u201d scattered through the comments. Yet some Michiganders had a more immediate reaction.  For instance, one Michigan reader wrote, \u201cI have seen President Trump mention us in Michigan more (in a good way) in the past 3 months, than my entire life (since 1960). \u201d Yet at the same time, there are lessons for all Americans to learn.  For example, one reader connected the success of the national effort during WW2 to earlier American team efforts: This is truly the American way.  It has always been our way.  It is only a short distance in time and space from the   in farm country to the factory at Willow Run.  From that   to Willow Run to today we are Americans who work and succeed together. As reader \u201cVypurr\u201d observed, \u201cNationalism is what kept America alive in WWII. \u201d  And  reader \u201cTiger Kitten\u201d turned that point into a larger sentiment: Nationalism is a good thing, it keeps cultures intact, countries strong, and morale high, whereas globalism does nothing but destroy cultures.  Without borders you not only have no country, you have no culture, either. Meanwhile, reader \u201cFLGibsonJr\u201d added valuable historical perspective, linking Trump\u2019s ideas on trade today with the American tradition \u2014  as described by Virgil \u2014  of Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay: America was famous around the world for its Protectionism.  In fact it was Protectionist Tariffs that paid for essentially our entire government including all of our military.  Furthermore, it was Bismarck who looked at the American System of high tariffs and the British System . . . of free trade and chose the American System of high tariffs and then went about building one of the great economic powers in the world. \u201cFLGibsonJr\u201d continued by urging a fellow commenter not to be seduced by \u201cglobalist corporate propaganda. \u201d The   policies stemming from such propaganda, he added, might enrich companies, but they will be \u201cdevastating for countries like the United States. \u201d Meanwhile, reader \u201cAmerican Worker\u2019s Warrior\u201d put the matter in even starker terms: We couldn\u2019t win a war like WW2 today, not after the uniparty\u2019s NAFTA decimated our industrial base, and now we have to rely on China and Asia to make the microchips for all our smart missiles and tech. Others added   policy prescriptions, connecting past to present. One such was reader \u201cnewsies2\u201d: The Willow Run Bomber Plant was as example of what our great Country was capable of doing, when the need arose.  This plant went up in the space of less than a year, and was capable of producing an airplane that helped win the war.  One has to admit that it was a great success.  In my thinking, the article, as it mentioned, is about  !  . . .  Trump is talking about our People working together to be strong and self sufficient once more. Today, some are already doing their part.  For instance, reader \u201cJRG\u201d has a personalized trade policy: During WW2 my mom worked in a factory making piston rings while my dad was in the Pacific doing what Marines do.  I go out of my way to purchase products that are made in the USA even though I know it will cost me more. Still, many commenters made the point that automation will change the factory of the future and factory employment in the future.  And this is undoubtedly true.  Indeed, some, such as reader \u201cgreg,\u201d went out of their way to make the point, sharply, at Virgil\u2019s expense: This article is ridiculous.   It would have you believe that there is some chance that there will be manufacturing jobs coming back to the US. To which reader \u201cJonsen\u201d riposted, \u201cIt\u2019s about the can do spirit. \u201d  \u201cJonsen\u201d added, quoting Virgil, \u201cbefore WWII \u2018we had the resources in place. \u2019\u201d  And those    resources, as Virgil noted, included a quality workforce. As reader \u201cKris Johnson\u201d wrote of those we\u2019     days: Tears fill my eyes at the thought of the America of my grandfather. . . . To imagine a time when management was proud to provide good people with good jobs.  Good American companies built excellent American products that worked and lasted beyond expectation. Indeed, as reader \u201cAngelHorseMomMD223\u201d pointed out, even today, labor is still important: If automation was THE issue in regards to employment, they\u2019d be importing machines, not highly skilled H1B visa workers or unskilled laborers. Indeed, the issue of trade came up often in the comments.  For instance, reader \u201cMechMan\u201d wrote, \u201cWe must be careful not to become   trade.  Free trade is a good thing. \u201d To which reader \u201cMbekos\u201d responded, \u201cThere is no free trade, none. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, Germany, all of them had   ways to win the trade war with US. \u201d And reader \u201cGSR\u201d added, \u201cFree trade can benefit a company, but too much of it can destroy a nation. \u201d Meanwhile, reader \u201cGahD of Socialism,\u201d the name notwithstanding, made a powerful point about capitalism: \u201cWhen a country has a   economy, it thrives. \u201d Yet at the same time, reader \u201cFranco\u201d added a point that was widely understood in the 40s, and less widely understood today: \u201cCan\u2019t have a manufacturing sector without strong consumption and demand. \u201d That is, people need the money in their pockets to buy the things that are being made too much concentration of wealth at the top means too little demand for products \u2014  and so the economy stalls. Thus reader \u201cTyler\u2019s\u201d point on the distribution of wealth, then vs. now, deserves to be taken seriously: \u201cDuring those years CEO and leadership pay was 80 times the median worker. Now it\u2019s 900 times the median worker. \u201d In addition, reader \u201cGregory Brittain\u201d added another good point about the value of widespread prosperity: In addition to the economic effects, the social effects of good jobs are at least as important.  Good jobs leads to more marriage,   families, more children, more stable communities, less crime and more social harmony as a bigger piece of pie is available to all who work for it. Another reader took note of a line from Virgil\u2019s article, describing corporate culture back then: \u201cA   employee was loyal to a company, and the company, in turn, was loyal to the employee. \u201d  Then the reader added a crucial observation about    corporate practices today: THIS is what has fallen by the wayside with the infection of the globalist mindset.  Billionaires see themselves as countries unto themselves, and have no loyalties to anyone or anything else. For his part, reader \u201cLew Ross\u201d was even more blunt: I wish there was some way to prosecute politicians who purposely hurt American wages [by] assisting globalists in cheap labor and higher profits abroad and south of the border.  For almost two decades average household earnings have been stagnant for the      and nobody has paid any price for betraying the nation. Not surprisingly, President Trump figured in many of the comments.  Reader \u201cStella S\u201d posted, \u201cI listened to that speech.  It was heartfelt from an American President to American workers. \u201d  Or as reader \u201cNYPATRIOT\u201d declared, \u201cMake America Great Again, and the manufacturing powerhouse of the world!\u201d And reader \u201cBuckeye Ken\u201d wrote: President Trump bringing the globalists to heel is a good thing.  Lord knows that he is not opposed to anyone making money, but the overall good of the nation must be considered first. To be sure, Trump had critics, too, among the commenters.  One such was reader \u201cStever Collette,\u201d who jibed: \u201cALL of Dishonest Donald\u2019s products are made overseas.  His hotels and clubs continue to use foreign workers on temp visas. \u201d Okay, in American everyone can have his or her own opinion, and more than a few of those opinions seem to end up in the Breitbart comments section. And reader \u201cConfidentSpaceman\u201d put all these diverse options into a useful context, saying of this site,\u201cIt has become the modern equivalent of the public square. \u201d And so maybe that\u2019s a good place to stop.  WW2 was fought, in part, for freedom, and so those who fought \u2014  on the battlefront and on the homefront \u2014  would be gratified to know that freedom is still a cherished value. Finally, Virgil is grateful to the following readers for their nice comments: \u201caha! ,\u201d \u201cAlexa,\u201d \u201cAngelHorseMomMD223,\u201d \u201cBrick Wilson,\u201d \u201cDesertSun59,\u201d \u201cDJTWILLWIN,\u201d \u201cHandsomeRogue,\u201d \u201cJake Manchester,\u201d \u201clarry king,\u201d \u201cLizzy,\u201d \u201cMadMen,\u201d \u201cMarianne,\u201d \u201cNHnative,\u201d \u201cNK210,\u201d \u201cSam Houston,\u201d \u201cTexan Forever,\u201d and \u201cTiger184. \u201d And thanks to all the other commenters, too, even those who were not so nice Virgil learns from all of them. And more to the point, thanks to those who shared their personal histories, the overall canon of American history has thus been enriched.
