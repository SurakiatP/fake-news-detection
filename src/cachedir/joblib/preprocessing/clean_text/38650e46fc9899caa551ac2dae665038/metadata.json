I. and the White House may all agree that Russia was behind the hacking that interfered with the election. But that was of no import to the website Breitbart News, which dismissed reports on the intelligence assessment as \u201c  fake news. \u201d Rush Limbaugh has diagnosed a more fundamental problem. \u201cThe fake news is the everyday news\u201d in the mainstream media, he said on his radio show recently. \u201cThey just make it up. \u201d Some supporters of   Donald J. Trump have also taken up the call. As reporters were walking out of a Trump rally this month in Orlando, Fla. a man heckled them with shouts of \u201cFake news!\u201d Until now, that term had been widely understood to refer to fabricated news accounts that are meant to spread virally online. But conservative cable and radio personalities, top Republicans and even Mr. Trump himself, incredulous about suggestions that fake stories may have helped swing the election, have appropriated the term and turned it against any news they see as hostile to their agenda. In defining \u201cfake news\u201d so broadly and seeking to dilute its meaning, they are capitalizing on the declining credibility of all purveyors of information, one product of the country\u2019s increasing political polarization. And conservatives, seeing an opening to undermine the mainstream media, a longtime foe, are more than happy to dig the hole deeper. \u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve effectively brainwashed the core of our audience to distrust anything that they disagree with. And now it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d said John Ziegler, a conservative radio host, who has been critical of what he sees as excessive partisanship by pundits. \u201cBecause the gatekeepers have lost all credibility in the minds of consumers, I don\u2019t see how you reverse it. \u201d Journalists who work to separate fact from fiction see a dangerous conflation of stories that turn out to be wrong because of a legitimate misunderstanding with those whose clear intention is to deceive. A report, shared more than a million times on social media, that the pope had endorsed Mr. Trump was undeniably false. But was it \u201cfake news\u201d to report on data models that showed Hillary Clinton with overwhelming odds of winning the presidency? Are opinion articles fake if they   facts to draw disputable conclusions? \u201cFake news was a term specifically about people who purposely fabricated stories for clicks and revenue,\u201d said David Mikkelson, the founder of Snopes, the   website. \u201cNow it includes bad reporting, slanted journalism and outright propaganda. And I think we\u2019re doing a disservice to lump all those things together. \u201d The right\u2019s labeling of \u201cfake news\u201d evokes one of the most successful efforts by conservatives to reorient how Americans think about news media objectivity: the move by Fox News to brand its   coverage as \u201cfair and balanced. \u201d Traditionally, mainstream media outlets had thought of their own approach in those terms, viewing their coverage as strictly down the middle. Republicans often found that laughable. As with Fox\u2019s ubiquitous promotion of its slogan, conservatives\u2019 appropriation of the \u201cfake news\u201d label is an effort to further erode the mainstream media\u2019s claim to be a reliable and accurate source. \u201cWhat I think is so unsettling about the fake news cries now is that their audience has already sort of bought into this idea that journalism has no credibility or legitimacy,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, a liberal group that polices the news media for bias. \u201cTherefore, by applying that term to credible outlets, it becomes much more believable. \u201d Conservative news media are now awash in the \u201cfake news\u201d condemnations. When coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary, Andrew F. Puzder, highlighted his opposition to minimum wage increases, the writer and radio host Erick Erickson wrote that Mr. Puzder should have been getting more credit for pointing out that such increases lead to higher unemployment. \u201cTo say otherwise is to push fake news,\u201d he wrote. (The effects actually have been found to vary from city to city.) Infowars, the website run by the conservative provocateur and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, labeled as \u201cfake news\u201d a CNN report that Ivanka Trump would move into the office in the White House normally reserved for the first lady. Mr. Trump has used the term to deny news reports, as he did on Twitter recently after various outlets said he would stay on as the executive producer of \u201cThe New Celebrity Apprentice\u201d after taking office in January. \u201cRidiculous  untrue  \u2014   FAKE NEWS!\u201d he wrote. (He will be credited as executive producer, a spokesman for the show\u2019s creator, Mark Burnett, has said. But it is unclear what work, if any, he will do on the show.) Many conservatives are pushing back at the outrage over fake news because they believe that liberals, unwilling to accept Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, are attributing his triumph to nefarious external factors. \u201cThe left refuses to admit that the fundamental problem isn\u2019t the Russians or Jim Comey or \u2018fake news\u2019 or the Electoral College,\u201d said Laura Ingraham, the author and radio host. \u201c\u2018Fake news\u2019 is just another fake excuse for their failed agenda. \u201d Others see a larger effort to slander the basic journalistic function of  . Nonpartisan websites like Snopes and Factcheck. org have found themselves maligned when they have disproved stories that had been flattering to conservatives. When Snopes wrote about a State Farm insurance agent in Louisiana who had posted a sign outside his office that likened taxpayers who voted for President Obama to chickens supporting Colonel Sanders, Mr. Mikkelson, the site\u2019s founder, was smeared as a partisan Democrat who had never bothered to reach out to the agent for comment. Neither is true. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to float anything they can find out there to discredit \u201d he said. There are already efforts by highly partisan conservatives to claim that their   efforts are the same as those of independent outlets like Snopes, which employ research teams to dig into seemingly dubious claims. Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, has aired \u201c \u201d segments on his program. Michelle Malkin, the conservative columnist, has a web program, \u201cMichelle Malkin Investigates,\u201d in which she conducts her own investigative reporting. The market in these divided times is undeniably ripe. \u201cWe now live in this fragmented media world where you can block people you disagree with. You can only be exposed to stories that make you feel good about what you want to believe,\u201d Mr. Ziegler, the radio host, said. \u201cUnfortunately, the truth is unpopular a lot. And a good fairy tale beats a harsh truth every time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563755.848673}
