Some of the pilot\u2019s comments made passengers feel uncomfortable, \u201ccausing them to question her ability to fly the plane. \u201d Passenger Randy Reiss said the pilot seemed friendly at first, \u201cbut things took an awkward turn when she pointed out an interracial couple sitting in first class. \u201d \u201cIt quickly turned from playful to scary,\u201d Reiss told BuzzFeed News. Passengers said the pilot said that she was going to be on Oprah and then commented on the 2016 presidential election. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t care if you voted for Trump or Clinton, they\u2019re both assholes,\u201d she said.
