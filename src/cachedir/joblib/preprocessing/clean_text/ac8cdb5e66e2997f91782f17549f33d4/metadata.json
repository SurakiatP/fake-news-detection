The report examines the illegal immigrant workforce up through 2014. \\nBefore the crisis, especially as the housing bubble inflated, the share of unauthorized labor soared, from below 3 percent of the labor force in the 1990s to 5.4 percent just prior to the crash. \\n{snip} \\nAbout 10 percent of the illegal immigrant workforce has been protected from deportation, according to Pew, by executive orders from President Obama . Hillary Clinton has said that she will expand on those orders. {snip} \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742561823.0421836}
