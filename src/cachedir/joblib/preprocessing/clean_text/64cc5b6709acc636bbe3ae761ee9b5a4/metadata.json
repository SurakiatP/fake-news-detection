Al Franken ( ) has disinvited Kathy Griffin from an upcoming book event one day after saying he would still appear with her in the wake of the controversy generated by a photograph in which the comedian posed with what looked like President Donald Trump\u2019s decapitated head. [Griffin had been set to appear alongside Franken at an event at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on July 7 to discuss Franken\u2019s new book, Giant of the Senate.  In a Wednesday appearance on CNN, the senator said the image of Griffin holding a bloody, fake head meant to resemble that of the president was a \u201chorrible mistake\u201d and \u201chad no business being in our public discourse. \u201d But Franken  \u2014   who has previously received campaign donations from Griffin  \u2014   said the July book event would continue as scheduled. Franken backtracked Thursday, saying \u201cit would be best\u201d for Griffin not to appear at the event. \u201cAfter hearing from many Minnesotans who were rightfully offended, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it would be best for her not to participate in the event we had previously scheduled. I understand why Minnesotans were upset by this, and I take that very seriously,\u201d Franken told Politico Thursday. \u201cI believe what Kathy Griffin did was inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere in our national discourse. I consider her a friend and I\u2019m glad she realized she crossed the line and apologized,\u201d he added. The photo of Griffin  \u2014   taken by L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields  \u2014   sparked a firestorm when it was first published by TMZ Tuesday morning. CNN fired the comedian from her role as   of its New Year\u2019s Eve coverage, and at least five venues have cancelled scheduled performances on her comedy tour. Griffin is set to hold a press conference Friday morning to address the \u201ctrue motivation\u201d behind the image, and respond to the \u201cbullying\u201d she says she had endured by the Trump family.
