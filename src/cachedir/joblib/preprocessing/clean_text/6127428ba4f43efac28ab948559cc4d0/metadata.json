When he did so, box-cutter blades attached to the Trump-Pence sign cut his hands.\u201d \\nSteve Spainhouer, Collin County Democratic Campaign Chair, told reporters at KTVT that the incident was \u201cdeplorable.\u201d \\n\u201cIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who\u2019s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other. \\nI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they\u2019re going to vote and so there\u2019s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.\u201d \\nThankfully, the injured poll worker was not seriously hurt, but this could have been much worse. Clearly, the people who did this have listened to Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric \u2014 they knew putting a razor blade in a misplaced sign was dangerous. And in placing the sign in the wrong place, they deliberately injured someone. \\nTexas Rangers are investigating the incident. Let\u2019s hope they find the people/person who did this. \\nWatch the full report via KTVT here: \\nFeatured Image via Video Screen Shot Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564383.8747618}
