[On Wednesday, Kushner Cos. and the Anbang Insurance Group of China reportedly agreed to end talks about securing investment in an office tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The deal had been criticized as an effort by the Chinese to win favor with the Trump administration.  \u201cThe biggest concern that I\u2019ve had is whether Jared Kushner, whether it\u2019s the president\u2019s sons who are running the real estate business, that they are going to be offered or they are going to seek out sweetheart deals with foreign government entities  \u2014   Chinese, Russian, Kazakhstan, you name it,\u201d Schweizer told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. \u201cThat\u2019s where the vulnerability is, because they will make a killing financially, and a foreign entity will then gain leverage or favors from the Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things are very worrisome. Again, there\u2019s no deals that seem to have been sealed, and there\u2019s no evidence that there have been financial transfers,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut this needs to be monitored  \u2014   and monitored, I think, with great intensity because this has been a repeated pattern in American politics. \u201d Peter Schweizer is a senior editor at large for Breitbart News, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and author of the   Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.
