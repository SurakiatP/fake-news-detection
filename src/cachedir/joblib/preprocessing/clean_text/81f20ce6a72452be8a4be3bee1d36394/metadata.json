[One photo posted to the \u201cSee You Again\u201d rapper\u2019s Instagram account shows a bouquet of fresh flowers and a marijuana joint perched next to a headstone belonging to Pablo Escobar.  The    rapper  \u2014   real name Cameron Jibril Thomaz  \u2014   ultimately deleted the photo, but not before it had been captured and spread online. One disgusted Twitter user posted the rapper\u2019s photo, captioning it: \u201cColombians aren\u2019t proud as you are of a murder and narco like Pablo Escobar. Show more respect. Colombia isn\u2019t Pablo Escobar  \u2026    \u201d . @wizkhalifa Colombians aren\u2019t proud as you are of a murder and narco like Pablo Escobar. Show more respect. Colombia isn\u2019t Pablo Escobar  \u2026     pic. twitter.   \u2014   Pablo JaramilloVasco (@PabloJlloVasco) March 27, 2017,  A post shared by Wiz Khalifa (@wizkhalifa) on Mar 25, 2017 at 8:38am PDT,  The   rapper was in Colombia for a performance at a music festival in Medellin. Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez slammed Khalifa and demanded he apologize for \u201cadvocating crime. \u201d \u201cThat scoundrel, instead of bringing flowers to Pablo Escobar, he should have brought flowers to the victims of violence in this city,\u201d Gutierrez reportedly told local media. \u201cHe must offer an apology to the city,\u201d Gutierrez said, adding that Khalifa was \u201cnot welcomed\u201d back. Dozens of others took to social media to protest Khalifa\u2019s apparent praise of the late drug lord, whose cartel killed thousands in the 1980s and 90s. It\u2019s embarrassing that @wizkhalifa honors Pablo Escobar. What a lack of respect with the people of Colombia: https:  .   \u2014   Jos\u00e9 Miguel Quintero (@JosMiguelQuinte) March 27, 2017,  @wizkhalifa Celebrating the thousands of crimes commited by Pablo Escobar is the product of a filthy mind and a putrid soul.  \u2014   IgnacioGreiffenstein (@NachoGreiffenst) March 26, 2017,  It\u2019s unfortunate that @wizkhalifa brought flowers to Pablo Escobar\u2019s grave in Medellin. The drug kingpin was no Robin Hood. @FicoGutierrez,  \u2014   Aldo Civico (@acivico) March 26, 2017,  Escobar\u2019s life is the subject of the   Netflix original series Narcos. Wiz Khalifa has not responded to the controversy.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742564419.756959}
