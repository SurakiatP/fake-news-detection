The water in two of the competition pools has grown progressively greener and murkier all week, even as officials have been unable to provide a plausible explanation for the problem, let alone solve it. Things had gotten so bad on Friday that athletes were complaining of eye irritation, morning diving practice was canceled in one of the pools and officials said that the second pool, which is used for water polo and synchronized swimming, would probably have to be drained completely and refilled with water from a nearby practice pool. Under the worst possible outcome, said Cornel Marculescu, executive director of the international swimming federation, known as FINA, the pools would have to be shut down and the events moved to a different location. \u201cThe most important issue is to be sure that the water quality does not affect the health and safety of the athletes, which is why we\u2019re conducting tests throughout the day to make sure everything is O. K.,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, we will be obliged to say, no more events in the pool. But we are not there yet. \u201d Compounding the problem is a lack of transparency and a sense that officials are helpless to do anything about it. Since Tuesday, when the water in the diving pool abruptly changed from a pellucid azure to a lurid green, officials have provided an array of different diagnoses, from too many people in the water to not enough wind in the air. Each day, too, they have promised, incorrectly, that things were speedily returning to normal. Not only did the trouble swiftly migrate from the diving pool to a second pool at the venue, the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, the greenness grew darker by the day. By late Thursday, underwater visibility in the diving pool had been reduced to zero. Diving practice was canceled on Friday morning, with dozens of athletes forced instead to \u201cdry practice\u201d indoors. In a statement explaining the closing, the Rio 2016 committee said, \u201cThe reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible. \u201d What they meant, said Mario Andrada, a spokesman, is that \u201cwe can clean it easier and faster\u201d without any athletes in the pool. By the afternoon, the water had not returned to the desired hue, but the diving pool was reopened anyway for the first individual diving event, the women\u2019s   springboard preliminaries. Trying to explain the cause, Marculescu said that faulty filtration that messed up \u201cthe very sophisticated chemical combination\u201d in the water. \u201cThe quality of the water through the filters and the treatment of the water in the filters was inadequate,\u201d Marculescu said. He blamed the trouble on poor oversight by officials in charge of the venue. Athletes leaving the diving competition complained of red eyes and irritation. \u201cI could not see a thing underwater, but luckily I didn\u2019t need to,\u201d said Uschi Freitag, a diver from the Netherlands. Earlier in the day, some athletes were quoted as saying that the pool smelled slightly   but that did not seem to be the case in the afternoon. It seemed, too, that the pool was a bit lighter in color, though it remained murky and swampy. \u201cTo change the color of the water is going to take a long time due to the amount of water in the pool,\u201d Marculescu said. \u201cThe process is complex. \u201d Officials have offered an array of explanations, beginning on Tuesday, when Andrada blamed \u201ca proliferation of algae\u201d due to \u201cheat and lack of wind. \u201d On Wednesday, Andrada had a new theory: \u201ca sudden decrease in the alkalinity in the diving pool,\u201d caused by too many people using it. Sean Johnson, president of the New York franchise of American Pool New York, a   company, rejected that notion. \u201cIt\u2019s like the worst excuse ever,\u201d Johnson said in an interview, adding that he believed the cause to be copper or other metals in the water that had been oxidized by the addition of chlorine. He said it was a common problem in pools around New York. \u201cAs soon as you fill it up, it\u2019s blue,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start to add chlorine to it, it turns green. \u201d What the pool handlers should have done, he said, is add a chemical known as a sequestering agent that counteracts the effects of the metals. Back in Rio, the international swimming federation offered its own midweek account. \u201cThe water tanks ran out of some of the chemicals used in the water treatment process,\u201d it said. \u201cAs a result the pH level of the water was outside the usual range. \u201d By Thursday, Andrada sounded more hopeful. \u201cThe water is improved,\u201d he said. That was not really the case, though, and by Friday he had turned a bit philosophical. \u201cChemistry\u2019s not an exact science,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628488.007059}
