However, Tesla claimed to have \u201chad thoroughly investigated the employee\u2019s allegations with the help of \u2018a neutral,   expert\u2019 and concluded her complaints were unmerited. \u201d  In a statement, Tesla claims to have fired Vandermeyden after launching an investigation into her claims and discovering that they were \u201cillegitimate. \u201d \u201cDespite repeatedly receiving special treatment at the expense of others, Ms Vandermeyden nonetheless chose to pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla and falsely attacking our company in the press,\u201d said a Tesla spokesperson following Vandermeyden\u2019s dismissal. \u201cAfter we carefully considered the facts on multiple occasions and were absolutely convinced that Ms Vandermeyden\u2019s claims were illegitimate, we had no choice but to end her employment at Tesla. \u201d Despite Tesla\u2019s statement, Vandermeyden\u2019s lawyer blamed the dismissal on sexism. \u201cThis was absolutely shocking for AJ. She is devastated,\u201d said Vandermeyden\u2019s lawyer, Therese Lawless. \u201cShe brought the lawsuit in an attempt to make the workplace at Tesla more equitable and fair and to have Tesla comply with the law. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve just proven our case. It\u2019s clear retaliation,\u201d she continued. \u201cSomebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired  \u2026     It\u2019s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have. \u201d   Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
