While some of his advisers suggested that he would slip back into a more conventional Republican approach, Mr. Trump dropped hints in interviews, Twitter posts and other public comments that he intended to push his party away from its   internationalist dogma on trade, foreign alliances, immigration, infrastructure spending and prescription drug access. The hints are over. An inaugural speech delivered with the same blunt force that propelled Mr. Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign has dashed Republican hopes for a more traditional agenda. With his \u201cnew decree,\u201d he declared himself modern America\u2019s first populist president  \u2014   and all but dared his own party to resist his Republican reformation. \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s vision will inevitably collide with establishment Republican leaders in Congress, and the outcome could determine not just the success of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, but also the identity of his party. Republicans have resisted Democratic efforts to spend big on the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, tunnels and rail lines use the federal government\u2019s power to bargain for lower prescription drug prices block trade agreements and limit foreign interventions. Republican leaders have sought a   approach on immigration laws, offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and tried to restrain popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. If the president is able to blur party lines on such issues and harness an ascendant   coalition to win that clash, he will have untethered conservatism from the Republican Party and shifted the party away from the   approach that has been its hallmark since Ronald Reagan stood 36 years ago in the same position on the Capitol steps as Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump is about to discover that his hopes for a realignment may not come easily. As in his campaign, he faces an array of obstacles: his historic unpopularity and lack of discipline, advisers who hope to nudge him back toward conventional Republicanism and, perhaps most significant, other party leaders who have a more conservative outlook on domestic policy and government spending and a more hawkish attitude on foreign affairs. The alarm and anxiety within the Republican Party\u2019s congressional wing toward its own president are remarkable. And among Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken intraparty critics, the warnings of resistance are unambiguous. \u201cThere are three branches of government,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. \u201cWe now have a majority in both houses. And both majorities I think hold to basic conservative Republican principles. \u201d   the threat of reprisal, Mr. McCain said he intended to be true to what he saw as his party and his voters: \u201cTrump carried Arizona by four points. I carried my state by 14 points. \u201d Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who like Mr. McCain has repeatedly clashed with Mr. Trump, said that he was preparing for the president to back his opponent in a primary next year  \u2014   but that it would not dissuade him from putting up opposition on some issues. \u201cThere are some of us who will be pushing to get back to the roots of the party: limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, free trade,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cThose are things that the party has stood on for a long time. \u201d Mr. Trump and some of his closest advisers say such resistance is not just futile but foolish. And they are already pledging to harness Mr. Trump\u2019s following in the states and districts of recalcitrant Republicans to sound warnings of their own. \u201cThe incentive for many of these members will be to follow Mr. Trump\u2019s lead because he won many of their states,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s campaign chief turned senior White House adviser. Aiming at perhaps the most powerful congressional Republican, and one of the more orthodox conservatives, Ms. Conway pointedly recalled Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s inability to carry his own state in 2012 as the party\u2019s   nominee. \u201cSpeaker Ryan knows   lost by seven points in Wisconsin, and Mr. Trump just won the state,\u201d she said. As Ms. Conway noted, many Republican skeptics were doubtful that Mr. Trump could win in the first place. But even some on the right who are sympathetic to elements of his vision worry that there is no infrastructure to undergird and promote Trumpism  \u2014   unlike Reagan\u2019s conservative movement or former President Bill Clinton\u2019s centrist \u201cthird way\u201d approach. Traditional conservatives dominate Capitol Hill, Washington\u2019s think tanks and advocacy groups, as well as   statehouses. \u201cPopulism has been an energy that has carried Republicans into office, but once in office very few of them stay populist,\u201d said Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the conservative Washington Free Beacon. Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s likely that Trump is premature,\u201d arguing that Mr. Trump is aligned with the party\u2019s voters but a step ahead of its congressional wing. \u201cHe is only one man. \u201d There are Republicans who still believe that Mr. Trump will govern more as a   conservative even as he attracts a broader coalition of   voters to the party. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is going to fundamentally reshape the party on issues,\u201d predicted Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. He added that Mr. Trump\u2019s political legacy would be to \u201copen the eyes\u201d of voters who had not supported Republican presidential hopefuls in recent years. Mr. Walker said Mr. Trump himself had said he was not \u201ca policy guy\u201d and argued that the president would lean heavily on Vice President Mike Pence and the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to carry out his agenda. That is exactly what worries some Republicans who share Mr. Trump\u2019s views: that the president will be undermined by some in his inner circle. When Mr. Trump veered away from orthodoxy during the transition, some of his advisers quickly tried to recast his comments with a more conservative veneer. \u201cMy concern with Reince is he\u2019s bringing in a lot of the   folks,\u201d said Rick Santorum, a onetime senator from Pennsylvania, who ran a     campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. \u201cThey\u2019re not fans of the agenda, much less real fans of Trump. \u201d And, Mr. Santorum added of Mr. Pence\u2019s roots in traditional conservatism, \u201ccandidly this is not where Mike has been in the past, either. \u201d Still, Mr. Santorum said, he spoke on the phone to Mr. Trump this past week, and the incoming president was every bit as committed to his style of politics as he was during the campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to change,\u201d Mr. Santorum said. Mr. Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address reflected as much, and it highlighted the influence of the most prominent nationalists entering the West Wing this weekend, the senior advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller. The new president not only outlined his brand of politics, but also sent a message to those who work in the building behind him. \u201cWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe time for empty talk is over. \u201d Or as Ms. Conway put it, \u201cWhen he says, \u2018We\u2019re going to build the wall,\u2019 he means it, and when he says, \u2018We\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals,\u2019 he means it. \u201d \u201c  or undercutting or trying to change Donald Trump is a fool\u2019s errand,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople who watched this campaign should have discovered that by now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563597.0025413}
