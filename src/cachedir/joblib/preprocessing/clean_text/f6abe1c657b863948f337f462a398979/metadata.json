The sulfuric acid is highly toxic and can burn and damage the environment if the battery leaks. These batteries use a solution of salt water instead of acid and the results are astounding. \\nAs opposed to lead-acid batteries, which can only be discharged to about 50% of their capacity, these salt water batteries can be discharged to 90%, meaning they can utilized 40% more of their energy per charge. \\nEach battery can handle 3,000 discharges, meaning they can last 3,000 days and nights. They are also stackable, useful for increasing your power needs. \\nAnother awesome feature is that these batteries won\u2019t catch on fire like lead-acid batteries. \\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing one, you can, through Aquion\u2019s website .
