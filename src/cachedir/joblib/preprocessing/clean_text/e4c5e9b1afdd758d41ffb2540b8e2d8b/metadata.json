C.  \u2014     Donald Trump\u2019s first act as president will reportedly be to \u201cclamp down\u201d on the country\u2019s immigration system and refugee resettlement program, while enforcing a \u201c \u201d method, focusing on skilled workers. [In a new piece by the LA Times, the   newspaper says Trump will immediately focus on the broken immigration system, both legal and illegal, just as his campaign for president promised:  Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally. In their place, expect to see images on the evening news of workplace raids as Trump sends a message that he is wasting no time on his promised crackdown. The LA Times cites Trump spokesman Sean Spicer\u2019s statement on immigration as an indication that the incoming administration will not take a backseat to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the issue. \u201cWe need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system, and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community,\u201d Spicer told the LA Times. The LA Times also noted Trump\u2019s widespread powers as president over the country\u2019s immigration system, writing that \u201cTrump can act on immigration without Congress\u201d: Taken together, the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced, which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U. S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other   plans, such as replacing Obamacare, Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president\u2019s wide legal authority to control borders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to move very quickly on the border,\u201d Vice   Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday, saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge  \u2014   building a wall along the border with Mexico. That   on immigration could come via a   immigration system, which would mean less   immigrants and more   workers to take jobs that cannot be filled from the country\u2019s native population, POLITICO reported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have great people and people of great talent coming into our country,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox  Friends. \u201cAnd if you can think of this, some of the Silicon Valley companies want to build up in Canada, because in Canada, they\u2019re able to get the people that they need and they can\u2019t get them in this country because we don\u2019t allow them in this country. \u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re going to take care of a lot of situations,\u201d Trump continued, referring the country\u2019s immigration system. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have a lot of heart, believe me. It\u2019s going to be a heart almost as big as yours. \u201d The   immigration plan could be trotted out by the incoming Trump administration \u201cover the next two to three months,\u201d as he noted in the interview. Immigration groups like NumbersUSA heralded the potential   system, saying that it would favor giving legal immigrant residence to individuals who fill jobs, rather than the current system which favors family members of immigrants already living in the U.
