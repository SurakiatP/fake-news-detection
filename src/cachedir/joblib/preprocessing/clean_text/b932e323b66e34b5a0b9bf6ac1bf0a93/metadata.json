This is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also [entails] battles against Takfiri groups,\u201d said Zarif. \\nHe added, \u201cWe have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an all-out ceasefire, humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian issue.\u201d \\nFollowing the trilateral talks, the three ministers attended a joint press conference. \\nDuring the presser, Muallem slammed the US-led coalition purportedly fighting Daesh, saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims. \\nHe said the Washington-led campaign was in fact encouraging Daesh terrorists to move from Iraq\u2019s Mosul to Syria\u2019s Raqqah. \\nMosul and Raqqah have served as the main Daesh bases in the Middle East over the past years. Iraqi and Syrian armed forces are engaged in large-scale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities. \\nThe Syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with Iran and Russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism. \\nMuallem described the atmosphere of the talks in Russia as \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cvery comfortable.\u201d \\n\u201cWe in Syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the Russian and Iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism,\u201d he added.
