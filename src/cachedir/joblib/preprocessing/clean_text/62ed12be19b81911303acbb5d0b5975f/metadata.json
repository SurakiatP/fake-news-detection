[Kumar, a wealthy and successful   businessman based in Chicago, took the opportunity to dispel media and   myths about former Breitbart News Executive Chairman and now Chief White House Strategist Stephen K. Bannon.  Speaking to Breitbart News, he said: \u201c[He is a] totally different creature [to his portrayal in the media],\u201d said Kumar. \u201cWhen I first met him, this narrative was there. And the first time I met him at the end of July last year, he welcomed me, he showed me his great innovative mind, he recognised the potential of the   vote, and he was participant every which way. \u201cHe was so nice, he was just unbelievably nice  \u2026     [he\u2019s] just an absolutely great guy,\u201d added Kumar. The book, written by political operative James Kahrs details Mr. Kumar\u2019s journey from setting up the Republican Hindu Coalition, having himself become convinced of the party and its conservative values through personal conversations with President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Kumar says he threw his weight behind Mr. Trump after meeting him on several occasions during the Presidential campaign, hosting dozens of town hall events, putting himself forth as a Trump surrogate on television channels around the world, and indeed producing a video aimed at Hindu Americans which he says had 1. 2 billion impressions around the world, including amongst the 4. 2 million Hindu Americans living in the United States. \u201cIn the past, they\u2019ve only voted 16 per cent for Republicans  \u2026     84 per cent have voted for Democrats  \u2026     They should all be voting  \u2026     90 per cent should be voting for Republican conservatives, but they needed to be touched\u201d. In the book, Kahrs writes: People who know Bannon know that he is a gregarious and courtly man, despite all the scary stories written about him or even his portrayal on NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live as the grim reaper. True to himself, Bannon was the first to greet Kumar when he arrived. \u201cHe is not the   racist animal that is depicted in the media at all,\u201d Kumar thought to himself. \u201cIn fact, he was so kind and hospitable. He took me around to the offices and introduced me to the members of the staff. He really made me feel like I was a welcome member of the team. \u201d The book recalls stories of how Kumar met with candidate Donald Trump, even at one point getting the now President to utter the Hindi words \u201cAb Ki Baar Trump Sarkar!\u201d for a campaign video.
