I don\u2019t agree with him that   Trump is illegitimate. I believe it was a legitimate election and that he was elected through that electoral process. I also don\u2019t agree with his decision not to attend the inaugural although it certainly is his right because it is not about   Trump, it\u2019s a peaceful transfer of power which is a distinguishing characteristic of our republic. That said, I also hoped the   would have responded differently given everything that John Lewis means to our country.
