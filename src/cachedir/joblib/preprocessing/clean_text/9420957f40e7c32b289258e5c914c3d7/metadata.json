He also appeared to be blinking away a tear or two at the thought of losing those three players: Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. That moment of emotional reflection for Auriemma, who is better known for biting sarcasm, came after a 60th consecutive victory, to which the Huskies predictably added 15 more on the way to their fourth straight (and 11th overall) national championship. Not many, including Auriemma, would have bet the mortgage on the streaks  \u2014   both in games and titles  \u2014   lasting much longer. But on Monday night, in a   and expectant Gampel Pavilion, the Huskies made it an even 100 straight victories, swarming that same South Carolina team,   to cross the   threshold. The Huskies did it behind their   forwards, Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier. Williams scored 26 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while Collier added 18 and 9. \u201cContinuing what they\u2019ve done for so many years,\u201d said Williams, referring to past iconic Huskies, several of whom, Stewart included, watched from the stands. It starts to sound ridiculous, but the Huskies,   this season, have not lost since November 2014 (in overtime at Stanford). If not for that loss, they\u2019d be working on a streak of 148 straight. Even Auriemma sounded at a loss to explain this. He settled on \u201cit was meant to be\u201d after weeks of insisting that he and his players never talked about No. 100. Against the   and No. 6 Gamecocks, the subject was unavoidable. And after 12 successive blowouts in an American Athletic Conference in which the Huskies have gone   since its formation, the prospect of stiffer competition was preferable. With an eye on bigger game, the N. C. A. A. tournament, Auriemma said: \u201cThe   streak isn\u2019t all theirs. They carried the streak across the finish line. But if they win the national championship, it\u2019s all theirs. \u201d It\u2019s not as if the act of breaking records is new to his program. A previous record   winning streak (surpassing the U. C. L. A. men\u2019s record established from 1971 to 1974) was bested by the current run last month. There is no doubt that a potential fifth straight national title, and 12th over all, are numbers more appealing to Auriemma. But triple digits in consecutive wins represents another symbolic groundbreaking and powerful statement in the continued and collective excellence of a women\u2019s sports team. Only once had Auriemma\u2019s program come this close to 100  \u2014   a   winning streak that stood at 99 when an upstart St. John\u2019s team won at Gampel in February 2012, before Connecticut\u2019s departure from what was then a highly competitive Big East Conference. \u201cSenior night, packed house at Gampel, as always,\u201d Kim Barnes Arico  \u2014   then the St. John\u2019s coach, now in her fifth season at Michigan, where she has built a     team  \u2014   said in a telephone interview. With St. John\u2019s trailing by 2 points in the final seconds, Barnes Arico decided during a timeout to try for the win rather than overtime in such a challenging environment. Shenneika Smith  \u2014   \u201cshe hadn\u2019t made a 3 in weeks\u201d  \u2014   sank the winning shot. On the bus ride home, Barnes Arico\u2019s cellphone rang. \u201cIt\u2019s Geno, calling to congratulate me after what had to be a crushing loss,\u201d Barnes Arico said. Auriemma had been supportive of her efforts to elevate the St. John\u2019s program, which is why, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t help but applaud what he\u2019s doing there, going for 100 straight, just incredible. \u201d That said, she was \u201cholding off\u201d on reaching out, or rooting for either side on Monday, given her ties to South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley. Barnes Arico has coached   and   U. S. A. Basketball teams with Staley, a   Olympian and, like Auriemma, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member. \u201cEither way, such a great story,\u201d Barnes Arico said. Staley\u2019s team  \u2014   as have most ranked teams  \u2014   presented Connecticut with its usual handicap of a size disadvantage, with their    star, A\u2019ja Wilson, and the    center Alaina Coates. But the Huskies countered with Williams, only   and Collier,    \u2014   both quick jumpers who play bigger than they are. After Wilson helped keep the Gamecocks within   at the half, the Huskies limited her to 5   points. They took control late in the third quarter and were never threatened in the fourth. \u201cYou can\u2019t let your guard down  \u2014   UConn is going to make you pay every time,\u201d Staley said. In surmounting every obstacle on a schedule   with   opponents, Auriemma rapidly developed a cohesive Core Four to replace the Big Three of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, who were the top three picks in last year\u2019s W. N. B. A. draft. \u201cWe have no preseason   but we have four really good players, and every time we need something, one of them comes up with something,\u201d Auriemma said, referring to the juniors Williams and Kia Nurse, and the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Collier. If this wasn\u2019t supposed to be a season of extended dominance, the question entering Monday night had evolved. Would the Huskies ever lose? \u201cIt\u2019s not if,\u201d Auriemma said, \u201cit\u2019s just when. \u201d But if not Monday night, or sometime this season, just when? Next season, Connecticut is planning to suit up Azura Stevens, a    transfer from Duke who many believe would have been UConn\u2019s best player this season. The Huskies will add Megan Walker, rated by some as the nation\u2019s No. 1 high school recruit. They will return six of their seven rotation players, the exception being Saniya Chong, who shares the   position with the freshman Crystal Dangerfield. With no formidable opponent left on the conference schedule, and victories over many of the   teams already recorded, an inquiring mind wants to wonder whether the Huskies might in a couple of years be on the doorstep of 200.'"}, "time": 1742561764.477956}
