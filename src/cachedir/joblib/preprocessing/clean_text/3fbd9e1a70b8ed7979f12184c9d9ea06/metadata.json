Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed on terrorism, jobs, race relations and, above all, basic issues of honesty and trustworthiness during their first presidential debate. If you missed it, let us help you catch up with a few highlights and our rigorous fact checks of the candidates\u2019 assertions. And watch clips from the debate above. _____ 2. Houston suffered through a mass shooting. The authorities said that a heavily armed man wearing a uniform emblazoned with a Nazi symbol opened fire at random in a residential area near a mall. He injured nine people, two of them seriously, before the police shot and killed him. Officials said he was a lawyer and had experienced troubles at his firm. In Washington State, a    Turkish immigrant confessed to killing of five people at a shopping mall on Friday. His motive remains unknown. _____ 3. Nationally, there was good news and bad news. The good news: Millions of Americans have climbed out of poverty, driven partly by widespread moves to increase the minimum wage. The bad: F. B. I. figures showed homicides skyrocketing 10. 8 percent from 2014 to 2015, the largest   rise since 1968. But most of the country was far safer. The killing was largely limited to a few neighborhoods in cities like Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, Washington and Milwaukee, all plagued by gun violence among young   males. _____ 4. Syrian and allied Russian forces intensively bombed   areas of the tormented northern Syrian city of Aleppo for the fourth day straight, ignoring accusations of war crimes and \u201cbarbarism\u201d at the United Nations. Hundreds of people have been killed there since Thursday. Efforts to revive a   have been abandoned. _____ 5. How often do sports teams appear to make decisions based on their player\u2019s welfare? Chris Bosh, one of the N. B. A. \u2019s top players, says the blood clots that cut his last two seasons short shouldn\u2019t stop him from playing this year, but the Miami Heat\u2019s president, Pat Riley, said Bosh\u2019s career with the team \u201cis probably over. \u201d They\u2019ll have to pay him some $76 million over the next three seasons, but will get the chance to raise the team\u2019s spending cap. _____ 6. Why is the fashion world obsessed with RuPaul\u2019s \u201cDrag Race,\u201d a platform for those hoping to be \u201cAmerica\u2019s next drag superstar\u201d? Sure, there\u2019s affirmation and visibility for the  . But there\u2019s also drama, courage and sometimes unbelievably great looks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen every episode,\u201d said the designer Marc Jacobs, who has also served as a judge. \u201cIt makes me laugh, it makes me cry. \u201d _____ 7. The admitted mastermind of the Bridgegate scheme testified for the first time about how he came up with the idea to create a catastrophic traffic jam in New Jersey to punish a Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s   bid. David Wildstein, a Christie ally, also testified about how many top Christie operatives he told. He said his exchanges with a Christie aide made it clear the mayor \u201cneeded to fully understand that life would be more difficult for him in the second Christie term than it had been in the first. \u201d _____ 8.

Above, Mr. Obama was presented with a traditional blanket and hat. _____ 10. Finally, multiple generations of   made up many of the thousands upon thousands of people who have visited the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture in its opening days. For some, the import resonated as a bookend of the final days of President Obama\u2019s final term, and as a marker for an unfinished fight for racial equality. \u201cThe timing is prophetic  \u2014   you can\u2019t visit here and not think about what\u2019s going on today, and the sense of history and struggle,\u201d said a Maryland pastor. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
