Facing her first serious Syria showdown at the Security Council, the ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, also used her remarks at an emergency session to blame Russia for blocking a robust response to the attack on Tuesday on a northern Syrian town, which has incited widespread condemnation. The death toll was reported to exceed 100. The United States, France and Britain have accused the Syrian government of responsibility and bitterly criticized Russia  \u2014   Syria\u2019s main ally in the    war  \u2014   for objecting to a resolution they drafted condemning the attack. Russia has said that insurgents may have been responsible, or that the attack may have been fabricated to embarrass President Bashar   of Syria. \u201cTime and time again, Russia uses the same false narrative to deflect attention from their allies in Damascus,\u201d Ms. Haley said. \u201cHow many more children have to die before Russia cares?\u201d She closed her remarks with an ominous warning. \u201cWhen the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,\u201d she said. She did not provide further details. But the hint of acting alone was striking, suggesting that she was willing to articulate a position even before her boss. Shortly after her remarks, President Trump expressed his own tougher tone toward Mr. Assad. At a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that the attack had \u201ccrossed a lot of lines for me\u201d and that his attitude toward \u201cSyria and Assad has changed very much. \u201d The French ambassador to the United Nations, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, called on Russia to stand up to the use of chemical weapons and on the United States to show leadership on Syria. Asked about his American counterpart\u2019s suggestion of unilateral action in the absence of a consensus, Mr. Delattre demurred. \u201cAction by the Security Council would be by far the best option,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned by inaction at this stage, the risk of inaction. \u201d The draft resolution \u201cexpresses its determination that those responsible must be held accountable\u201d but provided no concrete measure to do so. It reminded the Syrian government that it was obliged to cooperate with international investigators looking into the use of chemical weapons, including by turning over all flight logs, flight plans and the names of commanders in charge of air operations on the day of the strike. It also asked the secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to provide monthly reports on whether the Syrian government was cooperating. The British envoy, Matthew Rycroft, pushed his fellow diplomats to act or lose all credibility in the eyes of the public. \u201cThey view us as a table of diplomats doing nothing, our hands tied behind our backs, beholden to Russian intransigence,\u201d he said. Russia dismissed the comments, saying, \u201cAt this stage, we don\u2019t see a particular need. \u201d Its deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, went on to scold its drafters for expressing \u201chorror\u201d at the attack: \u201cHave you even checked what you wrote? This draft was prepared in a hasty way. \u201d After the Council meeting ended, diplomats said that they were continuing to negotiate and that no vote had been scheduled. In Brussels, at a meeting of donor countries for Syrian humanitarian relief convened by the European Union, Mr. Guterres declared that \u201cwar crimes are going on in Syria. \u201d Asked whether Mr. Assad\u2019s government was responsible, Mr. Guterres called for \u201ca very clear investigation to remove all doubts. \u201d Condemnation also came from Pope Francis, who called the attack \u201can unacceptable massacre\u201d the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who deplored \u201cthe use of these barbaric weapons\u201d and Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, who said that Syria\u2019s government bore primary responsibility. The Brussels conference produced pledges of $6 billion for 2017, Christos Stylianides, the European commissioner for humanitarian aid, announced Wednesday evening when the meeting concluded. The war in Syria has taken nearly 400, 000 lives, monitoring groups have said, and it has displaced roughly half of all Syrians from their homes.'"}, "time": 1742561873.4821532}
