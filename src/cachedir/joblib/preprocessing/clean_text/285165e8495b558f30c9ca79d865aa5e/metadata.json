His exact words: \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d Several pundits think that statement cost him the election. But read more broadly, the way the subliminal mind does, and his response was brilliant, revealing his astute instincts emanating from the newly discovered unconscious super intelligence (which we all possess). \\nHis word \u201csuspense\u201d implies an unfolding drama. Indeed, the depth of this drama is immeasurable. But Trump\u2019s telling America a secret story. \\nHis story is told through his super intelligence which quick reads situations before telling what it perceives between the lines. Trump\u2019s super-intel is naturally attuned to other persons\u2019 subconscious confessions. They do so in the symbolic language of \u201cprotests too much\u201d denial and \u201clog in your eye\u201d projection along with other key imagery. \\nHis super-intel quick reads Hillary Clinton and the media and conveys his response indirectly in code. \\nThere\u2019s far more to the media\u2019s insistence that Trump was violating rules by not accepting election results. The media asked, \u201cAre you going to play by the rules of prior presidential candidates?\u201d But the big picture behind this election focuses on presidents playing by the rules, specifically the rule of law. \\nUnconsciously, Trump\u2019s answer implied that the candidacy of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, raises serious rule of law questions. \\nFor two weeks the media harangued Trump complaining he\u2019d not played by society\u2019s accepted rules of sexual conduct. That criticism continued while they ignored Hillary\u2019s longtime enabling of her husband\u2019s abusive sexual behavior and her documented harassment of his victims as well as her own sexual escapades. The media wanted to turn this sexual matter into the central rule of law issue while a far more important rule of law issue regarding the nation\u2019s foundation still sits on the table. \\nAs Roger L. Simon of pjmedia.com wrote on March 23, 2016, \u201cThe very backbone of our country was the rule of law. Without [it]\u2026 America as we know it does not exist.\u201d Simon declared Americans must be convinced that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email matter was handled justly and that Obama dare not interfere. Neither condition was satisfied. Obama avowed long before the Department of Justice ruled that Hillary was innocent. \\nThen FBI Director James Comey in July 2016 detailed many of Hillary\u2019s rule of law violations and in a denial confession\u2014reading through his \u201cprotests too much\u201d\u2014revealed she should have been prosecuted although Comey lacked the courage to see it through. (On October 28 th under pressure from newly discovered emails he reopened the investigation.) \\nAs Simon warned, Democrats nominated an illegal candidate who should have been tried for breaking the law. Trump reiterated that Hillary shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to run. \\nTrump also reading Obama\u2019s law-breaking Yet there\u2019s a deeper, far more powerful story Trump unconsciously hints at \u2014one which terrifies Democrats and the entire political class. \\nTrump demonstrates his subtle super-intel instincts. He\u2019s far ahead of the media\u2019s conscious take. Deep down, Trump focused on Barack Obama who facilitated Hillary Clinton\u2019s violation of the law in her email scandal. \\nTrump alludes to a far more significant rule of law issue. His super-intel continues asking the greatest question regarding the legality of any presidential election in U.S. history: the question of Obama\u2019s citizenship in 2008 and 2012. \\nFrom 2008 to 2015, Donald Trump stood strong, demonstrating presidential-type leadership by insisting on respect for the Constitution. He questioned Obama\u2019s failure to produce evidence of legal U.S. citizenship. When Obama produced his alleged birth certificate under pressure in 2011, Trump was aware that Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s panel of document examiners declared it a phony . \\nThe media buried the issue. Reporters abused millions of Americans, including Trump, by labeling them racist conspiracy theorists\u2014a basic projection reflecting that the PC media was itself \u201cenabling the Obama conspiracy\u201d at the expense of our Constitution. \\nDon\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s no longer a birther. Only recently, to avoid media harassment, did he claim that he accepted Obama\u2019s U.S. citizenship. But besides the birth issue, Trump saw that Obama continually functioned as an illegal president . To America\u2019s detriment he repeatedly violated laws on a whim, for example by ignoring immigration laws. \\nWhen Obama continually neglected to protect America\u2019s national security, Trump confronted him. Trump recognized Obama had increasingly enabled Islamic terrorists while simultaneously building up terrorist Iran, even giving them a nuclear bomb on a layaway plan and cash money to boot. \\nFollowing the June 11, 2016 Orlando massacre perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist, Trump confronted Obama, observing that Obama wouldn\u2019t identify the enemy\u2014call them by their name, \u201cIslamic terrorists\u201d\u2014and Trump suggested Obama unconsciously knew the many reasons he should resign the presidency. \\nOn the surface, Obama became enraged, but unconsciously Trump elicited from Obama the most shocking confession imaginable. Secretly Obama wants the truth known. \\nOn the heels of Trump\u2019s challenge, Obama explained between the lines of two speeches on June 12 and 14, that he was truly a mind-controlled Stockholm Syndrome prisoner of radical Islam, programmed at an early age in his own home. \\nThe decoded details are described in my book, The Stockholm Syndrome President, How Trump Triggered Obama\u2019s Hidden Confession . \\nAs he intuitively put together the story of his life, Obama learned the horrifying family secret that his Muslim father had wanted him aborted. \\n(My scientific forensic profiling approach confirmed that Obama\u2019s super-intel imagery pointed toward a near abortion which matched his life\u2019s circumstances including a promiscuous 17 year-old mother unexpectedly pregnant from a casual affair.) \\nHis father had also emotionally \u201ckilled him\u201d by abandoning him. Obama felt that pain on a daily basis, and then he learned that his father physically abused his mother and two later wives in Kenya. \\nThe near-death by abortion and constant death experience at the hands of his anti-American Muslim father became fixated in Obama\u2019s mind. He became frozen in terror\u2014suffering a deep early-childhood trauma\u2014terrified that his father would kill him at any moment. \\nWhen he was a child, his father was radical Islam to him\u2014both one and the same. To stay alive Obama became an unconscious Stockholm Syndrome victim controlled by Islam\u2014explaining his repeated capitulations to them as president and his curious refusal to use that term. \\nObama\u2019s Stockholm Syndrome remains buried deep in his psyche. Only his unconscious super-intel can tell his story in its psycholinguistic language. In his recent speeches, he unknowingly confessed in key images such as \u201cdoing the terrorists\u2019 work for them\u201d or key denials \u201cthen the terrorists would win. I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d \\nBut Obama further confessed in his June 14 speech, that he was programmed as \u201ca radical Islam mole\u201d to carry out a major robbery from America\u2014 first by stealing the rule of law and running as an illegal president. \\nIn fact, Obama has robbed America in many ways: economically with massive debt and hampering business; robbed us of our borders with massive illegal immigration; of gains in racial harmony; of safe communities, of police safety, of inner city safety, of affordable health care, of military power and of our world leadership role. All the while his policies have strengthened terrorist Iran and radical Islam. \\nNow return to Trump\u2019s threatened refusal to accept the election results. Consider his brilliant super-intel message to the media: \u201cYou keep America in suspense about how you avoid the rule of law both with Hillary Clinton and especially Obama, and I will keep you in suspense as to what I\u2019ll do about it.\u201d \\nConsciously Trump may not yet fully appreciate his deeper plans, but he hints at them strongly. \\nIf Trump wins he could appoint a special committee of document examiners to study Obama\u2019s birth certificate. As Obama and Clinton have reversed themselves on gay marriage, Trump could simply change his mind about the need to clarify Obama\u2019s birthplace. \\nBut if Trump loses he could still rise to the occasion by putting rule of law money behind a renewed investigation. He could potentially mobilize an abused citizenry. Rule of law Americans could demand Congress take action and legally obtain Obama\u2019s birth records\u2014as Obama himself, the traumatized child, has unconsciously encouraged. Obama\u2019s super-intel, like Trump\u2019s and all others, fully espouses the rule of law. And the need for America to re-embrace its moral compass is the most significant story of the election of 2016. Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .
