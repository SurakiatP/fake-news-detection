Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \u2018Do what thou wilt\u2019 or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati, an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or \u2018light bringer\u2019), he has given the sect priceless publicity. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Aleister Crowley, who was born into an upper-class British family in 1875, styled himself as \u2018the Great Beast 666\u2019. He was an unabashed occultist who, prior to his death in 1947, revelled in his infamy as \u2018the wickedest man in the world\u2019. \\n\u201cAnd he was withdrawn from them about a stone\u2019s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\u201d Luke 22:41,42 (KJV) \\nHis form of worship involved sadomasochistic sex rituals with men and women, spells which he claimed could raise malevolent gods and the use of hard drugs, including opium, cocaine, heroin and mescaline. \\nCrowley\u2019s motto \u2014 perpetuated by OTO ( Ordo Templi Orientis ), \u2014 was \u2018do what thou wilt\u2019. And it is this individualistic approach that has led to a lasting fascination among artists and celebrities. Led Zeppelin\u2019s Jimmy Page, for example, routinely took part in occult magical rituals and was so intrigued by Crowley he bought his former home, Boleskine House, on the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland. And there are now OTO lodges scattered around the country, practising the same ceremonial rituals and spreading the word of Crowley. Jay-Z and Beyonce are leading the way \\nOther celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z , who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley\u2019s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \u2018Do what thou wilt\u2019 or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati , an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or \u2018light bringer\u2019), he has given the sect priceless publicity. \\nHis clothing line , Rocawear , is shot through with OTO imagery such as the \u2018all seeing eye\u2019 in a triangle, the \u2018eye of Horus\u2019 (an ancient Egyptian symbol frequently referenced in occult texts) and the head of Baphomet (the horned, androgynous idol of\\u2009Western occultism). Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles admits demon possession by Sasha Fierce: \\nSome conspiracy theorists have seized on this as evidence that he is a member of a secret Masonic movement which they believe permeates the highest levels of business and government. Others take a more pragmatic view: that it is commercial opportunism, cashing in on impressionable teens\u2019 attraction to the \u2018edginess\u2019 of occult symbolism. Yet OTO is much more than a marketing opportunity for attention-seeking celebs. It is a living religion, with adherents still practising occult rituals set out by Crowley in his books. \\nThis week I tracked down John Bonner, 62, the head of OTO in the UK, to his home in East Sussex. He told me: \u2018We are not a mass-appeal sort of organisation \u2014 in the UK we number in our hundreds. Worldwide it\u2019s thousands. Hillary Clinton gets in formation with Jay Z and Beyonce: \\nCelebrities are not always a boon or a benefit. \u2018We are used to being misunderstood. Many stories about Crowley, like people saying he filed his teeth down into fangs, are nonsense. \\n\u2018YOU COULD CALL US A SEX CULT IN A WAY, BECAUSE WE RECOGNISE, ACCEPT AND ADORE THE WHOLE PROCESS WHICH GOES TOWARDS MAKING TANGIBLE THE PREVIOUSLY INTANGIBLE.\u2019 According to adherents of OTO it takes years of study before you can begin to understand what the religion is about \u2014 much like the equally controversial Church of Scientology. \\nA former FBI agent , Ted Gundersen, who investigated Satanic circles in LA, found that Crowley\u2019s teachings about \u2018raising demons to do one\u2019s bidding\u2019 suggested human sacrifice, preferably of \u2018an intelligent young boy\u2019. \\nJohn Bonner is dismissive of any idea that he and his fellow believers would even begin to countenance such excesses, pointing out that his is the only religion that sends people a letter of congratulations when they decide to leave (\u2018because they are exercising free will, which is what we\u2019re all about\u2019). \\nBut he accepts many people may not be able to deal with Crowley\u2019s complex teachings. \\n\u2018You\u2019re not supposed to just jump straight in to it. It takes time and study, but our rituals are not for public consumption. You need to join us and go through the initiation process before you can begin to understand. \u2018But according to our beliefs we can\u2019t turn anyone away. So if you are over 18, are passably sane and are free to attend initiations, then you have an undeniable right of membership.\u2019 source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
