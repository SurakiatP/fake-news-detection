[The Times\u2018 Jeremy W. Peters  \u2014   normally one of its more credible journalists  \u2014   reported that a tweet by Jack Posobiec led Breitbart News and other conservative outlets to conclude  \u2014   falsely, in its view  \u2014   that Comey had exonerated President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, under oath.  \u201cMr. Posobiec wrote on May 17 that Mr. Comey, the recently ousted F. B. I. director, had \u2018said under oath that Trump did not ask him to halt any investigation\u2019,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cIt mattered little that Mr. Comey had said no such thing. The tweet quickly ricocheted through the ecosystem of fake news and disinformation on the far right, where Trump partisans like Mr. Posobiec have intensified their efforts to sow doubt about the legitimacy of expanding investigations into Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. The Times included Breitbart News in that \u201cecosystem,\u201d citing an article at Breitbart News that mentioned Posobiec\u2019s tweet. But the Breitbart article was careful to note that Comey\u2019s testimony on May 8 had not responded specifically to a question about whether Trump himself had asked him to stop an investigation. It did draw the inference that Comey\u2019s comment could have included Trump  \u2014   but was precise in its language: \u201cAlthough Sen. Mazie Hirono ( ) didn\u2019t specifically ask about Trump in the question she posed to Comey, the inquiry was about whether or not he had experienced having a higher authority stop an FBI investigation. \u201d The inference is not the only possible one  \u2014   but neither is the inference that the Times prefers to draw against Trump, and to present as established fact. The Breitbart headline also did not specifically mention Trump. Comey did not volunteer any information about Trump during that testimony. He only accused Trump of having asked him to stop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn  \u2014   by allegedly expressing a \u201chope\u201d  \u2014   once Comey had been fired.
