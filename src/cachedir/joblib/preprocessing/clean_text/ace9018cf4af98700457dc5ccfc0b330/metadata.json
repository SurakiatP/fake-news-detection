Worse still, there may be reason to suspect he was fed the question in advance and gave a premeditated, Machiavellian answer. \\nWhile talking to actress and rapper Gina Rodriguez on the Latin-oriented YouTube channel MiTu, Obama was asked, \u201cMany of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, um, citizens \u2014 and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country \u2014 are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?\u201d Here was Obama\u2019s answer (video below): \\nNot true. And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself \u2014 and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for.'"}, "time": 1742562300.6173549}
