It was unclear what Mr. Kushner, who has been expanding his reach in his   \u2019s administration, planned to gain from the trip. Mr. Kushner, 36, who serves as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, was invited by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Navy Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for the chairman, said early Monday that the general had arrived in Iraq for meetings, including with coalition officials, accompanied by Mr. Kushner and Thomas P. Bossert, the president\u2019s homeland security adviser. The general invited Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bossert to accompany him \u201cto receive an update on the status of the   campaign in Iraq and Syria,\u201d Captain Hicks said. Mr. Kushner is \u201ctraveling on behalf of the president to express the president\u2019s support and commitment to the government of Iraq and U. S. personnel currently engaged in the campaign\u201d against the Islamic State, Captain Hicks added. Mr. Trump has repeatedly turned to Mr. Kushner as an envoy to foreign leaders, at times creating a parallel structure to the one led by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Kushner has had a role in discussions with Mexico, whose government officials have expressed concern over Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks on trade policy and his vow to build a wall at the border. The president has also charged Mr. Kushner, who has no previous government or diplomatic experience, with a vague edict to establish peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Kushner is also taking the lead in preparing the West Wing for Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting this week with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at    the president\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla. In addition, Mr. Kushner has created an Office of American Innovation, which is intended to use ideas from the business world to improve the government.'"}, "time": 1742628397.366562}
