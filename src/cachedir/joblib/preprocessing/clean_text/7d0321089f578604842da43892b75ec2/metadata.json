The scenes were unremarkable, and that was the point: Mr. Wong and other members of the Add Oil Team, an artists\u2019 collective, were broadcasting the videos of people engaged in activities that did not include voting as a critique of an unrepresentative political process. \u201cNo Election in Hong Kong Now,\u201d the title of their Facebook Live stream said. The Add Oil Team plans to turn the videos into a   work that could be exhibited in a gallery. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s an angry protest gesture, it\u2019s also kind of peaceful,\u201d Mr. Wong said, flanked by laptops and coffee cups in a minimalist design studio. Nearly three years ago, this semiautonomous Chinese city of 7. 3 million was roiled by months of   protests, known as Occupy Central or the Umbrella Movement, that stoked an existential debate over its political future. The protests ended without achieving their goal of greater public participation in the election of Hong Kong\u2019s leader, and several organizers now face criminal charges. In July, Hong Kong will inaugurate its new leader, Carrie Lam, Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate, as the former British colony commemorates the 20th anniversary of its handover to Chinese rule. All of that leaves local artists struggling to find meaning in the city\u2019s upheavals, art professionals said in interviews. And while some of their recent works are more overtly political than others, many are infused with a sense of helplessness toward what is widely seen here as the city\u2019s increasing subjugation to Beijing\u2019s authoritarianism. \u201cThe expression of frustration, or the acceptance of failure, could be the key words of the artwork which reacts to the Umbrella Movement,\u201d said Chow Chun Fai, who paints scenes from films in which characters comment on Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with the mainland. \u201cThree years ago, we had to be very quick and loud\u201d during the street protests, he added. But recent artwork is \u201cmore sentimental, and we have the distance to tell the story and to listen to the story. \u201d Artists and curators in Hong Kong say that some of the themes coursing through local art have been present for decades. But the 2014 protests, they say, were an important catalyst for many artists, particularly those who came of age in this century. \u201cSomehow the Umbrella Movement unfolded a lot of layers of the political and social problems\u201d that Hong Kong faces, said Clara Cheung, a   of CG Artpartment, an art space in the Kowloon district. Recent artworks that address Hong Kong politics vary widely in message and delivery. Some are intended for public spaces, rather than commercial galleries, and feature loaded commentaries on the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that guarantees the city its civil liberties and a high degree of autonomy until 2047. A prominent example is the   light show Mr. Wong and Jason Lam mounted last year that counted down the seconds until \u201cone country, two systems\u201d was due to expire. The display was exhibited across the face of Hong Kong\u2019s tallest skyscraper to coincide with a visit by Zhang Dejiang, a member of China\u2019s governing Politburo Standing Committee  \u2014   but pulled after the artists explained its subversive message. In a similar vein, \u201cControlling Device,\u201d by Kacey Wong, shows a pair of nooses, one bronzed, and one coated in red wax. Mr. Wong has said the piece is a commentary on recent crackdowns on free expression in Hong Kong, including the apparent abductions of several prominent booksellers to the mainland in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting a war that we cannot win, so how to fight it?\u201d Mr. Wong asked on a recent afternoon in his studio. \u201cYou fight it with grace. \u201d Other artworks comment on Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with Beijing in more roundabout ways. Ocean Leung, for example, incorporates police and   political banners into   works that intentionally distort the banners\u2019 original messages. The works are not overtly   and Mr. Leung said that his art illustrated how difficult it was to take clear positions on political questions. \u201cIt\u2019s an embrace of failure,\u201d he said. Similarly oblique commentaries run through \u201cBreathing Space: Contemporary Art From Hong Kong,\u201d an   show on view through July 9 at the Hong Kong Center of the Asia Society, which in November canceled a planned screening of a documentary about the Umbrella Movement, citing political concerns. One piece, \u201cDefense and Resistance,\u201d by South Ho, shows photos of the artist walling and then unwalling himself in with bricks marked with \u201cMade in Xianggang,\u201d the word for Hong Kong in Mandarin, the mainland\u2019s dominant tongue. The bricks are also stacked up in the center of the gallery, with a chunk missing, and it is unclear whether the wall is structurally sound  \u2014   a possible metaphor for Beijing\u2019s power over the city. An especially haunting work, \u201cIf the Moment Came,\u201d is a   black box with a top made of wired glass and a murky interior that shows a looping video of a hand playing with a kendama, a Japanese toy featuring a wooden handle and a small ball. The artist, Chlo\u00eb Cheuk, said that she created the installation after making an audio recording of boys playing with kendamas at one of the 2014 protest sites. She added the wired glass, she said, as a reference to protesters who smashed a window at the Legislative Council complex around the same time. Ms. Cheuk, 27, said that the ball\u2019s inevitable failure to break through the glass was intended to evoke the feeling of helplessness that she said was now familiar to many young Hong Kongers. But that feeling transcends politics, she said, and her artistic practice is primarily guided by her emotions. \u201cWhen people see my work, they can respond because they can really feel it,\u201d she said on a recent evening in Yau Tong, an industrial area in eastern Kowloon. \u201cThey feel that they\u2019ve been understood. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562965.1178138}
