One is pro-gun, while the other is anti-gun. One believes global warming is a hoax, and the other claims the science is settled. One wants to build a wall, while the other is essentially for opening the borders. One believes in a traditional marriage between one man and one woman, while the other supports same-sex marriage. And the list goes on and on. \\n\\nEach of these issues is certainly important and should be considered before making a final decision on who to vote for in November. \\n\\nHowever, for those who follow prophecy, this upcoming election goes beyond that. Knowing that a world government is prophesied for the near future, one area that we are following closely is the ongoing process of globalization. (moving toward a global governing system) \\n\\nIt is possible that this upcoming election will set the course of the United States of America on a path toward either full involvement or total dissention from this prophesied world government. If everyone understood the prophecies concerning the future global political authority, the entire election would be determined on that issue alone. That is why we chose to devote an entire article to that subject in this magazine. \\n\\nAnd yes, one candidate is vehemently opposed to globalization, while the other supports it in every way. \\n\\nSince the next President of the United States will serve at least a four-year term, and quite possibly eight, we thought it would be important to let you see where each candidate stands on the important issues. \\n\\nWhy? With all the prophecies converging at the same time, it is likely that the next president will be in office during some of the most significant prophetic fulfillments concerning the end time. \\n\\nAlthough there are more technical issues at hand (i.e. taxes, infrastructure, job creation, etc.), these do not necessarily show the character of an individual. That is why we have chosen the more defining topics which let us see the person behind the persona. In our opinion, these are the most critical. \\n\\nTherefore, instead of giving you my opinion, I will let the candidates speak for themselves\u2026 Abortion \\nTrump: Pro-Life \\n\\nAre you pro-life? Mr. Trump, \u201cYes\u2026It\u2019s an issue. I mean it\u2019s an issue, and it\u2019s a strong issue\u2026What I am saying is this: With caveats \u2013 life of the mother, incest, rape. That\u2019s where I stand. So, I\u2019m pro-life, but with the caveats. You have to have it with the caveats.\u201d Pregnancy outside of those caveats? Mr. Trump stated, \u201cIt depends why?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m, pro-life\u2026very simple, pro-life.\u201d [i] \\n\\n\u201c\u2026friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn\u2019t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.\u201d [ii] \\n\\nClinton: Pro-Choice \\n\\n\u201cPoliticians have no business interfering with women\u2019s personal health decisions. I will oppose efforts to roll back women\u2019s access to reproductive health care, including Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. As president, I\u2019ll stand up for Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s access to critical health services, including safe, legal abortion,\u201d [iii] \\n\\n\u201cThe unborn person doesn\u2019t have constitutional rights.\u201d [iv] \\n\\n\u201cI believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion, not just in principle, but in practice.\u201d [v] Climate Change \\nTrump: \u201cIt\u2019s a Hoax\u2026\u201d \\n\\nOn December 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., \u201cObama\u2019s talking about all of this with the global warming and\u2026a lot of it\u2019s a hoax. It\u2019s a hoax. I mean, it\u2019s a money-making industry, okay? It\u2019s a hoax, a lot of it.\u201d [vi] \\n\\nIn an \u201cEnergy Policy\u201d speech in North Dakota on May 26, 2016 Trump stated, \u201c\u2026rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan\u2026We\u2019re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\u201d [vii] \\n\\n\u201cThere has been a big push to develop alternative forms of energy\u2013so-called green energy\u2013from renewable sources. That\u2019s a big mistake. To begin with, the whole push for renewable energy is being driven by the wrong motivation, the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions. If you don\u2019t buy that\u2013and I don\u2019t\u2013then what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.\u201d [viii] \\n\\nClinton: The Science is Settled. \\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that people running for president refuse to believe the settled science of climate change.\u201d [ix] \\n\\n\u201cI believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.\u201d [x] \\n\\n\u201cGo talk to a scientist!\u201d she said. \u201cI really am tired of the debate, which is a phony debate. Climate change is real. It is here. It has to be dealt with.\u201d [xi] Gun Control \\nTrump: Pro-Gun \\n\\n\u201cThe Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period\u2026The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right that belongs to all law-abiding Americans. The Constitution doesn\u2019t create that right \u2013 it ensures that the government can\u2019t take it away. Our Founding Fathers knew, and our Supreme Court has upheld, that the Second Amendment\u2019s purpose is to guarantee our right to defend ourselves and our families. This is about self-defense, plain and simple\u2026It\u2019s been said that the Second Amendment is America\u2019s first freedom. That\u2019s because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment.\u201d [xii] \\n\\nClinton: Anti-Gun \\n\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos asked, \u201cDo you believe that an individual\u2019s right to bear arms is a constitutional right; that it\u2019s not linked to service in a militia?\u201d Mrs. Clinton replied, \u201cI think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice (Antonin) Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right \u2013 as we do with every amendment \u2013 to impose reasonable regulations. So I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment\u2026But I\u2019m going to continue to speak out for comprehensive background checks; closing the gun show loophole; closing the online loophole; closing the so-called Charleston loophole; reversing the bill that Sen. (Bernie) Sanders voted for and I voted against, giving immunity from liability to gun makers and sellers. I think all of that can and should be done, and it is, in my view, consistent with the Constitution.\u201d [xiii] \\n\\n\u201cWhen it comes to guns, we have just too many guns,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOn the streets, in our homes, in our neighborhoods.\u201d [xiv] \\n\\n\u201cI am not here to make promises I can\u2019t keep. I am here to tell you I will use every single minute of every day, if I am so fortunate enough to be your president, looking for ways that we can save lives, that we can change the gun culture\u2026It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun to settle their problems. It makes no sense.\u201d [xv] \\n\\n\u201cI was proud when my husband took [the National Rifle Association] on, and we were able to ban assault weapons, but he had to put a sunset on so, 10 years later, of course [President George W.] Bush wouldn\u2019t agree to reinstate them\u2026We\u2019ve got to go after this\u2026And here again, the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.\u201d [xvi] \\n\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work, but certainly the Australia example is worth looking at,\u201d Clinton said at a New Hampshire town hall\u2026The Australian program reduced the number of firearms in circulation by implementing a gun buy-back plan for citizens. [xvii] Immigration \\nTrump: \u201cI will Build a Great, Great Wall\u2026\u201d \\n\\n\u201cYou cannot have\u2026illegal immigration. You don\u2019t have a country if you have that\u2026As has been stated continuously in the press, people are pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants. This must be stopped and it must be stopped now.\u201d [xviii] \\n\\n\u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d [xix] \\n\\nMr. Trump responded to a question on mass deportation: \u201cNo, I would not call it mass deportations\u2026We\u2019re going to do it (deport illegals) in a very humane fashion. Believe me. I have a bigger heart than you do. We\u2019re going to do it in a very humane fashion\u2026I want terrorists out. I want people that have bad thoughts out. I would limit specific terrorist countries, and we know who those terrorist countries are.\u201d [xx] \\n\\nClinton: \u201cWe will not Build a Wall.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cWe will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one. And we\u2019ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy\u2026I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out.\u201d [xxi] \\n\\n\u201cIn 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER (sic) Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.\u201d [xxii] \\n\\nMrs. Clinton made this statement concerning Syrian refugees: \u201cWe\u2019re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more\u2026I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 (incoming refugees) and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.\u201d [xxiii] \\n\\n\u201cI would stop (deportations) of the undocumented (illegal) people living in our country,\u201d Clinton responded. \u201cI do not want to see them deported\u2026I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That\u2019s exactly what I will do.\u201d [xxiv] \\n\\n\u201cYou can count on me to defend President Obama\u2019s executive actions on DACA and DAPA when I am president,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Obama\u2019s 2012 (DACA) and 2014 (DAPA) executive amnesties, which gave work permits and access to federal benefits to millions of illegal immigrants. [xxv] Obamacare \\nTrump: \u201c\u2026Repeal and Replace Obamacare\u2026\u201d \\n\\nSpeaking at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January 2015, Mr. Trump stated, \u201cSomeone has to repeal and replace Obamacare\u2026 (Obamacare is) a total catastrophe. It kicks in in 2016 and it will be a disaster. People are closing shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend who was a doctor and he says he has more accountants than patients. He needs that because it is complicated and terrible.\u201d [xxvi] \\n\\n\u201cWe are going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better.\u201d [xxvii] \\n\\nClinton: \u201cI will Defend the Affordable Care Act\u2026\u201d \\n\\n\u201cI will defend the Affordable Care Act, but as president I want to go further\u2026I want to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.\u201d [xxviii] \\n\\n\u201cYou know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare\u2026\u201dI am a staunch supporter of President Obama\u2019s principal accomplishment, namely the Affordable Care Act.\u201d [xxix] \\n\\nConcerning Obamacare for illegal immigrants: \u201cThere are two steps here. If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act, I support that. If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it. However, it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that\u2026What I do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented (illegal) people to be able to get the health care they need\u2026It\u2019s not only the right and moral thing to do for them. It\u2019s also important that we keep ourselves healthy, and public health requires that. So I see this as a two-step process.\u201d [xxx] Warrantless Surveillance/Database \\nTrump: Bulk Data Collection is Fine \\n\\nMr. Trump said that he would be \u201cfine\u201d with restoring provisions of the Patriot Act to allow for the bulk data collection. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that would be fine,\u201d Trump said. [xxxi] \\n\\nMr. Trump also told the Daily Signal , \u201cI support legislation which allows the NSA to hold the bulk metadata. For oversight, I propose that a court, which is available any time on any day, is created to issue individual rulings on when this metadata can be accessed.\u201d [xxxii] \\n\\nClinton: Does not Regret Her Vote on Patriot Act \\n\\nConcerning plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers: \u201cWe already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out\u2026That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed an \u2018intelligence surge\u2019 to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.\u201d [xxxiii] \\n\\nDuring the Democratic Presidential debate on October 13, 2015 Anderson Cooper asked: \u201cGovernor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You\u2019ve emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign\u2026Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?\u201d \\n\\nClinton replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security. It\u2019s not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind.\u201d [xxxiv] \\n\\n\u201cWell, the NSA has to act lawfully. And we as a country have to decide what the rules are. And then we have to make it absolutely clear that we\u2019re going to hold them accountable. What we had because of post-9/11 legislation was a lot more flexibility than I think people really understood, and was not explained to them.\u201d [xxxv] Real ID/National ID'"}, "time": 1742562985.2117834}
