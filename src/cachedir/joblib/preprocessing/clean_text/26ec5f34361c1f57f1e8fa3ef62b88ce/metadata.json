But that record may be weakened or overturned by   Donald J. Trump, who has denigrated many of President Obama\u2019s policies. Here is a look at how the secretary and the   see the major foreign policy issues differently. Kerry: Mr. Kerry praised the 2015 deal that the United States brokered with Iran to curtail that country\u2019s ability to produce nuclear weapons. Mr. Kerry wrote that before the deal was struck, Iran was less than \u201c90 days away from having the material necessary to produce one nuclear weapon,\u201d but \u201ctoday they are at least a year away. \u201d He wrote on Thursday, \u201cIn reaching and implementing this deal, we took a major security threat off the table without firing a single shot. \u201d Trump: Mr. Trump made criticism of the nuclear deal a major talking point of his foreign policy in the presidential campaign. He has called the agreement \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated. \u201d At a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, he said, \u201cMy No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. \u201d Later, he said he would renegotiate the agreement. Kerry: The secretary said that the United States tried to reset relations with Russia early in President Obama\u2019s first term, but that a series of aggressions including \u201cunprecedented cyber intrusions,\u201d \u201cmilitary intervention in Syria,\u201d and the \u201cillegal occupation\u201d of Ukraine impeded that effort. Trump: Mr. Trump has made improved relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a cornerstone of his future foreign policy. After American intelligence agencies provided evidence that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee systems to help tip the election in his favor, Mr. Trump criticized the reliability of the intelligence community. He has praised Mr. Putin and said he would work closely with him to combat the Islamic State. Mr. Trump also seemed to upend American nuclear weapons policy when he declared in December: \u201cLet it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all. \u201d Kerry: Mr. Kerry devoted a significant portion of his memo to climate change, calling it \u201cnot just a threat to the future of our planet, but a growing and immediate threat to our national security. \u201d He lauded an agreement struck between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, which bolstered a global climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 that he called the most \u201cambitious, inclusive climate agreement ever negotiated. \u201d Trump: Mr. Trump has called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d said he would \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris accords and vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cin almost every form. \u201d His nominee to run that agency is Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry, who has led the legal battle against Mr. Obama\u2019s   policies. Kerry: Though the Obama administration never fulfilled a promise to shutter the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention center, Mr. Kerry wrote that \u201dno single action would do more to reaffirm our commitment to international human rights norms and remove a recruiting tool for terrorists than closing\u201d the site. During Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, the number of detainees decreased to 59 from 242, with 20 approved for transfer. Trump: In a message posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cThere should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield. \u201d Kerry: \u201cIt would be a moral failing of the highest caliber to turn our backs on those in need  \u2014   including and especially from countries like Syria and Iraq,\u201d Mr. Kerry wrote, adding that the United States had a \u201cprofound responsibility to help refugees. \u201d Trump: After the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. in December 2015, Mr. Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. \u201d Later in the campaign, he said: \u201cWe must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628579.9613647}
