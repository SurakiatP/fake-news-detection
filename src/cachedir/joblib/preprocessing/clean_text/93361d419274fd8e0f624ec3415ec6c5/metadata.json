Despite clear evidence of war crimes, racketeering, perjury, and Hillary\u2019s email scandal, along with suspicion of murder, and who knows what else, they\u2019re heading back to the White House in January. Electoral rigging virtually assures it. FBI director James Comey\u2019s announced revisiting of Hillary\u2019s use of her private email server to maintain and send classified information won\u2019t derail her presidential bid. .. Last July, Comey whitewashed her criminality \u2013 serious enough to send ordinary people to prison. At the time, Trump was right, saying she \u201ccompromised the safety of the American people by storing highly classified information on a private email server with no security.\u201d .. \u201cOur adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on (her), and this fact alone disqualified her from service.\u201d She was caught red-handed lying to the FBI and Congress \u2013 claiming she didn\u2019t use her home server to maintain or send classified information. Comey confirmed over 100 emails were classified when sent, including top secret ones \u2013 maybe hundreds more we haven\u2019t heard about or not yet discovered. .. Deleting thousands of emails compounded her criminality. Yet her road to the White House remains on track. Still, Comey\u2019s Friday announcement was astonishing, less than two weeks before November\u2019s election, an unprecedented act Trump will try using to his advantage \u2013 though likely no more successfully than earlier. .. Comey\u2019s letter was disturbingly vague, suggesting having absolved Hillary\u2019s criminality once, he\u2019ll do it again. Announced \u201cinvestigative steps\u201d take time \u2013 likely concluding next year after November\u2019s election and January\u2019s inauguration. Here\u2019s his letter to FBI employees explaining his action: .. \u201cThis morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case.\u201d .. \u201cBecause those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.\u201d .. \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d .. \u201cAt the same time, however, given that we don\u2019t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don\u2019t want to create a misleading impression.\u201d .. \u201cIn trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.\u201d Judicial Watch (JW) has done important work, trying to have Hillary held accountable for her scandalous email practices \u2013 criminality without punishment so far, unlikely to change ahead, especially if she\u2019s anointed in November to succeed Obama, a near-certainty as things now stand. .. In response to Comey\u2019s announcement, JW president Tom Fitton issued the following statement: .. \u201c The FBI\u2019s seeming decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information is astonishing. Once again, we suspect our Freedom of Information Act and other investigations have spurred the FBI to act. This decision highlights the corruption, favoritism, and incompetence in the FBI/Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton.\u201d .. Her \u201cemail misconduct and lies, aided and abetted by the Obama administration, have created a national crisis. The FBI needs to disclose more information about what it found and when \u2013 the American voters deserve answers now.\u201d .. \u201cJudicial Watch helped break open the Clinton email scandal and, no matter what the FBI does, will independently continue its historic litigation and investigation.\u201d U S voters go to the polls in 10 days. Millions already voted in advance. Things were likely rigged way ahead of November 8. Hillary is the establishment choice. Power brokers running America picked her last year to succeed Obama. Trump surprisingly emerged last man standing among a deplorable array of GOP aspirants, resembling a police lineup \u2013 or an FBI most wanted list. .. Bill and Hillary Clinton belong in prison, not high office for a third co-presidential term. Given everything publicly known, they remain irreparably tainted, a disturbing indictment of a political process too debauched to fix. Voters have no say over who leads them. Powerful interests decide everything. Democracy in America is pure fantasy, not the real thing. .. The only solution is grassroots revolution. Nothing else can work.
