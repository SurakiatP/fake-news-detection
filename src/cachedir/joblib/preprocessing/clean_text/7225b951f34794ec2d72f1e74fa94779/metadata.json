Joyner, a prolific art collector and supporter of artists of African descent, invited her on a trip to Washington to visit the studio of the Color Field painter Sam Gilliam. They looked at Mr. Gilliam\u2019s   pieces, a series of striking works with a thin stream of paint poured on board. Ms. Wagstaff knew the Met owned a Gilliam work, \u201cLeah\u2019s Renoir\u201d (1979) somewhere in its collection, and the visit \u201cprompted me to take a second look at it. \u201d Later, Ms. Joyner donated money to buy another Gilliam, \u201cWhirlirama\u201d (1970) and next year there are plans to exhibit both when the Met reinstalls its modern collection. \u201cPamela is such an informed champion of her artists,\u201d Ms. Wagstaff said. That trip to Washington was one of the many ways that Ms. Joyner, 58, exerts her power as an   influence behind the scenes. She has relinquished a successful business career to become what she calls a   \u201c \u201d collector of a very specific niche: Abstract art by   and members of the global African diaspora. Now she leverages her relationships with the Met in New York, the Tate in London, the Art Institute in Chicago and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to help these artists gain traction in the wider world. \u201cIt\u2019s no less ambitious than an effort to reframe art history,\u201d said Ms. Joyner, who sees herself as righting a wrong. \u201cFirst, to include more broadly those who have been overlooked  \u2014   and, for those with visibility, to steward and contextualize those careers. \u201d When art collectors publish a book on their treasures, they often include a glamour shot of themselves surrounded by myriad works. But in \u201cFour Generations: The   Collection of Abstract Art,\u201d edited by Courtney J. Martin and published last month by Gregory R. Miller, there is no picture of Ms. Joyner anywhere. Instead, there are academic essays by curators and writers, with only a short \u201cquestion and answer\u201d segment with Ms. Joyner and her husband, Alfred J. Giuffrida. \u201cThat\u2019s very deliberate,\u201d Ms. Joyner said recently over coffee in Chelsea. \u201cThe focus is on the artists. \u201d Ms. Joyner, who is based in San Francisco but keeps an apartment in New York, founded and ran a private equity marketing company called Avid Partners. She started the collection 20 years ago and now adds to it with Mr. Giuffrida, an investment executive whom she married in 2004. Her trove, more than 300 works, begins in the 1940s and goes up to \u201cyesterday,\u201d Ms. Joyner said, encompassing four generations. Her definition of \u201cAfrican descent\u201d has broadened to include William Kentridge, the white South African artist whose work has been in Ms. Joyner\u2019s sights for some time. She just acquired her first Kentridge piece the other week in London. As an   woman in the corridors of establishment power  \u2014   an education at Dartmouth and Harvard, and then an entrepreneurial career  \u2014   she said she knew the feeling of being an outlier. \u201cI\u2019ve operated in environments where some people would construe me to be unusual,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am stitched together in a way that I find myself doing things that aren\u2019t necessarily expected. So I relate to that journey. \u201d The book\u2019s most telling photograph is from 1950, when Abstract Expressionists gathered in New York to discuss their work. Some were famous  \u2014   Willem de Kooning and Robert Motherwell  \u2014   but the black painter Norman Lewis ( ) whose work Ms. Joyner collects, was also there. \u201cHe\u2019s literally at the table, but he gets written out of that history,\u201d Ms. Joyner said. \u201cHis first monograph was only published last year. \u201d She explained some of the factors that kept black artists from gaining a foothold, especially in the 1960s and \u201970s. \u201cFor a long time, the art world wanted black artists to do black subject matter,\u201d she said. \u201cArt was a political tool. People were viewed as not part of the struggle if they were doing abstraction. \u201d About 100 artists are in her collection, and Ms. Joyner referred to Lewis and the Washington Color School painter Alma Thomas ( ) as the \u201cAdam and Eve\u201d of the group, stylistically begetting the later generations. (Thomas is the subject of an exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem through Oct. 30.) Ms. Joyner\u2019s largest holding, more than a dozen works, is of works by Mr. Gilliam, who is 82. She also owns pieces by successful midcareer artists like Kara Walker, Glenn Ligon and Mark Bradford, and is scouting out new talents. The   artists she is tracking include the Conceptual sculptor Kevin Beasley Hugo McCloud, who uses nontraditional materials in his paintings and Samuel Levi Jones, best known for his   works on canvas. The Los Angeles artist Charles Gaines, whose Abstract and Conceptual work is in her collection, said that \u201cFour Generations\u201d crystallized his longtime thinking about the context of his work as part of a continuum. \u201cPamela\u2019s book is the first legitimate academic effort to theorize some of this material,\u201d Mr. Gaines, 72, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pioneering effort. \u201d About 60 works from the   collection will tour in a museum show, \u201cSolidary and Solitary,\u201d beginning next fall at the Ogden Museum in New Orleans. Ms. Joyner buys about 30 works a year and has never sold one, she said, although she has donated them to museums. \u201cCollecting is a job for Pamela,\u201d said James Rondeau, director and president of the Art Institute of Chicago, in Ms. Joyner\u2019s hometown, where she is a trustee. Over the years, Ms. Joyner has watched prices rise for many artists she has championed. \u201cOne curator said that I\u2019m my own worst enemy,\u201d she said with a wry smile. Lorna Simpson, an artist Ms. Joyner has collected and now befriended, noted that Ms. Joyner was no longer alone in her interest in the field. \u201cThe market was already starting to move around those pictures when she began,\u201d Ms. Simpson said. \u201cBut she was ahead of it. \u201d Ms. Joyner is the daughter of two teachers, and she used to visit Georges Seurat\u2019s \u201cA Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u201d at the Art Institute after attending ballet class. She noted that her mother moved from Mississippi to Chicago, where she attended her first integrated school. \u201cThere was a keen sense in my household that you had to be prepared for whatever was going to happen,\u201d Ms. Joyner said. \u201cYou needed these literacies, and cultural literacy was one of them. \u201d Ms. Simpson, who also has family roots in Chicago, said she noted a \u201cblack Chicago thing\u201d about Ms. Joyner\u2019s outlook, which she defined as a forthright sense of humor, \u201ca way of seeing the world. \u201d Ms. Joyner does take breaks from collecting. \u201cI have slumber parties with my girlfriends, and that has included Lorna,\u201d she said. So far, she said she was pleased by the reception to \u201cFour Generations,\u201d and had only one fear: that it might be misunderstood. \u201cThe danger of these projects is if people think it\u2019s a politically laden,   exercise,\u201d she said, in explaining that race is not the only lens through which to view art. \u201cThose elements are there, but they are not the drivers. Good art is the driver. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564529.7424202}
