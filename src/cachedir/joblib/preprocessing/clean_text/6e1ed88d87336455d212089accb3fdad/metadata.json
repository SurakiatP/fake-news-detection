He can lay down some fierce heavy metal licks on his electric guitar, a skill that might be given away by the Iron Maiden socks he wears for workouts. His Spanish isn\u2019t bad, either. In many ways, Higashioka grew up a quintessential Californian. But recently he has begun to explore his family\u2019s roots  \u2014   by learning to speak Japanese. \u201cMy dad has always been pressing me to learn,\u201d said Higashioka, a     on his father\u2019s side. \u201cThis spring, finally, I thought maybe I should try. \u201d There was also some pragmatic motivation for Higashioka, a catcher who was elevated to the Yankees\u2019   roster for the first time after a standout 2016 season in the minor leagues: He thought learning Japanese might help him communicate with Masahiro Tanaka, the ace of the Yankees\u2019 pitching staff. And if the Yankees, who have a lengthy history with Japanese players, were to land the   Japan League star Shohei Otani next year? \u201cI thought it could be beneficial for the Yankees to have a catcher who speaks Japanese,\u201d Higashioka said. Higashioka, who picked up some words from his father and has relied on   software, will bounce words off Tanaka and his interpreter, Shingo Horie, who has helped him improve his baseball vocabulary. He also occasionally tosses phrases toward the cadre of Japanese reporters who cover Tanaka. \u201cI mess around with them in Japanese,\u201d Higashioka said. \u201cI say the few things I know to them even if it\u2019s out of context. I\u2019ll tell them I ate eggs this morning because it\u2019s the only stuff I know how to say. \u201d He added: \u201cThe rule of thumb is they don\u2019t really consider you Japanese unless you speak Japanese. I would be a lot more proud of being able to speak because I am part Japanese. \u201d As a beginner in Japanese, Higashioka has modest expectations, but his baseball career might provide a good model for persistence and patience. The Yankees chose Higashioka in the seventh round of the 2008 draft and lured him away from a scholarship to the University of California with a $500, 000 signing bonus. While valued for his catching skills  \u2014   he is regarded as the best pitch framer in an organization that has long prized that skill  \u2014   Higashioka missed almost the entire 2014 season after Tommy John surgery and had never hit much. Until last year. Higashioka, 26, belted 21 home runs last year between Class AA Trenton and Class AAA    trailing only Gary Sanchez, Carlos Beltran, Aaron Judge and Tyler Austin in the organization. He also drove in 81 runs and posted an . 847   plus slugging percentage, about 150 points above his career average. As if to serve as a reminder of last season, Higashioka homered in his first game of spring training. \u201cHe put himself on the map, definitely, with what he did last year,\u201d said Manager Joe Girardi, adding that he believed that Higashioka, who has altered his swing, can continue to hit for power. \u201cWe talked about it when we left spring training last year that he was impacting the ball better than we had ever seen it. We thought he\u2019d hit some home runs, and it turned out that he did. \u201d With Sanchez marked as the Yankees\u2019 catcher of the future and Austin Romine having performed capably as the backup last season, Higashioka will most likely begin the season with   . Spring training, though, is often a valuable time for pitchers and catchers to get to know one another, as catchers seek to learn not only a pitcher\u2019s repertoire but also his personality. Tanaka said he had developed a good working relationship with Sanchez and Romine last season, adding that he hoped to become more familiar with Higashioka this spring. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting on the same page,\u201d Tanaka said through his interpreter. \u201cDuring the game what is important is that we both know what we want to do. If we\u2019re on the same page, when he gives out that sign, that\u2019s exactly what I want. That\u2019s the type of relationship that ultimately you want to get to. We\u2019re working toward that. \u201d While Tanaka uses his interpreter to communicate with his catchers, Higashioka rattled off Tanaka\u2019s pitches in Japanese: sutoreeto (fastball) suraidaa (slider) supuritta (splitter) and kattaa (cutter). He can also ask Tanaka where he wants to throw the pitch: takamei (high) or hikamei (low) nikakoo (inside) or gikakoo (outside). Asked which was better  \u2014   his English or Higashioka\u2019s Japanese  \u2014   Tanaka smiled. \u201cSame,\u201d he said in English. Tanaka was probably being charitable. Still, Anri Uechi, a reporter for The Kyodo News who has covered Tanaka for two years, said any effort to speak Japanese was generally viewed as a sign of respect. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have someone speak your language,\u201d Uechi said. \u201cI know I feel that way maybe Tanaka does, too. \u201d Though Japanese immigrants have settled in Southern California for generations, there are few where Higashioka grew up, so there was little to spark his interest in his family\u2019s heritage. Unlike his father, Ted, a   American, Higashioka did not have any   friends growing up. \u201cWe\u2019re in Huntington Beach,\u201d Ted Higashioka said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a Japanese cultural center here. It was a little more difficult. \u201d Ted Higashioka spent several years as a child in Japan, where his father worked as an oil company executive. But when the family returned to the United States, there was little reason for him to speak Japanese. He wishes he had. He can understand the language but does not feel comfortable speaking it. \u201cMy parents never deterred me from speaking Japanese, but you just feel it,\u201d Ted Higashioka said. \u201cYou want to assimilate a little better. You try to put those things in the background and try to be a little more  . It\u2019s really important for people to hold onto their heritage and language growing up and not be forced to hide something like that. \u201d The family history, like that of many   during World War II, is complicated. While Shigeru Higashioka  \u2014   Ted\u2019s father and Kyle\u2019s grandfather  \u2014   earned a Bronze Star in the Army\u2019s 442nd Infantry Regiment, a mostly   unit that fought in Europe, Shigeru\u2019s parents and other family members were sent to internment camps. \u201cThe feeling I got from my parents was it was no ill feelings,\u201d said Ted Higashioka, who added that his father was extremely proud of his military service. \u201cIt was just a sign of the times. He was just being a good American, but I never heard him be bitter about what happened. I guess, in a way, that was kind of the Japanese way. They just endured it. \u201d Kyle Higashioka said the topic rarely came up. \u201cMy grandparents were quite a bit older than me, so I never really got their perspective on it,\u201d said Higashioka, whose grandfather died 13 years ago. \u201cBy the time I was old enough to understand that stuff, it was too late. \u201d This more recent embrace of his heritage is taking on other forms. If his Japanese is still nascent, Higashioka did a very Japanese thing over the winter: He married in Hawaii. His father also noticed that his older son would leave the last morsel of his dinner on the plate, a form of Japanese etiquette. When this observation was relayed to Higashioka, he smiled, acknowledging that his father was right. \u201cEverything how that culture works is quite different than American,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see the difference between Tanaka and the rest of the American guys. It\u2019s real interesting and something I\u2019m curious about. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628539.6544883}
