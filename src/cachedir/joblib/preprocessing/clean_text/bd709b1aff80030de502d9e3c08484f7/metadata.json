[Emergency services said eight people were detained in connection with the incidents, from 04:00 local time (0200GMT) on Friday, which sent people running in panic and leaving children in tears along procession routes throughout the city .  One man was later released, though he could still face charges, authorities in the southern Spanish city said. In a statement, the Cecop centre that oversees security during the annual processions said those detained had \u201cshouted\u201d used metallic objects to make loud noise or made \u201cwild gesticulations\u201d to create panic in the   crowds. An AFP photographer present said she heard what sounded like a stampede of galloping animals, and then a mass of people pushed towards her. Standing on the Isabel II bridge that straddles Seville\u2019s Guadalquivir River, she climbed onto a lamppost. \u201cThere were children, women with prams,\u201d she said, adding that some people rushed down steps towards the river, falling over themselves in panic. \u201cThe first thing people think is that there is a terrorist attack. \u201d Spanish media reported that some of those later detained shouted \u201cAllah is great\u201d as well as slogans in favour of the Basque separatist group ETA. But Ricardo   the central government\u2019s representative in Seville, said there was no link to extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with Islamist groups, ETA, or any known terrorist group,\u201d he told reporters in comments broadcast on Spanish television. \u201cThey wanted to create the utmost panic with their shouting,\u201d he added. An initial probe showed that there were three initial movements of panic, which sparked a \u201cdomino effect\u201d in other parts of the city, Cecop said. \u201cThese are isolated cases without any apparent connection that are similar to cases of vandalism and hooliganism,\u201d it said. The situation was later brought back under control and the processions continued. Cecop said three of those arrested were \u201ccommon delinquents\u201d. Some 17 people were taken to hospital for injuries and panic attacks, it said. One of them was in intensive care in a serious condition with a head injury. Organised by religious brotherhoods and featuring huge floats of wooden sculptures of religious scenes accompanied by hooded penitents, the processions known as \u201cLa Madruga\u201d are the high point of Easter Week festivities in Seville. This morning\u2019s early incident mirrors a similar outbreak of panic in 2000 in Seville\u2019s Good Friday processions, which left 52 people injured. Good Friday is the second of four intensive days in the Christian calendar culminating in Easter Sunday, which commemorates Christ\u2019s resurrection.'"}, "time": 1742563891.2308257}
