His studio sits beside a wide boulevard without nearby stop signs, red lights or crosswalks, so cars and trucks hurtle past day and night at terrifying speeds. One recent afternoon, Longstreth edged up to the curb, head swiveling. He wore an unkempt beard and scuffed desert boots that  \u2014   after he spotted a narrow gap in traffic  \u2014   transported him across the asphalt and into a bodega on the other side. There, he bought two gallon jugs of filtered water. He was planning a full night of recording and, he explained, \u201cthe tap water here is kind of jank. \u201d For the last decade and a half, Longstreth has been putting out music under the name Dirty Projectors, and it was here, beside the   death gantlet, that he finished his first new LP in four years, out next week: a   breakup album that he calls the most emotionally taxing thing he has made. His studio was cavernous, with gaping skylights and a battalion of movable soundproofing panels that Longstreth built D. I. Y.  using materials from Home Depot. These stood sentry around a drum kit, a piano and assorted microphones and amps. An iMac, loaded with ProTools production software, sat atop a Giotto monograph and a massive tome called \u201cRecording the Beatles. \u201d Leaned against a wall were framed portraits of Missy Elliott, Joni Mitchell and Beethoven  \u2014   an unimpeachable holy trinity. Longstreth, 35, draws from a wide range of references, and in between seven   Dirty Projectors albums he has put his fingerprints all over work by an impressive variety of artists. He teamed up with David Byrne to write a song and with Bjork to write several he   adventurous R. B. with Solange Knowles devised orchestral arrangements for Joanna Newsom produced an album by the Tuareg rock guitarist Bombino and, most recognizably, wrote the luminous bridge that Rihanna sings on \u201cFourFiveSeconds,\u201d a smash hit from 2015 that also features Kanye West and Paul McCartney. Speaking to an interviewer in 2012, Bjork praised Longstreth\u2019s \u201calmost psychic ability to write for other voices. \u201d A freight train rumbled past the studio on tracks abutting the building. Fiddling with the placement of two microphones, Longstreth seemed not to notice. Before long, I detected another, gentler source of noise pollution. A cricket had moved into the ceiling, and its intermittent chirping provided a hypnotic overhead beat. Longstreth moved to a worn old couch and, fooling around on an electric guitar, briefly improvised against it. Longstreth has not yet made an LP of cricket duets, but you could almost imagine it. He is a playful conceptualist whose music moves in a handful of directions all at once. Dirty Projectors\u2019 critical breakthrough was the album \u201cRise Above,\u201d from 2007, in which Longstreth tried to recreate Black Flag\u2019s 1981 punk landmark, \u201cDamaged,\u201d wholly from memory. The result  \u2014   a covers record riddled with the flubs and inventions of forgetfulness  \u2014   was a jumble of intricate syncopations, vertiginous time changes and splintery guitar work. \u201cRise Above\u201d was Longstreth\u2019s fourth album, and his first to feature the singer and guitarist Amber Coffman, who joined the cast of musicians Longstreth relied upon to tour and record. Coffman became his girlfriend, and she proved crucial to the success of the band\u2019s next album, \u201cBitte Orca,\u201d which came out in 2009 and won Dirty Projectors a wave of new fans. Longstreth\u2019s ideas about harmony, rhythm and arranging remained unconventional, but his songwriting grew brighter and more direct. Coffman\u2019s voice, with its strong, clean phrasing, helped this music to pass, after a fashion, as a kind of alien pop. At the couple\u2019s apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, domestic rituals bled into the creative process, and vice versa. When they watched Wim Wenders\u2019s \u201cWings of Desire\u201d together, Longstreth asked Coffman to write down dialogue that resonated with her. These jottings became lyrics for the band\u2019s biggest single, \u201cStillness Is the Move,\u201d in 2009, on which Coffman emulated the   feats of R. B. stars like Mariah Carey and Destiny\u2019s Child. Accompanying her, Longstreth played a West   guitar riff that sounded like something colorful shattering. The song put Dirty Projectors at the forefront of the booming Brooklyn   scene, alongside simpatico acts like Vampire Weekend, Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear. These bands booked worldwide tours, landed prominent festival slots, licensed songs to ad campaigns and crossed over to mainstream audiences. Among Dirty Projectors\u2019 converts was Jay Z, who sent a handwritten note asking them to join a festival he was organizing the   star Diplo, who flew Coffman and Longstreth to Jamaica to work with him and the French rockers Phoenix, who invited the band to open for them at Madison Square Garden. In 2013, after a year of intense touring to support Dirty Projectors\u2019 assured sixth album, \u201cSwing Lo Magellan,\u201d Longstreth and Coffman split. The album was not the commercial success Longstreth had hoped for. \u201cYou think an album\u2019s gonna propel you forward, and then it doesn\u2019t, at least not immediately,\u201d says Brett Williams, the music manager who represents both Longstreth and Coffman. This shortfall, paired with the breakup, sent Longstreth into a depression. \u201cI was super bummed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe band and my relationship with Amber had become so intertwined that, when we broke up, it felt like everything that had defined my life for a decade was suddenly gone. \u201d Gradually he began making music again \u201cto try to work through what I was feeling. \u201d The first song he released was the sparse, glitchy \u201cKeep Your Name. \u201d In writing the lyrics, he drew on a     convention: \u201cIt\u2019s a divorce song,\u201d Longstreth said. The opening line is \u201cI don\u2019t know why you abandoned me,\u201d and he soon drops a knotty clue about fissures between him and Coffman: \u201cWhat I want from art is truth  \u2014   what you want is fame. \u201d In building the vocals, meanwhile, Longstreth digitally lowered the pitch of his singing in a nod to DJ Screw, a Houston   innovator who wrung from this effect a narcotic quality that Longstreth was curious to explore in his song about heartbreak. The single, smoldering with recrimination, offered the first outward sign of turbulence within the group. Two weeks after its release, last fall, Coffman put out her own single, \u201cAll to Myself,\u201d about finding solace in solitude. It emerged that she had an album of solo material due in 2017. Conjecture filled blog posts and comment sections. What was going on with Dirty Projectors? What did these dueling releases mean? The answer was complicated. After their breakup, Longstreth and Coffman reached a d\u00e9tente solid enough that she asked him to produce her solo record. \u201cIt was a good thing for our friendship, to reverse the roles we\u2019d played in Dirty Projectors, where everything had been in the service of my vision,\u201d Longstreth said. \u201cHere, I was in service of her ideas, trying to bring them out into the world. We were reinventing how we related to each other. \u201d By the end of 2015, they\u2019d more or less finished the album. In an act of symbolic accord, its last song shared musical motifs with the last song on Longstreth\u2019s. Around this time, however, things soured again, and when I spoke with Longstreth in his studio, he said that, with some stray exceptions, he and Coffman hadn\u2019t spoken in a year. \u201cI want us to be close friends, and to work together again,\u201d he said. But \u201cthings between us,\u201d he noted unhappily, \u201chave been better. \u201d Now each of their projects was scheduled to come out within a couple of months of the other: They weren\u2019t talking, but their music was in direct conversation. On the floor of Longstreth\u2019s studio were 15 stacks of index cards. The topmost cards bore different inscriptions in black Sharpie: These were names of new songs in various stages of completion, with each stack containing Longstreth\u2019s notes for a different song. \u201cUh, I guess you can look at those,\u201d he said when he saw me standing over the stacks. He explained that this organizational system was one he used on \u201cDirty Projectors\u201d too, but as to whether another album was underway, he demurred: \u201cI\u2019m just working through some numbers. \u201d An engineer named Robby Moncrieff commandeered the iMac, dialing up the ProTools session for a song currently called \u201cSuck My Lifestyle. \u201d It featured a riot of snares, bongos, tambourines, cabasas,   and claps. Some of these instruments were acoustic others,  . The acoustic sounds derived from recordings Longstreth made of the virtuoso percussionist Mauro Refosco, who backs Thom Yorke and Flea in the band Atoms for Peace. Longstreth had manipulated these recordings, sampling individual hits and rearranging them, with software, into wild new configurations. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to use the dynamics and imperfections of his performance to make an impossible rhythm,\u201d Longstreth said. \u201cSuck My Lifestyle\u201d contained a place holder guitar riff that was, like the beat, a product of ample technological mediation. Longstreth had cut and pasted recordings of his own playing, then rearranged these snippets to compose a new riff. The ensuing melody behaved in unexpected ways  \u2014   doubling back on itself, unfurling, stammering. As Moncrieff recorded him, Longstreth sat with an acoustic guitar and diligently replayed the digitized riff live, returning it to the realm of the analog: an oil painting of a Photoshop collage. Much of the music on \u201cDirty Projectors,\u201d he told me, had come together in this way. Whereas fragmentation and reconciliation are major themes on any breakup album, Longstreth had made them compositional strategies too. When I asked him to explain the tensions with Coffman, Longstreth declined, out of respect for her, he said, and to \u201ckeep certain personal things personal. \u201d But many lyrics on \u201cDirty Projectors\u201d grapple with the breakup, whether it\u2019s lines in \u201cKeep Your Name\u201d about   or his seeming admission, on the slithering \u201cDeath Spiral,\u201d that he \u201ccondescended relentlessly. \u201d After I inquired into their romantic troubles, Longstreth said his desire was to \u201cleave it to the music,\u201d while reminding me that the album was a work of art, grounded in truth but subject to distortions. \u201cNot a journal,\u201d he said. (Coffman declined to speak to me for this article. Her publicist said, \u201cHer focus right now is on her own music. \u201d) For Longstreth, moreover, the three years it took to make the album had allowed its meaning to dilate. He initially wrote the second single, \u201cLittle Bubble,\u201d to describe the sphere of happiness he and Coffman temporarily shared, but here in 2017 \u201cbubble\u201d had become a buzzword, referring to the supposedly cosseted perspective of \u201ccoastal elites,\u201d and now the song\u2019s poignant refrain  \u2014   \u201cwe had our own little bubble, for a while\u201d  \u2014   sounded like a postelection elegy. Longstreth hoped when he wrote \u201cDirty Projectors\u201d for such added resonances to accrue, and in devising motifs that worked in the context of a breakup album but also brooked alternate interpretations, he was inspired in part by his exposure, while working on \u201cFourFiveSeconds,\u201d to the songwriting methods of Kanye West. (According to Longstreth, West initially envisioned that track as a solo, then added Rihanna.) In 2015 West asked Longstreth over to his L. A. home to toss around ideas. West routinely assembles motley creative brain trusts, and the brusque,   Bronx rapper French Montana and the slick Canadian singer the Weeknd were there, too. This invitation led to another, to the Mexican seaside village of Punta Mita, where West rented a mansion belonging to the \u201cGirls Gone Wild\u201d impresario Joe Francis and transformed it into a songwriting headquarters for his album \u201cThe Life of Pablo. \u201d Longstreth, a coffee geek who observes a precise   ritual, brought along his own ceramic dripper and, as he   put it, \u201cThird Wave roasted beans,\u201d which apparently entertained West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian. \u201cShe asked me, \u2018Are you making, like, a caramel macchiato? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Longstreth recalled. Other guests included Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend and the rappers Rhymefest and Big Sean. \u201cKanye has this discursive way of working, getting input from a range of people, that I thought was really cool,\u201d Longstreth said. He described a moment when West played a tape he\u2019d made of Paul McCartney playing a Wurlitzer while West improvised a vocal, feeling his way through the music by making nonsense sounds. Amid this gibberish, \u201csomething he sang sounded sort of like \u2018Memories can get you into trouble,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Longstreth recalled. Struck by this phrase, he and Koenig went off to write a song exploring its potential meanings. \u201cLike, maybe you\u2019re with your girlfriend but thinking of your ex,\u201d Longstreth explained. After Mexico, Longstreth kept in touch with Elon Rutberg, one of West\u2019s main creative advisers, and solicited his feedback about \u201cDirty Projectors. \u201d Of the \u201cMemories\u201d song, Longstreth added, \u201cKanye didn\u2019t wind up using it, but it was good  \u2014   maybe something will come of it down the line. \u201d The path that Longstreth took to hanging out with Kanye West in Mexican mansions is improbable. He grew up on five acres of farmland in central Connecticut, where his parents moved from the Bay Area in the late \u201970s. They levied a prohibition on video games and grew their own food. \u201cThey were into subsistence farming  \u2014   \u2018back to the land,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he says. \u201cThey had a cow or two, sheep, goats, geese. They made their own cheese. We ate eggs from our chickens, who were my responsibility. \u201d His older brother, Jake, exposed him to \u201ccool stuff,\u201d David recalls, like \u201cmusic and drawing. He showed me how to play the riff from Nirvana\u2019s \u2018Come as You Are. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Through Nirvana, Jake, who is now a painter in Los Angeles, got into \u201cother weirder, smaller bands from the late \u201980s and \u201990s West Coast underground,\u201d Longstreth continued, \u201cand from there, into the first generation of punk. \u201d Their parents, he added, \u201cwere rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers in the \u201960s, but they listened pretty widely: baroque music titans of \u201940s, \u201950s, \u201960s jazz the \u2018Big Chill\u2019 soundtrack. \u201d In 1999, when Jake left for college in Portland, Ore. David inherited his Tascam   recorder. With all these influences swimming through his head, he recalled, he \u201cstarted making albums. My brother still has a suitcase with, like, 100 tapes we made as kids. \u201d Longstreth\u2019s early recordings were rough by design:     and even ugly. \u201cI used to feel that musical knowledge and emotional   were antagonistic,\u201d he said, invoking bedrock punk principles. \u201cBut I was too curious about chords and instruments and recording to stay locked in that mentality. \u201d He enrolled at Yale, where he studied music, but was unhappy. \u201cIt was about training the next generation of global power elite,\u201d Longstreth said of the campus culture. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about intellectual curiosity or mastery. \u201d He dropped out and traveled to Portland, where Jake had enmeshed himself in the   demimonde, and where David began giving his own concerts at house parties. After about a year, he returned to Yale to finish his degree. \u201cIt would not have been cool with my parents if I didn\u2019t,\u201d he explained. There, he assumed the name Dirty Projectors and made one of his best, and strangest, albums, \u201cThe Getty Address,\u201d which was a   tracing the spiritual wanderings of a fictitious version of the Eagles\u2019 Don Henley. The libretto was a fanciful meditation on, among other things, entwined forms of imperialism, and in Longstreth\u2019s rendering Henley became a sort of   Oppenheimer, conflicted about his epochal hits and their role in the flattening of world culture. For the music, Longstreth \u201cwrote and recorded arrangements for wind septet, women\u2019s choir and cello octet,\u201d according to accompanying text, then \u201cdigitally deconstructed\u201d these sessions \u201cand sang over the reconstituted parts. \u201d Songs alluded to Steve Reich, Justin Timberlake and, as Longstreth put it to me, \u201ca kitschy, exoticist, American fantasy of what Chinese music sounds like. \u201d These collisions of era and idiom doubled, for him, as elaborate   arguments, but you didn\u2019t need to fully grasp these in order to appreciate the album\u2019s   beauty. By the time Longstreth moved to Brooklyn, he was something of a minor legend in   circles: ascetic, eccentric and respected for it. Ezra Koenig told me that, in college, he passingly considered becoming a music critic, but the only review he ever wrote was an \u201cembarrassing\u201d rave, published in the online magazine Dusted, about Dirty Projectors\u2019 2003 debut album. A couple of years later, Koenig befriended Longstreth and came aboard Dirty Projectors as a touring saxophonist and keyboardist  \u2014   joining an   group of musicians whose members also included the bassist Nat Baldwin, the drummer Brian McOmber and the singers Haley Dekle and Angel Deradoorian. When Longstreth moved to a place in   Koenig, then a schoolteacher, was among his roommates. \u201cI remember him recording music in the middle of the night, when I had to be up at 7 a. m. for work,\u201d Koenig said. The friendship survived, and Koenig was among Longstreth\u2019s sounding boards as he   \u201cDirty Projectors\u201d for release. \u201cI watched him go from living in a windowless room, making what most people would call difficult music, to being a part of Rihanna and Solange songs,\u201d Koenig said. He added that, even as Longstreth\u2019s profile has risen, there has been a constancy to his music: \u201cCompositionally, he does harmonic stuff no one else is doing. There\u2019s a thread that runs through all Dave\u2019s work, where the sensibility is unmistakably him. \u201d One morning, I met Longstreth for breakfast burritos near the house in Highland Park that he shares with his girlfriend, an artist liaison at an L. A. gallery. Afterward we walked to his cluttered Prius, where he retrieved \u201cThe Fractal Geometry of Nature,\u201d a book by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot featuring   fractals. \u201cThis is a late Christmas present for my friend Zach Harris,\u201d Longstreth explained. \u201cHe\u2019s a painter, and his studio\u2019s just down the block. Do you want to pop in on him?\u201d Longstreth moved to California in 2014, and through his girlfriend and his brother, he gained entry into a circle of fine artists in town. He enjoyed visiting with Harris, he said, and trading ideas about work: \u201cZach has this whole cosmology behind everything he does. \u201d Lately they\u2019d been discussing tantalizing geometries, like Fibonacci spirals and Mandelbrot sets, and these conversations inspired Longstreth\u2019s gift. Harris welcomed Longstreth into his studio with a hug. He wore a mustache and   white jeans. His work space, he explained, \u201cused to be a grow house. I converted it three years ago, and we found all this weed still here. Some bullets too. \u201d A dozen or so paintings ringed the room, all very large. Many were covered and crisscrossed by carved pieces of wood that Harris had machined with a laser, then painted   colors. Between these lattices he\u2019d inscribed legions of   tiny figures engaged in odd, feverish interactions. I spied a roaring lion near a cluster of winged archers and, in a cheekier register, a parody of the \u201cMarch of Progress\u201d illustration that riffed on Nike\u2019s Jumpman logo. Longstreth inspected a painting up close, in which a woman and a devil were engaged in a contortive sex act. \u201cStories start suggesting themselves,\u201d Harris said, \u201cand I follow them. I\u2019m really into making these little universes you can get lost in. \u201d The two seemed to regard each other as kindred spirits. \u201cDave and I talk a lot about structures that all art forms share,\u201d Harris went on. Longstreth nodded. \u201cI love thinking of one medium as analogous to another, even if they aren\u2019t, quite,\u201d he replied. \u201cWorking on this new album, I\u2019d lose focus on a song after a while, but thinking of it as if it were a painting allowed me to come at it again, in a new light. \u201d Harris waved a hand over one of his canvases. \u201cThere\u2019s a   thing here and an Egyptian thing here  \u2014   in painting, you can take all these different visual languages and styles and put them together. There\u2019s a sense of that in Dave\u2019s songs, too. Traditions he\u2019s bringing together and synthesizing. \u201d Longstreth appeared to blush at the sound of his friend describing his music with such care. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, shrugging. He lingered a bit more, paging through the Mandelbrot book. \u201cHe figured out the math and ratios that generate this stuff,\u201d Longstreth said. \u201cThere are names for all of these. \u201d Before long, Longstreth said goodbye and made for his Prius, which he pointed toward his studio. It was nearly noon, and he had his own little universe to get lost in.'"}, "time": 1742562961.848842}
