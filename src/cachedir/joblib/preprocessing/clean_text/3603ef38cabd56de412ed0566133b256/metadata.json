It\u2019s a policy that has been respected across parties and administrations for decades to keep justice and elections un-entwined. \\nJustice officials specifically advised Comey of the policy . \\nHe sent a mea culpa letter to other FBI agents just hours after the election-impacting memo. \\nThe Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed the first reported Hatch Act complaint against FBI Director Comey in the wake of his unusual memo Friday afternoon. \\nYesterday, Professor Richard Painter filed his own Hatch Act and ethics complaint against the FBI Director and an ethics complaint over the same memo, which is also drawing the ire of the career professionals at the top federal investigatory agency.'"}, "time": 1742628593.6935208}
