[The   charity Odara is believed to have received over \u00a3150, 000 of taxpayer money via the government\u2019s   Prevent program, for the work it does in running workshops for women. The charity prides itself on providing what it calls a \u2018safe environment for discussion on issues like domestic violence, mental health and extremism\u2019.  But Aysha Iqbal, leader and   of Odara, and outreach worker Tasmiyah Bint Naeem were both found by the Daily Mail to have made numerous comments on Facebook of an   and homophobic nature. Iqbal posted a series of videos suggesting that Israel was behind mass shootings in America. Posting a video entitled: Israel did Sandy Hook, Newtown CT School Massacres says Michael Harris, she wrote: \u201cTruth be told. \u201d Bint Naeem shared in her colleague\u2019s belief in conspiracy theories, posting a video which claimed   was an \u201cinside job\u201d with the comment \u201cwatch and think\u201d. In other posts to the social media platform, she referred to all Israelis as Zionists, a modern   trope, as well as commenting \u201cmay Allah destroy Zionists. \u201d And she expressed homophobic views, saying she would not want to \u201cbe in the company of those that are gay\u201d adding that she would not \u201cembrace\u201d homosexuality, she said: \u201cShoot me for my views  \u2026     don\u2019t care if times have changed. \u201d Odara was singled out last year by Theresa May, then as Home Secretary, who said she was \u201cproud\u201d to support the group in \u201cworking to stand up against the extremists who seek to divide us\u201d. The group was also singled out by Dame Louise Casey in her recent report  \u2014   which was highly critical of   by British Muslim communities  \u2014   as an organisation providing an example of how Muslim women with poor English language skills are being encouraged to integrate. Yet sources from two groups who have considered working with Odara told the Mail that they had last year decided against it thanks to the group\u2019s \u201chomophobic and   views\u201d. When asked for comment, Iqbal said the posts were from 2013, before she began working on   matters. She claimed the comments had been \u201ctongue in cheek\u201d but that she now realised how \u2018inappropriate and offensive it appeared without the context\u2019. She added that Bint Naeem had stopped working for Odara last month. Bint Naeem said: \u201cI want to make it very clear I am not homophobic or  . What has been picked up on are online profile statuses from a long time ago  \u2014   since then I have developed personally and professionally and reject any of the views in question. \u201d Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said: \u201cAgain this is an example of how the Home Office has been duped into supporting, recommending and funding organisations that spring up from nowhere. \u201cIt is wrong that such groups are receiving Government money without first understanding what their role is in the community and whether they have any positive track record. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628528.7191162}
