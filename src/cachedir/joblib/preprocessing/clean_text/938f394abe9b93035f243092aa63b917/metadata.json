I will defeat ISIS. I will protect America.\u201d \\nWatch: \\n\u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 2, 2016 \\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2026 Hillary wasn\u2019t actually there on 9/11, and it\u2019s common knowledge. \\nTellMeNow reported: \\nShe went to New York City the following day, but she definitely wasn\u2019t there on the day of the terrorist attacks. She toured the area on 9/12 with Mayor Rudy Giuliani then hightailed it back to DC. She didn\u2019t get her hands dirty. She went for a short photo op and now she can\u2019t even get the facts of that straight. \\nIt is sickening that someone would use such a tragedy for personal gain, but then, this is Hillary Clinton we\u2019re talking about. She left four Americans to die in Benghazi, she threatened women who were assaulted by her own husband, she laughed about getting a child rapist off the hook, and the list goes on and on\u2026 She is heartless.'"}, "time": 1742628368.1083682}
