[Trump\u2019s comments were interpreted by some critics as a slam against the American troops who fought in the Iraq War  \u2014   if they are \u201cfighting like never before\u201d now, the argument goes, Trump must think the soldiers deployed to Iraq in the Bush administration were not fighting so hard.  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed this criticism on Wednesday, saying President Trump was referring to \u201cprogress, particularly in Mosul, the way that they have taken back that city. \u201d \u201cI think that for a long time, there was a lot of concern about Iran moving in and dominating parts of Iraq,\u201d Spicer continued. \u201cI think with the advice and consent of U. S. military advisers, there\u2019s been tremendous progress at moving Iraq forward to an area of stability, and continuing to see the troops there in Iraq standing on their own. \u201d Spicer said the president pleased with the action that General Mattis and our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are taking to do that. \u201d \u201cHe was very proud of the work that our soldiers are doing over there in Iraq. There is a lot of work, and a lot of progress that is being made,\u201d said Spicer. \u201cThe fight against ISIS is going extremely well, and he\u2019s proud of it. \u201d Critics of Trump\u2019s fight against ISIS dwell on mounting civilian casualties and confusion in Iraq\u2019s military ranks, but Doyle McManus at the L. A. Times wrote on Wednesday that Trump \u201cmay actually win the war against the Islamic State\u201d: Under Obama, who waged a \u201clight footprint\u201d strategy with minimal U. S. troops, Islamic State lost most of the territory it once held in Iraq and almost a third of what it held in Syria. But taking the extremist group\u2019s most important strongholds, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria, was taking longer. Enter Trump. The new president, after claiming he had a secret plan to win the war, told his generals to give him one in 30 days. They responded with an outline  \u2014   a \u201cskeleton plan,\u201d in the words of Defense Secretary James N. Mattis  \u2014   that could be described as Obama Plus: more bombing, more troops, fewer restrictions on commanders. \u201cThe Obama strategy wasn\u2019t failing, but it was slow,\u201d James F. Jeffrey, a former ambassador (and former Army officer) who\u2019s advising the administration, told me. \u201cThis is more  \u2014   not only more troops, but more willingness to use them. It\u2019s a change of maybe 20% but it\u2019s an important 20%. \u201d McManus notes the task at hand is more complex than Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric about \u201cbombing the s**t out of them,\u201d blowing up \u201cevery single inch\u201d of the Islamic State and then bringing in oil companies to rebuild from the ruins. He gives Defense Secretary Mattis credit for influencing White House policy, which now appears to envision aggressive military victory over ISIS, followed by an extended troop commitment to achieve \u201cstabilization. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564515.7187223}
