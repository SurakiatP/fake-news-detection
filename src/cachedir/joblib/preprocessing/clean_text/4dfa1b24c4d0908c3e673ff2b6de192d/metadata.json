[But a deeper dive reveals that lots of people who would not consider themselves Trump supporters admit there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Trump campaign regarding alleged collusion with Russians.  Here\u2019s a list of some of those who fall into the \u201cno evidence\u201d column: \u201cThe last time we spoke, Senator, I asked you if you had actually seen evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and you said to me  \u2014   and I\u2019m quoting you now  \u2014   you said, \u2018not at this time.\u2019 Has anything changed since we spoke last?\u201d asked CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, \u201cWell, not \u2014  no, it hasn\u2019t,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cBut I just want to be precise, Senator. In all of the \u2014  you\u2019ve had access from the intelligence committee, from the Judiciary committee, all of the access you\u2019ve had to very sensitive information, so far you\u2019ve not seen any evidence of collusion, is that right?\u201d Blitzer pressed. \u201cWell, evidence that would establish that there\u2019s collusion. There are all kinds of rumors around. There are newspaper stories, but that\u2019s not necessarily evidence,\u201d Feinstein admitted. \u201cBut just to be clear, there has been no actual evidence yet,\u201d Sam Stein of the Huffington Post asked. \u201cNo, it has not been,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWhat I have found appalling is the number of leaks that have taken place over the last several months,\u201d Brennan said at the SALT conference in Las Vegas, the annual gathering of   managers and other financiers. \u201cThis needs to be stopped. \u201d \u201cThe damage that was done is what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media. The real damage to national security is the leaks,\u201d Brennan said. Brennan said. \u201cThese individuals who still stay within the government and are leaking this stuff to the press need to be brought to task. \u201d \u201cFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC\u2019S Andrea Mitchell on Friday that there could be evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign,\u201d CNN reported. But, \u201cThere was no evidence that rose to that level, at that time, that found its way in to the intelligence community assessment, which we had pretty high confidence in,\u201d Clapper said of collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russians, referring also to the U. S. intelligence assessment that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t evidence, but not that met that threshold,\u201d Clapper said. Reuters ran a story on Thursday with the headline \u201cExclusive: Trump campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians sources\u201d But buried in the story is the real headline: \u201cIn January, the Trump White House initially denied any contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. The White House and advisers to the campaign have since confirmed four meetings between Kislyak and Trump advisers during that time. The people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562001.3813066}
