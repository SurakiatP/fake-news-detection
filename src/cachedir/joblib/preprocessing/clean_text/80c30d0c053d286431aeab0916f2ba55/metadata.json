The hidden 33,000 emails are just emails about her personal life, she says. \\nTop Democrats have quietly slammed Clinton for her recklessness and ethical short-cuts, but the FBI leadership decided that she should not be charged with crimes in the run-up to the 2016 election. \\nSince that decision was announced, there\u2019s been growing evidence that the FBI and the Department of Justice handcuffed the FBI investigators and granted favorable treatment to Clinton\u2019s staff. \\nNow Sperry shows how Justice Department and FBI officials have also declined multiple opportunities to find copies of the missing 33,000 emails that would provide more evidence about whether Clinton was obeying or violating many federal laws: In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton\u2019s private server revealed that an underling didn\u2019t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton\u2019s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress. The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta \u201ccreated a \u2018vehicle\u2019 to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the \u2018vehicle,\u2019 but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.\u201d Unless one of Clinton\u2019s aides had the capability to log in to the PRN server as an administrator and remove a mailbox, her archived mailboxes more than likely still reside somewhere in that system. And they may also materialize on an internal \u201cshared drive\u201d that PRN created to control access to the Clinton email accounts among PRN employees. PRN has been under FBI order to preserve all emails and other evidence since the start of its investigation last year. Clinton\u2019s missing \u201cpersonal\u201d emails may also be captured on a Google server. According to FBI notes, Combetta \u201ctransferred all of the Clinton email content to a personal Google email address he created.\u201d Only the FBI never subpoenaed Google to find out. The FBI documents also reveal that Hillary\u2019s server was mirrored on a cloud server in Pennsylvania maintained by Datto Inc., a tech firm that performs cloud-to-cloud data protection. When PRN contracted with Datto, it requested that Hillary\u2019s server be backed up locally and privately. But the techs forgot to order the private node, and they sent the server backup data \u201cremotely to Datto\u2019s secure cloud and not to a local private node.\u201d The FBI never subpoenaed Datto\u2019s server, either. \\nRead it all here .'"}, "time": 1742628562.8360386}
