[The incident occurred at a Kansas City Jimmy John\u2019s around 9:15 p. m.  According to Fox 13, the robbery suspect was \u201cwearing a baby blue sweatshirt and black hat. \u201d He ordered food, then tried \u2014  unsuccessfully \u2014  to rack the slide on his pistol. Video of the incident shows a bullet ended up being jammed between the slide and the barrel\u2019s chamber, yet the suspect pointed the gun at the cashier and carried out the robbery anyway.  The cashier remained extremely calm throughout the incident, even though the suspect placed the end of the barrel just inches from the cashier\u2019s head. In fact \u2014  once the robbery attempt was obvious \u2014  the cashier \u201csimply takes his gloves off, takes the money out of the register and hands it to the suspect, without any change in his demeanor whatsoever. \u201d The suspect took the money and fled the scene, but police reported that he was arrested on Friday. Police did not indicate whether the cashier knew the gun was jammed. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
