We have a White House, Donald Trump has a White House with almost no skill of governing. We have a cheif of staff who has never been in government, which is absolutely extraordinary. \u201d \u201cHe has elevated people, generals and corporate heads that have no experience in this extraordinary complex business of how you put together an administration, run a bureaucracy, produce ideas,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, I think there\u2019s a deep concern about the possibility of overreach. But I think we should be also concerned about the possibility of an entirely ineffective government that doesn\u2019t value governing experience, that doesn\u2019t value, you know, what government should do and what it can do under the right circumstances. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563051.8531485}
