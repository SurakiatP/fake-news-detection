A university police officer fatally shot the suspect within about a minute of the attack, but the sprawling campus in Columbus, Ohio, remained on lockdown for about an hour and a half as people ran for cover and barricaded themselves in academic buildings and dorms. Investigators were looking into whether the attack was an act of terrorism and were seeking information on the student, Abdul Artan, a permanent United States resident from Somalia who was studying logistics management at Ohio State. The F. B. I. was investigating comments on Facebook indicating that he may have felt Muslims were being persecuted, an investigator said. Last summer the student newspaper, The Lantern, published an interview with Mr. Artan in which he complained about being afraid to pray in public as a Muslim, because of people\u2019s negative perceptions of the religion. \u201cI was kind of scared with everything going on in the media. I\u2019m a Muslim, it\u2019s not what media portrays me to be,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIf people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to think, what\u2019s going to happen. But I don\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s the media that put that picture in their heads. \u201d The attack began at 9:50 a. m. Monday, when \u201cthis car suddenly appeared on the sidewalk,\u201d said Angshuman Kapil, a graduate student. \u201cIt was in high speed, and it just hit whoever came in front of him. \u201d The car stopped only when it rammed a concrete block, he said. The driver leapt out, the authorities said, and began attacking people with a knife. A campus police officer, Alan Horujko, 28, shot Mr. Artan after he failed to follow orders to drop his weapon, and officials credited the officer with helping to save lives. All of the wounded were expected to survive, university officials said. Six people were hit by the car, and five had stab wounds or lacerations, doctors said. They were being treated at three hospitals. No evidence has emerged that Mr. Artan had any connection or allegiance to radical ideology. Though no terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the attack, the Islamic State was updating its online audiences on the rampage on Monday. Both the   and the knife attacks are now established forms of aggression inspired by the Islamic State. An attacker in Nice, France, used a delivery truck to kill dozens of pedestrians in July, and chats between an attacker in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, and his Islamic State handler indicate he was initially told to use a car to carry out his assault that same month, before he settled on using an ax because he did not have a driving permit. The authorities in Ohio said that it was too soon to know what had motivated Mr. Artan, but that it was clear the attack had been deliberate. Mr. Artan\u2019s Columbus home was surrounded by squad cars, crime scene tape and a bomb squad truck on Monday afternoon, and police officials said they were waiting for a search warrant. \u201cThis was done on purpose,\u201d said Chief Craig Stone of the Ohio State University police. \u201cTo go over the curb and strike pedestrians and then get out and start striking with the knife  \u2014   that was on purpose. \u201d The attack, initially reported as an \u201cactive shooter\u201d by the university, stunned students who were returning to class after Thanksgiving break, leading to a      warning and an admonition from campus officials to \u201cRun Hide Fight. \u201d Haylee Gardiner, a sophomore, said she was on her way to a chemistry lab when the attack occurred. \u201cI saw a bunch of people running, and when they were running, they were screaming and yelling,\u201d said Ms. Gardiner, who scrambled to a residence hall for shelter. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, I heard four or five gunshots. \u201d Sean Cody, 23, from Akron, Ohio, was running late for his philosophy class, and after hearing a loud boom, he sprinted into a building to alert fellow students. \u201cThen there was a bang, a dust cloud, then shouting and screaming, and people just booking it in every direction,\u201d Mr. Cody said. \u201cThen, 30 seconds, a minute later, there were gunshots. \u201d During the chaos, students huddled in locked rooms, and some took to Twitter, posting photos from inside barricaded classrooms. Ohio State administrators released little information about Mr. Artan, and parts of his background remained unclear. He was admitted to the United States in June 2014 as the child of a refugee, federal officials said, and was believed to be in his late teens or early 20s. He graduated cum laude from Columbus State Community College with an associate of arts degree, officials there said. He was on the Columbus State dean\u2019s list in 2015. Officer Horujko, who joined the university police last year, had also been profiled in The Lantern. An Ohio native and a graduate of the university, he said he had decided to be an officer after working in campus safety as a student. As Ohio State officials took stock of the attack and made plans for classes to resume on Tuesday, they said they were thankful the injuries were not more severe and were optimistic that students would come together even if investigators discovered a link to terrorism. \u201cOur campus community is extremely tolerant,\u201d Michael V. Drake, the university president, said in an interview. \u201cThe concept of branding a whole community for the act of a few leads to an intolerance that can make the world a more difficult place for all of us. \u201d The episode was reported near Watts Hall, a building at the heart of the campus that houses materials science and engineering programs. Heavily armed SWAT teams swarmed the campus, and at one point could be seen making their way up a stairwell of a nearby parking garage. Monday\u2019s violence followed a machete attack in February at a Mediterranean restaurant in Columbus, which also ended with the police killing the suspect. The restaurant\u2019s owner told reporters that he believed he had been targeted because of his Israeli heritage. The attack on Monday was the latest   episode over the last decade on an American college campus. Shootings at Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois University and Oikos University in California, among others, have led colleges nationwide to plan how to respond to an attack. Monday\u2019s instruction to \u201cRun Hide Fight\u201d came from a training program used by Ohio State and other groups for reacting to active shootings. \u201cWe prepare for situations like this,\u201d Dr. Drake said, \u201cbut always hope never to have one. \u201d Muslim leaders in Ohio praised the police for their response and urged the public not to make assumptions about the attacker\u2019s motives. \u201cWe as yet know nothing about the motivation of the attacker, but we do know of his Somali heritage, and that will be enough for some people to falsely link this tragic incident to the faith of Islam and to the Somali and Muslim communities,\u201d said Roula Allouch, national board chairwoman of the Council on   Relations. \u201cWe must not jump to conclusions. It is important to let the investigators do their jobs. \u201d Gov. John Kasich also praised the police response, saying it showed \u201chow much practice, how much training, how much expertise, how much coordination\u201d existed among local law enforcement agencies. \u201cWe are a strong, tough, resilient community,\u201d he said. Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus said that Monday was \u201cone of those days you\u2019re grateful for good training and great people across the board,\u201d and urged unity in the days ahead.'"}, "time": 1742563084.460905}
