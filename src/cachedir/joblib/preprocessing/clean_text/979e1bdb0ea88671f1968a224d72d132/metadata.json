[Many parents who homeschool their children, as well as their numerous local and national homeschooling organizations, are protesting the bill, introduced by Iowa Rep. Steve King (R) and calling upon the members of Congress who are its sponsors to \u201cleave homeschooling families alone. \u201d  School vouchers created by H. R. 610, the Choices in Education Act of 2017, \u201cwould be a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling,\u201d asserts William Estrada, director of federal relations for the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA). King\u2019s bill would first repeal the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. While many homeschoolers agree with the repeal of ESEA, the bill next would send all federal education funds to the states in the form of grants, which states would then distribute as vouchers to public, private, and homeschooled students. Estrada asserts the bill would essentially create a \u201cfederal right to homeschool. \u201d Section 104 of the bill states, \u201cTo be eligible to receive a grant  \u2026    the State will  \u2026    make it lawful for parents of an eligible child to elect  \u2026    to enroll their child in any public or private elementary or secondary school in the State or to   their child. \u201d Estrada explains: While this sounds good, HSLDA has fought  \u2014   successfully \u2014  for decades to make sure that there is no \u201cfederal right to homeschool\u201d because what could be created by a favorable Congress could be regulated by a future, hostile Congress. It is far better (and far more constitutionally sound) for education decisions \u2014  and homeschool freedom \u2014  to be protected at the state level. We ask our friends at the federal level to simply leave homeschooling families alone. Section 105 of the bill further states: The State shall distribute funds  \u2026    based on the number of eligible children enrolled in the public schools operated by each local educational agency and the number of eligible children within each local educational agency\u2019s geographical area whose parents elect to send their child to a private school or to   their child.   \u2026     On an annual basis, on a date to be determined by the Secretary, each local education agency shall inform the State educational agency of  \u2026    the number of eligible children within each local educational agency\u2019s geographical area whose parents elect  \u2026    to   their child. Estrada says the bill allows states to \u201ctrack\u201d homeschooling students. \u201cThere is only one way that states and school districts can do this: by requiring homeschooling families to register with them, and be tracked by the school district,\u201d he asserts. \u201cThis will be especially problematic in states that do not require homeschooling families to file a notice of intent with the local school district. H. R. 610 will require homeschooling families in all 50 states to register with the local school district. This would be just the first cost of \u2018free government money. \u2019\u201d In a statement on his website about the bill, King says: In order to receive a grant or voucher under my legislation, the State must ensure that the funds be distributed appropriately on a per pupil basis. Additionally and most importantly, this bill makes it lawful for the parent to make the ultimate decision between public, private or   education for their children. However, Estrada asserts it is not the job of the federal government to grant parents the freedom to decide their children\u2019s education. \u201cThe Constitution protects the right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children, as the U. S. Supreme Court has ruled in its seminal cases of Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder,\u201d he says. \u201cFederal legislation to \u2018protect\u2019 homeschooling is unnecessary. \u201d In an interview with Breitbart News, King says he \u201cregrets\u201d most of all that a    meeting has not taken place with homeschooling parents prior to the uproar over his bill. The Iowa congressman says that while his legislative director has been on the phone with homeschoolers opposed to his legislation, a meeting he had slated with them may have been canceled due to his schedule. He said he and his staff have asked homeschoolers to hold back on their open criticism of the bill until he could meet with them. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve got a national thing going on here that didn\u2019t need to happen,\u201d King says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for the last several weeks to have a meeting with them, and I\u2019ve said to my staff I want to look them in the eye and I want to talk this through reasonably. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve tried to talk openly and do business and we haven\u2019t been able to have that meeting, and I regret that,\u201d King emphasizes, still adding that he is surprised \u201cthere\u2019s a nationwide effort to oppose the broadest, most sweeping bill that supports parents being in charge of their children\u2019s education that this Congress has ever seen. \u201d He explains his view of the legislation: The objective is this, that we\u2019re watching as a nationwide curriculum is being established, and that nationwide curriculum, coupled with the money that goes to that, pushes all the public schools into that system, and eventually drags the parochial schools into that curriculum. I\u2019m watching as our   values are being undermined, and I\u2019m watching as western civilization is being deconstructed systemically throughout our public school system and especially in our universities  \u2014   which we don\u2019t touch with this, by the way. The object is to put parents back in control of their children\u2019s education and curriculum and put it in a position where the public schools compete with the parochial schools. To have exempted homeschools from this, would have made the bill the target of homeschoolers, too. King thinks homeschoolers should participate in his bill for the sake of the new system  \u2014   the intention of which, he says, is to save the culture of the country that is being destroyed by the public school monopoly. He continues: They\u2019re missing the objective of this bill, which is to put the public schools in a position where they have to compete with the parochial schools and respect and honor the homeschools, and let the states regulate those things at that level, not the federal government. States that are unwilling to pass a voucher program have to give up their federal money. So isn\u2019t that a much bigger goal for us  \u2014   to put the public schools into competition with parochial schools than it is to preserve the status quo of homeschool? Homeschoolers, King argues, want \u201cto be protected from ever being threatened by a state approving federal funds going through a voucher system that might tempt some of their people to accept some money that comes from the state and federal government. \u201d \u201cTo do that, they would not want to have parochial schools have an opportunity to compete with the public schools, which takes down our ability to allow masses of parents to decide curriculums, moral values, etc. ,\u201d he continues. \u201cMany parents can\u2019t afford to send their children to a parochial school, nor can they actually homeschool their children. \u201d Wisconsin homeschooling parent Tina Hollenbeck, however, writes at her blog about the level of regulation King\u2019s bill is inviting in for homeschoolers. The measure, she says, provides for states to be \u201cmandated to send information about all children  \u2014   yes, every child using any form of education  \u2014   to the federal Secretary of Education in order to get the voucher money H. R. 610 claims the states are due. \u201d Hollenbeck continues: Of course, the states will want to report on all the children anyway  \u2014   more children equals more money for state coffers even if some of us don\u2019t take it  \u2014   but even if a state wanted to behave ethically in order to protect the privacy of home educators who refuse voucher money, they are not allowed to do so under this bill. Thus, any state that currently requires any sort of notification from homeschoolers  \u2014   information that previously remained at the local or state level  \u2014   will now violate our privacy by giving information about us to the federal Secretary of Education  \u2014   without regard to either the 4th or 10th Amendments to the Constitution. And we can expect swift ( ) action from states whose homeschool laws currently require no  . They will assert that they \u201cmust\u201d know who the homeschooled children are according to H. R. 610  \u2026     Karen Braun, a homeschooling parent from Michigan, also tells Breitbart News she is opposed to H. R. 610. \u201cReading the fine print, it is clear they will make sure that states distribute the funds in a manner so as to \u2018ensure that such payments will be used for appropriate educational expenses,\u2019\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd who gets to define \u2018appropriate educational expense?\u2019 They do. \u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t about giving homeschoolers help, or offering choices, but about giving the nanny state more control,\u201d Braun concludes. The bill is   by Republican Reps. Andy Harris (MD) Trent Franks (AZ) and Pete Olson (TX). Estrada observes to members of HSLDA that Franks has clarified his position on the bill after speaking with homeschoolers: [W]e talked with Franks and his staff and they agree with our concerns about homeschooling families being included in H. R. 610. As a result, there is no need to contact his office, and we are deeply grateful to him for his commitment to protecting homeschool freedom from \u201chelp\u201d by the federal government. Here is the statement Franks gave us: \u201cI understand the concerns of the homeschool community. My support for the bill only extends to vouchers for public school and private school students. If this bill moves forward, I would request that any language that would impose vouchers upon homeschools is taken out. \u201d Breitbart News reached out to Franks\u2019 office, and his staff confirmed his statement to Estrada. The bill is introduced just as Betsy DeVos takes her post as U. S. education secretary. DeVos  \u2014   whose primary areas of interest have been school choice and school voucher programs  \u2014   experienced unprecedented controversy during her confirmation process from both those on the left, who fear privatization of public schools, and those on the right who have warned against regulation of private and home schools through vouchers. The school voucher  \u2014   as a transfer of taxpayer funds  \u2014   is a finance mechanism to create school choice and one that is associated with the highest level of regulation for schools that agree to accept them. If parents use vouchers to send their children to a private school or to homeschool them, that school choice may have additional regulatory burdens placed upon it by the state in which it is located  \u2014   in the name of \u201caccountability. \u201d In a 2010 study at Cato Institute, Andrew Coulson studied the question of school vouchers and increased regulation of private schools. He concluded that \u201cvouchers  \u2026     impose a substantial and statistically significant additional regulatory burden on participating private schools. \u201d Voucher programs, Coulson concluded, are more likely to \u201csuffocate the very markets to which they aim to expand access,\u201d because state funds \u2014  which invariably come with state regulation \u2014  are directly transferred, in the form of vouchers, to parents to spend in an alternate education setting. Cindy Nicolai writes at the   Constitutional Home Educators Alliance that, for homeschoolers, government regulations are binding \u201cstrings. \u201d \u201c  and   home education must avoid those strings in order to retain our independence, sovereignty, autonomy, and most importantly, our freedom,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe recognize the value of that freedom and are willing to pay the cost to keep   home education unrestricted and free from government control. \u201d \u201cHomeschools are not threatened under this bill,\u201d King insists, but adds, \u201cI\u2019m still open to listen to viewpoints, but they also must listen to mine, and they have not done that. They should come and talk to me in a reasonable fashion instead of unleashing letters across the state and asking people to send tweets at me, send letters, and call my office. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564561.437542}
