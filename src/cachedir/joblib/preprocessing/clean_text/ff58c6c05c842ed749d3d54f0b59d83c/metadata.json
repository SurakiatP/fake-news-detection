Dianne Feinstein ( ) Friday outside of her appearance at the Public Policy Institute of California Friday in San Francisco, to complain about her decision not to hold town hall meetings during the week\u2019s congressional recess.

Senator Dianne Feinstein will soon speak @KQEDnews pic. twitter.   \u2014   Cesar James Saldana (@cesarjsaldana) February 24, 2017,   According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cFeinstein, who has not debated her Republican opponent in her last two U. S. Senate campaigns  \u2014   state Sen. Dick Mountjoy in 2006 and Republican Elizabeth Emken in 2012  \u2014   has no plans for any town halls during Congress\u2019 current recess. \u201d People attending Feinstein\u2019s ticketed event were reportedly invited to send questions via email to the event moderator in advance. Tickets were free. There were reportedly only 240 chairs in the room, although many more were standing. The Sacramento Bee reported that during the event, Feinstein said she somewhat enjoyed the outbursts. The moderator reportedly \u201casked the audience to settle down so that he could continue asking questions\u201d when \u201cFeinstein admitted, \u2018I kind of enjoy it. \u2019\u201d The protesters were from the San Francisco chapter of Indivisible, a liberal group that has crashed talks in recent weeks to push their \u201c  Trump\u201d agenda. The Bee notes that they held up signs reading, \u201cHold a real town hall. \u201d Others held up a green \u201cagree\u201d and a red \u201cdisagree\u201d sign. At another point during the event, Feinstein reportedly said there was not much she could do to remove Stephen K. Bannon from his position as President Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist, which prompted the activists to hold up a red \u201cdisagree\u201d sign. \u201d \u201cWait a minute, all the   geniuses,\u201d Feinstein reportedly objected, before noticing a sign that said, \u201cBan Bannon to Russia. \u201d The Bee notes that she then said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a nice thought. \u201d Friday was not the first time Feinstein\u2019s constituents have confronted her. In January, approximately 200 radical leftists protested and picketed outside of her Pacific Heights mansion in San Francisco to oppose what they have labeled as her \u201c  voting record\u201d because she voted for confirming several of the president\u2019s Cabinet picks.

Adam Schiff ( ) held a town hall in Glendale, California where he discussed President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban and the refugee crisis. Amazing turnout tonight for our town hall on the President\u2019s travel ban. It\u2019s fantastic to see so many engaged. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 25, 2017,  So many showed up to our town hall, we filled the overflow room too.  Important to hear from everyone here tonight. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 25, 2017,  The Chronicle notes that on Sunday, at 10 a. m. several hundred   activists will also hold an \u201cempty chair\u201d town hall despite the fact that Feinstein will not attend in person. She reportedly declined their invitation. However, a spokeswoman for Indivisible East Bay told the Chronicle that Sunday \u201cis not really a protest\u201d of the senator. \u201cIt\u2019s a demonstration of our request that she meet with us. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742562467.002887}
