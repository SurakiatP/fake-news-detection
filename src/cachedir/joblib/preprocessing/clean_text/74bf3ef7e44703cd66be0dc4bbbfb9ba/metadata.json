Hillary Clinton dominated a final series of debate exchanges with Donald J. Trump about national security and gender, telling voters they could not trust her opponent with nuclear weapons and warning that he does not respect women. Here are a few of the highlights. \u25a0 Asked about a remark he made that Mrs. Clinton lacked a presidential \u201clook,\u201d Mr. Trump repeated the claim, adding that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have the stamina. \u201d In response, Mrs. Clinton ticked off some highlights of her tenure as secretary of state, saying Mr. Trump \u201ccan talk to me about stamina\u201d when he accomplishes as much. \u201cHe tried to change from looks to stamina, but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. Trump defended himself before adding that he had planned to say \u201csomething extremely rough\u201d to Mrs. Clinton and her family, but decided against it. \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton pressed Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated claim, contradicted by public statements he has made in the past, that he had opposed the Iraq war from the beginning. \u201cDonald supported the invasion of Iraq,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is absolutely proved over and over again. \u201d \u201cWrong,\u201d Mr. Trump interjected. \u201cWrong. \u201d \u25a0 Mr. Trump insisted again that he had opposed the Iraq war, calling any suggestion otherwise \u201ca mainstream media nonsense. \u201d Lester Holt, the moderator, said, \u201cThe record shows otherwise. \u201d Mr. Trump went on to appraise his own temperament, calling it \u201cmy strongest asset, maybe by far,\u201d before attacking Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. She smiled. \u201cWoo! O. K.,\u201d she said, beginning her response. \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton hit Mr. Trump for his record of praise for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, lamenting that Mr. Trump had \u201cpublicly invited Putin to hack into\u201d American communications, as Mr. Trump shook his head. Mr. Trump said he did not think \u201canybody knows\u201d if Russia was behind the recent hacks of Democratic organizations, wondering aloud if it might instead be China or a single hacker who \u201cweighs 400 pounds\u201d and sits at home. \u25a0 After Mrs. Clinton suggested she was worried about Mr. Trump getting his hands on the nuclear codes, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cThat line is getting a little bit old. \u201d Mrs. Clinton mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201csecret plan,\u201d as she called it, to fight the Islamic State, saying he had no true strategy. She also sought to reassure American allies that the country would honor its international commitments, saying some of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments during the campaign had startled them. \u25a0 Asked about his propagation of the conspiracy theory raising doubts about Mr. Obama\u2019s birth, Mr. Trump tried to blame Mrs. Clinton, suggesting falsely that she, too, had questioned the president\u2019s birthplace. \u201cShe failed to get the birth certificate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got involved, I didn\u2019t fail. \u201d Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump had \u201creally started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen,\u201d calling his efforts \u201cvery hurtful. \u201d \u25a0 Pressed on his refusal to release his tax returns, Mr. Trump repeated an   line that he is facing \u201ca routine audit\u201d that precluded him from releasing the information. Mr. Holt noted that the I. R. S. had said he was free to release anything he wanted. Mr. Trump said he would \u201crelease my tax returns, against my lawyers\u2019 wishes,\u201d if Mrs. Clinton agreed to release a cache of her emails. \u25a0 Asked if she believed police officers were \u201cimplicitly biased\u201d against   Mrs. Clinton suggested that all Americans were susceptible to bias. \u201cI think unfortunately too many of us in this great country jump to conclusions about each other,\u201d she said. \u25a0 Asked about race relations, Mrs. Clinton said that race remained \u201ca significant challenge\u201d in the country, adding that the criminal justice system treated minorities differently. Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to use a couple of words\u201d  \u2014   law and order  \u2014   before defending the contentious    police strategy. \u201c  and Hispanics are living in hell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou walk down the streets, you get shot. \u201d \u25a0 After Mr. Trump defended his plans to lower taxes on the wealthy, mixing in jabs at Mrs. Clinton, she joked, \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I\u2019m going to be blamed for everything that\u2019s ever happened. \u201d Mr. Trump replied, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Mr. Holt reminded Mr. Trump that he was speaking during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allotted time. \u25a0 Mr. Trump boasted about his campaign travels. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me, I\u2019ve been all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou decided to stay home and that\u2019s okay. \u201d Mrs. Clinton replied that she did indeed prepare for the debate, adding that she was preparing to be president, too. \u25a0 Hitting Mr. Trump over his tax returns, Mrs. Clinton wondered if there was \u201csomething he\u2019s hiding,\u201d before addressing her own use of a private email as secretary of state. \u201cI made a mistake using a private email,\u201d she said. Mr. Trump cut in, \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. \u201d Mrs. Clinton added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake. \u201d \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton condemned Mr. Trump for refusing to pay contractors on several projects, saying she was grateful her father had never done business with him. She said the debate crowd included an architect whom Mr. Trump had not paid. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do a good job,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton, seeking to portray Mr. Trump as an enemy of working people, said he had \u201crooted for the housing crisis\u201d because of the financial opportunities it might afford him. \u201cThat\u2019s called business, by the way,\u201d he interjected. \u25a0 Mr. Trump  \u2014   criticizing trade deals approved by Bill Clinton, among others  \u2014   suggested Mrs. Clinton had failed to improve people\u2019s lives during her decades in public life. As Mrs. Clinton defended her record, he interrupted frequently. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done it. You haven\u2019t done it,\u201d he said. \u201cExcuse me. \u201d Mrs. Clinton shot back, \u201cDonald, I know you live in your own reality,\u201d before continuing her answer. \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton, looking toward Mr. Trump, said it was \u201cgood to be with\u201d him on the same stage at last. \u201cYou have to judge us,\u201d she said, in a response to a question about job creation. \u201cWho can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency?\u201d Mr. Trump replied that \u201cour jobs are fleeing the country. \u201d \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s fiscal plans as \u201c    economics,\u201d before saying he had received millions of dollars of support from his father. \u201cMy father gave me a very small loan,\u201d he replied, before appearing to hesitate while addressing Mrs. Clinton. \u201cSecretary Clinton? Is that O. K.?\u201d he said of her title. \u201cGood. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563519.321208}
