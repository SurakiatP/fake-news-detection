Zakaria said, \u201cBut first here\u2019s my take. There has been much focus onDonaldd Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy. The out landish positions, the many   the outright mistakes, but far more damaging in the long run might be what some have termed the Trump effect. The impact of Donald Trump on the domestic politics of other countries. That effect appears to be powerful, negative, and enduring. It could undermine decades of American foreign policy successes. He added, \u201cIn foreign policy, great statesmen always keep in mind one crucial reality, every country has its own domestic politics. crude rhetoric, outlandish demands, poorly thought through policies, cheap shots, all place foreign leaders in a box. They cannot be perceived as surrendering to America and certainly not to an America led by someone who insists on showing that for America to win others must lose. That\u2019s one big difference among many between doing a real estate deal and managing foreign policy. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562520.189938}
