My host was stoic, strong, a Viking. I was whining. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to go out there,\u201d I said. \u201cHow do you make yourself do it?\u201d \u201cYou must, to swim in the pool,\u201d Valdimar Hafstein said with a shrug. He is a folklorist at the University of Iceland who studies the country\u2019s pools. \u201cKids hate it, too. I have to haul my kids kicking and screaming. \u201d I took a deep breath and tried to think of warm things. Wearing only a Speedo bathing suit  \u2014   I had packed three, in honor of the island\u2019s reputation as one of the company\u2019s most avid markets  \u2014   I stepped onto the deck. It was a few degrees below freezing. Imagine the feeling you get when you hold an ice cube tight, that combination of sting and ache, except imagine it all over your nearly nude body. Battling my   ingrained instincts never to run at a swimming pool, I fell into a kind of brisk   aiming for the large set of interconnected hot tubs in the center of the complex. I\u2019m sure I looked ridiculous. The good news: I\u2019d never been less concerned about my appearance while wearing almost nothing in public. Small snowflakes glittered in the sky, which at 4 p. m. was already darkening toward dusk. I reached the largest hot tub and sank to my chin. For one glorious moment, I felt my mind go blank: There was just my body, my big, stupid body in its stupid bathing suit, enveloped in warmth, the cold wind on my ears only heightening my delight. Behind me, Valdimar ambled across the deck, saying hello to a neighbor in another hot pot. Every Icelandic town, no matter how small, has its own pool. There are ramshackle cement rectangles squatting under rain clouds in the   boonies. There are fancy aquatic complexes with multilevel hot tubs and awesomely dangerous water slides of the sort that litigious American culture would never allow. All told, there are more than 120 public pools  \u2014   usually geothermally heated, mostly outdoors, open all year long  \u2014   in Iceland, a country with a population just slightly larger than that of Lexington, Ky. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a swimming pool, it seems you may as well not even be a town,\u201d the mayor of Reykjavik, Dagur Eggertsson, told me. I interviewed him, of course, as we relaxed together in a downtown hot tub. These public pools, or sundlaugs, serve as the communal heart of Iceland, sacred places whose affordability and ubiquity are viewed as a kind of civil right. Families and teenagers and older people lounge and chat in sundlaugs every day, summer or winter. Despite Iceland\u2019s cruel climate, its remoteness and its winters of 19 hours of darkness per day, the people there are among the most contented in the world. The more local swimming pools I visited, the more convinced I became that Icelanders\u2019 remarkable satisfaction is tied inextricably to the experience of escaping the fierce, freezing air and sinking into warm water among their countrymen. The pools are more than a humble municipal investment, more than just a civic perquisite that emerged from an accident of Iceland\u2019s volcanic geology. They seem to be, in fact, a key to Icelandic   being. This past winter, I visited Iceland and swam in 14 pools all over the country. I found them full of Icelanders eager to discuss what role these underwater village greens played in their lives. I met recent immigrants to the Westfjords town Bolungarvik as they mingled with their new neighbors, their toddler carrying fresh handfuls of snow into the hot tub and delightedly watching them melt. I saw Icelandic parents splash with their kids to calm them before bedtime I talked to adults who remembered that ritual from childhood and could summon the memory of slipping their   bodies between cool sheets. I heard stories of divorcing couples splitting their local pools along with their possessions and retired couples bonding by swimming together every day. I watched four steaming septuagenarians swim laps in a northern Iceland pool while the sunrise lit up the mountains behind them and an attendant brought out foam cups of coffee balanced on a kickboard. \u201cI think the swimming pools are what make it possible to live here,\u201d the young artist Ragnheidur Harpa Leifsdottir said. \u201cYou have storms, you have darkness, but the swimming pool is a place for you to find yourself again. \u201d For centuries, Iceland was a nation of seamen who regularly drowned within sight of shore. One local newspaper reported in 1887 that more than 100 Icelanders had drowned that winter alone. In 1931, a boat carrying four farmers capsized while they tried to row a panicking cow across Kollafjordur fjord. Three of the men died one, who had studied swimming, survived. Incidents like this fostered an enthusiasm for swimming education. At the time, the only place to learn was a muddy ditch downstream from the hot spring where the women of Reykjavik did laundry. Inspired by that hot spring, and using a heavily mortgaged drill that had been brought to Iceland to search fruitlessly for gold, the city soon tapped the underground hot water generated by Iceland\u2019s volcanic underbelly. Iceland\u2019s first geothermal heat flowed into 70 homes and three civic buildings: a school, a hospital and a swimming pool. The national energy authority offered   loans to villages across the country to encourage geothermal drilling, and within a generation, the ancient turf house had nearly disappeared from Iceland, replaced by modern apartment buildings and homes, all of them so toasty warm that even on winter nights most Icelanders leave a window open. With hot water flowing through the country and a populace eager to take a dip  \u2014   swimming education was made mandatory in all Icelandic schools in 1943  \u2014   pools soon popped up in every town. \u201cBecause of the weather, we don\u2019t have proper plazas in the Italian or French style,\u201d the writer Magnus Sveinn Helgason explained to me. \u201cBeer was banned in Iceland until 1989, so we don\u2019t have the pub tradition of England or Ireland. \u201d The pool is Iceland\u2019s social space: where families meet neighbors, where newcomers first receive welcome, where rivals can\u2019t avoid one another. It can be hard for reserved Icelanders, who \u201cdon\u2019t typically talk to their neighbors in the store or in the street,\u201d to forge connections, Mayor Dagur told me. (Icelanders generally use patronymic and matronymic last names and refer to everyone, even the mayor, by first name.) \u201cIn the hot tub, you must interact,\u201d Mayor Dagur continued. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to do. \u201d Not only must you interact you must do so in a state of quite literal exposure. Most Icelanders have a story about taking visitors, often American, to the pools and then seeing them balk in horror at the strict requirement to strip naked, shower and scrub their bodies with soap from head to toe. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s locker rooms feature posters highlighting all the regions you must lather assiduously: head, armpits, undercarriage, feet. Icelanders are very serious about these rules, which are necessary because the pools are only lightly chlorinated tourists and shy teenagers are often scolded by pool wardens for insufficient showering. The practice was even the subject of a popular sketch on the comedy show \u201cFostbraedur,\u201d in which a zealous warden scrubs down a reluctant pool visitor himself. That one of the   naked bystanders in that viral video, Jon Gnarr, was later elected mayor of Reykjavik demonstrates that Icelanders are quite     conscious about nudity in the service of pool cleanliness. This was made most clear to me, perhaps, in a dressing room in the town Isafjordur, where a chatty   store manager named Snorri Grimsson told me a long story about the time a beautiful Australian girl asked him to go to the pool but then revealed that she doesn\u2019t shower before swimming. He mugged a look of comic horror, then brought home the kicker: \u201cIt was a very difficult decision. Thankfully, the pool was closed!\u201d I could tell this bit killed with his fellow Icelanders, but my own appreciation of it was somewhat impeded by Snorri\u2019s delivery of it in the nude, his left foot on the sink, stretching like a ballet dancer at the barre. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d an actress named Salome Gunnarsdottir told me in the pool one evening. \u201cGrowing up here, we see all kinds of real women\u2019s bodies.       olds,   aged, pregnant women. Not just people in magazines or on TV. \u201d Her friends, all in their 20s and pregaming for a Saturday night out in the bars, nodded enthusiastically. \u201cEspecially pregnant women,\u201d Helga Gunnhildursdottir agreed. \u201cYou can see: Oh yes, she really got quite big. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so important,\u201d Salome said earnestly. \u201cYou get used to breasts and vaginas!\u201d As a journalist, I will never forget the uniquely Icelandic experience of shaking hands with handsome Mayor Dagur and then, just minutes later, interviewing him as we each bared all. (In the tradition of politician interviews everywhere, an aide lurked nearby, in a manner I would call unobtrusive but for the fact that he was also naked.) I admit I found this disconcerting at first, but eventually there was something comforting about seeing all those other chests and butts and guts  \u2014   which for the most part belonged to normal   being bodies, not sculpted masterpieces. And that comfort extends out into the pool proper, where you might be covered  \u2014   only a little, in my case  \u2014   but are still on display. But   nudity, by encouraging a slight remove from others, also allows the visitor to focus, in a profound and unfamiliar way, on his own body, on its responses and needs. Despite its being a social hub, the pool also cultivates inwardness. Results of a questionnaire distributed by Valdimar\u2019s research team suggested that women in particular go to the pool to seek solitude. According to women I talked to, most everyone respects the posture of aquatic reverie  \u2014   head tilted back against the pool wall, eyes closed, mouth smiling a tiny smile of satisfaction  \u2014   that you adopt when you come to the pool wanting to be left alone. Sigurlaug Dagsdottir, a graduate student researching the pools, speculated that the sundlaugs\u2019 social utility in Icelandic communities derives in part from the intimacy of the physical experience: In the pool, she said, you can \u201ctake off the five layers of clothing that usually separate you from everyone else. \u201d As such, the pools are a great leveler: Council members in Reykjavik make a point to circulate among the city\u2019s sundlaugs, where they often take   natured grief from their constituents. The filmmaker Jon Karl Helgason, who is shooting a documentary about Iceland\u2019s pools, said, \u201cWhen people are in the swimming pool, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a doctor or a taxi driver. \u201d His girlfriend, Fridgerdur Gudmundsdottir, added, \u201cEveryone is dressed the same. \u201d On the way from Reykjavik to Keflavik airport is the Blue Lagoon, a luxurious   water spa that is one of Iceland\u2019s most popular tourist destinations. There, for 40 euros, you can shower in private stalls and float in   rich water  \u2014   discharge from the nearby Svartsengi power plant, which uses turbines twice as tall as a man to generate 75 megawatts of electricity and 150 thermal megawatts of heat for the surrounding towns. My final day in Iceland, I turned off the highway just after the Blue Lagoon and instead drove into one of those towns, the port Rekjanesbaer. The lobby of the town\u2019s pool is dotted, fittingly, by a series of   like windows. The woman working at the desk charged me nine bucks and asked, \u201cIs this your first time in an Iceland swimming pool?\u201d \u201cNope,\u201d I said with some pleasure. The familiar signs in the showers were supplemented by notices in Polish, targeting the new wave of immigrants who have found work in Rekjanesbaer. I snapped on my Speedo, steeled my courage and exited the warm lodge into the chill. The         Celsius hot pot was full of enormous men with   type physiques and also a small girl in a pink ruffled bathing suit. The largest of the Blutos rose from the water, picked up the girl and carried her, giggling, to the family pool. His biceps sported a tattoo of a roaring bear consumed by flames. This time I didn\u2019t approach anyone, didn\u2019t ask any questions. I didn\u2019t speak at all. I concentrated on what I could feel: the water pressing lightly on my skin, the wind prickling my beard. All around me was the soft white noise of a community. The conversation the connection the freedom, within that flurry of sociability, to withdraw and simply be within yourself. It called to mind something a Ph. D. student named Katrin Gudmundsdottir told me on my first day in Iceland. She was describing a certain ineffable emotional state to me, a native Icelander\u2019s sense of comfort while immersed in her neighborhood sundlaug. When I thought of what she said, a perfect G chord strummed inside me. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly like you\u2019re happy,\u201d she had mused. \u201cIt\u2019s that you know how to be in the swimming pool. \u201d The sun was low on the horizon, bright but evanescent. The only other thing in the   blue sky was the contrail of a jet, pointed to the west. I closed my eyes. I was in the pool.'"}, "time": 1742561654.5208988}
