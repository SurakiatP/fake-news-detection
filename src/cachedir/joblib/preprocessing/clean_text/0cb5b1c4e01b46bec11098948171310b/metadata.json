Ted Lieu ( ) called Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201ca racist and a liar\u201d on Sunday after he referred to Hawaii as \u201can island in the Pacific\u201d in response to a federal judge who issued an order to block President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary visa ban. [Dear \u201dAttorney General\u201d Sessions: You are a racist and a liar. Actually, just joking. Oh wait, your record shows you are a racist  a liar. https:  .   \u2014   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) April 23, 2017,   \u201cDear \u2018Attorney General\u2019 Sessions,\u201d Lieu wrote on his Twitter account. \u201cYou are a racist and a liar. Actually, just joking. Oh wait, your record shows you are a racist  a liar. \u201d However, investigations have revealed that allegations of racism and dishonesty pushed by the left to discredit Sessions are part of what has become known as \u201cfake news. \u201d Prior to that tweet, Lieu attempted to mock Sessions again by reminding the accomplished attorney that \u201cHawaii is a state  HQ of UNITED STATES Pacific Command:\u201d Dear AG Jeff Sessions: There is a document called the Constitution. Read it. Oh, and Hawaii is a state  HQ of UNITED STATES Pacific Command https:  .   \u2014   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) April 20, 2017,  Sessions made the comments about Hawaii in an interview with \u201cThe Mark Levin Show\u201d last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got cases moving in the very, very liberal Ninth Circuit, who, they\u2019ve been hostile to the order,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWe are confident that the President will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. \u201d He added, \u201cI really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. \u201d Sessions\u2019 statement was in response to federal Judge Derrick Watson\u2019s order that blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary visa ban on travelers entering the United States from six (formerly seven)   countries. The temporary ban is meant to allow the U. S. government to properly vet individuals listed on it. The countries listed in the initial ban are Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen Iraq has since been taken off the list. The U. S. Department of Justice is appealing Judge Watson\u2019s decision. According to the Associated Press, U. S. Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior clarified Sessions\u2019 statements in an email, saying the attorney general was questioning one judge\u2019s ability to block the president\u2019s executive order for the travel ban. \u201cHawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific  \u2014   a beautiful one where the Attorney General\u2019s granddaughter was born,\u201d Prior said. \u201cThe point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President\u2019s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe. \u201d In a Sunday interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on \u201cThis Week\u201d about why he referred to Hawaii as an \u201cisland in the Pacific,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cNobody has a sense of humor anymore. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564135.3462172}
