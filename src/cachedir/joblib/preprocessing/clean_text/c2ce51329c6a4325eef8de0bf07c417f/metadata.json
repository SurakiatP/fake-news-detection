Editors can be heard claiming there is \u201cno debate\u201d on climate change while calling Fox News \u201cunbearable. \u201d[Joe Sterling, who was then News Desk Editor for CNN\u2019s online venue \u201cThe Wire\u201d was recorded dismissing any skepticism on the climate change issue, and comparing it to creationism.  \u201cThat issue, climate change, I mean science is pretty much on board and there are a few dissenters. There\u2019s no debate. It\u2019s like, you know,   saying there\u2019s a debate over, you know creationism, and all that stuff. There is no debate. \u201d The tapes reveal more bias from   Assignment Desk Editor Nicky Robinson, who can be heard attacking   channel Fox News. \u201cFox News, I think Fox News is unbearable. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Robinson can be heard saying. Over 119 hours of raw audio from inside CNN has been released by Project Veritas, with over 100 more hours yet to be released. The audio was recorded in 2009 by an anonymous whistleblower inside CNN\u2019s Atlanta headquarters, identified only as \u201cMiss X. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got 100 million people out there who\u2019ve got   to speak for them\u201d said Project Veritas founder James O\u2019Keefe at a press conference announcing the leaks. \u201cProject Veritas is determined to expose malfeasance, corruption, and wrongdoing. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve already have two whistleblowers come forward since we announced these tapes. People are coming to us now, on the inside. \u201d In a comment to Breitbart Tech, O\u2019Keefe spoke of his concern at the growing leftist bias of social media companies, and warned them that Project Veritas would investigate them too. \u201cYes we know about it, we\u2019re concerned about it, we\u2019re fighting it\u201d said O\u2019Keefe, responding to our question about social media bias. \u201c[CNN Leaks] is the first in a long effort to target and expose abuse within the media, and that includes social media. Who knows? Maybe we have someone inside with a camera right now, recording everything. \u201d You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter and add him on Facebook.
