Here are some moments to remember: Soon after delivering a tremulous speech addressed to the TV audience (\u201cHate will never win\u201d) the Tonys host, James Corden, dove into a breathless   of 20 Broadway hits, concluding with some elegant hoofing to \u201cWe\u2019re in the Money\u201d from \u201c42nd Street. \u201d \u201cThink of tonight as the Oscars, but with diversity,\u201d Mr. Corden joked in his opening monologue. And the show delivered: In a first for Broadway, Tony voters gave the four musical performance awards to black actors: Cynthia Erivo of \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and Leslie Odom Jr. Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry and Daveed Diggs of \u201cHamilton. \u201d In his acceptance speech for best score for \u201cHamilton,\u201d   Miranda provided the broadcast\u2019s emotional high point, reading a sonnet he had written that cited \u201csenseless acts of tragedy\u201d and included the repeated \u201cand love is love, is love, is love, is love\u201d that brought down the house. Asked later why he decided to address the situation this way, he said: \u201cWe live in this world where beautiful and horrible things exist at the same time. You can\u2019t let that go by, particularly when theater doesn\u2019t exist without the L. G. B. T. community. \u201d Not only did a pregnant Audra McDonald tap her heart out in the \u201cShuffle Along\u201d production number, she later presented the prize for best actress in a musical  \u2014   a category in which she was overlooked. With six Tonys already, it\u2019s easier to take things in stride. In winning best leading actor in a play for \u201cThe Father,\u201d Frank Langella tied Boyd Gaines for the most Tonys won by a male actor. He used his acceptance speech to movingly remember the victims of the massacre in Orlando, Fla. \u201cI\u2019m now a    man, and I react to things a lot more profoundly than I did when I was 60, when I was 50 or 40,\u201d Mr. Langella said. \u201cThis constant violence and sense of madness that seems to be pervading this country is terrifying. \u201d He continued: \u201cI urge you, Orlando, to be strong. I\u2019m standing in a room full of the most generous human beings on earth, and we will be with you every step of the way. \u201d Mr. Langella\u2019s other Tonys were for his roles in \u201cSeascape\u201d (1975) \u201cFortune\u2019s Fool\u201d (2002) and \u201c \u201d (2007). The costume designer William Ivey Long said he scrambled to make some 3, 000 commemorative ribbons in the basement of the Beacon Theater, where the ceremony was held. In an interview on the red carpet, Mr. Long said the ribbons were a small way for Broadway to show its support for the victims and their families in Orlando. \u201dYou\u2019re helpless because you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to open our arms and show love, that we understand. \u201d Mr. Diggs almost upstaged his own acceptance speech by wearing a jacket with gaudy patchwork sleeves that you almost couldn\u2019t take your eyes off. Meanwhile, Barbra Streisand\u2019s   look seemed almost a spoiler, giving the nod to \u201cHamilton\u201d as best musical before she\u2019d even opened the envelope. She joked, \u201cThank God I picked the right outfit. \u201d As the camera panned to show nominees for best director of a musical, it focused on the actor Christopher Fitzgerald, not Michael Arden, the director of \u201cSpring Awakening. \u201d Mr. Arden later tweeted: \u201cIf you know anything about me I\u2019ve spent the last 10 years of my life  \u2014   what some would consider the lifeblood of a woman\u2019s career  \u2014   just trying to have children. And I get to testify in front of all of you that the Lord gave me Benjamin and Brielle and then he still gave me this. Thank you. \u201d  \u2014   Ms. Goldsberry accepting her Tony. From the show\u2019s opening number, in which Mr. Corden glanced back fondly on his formative years as a bespectacled kid with big dreams, parents were paid tribute throughout the night for the encouragement they offered and sacrifices they made for their   sons and daughters. In his acceptance speech, Mr. Diggs thanked his father for joining him in a preschool gymnastics performance in which they both wore \u201cmatching rainbow tights,\u201d and his mother for \u201cpermission to do something that everyone else wasn\u2019t doing. \u201d Later in the program, Mr. Corden found his father in the audience and asked him how he thought the show was going. \u201cIt\u2019s great, mate,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s going on a bit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Compiled by Mike Hale, Scott Heller, Charles Isherwood, Dave Itzkoff and Erik Piepenburg.'"}, "time": 1742564168.4797287}
