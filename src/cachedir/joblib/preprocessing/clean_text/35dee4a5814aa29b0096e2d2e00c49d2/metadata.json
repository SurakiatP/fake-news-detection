But as performed by a ragtag chorus of displaced persons in Theater for a New Audience\u2019s spirited revival of Thornton Wilder\u2019s \u201cThe Skin of Our Teeth,\u201d the choice of song feels fitting, resourceful, valiant and  \u2014   for just those reasons  \u2014   very moving. The scene comes near the end of the first act of this wobbly mammoth of a play, which opened on Tuesday night at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn. And as often happens in the director Arin Arbus\u2019s heartfelt interpretation of Wilder\u2019s 1942 cosmic comedy, the sequence\u2019s elements register as both exceedingly whimsical and disturbingly familiar. What\u2019s being portrayed, after all, is an earth succumbing to climate change, which means that although it is high summer, a glacier is advancing on Excelsior, N. J. where a home has become a haven for a swarm of refugees, whose admittance was a subject of angry argument among the family that lives there. And what may be the last fire on the planet is about to go out. It is hardly a cause for celebration that the alarm bells being rung here sound as resonant today as they must have in the early 1940s, when the United States was on the brink of world war. Yet a celebratory glow pervades this   portrait of a single family\u2019s survival against the odds through freeze, famine and war. \u201cThe Skin of Our Teeth\u201d can be quaint, creaky and tedious. But it feels as perversely suitable to 2017 as \u201cJingle Bells\u201d does to the Ice Age. When the play first opened, with a dazzling cast led by Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead, Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that it stood \u201chead and shoulders above the monotonous plane of our moribund theater. \u201d Atkinson particularly admired Wilder\u2019s \u201cmischievous ideas about the informality of good theater. \u201d But while he adored the first third of \u201cSkin,\u201d he was less enamored of the two other acts. He wasn\u2019t wrong. That first act, which places a    American family on the edge of extinction in the Ice Age, still feels as fresh as morning and as old as Moses (who happens to appear in it). But as it continues to follow the allegorical Antrobus clan in its   struggle for survival (through a   flood on the boardwalks of Atlantic City and a   world war) \u201cSkin\u201d can wear thin. Recent revivals  \u2014   including a misguided whopper in Central Park in 1998, starring John Goodman  \u2014   have suggested that the play had gone the way of its singing dinosaurs. Wilder\u2019s starker \u201cOur Town\u201d and robust \u201cThe Matchmaker\u201d (the basis for the musical \u201cHello, Dolly! \u201d) seemed far more likely candidates for survival. Ms. Arbus  \u2014   whose fruitful association with Theater for a New Audience has yielded a bright string of cleareyed productions of classics  \u2014   doesn\u2019t entirely restore \u201cSkin\u201d to newborn sprightliness. But she makes you appreciate why its first audiences cherished it. Her production does particularly well by Wilder\u2019s inspired notion to have the improvisatory spirit of \u201ctheater, interrupted\u201d reflect the   persistence of life itself. From its first moments (and it\u2019s all in the script) the production is troubled by falling scenery, electrical blackouts and a temperamental actress who refuses to stay in character. That\u2019s the woman who plays Sabina, the Antrobus\u2019s mantrap of a maid, embodied with original comic flair by Mary Wiseman, who brings to mind not so much Ms. Bankhead (who created the part) as a young Lucille Ball with an attitude. It is Sabina who guides us  \u2014   irascibly and apologetically  \u2014   through the willful anachronisms of the play. Its central archetypal clan is made up of Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus (David Rasche and Kecia Lewis) and their children Gladys (Kimber Monroe) and Henry (Reynaldo Piniella) who was originally named Cain. Mr. Antrobus is an inventor of genius (his contributions include the wheel, the lever and the alphabet) while his wife is a fierce defender of family. As for Sabina, she\u2019s basically Lilith, the eternal temptress, there to lead good men like Mr. Antrobus astray. In its sexual politics (and its Oedipal confrontations) \u201cSkin\u201d can feel agonizingly dated. And despite solid performances by Mr. Rasche and Ms. Lewis, the configuring of this eternal triangle occupies entirely too much stage time. It\u2019s as a   production that this \u201cSkin\u201d captures, tickles and distresses the imagination. Ms. Arbus has enlisted a crackerjack production team  \u2014   including Riccardo Hernandez (sets) and Cait O\u2019Connor (the commedia dell\u2019  costumes and puppets)  \u2014   and a diverse cast of nearly three dozen (including a fierce Mary Lou Rosato as a boardwalk soothsayer) to fill Wilder\u2019s   canvas. The production deploys them with wit and efficiency, while retaining an endearing air of ramshackle spontaneity. The script has updated its anachronisms (Trader Joe\u2019s instead of A  P) and features some stirring contemporary songs by C\u00e9sar Alvarez about the search for home. \u201cSo many years I have been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of a place to call my own,\u201d the refugees sing, toward the first act\u2019s end. By that point, it\u2019s looking as if they may all freeze to death. So when Ms. Wiseman steps out of character to ask the audience to bring its chairs to the stage to stoke the fire, there\u2019s no question that were we able to oblige, we would. At such moments, \u201cSkin\u201d becomes a welcome pep rally for a world that could use some reassurance that it will, despite everything, carry on.'"}, "time": 1742562790.303339}
