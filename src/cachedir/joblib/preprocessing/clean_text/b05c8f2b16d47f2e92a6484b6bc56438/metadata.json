[The Social Weather Stations (SWS) polling occurs after every annual quarter, this poll taken between March 25 to 28 but published Monday. The SWS poll found that ten percent of the 1, 200 respondents had \u201clittle\u201d trust in Duterte, and another nearly 11 percent were undecided. Reuters notes that this represents a   drop from his   \u201cmuch trust\u201d approval rating in December 2016. Throughout the entirety of SWS\u2019s tracking of Duterte  \u2014   since December 2015  \u2014   Duterte has remained near the   mark, with his highest rating at 84 percent after his election but before his inauguration. Reuters adds that Duterte\u2019s initial trust rating in December 2015 was at 47 percent.  Duterte\u2019s ratings are better with men than women, as 83 percent of men and 79 percent of women say they had \u201cmuch trust\u201d in the president, gaining one percentage point among men and one among women. Regionally, his best ratings came from his native Mindanao, a southern Philippine island, where 90 percent of respondents said they had \u201cmuch trust\u201d in Duterte, down from 92 percent in December. The Philippine Star notes that the presidential palace announced the numbers with pride, as SWS deems an 80 percent \u201cmuch trust\u201d percentage as an \u201cexcellent\u201d approval rating. \u201cThe President continues to be the most trusted national leader today,\u201d presidential spokesman Ernesto Arbella told reporters. \u201cHis net trust rating has been excellent for four consecutive quarters, considering the deeply entrenched culture of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption. \u201d Duterte\u2019s enduring popularity appears unaffected by a global campaign to raise awareness about his call for extrajudicial killings against drug suspects. Duterte, who won the presidency on a campaign to eradicate drug crime calling upon his   tenure as the mayor of Davao City, where he enacted sprawling   initiatives. Duterte has encouraged civilians to kill suspected drug criminals and offered them bounties. He also claimed to have killed suspects himself as mayor. In December, SWS found that his policies against drugs were largely popular. While 80 percent of respondents said they personally feared being killed as part of Duterte\u2019s drug war, 85 percent said they approved of Duterte\u2019s approach to solving the problem.   a regional broadcast outlet, quotes experts stating that Duterte\u2019s popularity is largely the product of his populist,   image. \u201cHe comes across very strongly as \u2018makamasa\u2019 and it\u2019s not only giving an impression, he packs that with good action,\u201d Fr. Ranhilio Aquino, dean of the San Beda Graduate School of Law, told the outlet. \u201cMakamasa\u201d is a Tagalog term roughly meaning \u201cman of the people. \u201d Duterte refuses to live in the presidential palace, Malacanang, in Manila, for fear of it being haunted by late presidents. Instead, he lives in his humble Mindanao home while he is not in the capital. In January, Duterte hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his home instead of Malacanang, offering him a traditional breakfast and his favorite mosquito net. The positive ratings for Duterte arrive as he embarks on a foreign policy venture around Asia. The presidential palace announced that Duterte will leave the country on May 10 to visit Cambodia, Hong Kong, and China. Among the items on Duterte\u2019s agenda is a meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) where an estimated 700 \u201cleaders from business, government, and civil society groups\u201d will convene. Duterte\u2019s visit to China also arrives following what appears to be a shift in policy from the Philippine president, who once boasted of seeking to sever ties with the United States to get closer to Beijing but has since offered President Donald Trump \u201cfull friendship and cooperation. \u201d Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742563402.0534828}
