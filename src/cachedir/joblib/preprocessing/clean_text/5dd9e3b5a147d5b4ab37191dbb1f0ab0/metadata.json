The voice spoke of a bomb loaded with shrapnel and of an imminent \u201cblood bath. \u201d Moments later, the caller hung up. The   threat to a Jewish community center turned out to be a hoax. The warning was one of at least 100 that Jewish community centers and schools have reported since the beginning of the year, a menacing pattern that has upended daily life for people in 33 states and prompted a federal investigation that has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers, security specialists and Jewish leaders. Combined with the recent vandalism at Jewish cemeteries in Missouri and Pennsylvania, the calls have stoked fears that a virulent   has increasingly taken hold in the early days of the Trump administration. At the beginning of an address to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said the episodes, along with last week\u2019s attack on two Indian immigrants in Kansas, \u201cremind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. \u201d In a meeting with state attorneys general earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested that the threats and destruction might be a politically coordinated effort to \u201cmake people look bad,\u201d according to the attorneys general of Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. \u201cFirst, he said the acts were reprehensible,\u201d said Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who asked Mr. Trump about the episodes during a session at the White House. \u201cSecond, he said: \u2018And you\u2019ve got to be careful it could be the reverse. This could be the reverse, trying to make people look bad. \u2019\u201d Jewish leaders denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to the attorneys general, and some urged the federal government to accelerate its investigation of the threatening calls, the latest of which came on Monday. \u201cThe person or persons doing this have broken the law, and it\u2019s the responsibility of our system to investigate it and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible,\u201d said David Posner, the director of strategic performance for the JCC Association of North America. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been leading an inquiry since January, and a federal law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss a continuing investigation, said that a single person may be making the threats using an internet calling service. Independent analysts, including extremism researchers and retired law enforcement officials, share that theory and said that, so far, they have seen no evidence of an organized effort. Though some people had suspected that the calls were recorded and automated, there was evidence to the contrary. In Milwaukee, for instance, a switchboard operator asked questions and received responses from the caller, said Mark Shapiro, the president of the Harry and Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center. Mr. Posner said an F. B. I. official had emphasized that the investigation was a priority for the bureau, involving experts in behavioral analysis, civil rights and hate groups. \u201cAgents and analysts across the country are working to identify and stop those responsible,\u201d Stephen Richardson, the bureau\u2019s assistant director for the criminal investigative division, said. \u201cWe will work to make sure that people of all races and religions feel safe in their communities and in their places of worship. \u201d According to Mr. Posner\u2019s group, more than 80 community centers and day schools in the United States and Canada have been threatened, some repeatedly. The calls have come in five rounds, most recently on Monday, when there were 31 threats. Many of the calls have prompted evacuations and bomb sweeps, forcing schoolchildren from classrooms and employees to push cribs full of infants into parking lots. Retirees have been rushed from swimming pools, and offices and streets shut down. The threats are frequent and alarming, community center leaders said. \u201cMy initial reaction was, \u2018This is our turn,\u2019\u201d said Karen Kolodny, the executive director of the JCC of   in Scarsdale, N. Y. where officials responded to a bomb threat on Monday. \u201cMy reaction was not complete shock. We thought it was going to happen at some point. \u201d F. B. I. data shows that most hate crimes are linked to race, ethnicity or ancestry. In 2015, the most recent year for which federal data has been released, the authorities recorded 664 episodes they classified as  . Analysts said they believed that   commentary online before last year\u2019s presidential election had gradually escalated into more sinister behavior toward the Jewish institutions, which have long prepared for threats and often employ private security. \u201cYou started out with the hostile tweets,\u201d said Mitchell D. Silber, who was director of intelligence analysis for the New York Police Department. \u201cYou moved to the bomb threats against JCCs and other institutions, and now you have a physical manifestation at the cemeteries with the gravestones knocked over. \u201d Although the F. B. I. is investigating damage to headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia, the episode there, as well as a similar one near St. Louis, is not believed to have been the work of anyone behind the bomb threats. The bureau\u2019s inquiry into the bomb threats is likely complicated by the reality that criminals have embraced new technology, said Ronald T. Hosko, one of Mr. Richardson\u2019s predecessors as an assistant F. B. I. director. \u201cThis is unlikely to be little twisted Johnny calling from his parents\u2019 house,\u201d Mr. Hosko said. Instead, Mr. Hosko suggested, the caller could be relying on libraries, restaurants or other public places with internet access, sites that might be equipped with surveillance cameras that the F. B. I. could use to help identify someone who frequented those places at the dates and times of the calls. Each new threat, Mr. Hosko said, increased the odds of an arrest. \u201cEvery one of those contacts presents another opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another dot in the pattern analysis. \u201d As the threats have poured in, from Albuquerque to Nashville to Providence, there have been rising worries over whether people might stay away from the centers, which also serve people of other religious backgrounds. Some have fretted that the intense public attention might be encouraging whoever is behind the calls. \u201cGiven that this is happening wave after wave, there are concerns for people\u2019s families, and people are concerned about whether they should still send their kids to JCCs,\u201d said Oren Segal, the director of the   League\u2019s Center on Extremism. \u201cWhen communities start   like this, it is incredibly alarming and disruptive and serves the purpose of whoever is carrying out these threats. \u201d But Jewish institution leaders, in interviews and in conversations with one another, have expressed more frustration than fear. \u201cBy attacking the JCC, they\u2019re really attacking what is best about America: the diversity, the pluralism, the inclusion that one faith community can be as welcoming to other faith communities and demonstrate that through deeds on the ground,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we will never surrender. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562170.1742916}
