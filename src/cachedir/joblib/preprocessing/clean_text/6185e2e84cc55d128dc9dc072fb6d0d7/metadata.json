Some are waking up.\u201d \\nWhile most of the police officers at the scene of the DAPL protests have been brutal, violent, and unconstitutionally-militarized, it is clear from this recent act of solidarity that some of their hearts can be turned to the cause of justice. \\nThis recent incident is reminiscent of what happened in Frankfurt , Germany in May of 2012, when police removed their helmets and began marching with the people protesting big banks. \\nAccording to the Washington Post , \u201cAt least 20,000 people held a major rally of the local Occupy movement inFrankfurt on Saturday to decry austerity measures affecting much of Europe, the dominance of banks, and what they call untamed capitalism .\u201d \\nYesterday, Barack Obama announced that the White House is considering \u201cre-routing\u201d the pipeline to honor the 1851 Indian Treaty that guarantees the land in question to the Standing Rock Nation.
