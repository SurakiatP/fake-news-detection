During Sankara\u2019s short time in power, Burkina Faso became self-sufficient in grains. \u201cHe was the first to forbid female genital mutilation, and included women in all realms of public administration.\u201d His killer, Blaise Compaor\u00e9, ruled for 27 years, until run out of the country in 2014 . This article previously appeared in The Dawn [3] . \u201cHe created the Communist Officers\u2019 Group, which overthrew the government on November 7, 1982.\u201d Earlier this month, Burkina Faso began to exhume the remains of the leader that founded the country in 1984. They seek to reveal the murderous conspiracy that ended his life, after four years of leading a revolutionary government. Thomas Isidore No\u00ebl Sankara was born on December 21, 1949 in what is known today as Burkina Faso, but was then still a French colony called Alta Volta . When he finished secondary school, at 19, he began a prolific military career that would be inextricably linked to politics. Just 14 years later, Sankara made a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat through armed struggle and an overwhelming support from the population and assumed the leadership of the country. Back then, he was already a symbol throughout the continent. Thanks to a combination of charisma, courage and intelligence and his undoubtedly revolutionary convictions, the world began to talk about \u201cAfrican Che Guevara.\u201d Just like the Argentine guerrilla, he had an early, tragic death, due to the betrayal of his closest comrade. Now, 28 years after his murder, and after the work to exhume his remains began, to unveil his mysterious end, Infobae interviewed Spanish writer Antonio Lozano, one of the most notorious experts on the Burkinese leader. As a corollary to his investigations, in 2006 he published The Sankara Case (Almuzara Ed), a novel that combines historical accuracy with fiction to retell his eventful life and tragic murder. The creation of a revolutionary leader \u201cSankara wanted to be a doctor, but his family was poor and his only option if he wanted to study was to attend a military academy. He was a Christian and that was always a part of his ideology,\u201d Lozano says. \u201cSurprisingly, at the time many of the professors of the military academy were Marxists\u201d, Lozano explained, \u201cso there he came into contact with these ideas. When he finished the first level of studies, his good grades allowed him to train as an Official of the Army in Madagascar, a country where there were constant popular revolts\u201d. When he returned to Alto Volta, Sankara had strong convictions and thought that it was essential to break with the colonial oppression of his nation, which was one of the poorest of the planet. They sent him to the city of P\u00f4, where his military and political career began. He had soldiers under his command which he taught his ideas. And on the other hand he worked with the poor people of the city and earned their respect and admiration. \u201cWhen he went to Rabat, Morocco, to take a course he met Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who became a great friend and comrade-in-arms of his, and who would later do the revolution with him. When he returned to Alto Volta, he participated in a short war against Mali, where he shined for an incursion he did with his men and made him famous and praised by the population,\u201d the historian says. \u201cSankara had strong convictions and thought that it was essential to break with the colonial oppression of his nation, which was one of the poorest of the planet.\u201d I n 1981, he was appointed Secretary of Information of the State. But six months after, he announced his resignation in an explosive press conference, in which he denounced the authoritarianism of the government and the attempts to \u201cput a gag on the people.\u201d This consolidated his fame as one of the most notorious figures of the country. He had created, together with Campaor\u00e9 and other members of the Armed Forces, the Communist Officers\u2019 Group. This group overthrew the government on November 7, 1982, and appointed a new President: Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo. Sankara was appointed Prime Minister in January 1983. \u201cMuammar Khadafi, who was already governing Linya and was one of the biggest figures of Arab socialism at the time, invited him to his country and considered him a comrade. At that time, every rally he held in Alto Volta was attended by thousands.\u201d But France wouldn\u2019t have this. \u201cDue to the pressure of France and the right-wing coalition that was still in the government, he was imprisoned\u201d, Lozano recounts. \u201cSo Compaor\u00e9 and his allies started to act\u201d to get him released, and \u201cwith the help of mass mobilizations of the Burkinese people\u201d, they recovered Sankara from the claws of the metropoli. In August 4, 1983, they took the power through armed struggle. At 33, he was appointed president and the Sankara\u2019s Revolution began. The foundation of a new country \u201cHe created a revolutionary process that was unheard of in Africa. On August 4, 1984, he changed the name of Alto Volta to Burkina Faso, which means \u201cLand of the Honest People\u201d which reflects his struggle against corruption, an endemic disease of African governments. He lead by example: he continued earning the same amount he made as Captain of the Army, sold all of the expensive cars owned by the state and adopted as official vehicle the cheapest car in the market, the Renault 5.\u201d He decreased the salaries of all public officers, forbade the use of chauffeurs and mandated that all ministers had to travel in tourist class. He also stood against nepotisms and didn\u2019t allow family-members to work for the state. His austerity was a characteristic that defined him until his death. \u201cAt the time he was murdered, his only possessions were a mortgaged house and three bikes\u201d Lozano says. The other main axis of his administration was the incentive to education and culture. \u201cIn a single year, the alphabetization rate went from 12 to 36%, and it kept raising thanks to the rural schools he created throughout the country.\u201d He also made great advances in health. He created vaccination commands that in just a few months immunized almost all Burkinese children against infectious diseases that were causing great harm. \u201cAt the time he was murdered, his only possessions were a mortgaged house and three bikes.\u201d B ut the greatest revolution he led was the one in favor of women\u2019s rights . He was the first to forbid female genital mutilation. He promoted the celebration of March 8 and included women in all realms of public administration. In the economic aspect, \u201che made an agrarian reform that redistributed land and gave out fertilizers and seeds to peasants, and created small dams. Through this, he managed to make Burkina Faso one of the few countries of the region to acquire self-sufficiency in the cereal supply, which is the base of the population\u2019s diet.\u201d Sankara knew that in order to be able to implement his agenda of reforms, he had to achieve \u201ceconomic independence\u201d for the country. This led him to confront the international financial system, and particularly the French one. Despite the declaration of independence, the country was still heavily tied to its former metropoli. The refusal to pay the external debt, which had been taken by previous governments, was one of his main measures. \u201cIn his last big speech, which he gave in September 1987 in the context of the General Assembly of the African Union, he defended these ideas once again and said that if they didn\u2019t stand with him, he wouldn\u2019t be there the following year. And, in fact, he didn\u2019t live to see the 1988 assembly,\u201d the biographer said. \u201cHe said that the only one with the ability to kill him was Blaise Compaor\u00e9, because he knew him better than anybody else.\u201d S ankara had made powerful enemies, both inside and outside the country. \u201cHe saw the end coming. In an interview he gave 15 days before his death to a newspaper from Belgium, when they asked about potential conspiracies he said that the only one with the ability to kill him was Blaise Compaor\u00e9, because he knew him better than anybody else. His circle told him several times to cut him off because he was a threat. But his answer was always the same: he was like a brother.\u201d Compaor\u00e9 disagreed with many of Sankara\u2019s policies, especially with the ones that restricted the acts of public officers. On October 15, 1987, an armed group entered Thomas Sankara\u2019s office while he was in a meeting with the 12 members of the National Council of the Revolution. Sankara, who was 37 at the time, was murdered along with the rest of the attendants. Simultaneously, Compaor\u00e9 made a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and became the President of Burkina Faso. He stayed in power for 27 years, until mass revolts forced him to flee the country in 2014.
