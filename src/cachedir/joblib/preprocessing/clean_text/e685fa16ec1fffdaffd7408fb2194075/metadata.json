After saying that Trump supporters were \u201cdead right\u201d about the \u201cmedia double standard,\u201d Wilson claimed \u201cthe thing they really loved  \u2026     even at the cost of a lunatic Bernie Bro almost committing mass murder was  \u2026     the chance to try to blame opposition to Trump on the shooting. \u201d He added this was a \u201csign of their moral decay. \u201d   A lot of clickservatives saw yesterday as a grim blessing, and the editorial coverage and reaction from the left as two things.  \u2014   Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 15, 2017,    But the thing they really loved. Really, really, loved even at the cost of a lunatic Bernie Bro almost committing mass murder was  \u2026      \u2014   Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 15, 2017,        \u2026    the chance to try to blame opposition to Trump on the shooting. My TL and email were full of it. It\u2019s a sign of their moral decay  \u2026      \u2014   Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 15, 2017,  He has turned into an unhinged gasbag with a Twitter account.  \u2014   I\u2019m Triggered (@StopThisMadnes1) June 15, 2017,  Most Americans were praying for Scalise, staffers, and the heroic Capitol Police officers who were shot in the line of duty the morning after the assassination attempt. But this apparently was apparently the first thing on Wilson\u2019s unhinged mind when he woke up. Wilson, though, seems to be doing a bit of projecting since he once politicized, out of all things, a rape threat against his daughter to try to score political points against Breitbart News. John Nolte wrote at the time that \u201cin all the years I\u2019ve been on social media, I have never seen anyone  \u2014   not even the lowest Leftist  \u2014   use a threat of rape against their own child as a political talking point or debating point against a political opponent. \u201d After he politicized the rape threat against his daughter, Wilson was immediately asked if he had gone to law enforcement and whether law enforcement officials asked him not to publicize the rape threat on social media. During the 2016 election cycle, Wilson, who constantly bemoans what he deems is crass behavior by anyone who is not a fellow \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d went on national television and said the donor class needed to \u201cput a bullet in Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump,\u201d Wilson told MSNBC\u2019s   audience. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a fact. \u201d Wilson also likened Ann Coulter to a prostitute and asked Coulter if Trump paid her \u201cmore for anal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561740.3038113}
