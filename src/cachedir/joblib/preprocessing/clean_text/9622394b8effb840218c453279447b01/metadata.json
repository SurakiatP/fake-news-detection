Trump accused Hillary Clinton on Friday of wanting to let violent criminals out of prison and \u201cdisarm\u201d   citizens in unsafe neighborhoods, and warned that women, in particular, would be at greater risk if she were elected president. Accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association at its annual convention here, Mr. Trump  \u2014   who has not always been the staunchest opponent of stricter gun controls  \u2014   said the November election would be a referendum on the Second Amendment. He claimed,  hyperbolically, that Mrs. Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, \u201cwants to take away your guns. \u201d \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton is the most     Amendment candidate ever to run for office,\u201d he said. Mrs. Clinton has called for tightened restrictions on guns, but not for abolishing the right to own them. Mr. Trump, whose record of sexist remarks, among other things, has left him at a potentially crippling disadvantage among female voters, polls show, appealed directly to women in his speech, imbuing his defense of gun rights with an undercurrent of fear. \u201cIn trying to overturn the Second Amendment, Hillary Clinton is telling everyone  \u2014   and every woman living in a dangerous community  \u2014   that she doesn\u2019t have the right to defend herself,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo you have a woman living in a community, a rough community, a bad community  \u2014   sorry, you can\u2019t defend yourself. \u201d If Mr. Trump\u2019s comments seemed reminiscent of an era when crime rates were far higher  \u2014   the Willie Horton ads attacking Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, in the 1988 presidential race came to mind  \u2014   they also appeared somewhat at odds with the broad bipartisan consensus on the need to reduce incarceration rates and prison populations: Mr. Trump sought to frighten voters about the idea of criminals being released from prison. He said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s agenda was \u201cto release the violent criminals from jail,\u201d freeing them to roam the streets and put \u201cinnocent Americans at risk. \u201d He even tried out a new epithet for Mrs. Clinton: \u201cheartless Hillary. \u201d Calling Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, \u201cheartless hypocrites,\u201d he dared them to \u201clet their bodyguards immediately disarm,\u201d an apparent reference to their Secret Service protection. \u201cLet\u2019s see how good they do,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how they feel walking around without their guns and their bodyguards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns, right?\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to shore up his support among the N. R. A. \u2019s more than five million members could help him in the Rust Belt states that he would need to carry to win the White House. But Mrs. Clinton must strike a more delicate balance on the issue: In the Democratic primaries against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a mixed record on gun control, she has taken an aggressive tack against firearm manufacturers and sellers. In a general election contest with Mr. Trump, however, Mrs. Clinton would vie with him for the loyalties of white voters in a number of battleground states where support for gun rights runs deep. Indeed, in recent weeks, as she campaigned before largely white,   audiences in Appalachian and Great Lakes states, she has   gun control and focused more on job creation and economic aid for financially struggling communities. But on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton will speak at a dinner of the Trayvon Martin Foundation\u2019s \u201cCircle of Mothers\u201d in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. a group offering support to women who have lost a child to gun violence. And she is expected to press the issue to win over voters in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California cities before that state\u2019s primary on June 7. Maya Harris, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Friday, saying he was \u201cpeddling falsehoods. \u201d \u201cAlong with the vast majority of Americans, Hillary Clinton believes there are   steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the Second Amendment,\u201d Ms. Harris said. Since announcing his presidential bid, Mr. Trump  \u2014   who himself has a concealed carry permit and whose two oldest sons are avid hunters  \u2014   has fashioned himself a fierce advocate of gun rights. He has released a policy paper on the Second Amendment, has called for making concealed carry permits valid in all 50 states and routinely tells his audiences, as he did again here on Friday, that terrorist attacks like those last year in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. might have been prevented if more people were armed. But his support for gun rights has not always been so absolutist. In his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d he wrote that he \u201cgenerally\u201d opposed gun control, but criticized the N. R. A. \u2019s outsize lobbying power, saying, \u201cI support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. \u201d After President Obama spoke in 2012 at a vigil for those killed in the school shootings in Newtown, Conn. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cPresident Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown, Connecticut. \u201d On Friday, however, Mr. Trump took his support for gun rights an additional step. In January, he said he wanted to end   zones in schools. In his speech here, he said he wanted to do away with them entirely. \u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of   zones,\u201d he said, arguing that more guns would mean less gun violence, as his audience cheered. Officially throwing the N. R. A. \u2019s support to Mr. Trump, Chris W. Cox, executive director of the group\u2019s political and lobbying arm, warned that Mrs. Clinton would appoint liberal justices to the Supreme Court who would roll back gun rights. \u201cWe have to unite and we have to unite right now,\u201d Mr. Cox said. (He also played a clip of Mrs. Clinton talking about the Second Amendment, but not before \u201caccidentally\u201d playing a video showing Mrs. Clinton barking like a dog.) The Secret Service prevented attendees from bringing knives and guns  \u2014   ordinarily commonplace accessories at the convention  \u2014   into the hall where Mr. Trump was speaking, prompting some grumbling. There was also some grumbling about the presidential campaign, despite the N. R. A. \u2019s endorsement. Dan Kelsey, 57, an I. T. consultant and N. R. A. member from Columbus, Ohio, said he was not excited about Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, and was worried that Mr. Trump might shift his position on the Second Amendment. \u201cHe talks a good game, but I\u2019m not sure what his core values are,\u201d Mr. Kelsey said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good entertainer and marketer, but I don\u2019t know what he really believes. \u201d Yet to other members of the group, Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to support the Second Amendment were reassurance enough. Dianne Jennings, 67, a certified N. R. A. pistol instructor from Dayton, Ohio, said she had \u201cnothing nice to say\u201d about Mrs. Clinton: \u201cBasically, I detest her. \u201d Ms. Jennings said that she found Mr. Trump \u201centertaining\u201d and \u201cnot politically correct\u201d and that she thought he would do a good job as president. \u201cI think people are just terrified of his persona, but I think he has a lot of different personas,\u201d she said, \u201cand he can use the right one in the right situation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561659.1069863}
