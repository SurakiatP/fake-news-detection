But what people don\u2019t realize is that our cities are polluted too. Nobody talks about this because we don\u2019t live in Delhi,\u201d said a Patna citizen coughing but not giving up before completing the sentence. \\nA person who regularly travels to Gwalior was not optimistic that spraying deodorant all over the city will get the media attention. But he saw a silver lining in the artificial cloud. \u201cI hate visiting Gwalior because my in-laws stay there. But the Fog deo now sprayed all over gives the city a new odour and I like it. There you go, finally, a good reason for me to visit my wife\u2019s city.\u201d \\nPeople of Allahabad too have been shocked as the \u2018city of prime ministers\u2019 has been neglected by the media when it comes to air pollution. \u201cThe only time our city and the state gets eyeballs is when there is infighting in the family of the party that rules us. When will the media realize that the pollution in UP too is going UP?\u201d \\nA dejected Raipur citizen said that one day he hopes his city too is placed on the pollution map of the country. \u201cOne day, I wish to see a special broadcast on prime-time news shows on the pollution levels in my city.\u201d \\nWhen asked what else was happening in the city apart from air contamination, the person replied, \u201cBas, Fog hi chal raha hai. (Duh! Fog is in the air.)\u201d Tweet About Amrut Thobbi \\nAmrut Thobbi is an editor by profession, satirist by heart and useless as a person.
