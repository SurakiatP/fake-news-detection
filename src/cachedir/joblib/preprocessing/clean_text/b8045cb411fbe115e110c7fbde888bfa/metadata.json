{"duration": 0.2989630699157715, "input_args": {"text": "'We were somewhere north of Denver, not far from the pot farm, when my neighbor on the party bus pulled hard on his pipe and said: \u201cKnow what it is I love about this country? Everyone gets stoned. \u201d He was a big, bearded fellow who had come up from his cattle ranch in Kansas, and though he didn\u2019t seem like the usual type for a cannabis foodie tour, I felt that he was right. After all, with us on the bus that afternoon was a Whitmanesque array of stoned Americans. There they were, puffing blunts beneath the blinking purple lights: a gay couple from Rhode Island, some multiethnic techies from Atlanta, a rowdy group of white dudes who\u2019d just flown in from Houston for a bachelor party and a    Boston mother with a beach house in the Hamptons. Everyone gets stoned. For purely professional reasons, I was myself at that point something slightly less than wholly sober and shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that our tour that day  \u2014   from farm to head shop to   munchies meal  \u2014   had attracted such a rich assortment of potheads. Then again, there isn\u2019t much surprising about Colorado\u2019s marijuana tourist boom. Imagine visiting Napa Valley  \u2014   but with weed instead of wine. The state\u2019s \u201cgreen rush,\u201d as everybody calls it, is a   enterprise of hydroponic grow labs and artisanal dispensaries, but the tourist infrastructure that\u2019s emerged to stoke you up and squire you around to see it all operates on a fairly simple principle: Everything is better when you\u2019re high. As I began my exploration of Colorado\u2019s marijuana tourist trade, it occurred to me that a certain amount of lethargy was, well, baked into the notion from the start. So I went looking for something more extensive than a   suds and buds tour, but nothing quite so much as a fully immersive Ganja Yoga Retreat. I found the options dizzying: In the two years since the state first permitted the sale of weed to recreational users, an intricate economy has rapidly sprung up.   ski buffs can ride to the slopes in   charter S. U. V. s, and arriving potheads can schedule pickups from the airport through dedicated livery services like THC Limo. There are stoner painting classes, stoner mountain treks and  stoner chefs who will cook you a   marijuana dinner. Visitors can avail themselves of mobile apps like Leafly and Weedmaps to track down nearby vendors or book their    through websites like TravelTHC. In the end, I elected a   sampler tour of Denver offered at the price of $1, 295, not including airfare, by one of Colorado\u2019s most popular pot tourist firms, My 420 Tours. A cannabis concierge helped me plan my weekend, mellowly insisting on the foodie tour and the private massage with medicinal marijuana oil. After I booked the trip, I spent a few hours browsing through the online Colorado Pot Guide (  courses, vaporizer rentals) and reading up on the relevant regulations. (Smoking in public? No. In a licensed commercial vehicle? Light up.) But then, for a period of weeks, I didn\u2019t hear a word from My 420. Just as I began to wonder if the whole thing was for real, an email arrived with my itinerary. \u201cHigh Alan,\u201d the little note addressed me  \u2014   at which point I was totally reassured. I should note from the start that I\u2019m not much of a smoker. While bourbon doesn\u2019t last long on my shelf, I get high, at most, a few times a year. That\u2019s why I appreciated the weekend\u2019s first event: an orientation with a cannabis sommelier. I had by then already checked into my hotel downtown, the Crowne Plaza Denver, where a winking desk clerk handed me a large metal vaporizer, my     unit. Alone, upstairs, I took it for a shakedown run. It was only 9 a. m. Having thus obtained the proper frame of mind, I went back down to meet a man named Mike Metoyer, who, as I\u2019d been told, would serve throughout the weekend as my cannabis spirit guide. I found Mr. Metoyer in the lobby, waiting for me in a My 420   with its     corporate logo. He introduced himself and handed me a swag bag. This, I saw, contained a smaller vaporizer for use outside my room, a recent copy of Dope Magazine and  \u2014   because of Denver\u2019s potent homegrown  \u2014   a bottle of lavender oil designed to bring me down if I suffered a panicky high. Like almost everyone I met in the local pot trade, Mr. Metoyer, who is 22 and grew up in a Pentecostal church, had come to marijuana only recently. A few years ago, he told me as we made our way into a ballroom, he\u2019d been working as a docent at a silver mine in the mountains when J. J. Walker, founder of My 420, went on one of his trips. Mr. Walker was apparently impressed and offered Mr. Metoyer a job. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe at first that \u2018pot tour guide\u2019 was, you know, an actual position,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as you can see, it obviously is. \u201d Waiting for us in the ballroom was our sommelier, Michael Pyatt, the director of training at Native Roots  \u2014   \u201cthe Gucci of dispensaries,\u201d Mr. Metoyer whispered as we sat down at a table. Mr. Pyatt is a tall, thin man of 27, formerly employed in sales at Best Buy. His knowledge of the product, accumulated over years of personal research, was exhaustive and, within a few minutes, he had filled our table with little plastic canisters of weed. \u201cYou a smoker?\u201d Mr. Pyatt asked. I told him not so much. And so, in an almost oenological language, he started to describe for me the qualities of the Native Roots proprietary brands: Harlequin, for instance (\u201ca mix of three sativas\u201d) and Sour Kush (\u201cmusky, sweet, cerebral with a nice tight nug structure\u201d). As Mr. Pyatt peered into his goody bag for another strain to show, I turned to Mr. Metoyer and asked what kinds of people usually sign up for his tours. \u201cI get everyone,\u201d he told me, \u201cmen, women, young, old, but 60 percent of my clients are from Texas. \u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s a   society,\u201d Mr. Pyatt said.) Then Mr. Metoyer added: \u201cMost of our customers are blown away the first time they start smoking on the party bus. They\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a sec, you\u2019re sure this is legal?\u2019 When I tell them it is, then they\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa, dude, I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life for this! \u2019\u201d Last year, tens of thousands of people came to Denver for the High Times Cannabis Cup, a marijuana trade show with competitive events (best edible or best sativa flower) and an equally enormous crowd is expected at this year\u2019s gathering, which takes place in Broomfield, Colo. on April 19. \u201cYou walk around the state these days and you actually smell the cannabis right out on the street,\u201d Mr. Pyatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, dude, game on. \u201d By that point, he had found a package of his favorite brand, Jellybean, and told me, with a little thirsty lick of his lips, \u201cThis one\u2019s got a great head high  \u2014   it\u2019s the perfect daytime smoke. \u201d My 420 doesn\u2019t have a marijuana vendor\u2019s license and can\u2019t give samples to its customers, but a workaround was hastily arranged. Mr. Metoyer asked if I had had a chance to test the small vaporizer in my swag bag. When I told him I hadn\u2019t, Mr. Pyatt plucked a frosty bud of Jellybean and offered his assistance: \u201cI could, um, demonstrate it for you  \u2014   if you like. \u201d One perk of a My 420   cannabis vacation was a livery car and driver. When I\u2019d arrived the day before at Denver International Airport, a huge black Chevrolet Suburban had been waiting at the curb. Climbing inside, I discovered leather seats, a lingering smell of skunk weed and, behind the wheel, a man named Tariq Williams. Mr. Williams became my escort for the weekend, driving me to various events, including the next one: a cannabis cooking class. A couple of years ago, Mr. Williams had been driving for the airport service Super Shuttle when he came to the conclusion that recreational pot was about to take Denver\u2019s economy by storm. So he quit his job, bought the Suburban used (for $28, 000) and hasn\u2019t looked back since. \u201cI saw it coming,\u201d he told me that first day, \u201cand I had to get my feet in at an early stage. \u201d While he isn\u2019t yet making what he once made at the airport, he expects he will be soon. At any rate, everyone he knows works in marijuana these days. His brother, who owns a security company, now has contracts with various dispensaries, and one of his friends does waste removal for a cultivation plant. Other friends work as budtenders, or as hash extractors, or as couriers moving plants from farm to store. I noticed a similar phenomenon at the Stir Cooking School in the Highlands area, a very Martha   outfit  \u2014   exposed brick walls,   wooden floors  \u2014   that had recently embarked on a sideline teaching tourists to cook with marijuana oil. Our class that morning was led by a graduate of the Johnson  Wales culinary school, Travis French, who instructed us in the preparation of weed chicken tacos, weed guacamole and   jicama slaw. The students were another motley crew  \u2014   in an upmarket, foodie sort of way: a husband and wife who owned a weed dispensary in California, a   lesbian couple from Fort Lauderdale and some married academics on a secret holiday from their small Catholic college in the Midwest. I found myself at a work station with two more couples: Jason Lewis, a    chef, and Holly Gulbranson, 36, a hair stylist, who had come in from Atlanta to celebrate her birthday and Scottie and Lauren Long, a young musician and   pair, who were on their honeymoon from Orlando. All of them said that they had come to Colorado for the pot. \u201cScottie doesn\u2019t drink so we wanted to go somewhere we could both enjoy ourselves,\u201d Ms. Long told me. \u201cThe wedding was for everybody else, but the honeymoon\u2019s for us. \u201d This winter, a study commissioned by the Colorado Tourism Office found that nearly half of the people polled said that the state\u2019s loose marijuana laws had influenced their decision to visit. While state officials have themselves argued that the poll was misleading  \u2014   it never asked whether the influence was positive or negative  \u2014   if the cooking class was any measure, then weed has now joined skiing and microbreweries as one of Colorado\u2019s tourist draws. Mr. Lewis and Ms. Gulbranson had already made the rounds of several Denver restaurants and planned to travel to Pagosa Springs, but the common denominator in their movement through the state was marijuana. Mr. Lewis, a longtime pot enthusiast, told me it was simply nice to be someplace where he didn\u2019t really have to hide his habit. \u201cWe do live in Georgia,\u201d Ms. Gulbranson said. It was the same thing with the Longs. In Florida, they explained, they worried all the time about smoking on the street or getting caught with a joint inside their glovebox, but in Denver they could sit on the patio of their   rental and pass a bowl in plain sight of the neighbors. \u201cIt was a little weird at first because we\u2019re so used to hiding it,\u201d Ms. Long went on. \u201cBut when we came in from the airport, they let us smoke in the car. We were both like: \u2018Holy cow, the car!\u2019 \u201d Maybe I just like drinking, but I have to say, I didn\u2019t get it. I mean, I got it: It was cool getting high without fear of being hassled by the cops. But was that really something around which you could plan a whole vacation? I understand that people go on wine trips, but generally speaking, they\u2019re not popping bottles of shiraz the minute they leave the baggage claim. When I thought about it later, it occurred to me that what I might have been reacting to was the hard sell that Denver\u2019s   class was putting on these poor,      the way in which their stifled desire for pot was being commodified. The longer I stayed in Denver, the more I noticed it. Everywhere you looked there were shrewd little business deals: spend $20 at Dispensary A and you got a coupon for a free drink at Restaurant B spend $20 at Restaurant B and you got a voucher for a $1 joint at Dispensary A. It was even more ubiquitous online. Click onto CannaSaver. com and the bargains all but grabbed you by the throat: 50 percent off Red Dot Edibles! Buy two vaping cartridges and get a free battery! At a certain point, I started to suspect that the city\u2019s reefer tourist moguls were getting their clients high mainly for the purpose of relieving them of their money. \u201cFeel free to load those pipes, guys  \u2014   someone roll a fatty! ,\u201d our guide aboard the party bus encouraged us, as we climbed on for the tour. This was only hours after the cooking class, and those taking part in both events were by that point wasted. But the exhortation to smoke more pot  \u2014   not least, on the way to a pot lab  \u2014   was simply too enticing to pass up. When we reached the lab, my tour mates stumbled off the bus and stood for a moment in the parking lot gazing at the    structure as though it were the Vatican. \u201cOh yeah, dude,\u201d the cattle rancher murmured with a   nod as we stepped inside. There, we met Meg Sanders, the chief executive of Mindful, the company that runs the lab. Ms. Sanders, knowing her audience, told us that the site housed 8, 000 individual plants of 50 different strains. This elicited an   silence from the potheads, into which she added, waving us on, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s head back to Disneyland. \u201d The technical aspects of the lab were pretty interesting: cryogenic freezers,   ovens, lots of fluorescent lights  \u2014   like something you might find at a pharmaceutical plant or in crime scene photos. Ms. Sanders informed us that every seedling in the building had been tagged at birth with an RFID chip so that the state could monitor its progress from cultivation to retail sale. She was pretty interesting herself: a former financial compliance officer who, like many others, saw an opportunity in pot. \u201cI had a passion for the plant,\u201d she said as we made our way past a giant indoor copse of marijuana, \u201cand\u201d  \u2014   this seemed especially important  \u2014   \u201cthere was no glass ceiling. \u201d Things became a bit less interesting as the lab tour ended and, back onboard the bus  \u2014   joints and pipes ablaze again  \u2014   we took a ride to a Mindful dispensary, the pot vacation version of a museum gift shop. The transformation from tourist to consumer was immediate, if only because our options were so numerous. There, on the shelves before the spellbound heads, was Mindful\u2019s entire product line: transdermal pot patches, marijuana taffy, pot bacon brittle,   vegan pot capsules, Incredible Affogato pot candy bars, CannaPunch cannabis drinks, a Bubba Kush strain of root beer, Wake and Shake canna coffee, Lip Buzz lip balm, Apothecanna pain creams, and, of course, a wide variety of hashes, extracts and smokeables. Next morning, after visiting the hotel gym, I had brunch with Danny Schaefer, the chief executive of Pioneer Industries, parent of My 420. Wanting me to get \u201cthe full experience,\u201d Mr. Schaefer urged me to \u201cconsume\u201d before our meal  \u2014   if I missed any reportorial details, he\u2019d make sure I got them later. While that was kind, I kept to the restaurant\u2019s menu, listening as he talked about the growth of My 420\u2019s business. In 2015, its second year of operation, the company handled 300 to 600 customers a week, he said, with an average ticket price of $650. This year, he added, ticket sales were already up by 35 percent. Mr. Schafer went on to say that \u201ctaboo tourism\u201d was only one part of the local pot economy, which, he added, also included packaging, labeling and lighting companies, not to mention law firms, consultants and  \u2014   because the industry uses only cash  \u2014   heavily armed security firms. It was then that he told me that the ultimate goal of Pioneer Industries was to unite these businesses into a single vocal lobby, and thus turn Colorado into the country\u2019s premier pot vacation destination. \u201cWe\u2019ve got skiing, hiking, microbreweries,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re already the Mile High City. \u201d But to seize that throne will require competing with states like Washington, which legalized recreational weed in 2012, and Oregon, which did the same on a slightly more restrictive basis in 2014. It will also require the cooperation of state tourism officials who, at least so far, have failed to embrace the vision of Colorado as the Promised Land of pot. \u201cFor most travelers, marijuana is a   issue,\u201d said Cathy Ritter, the director of the Colorado Tourism Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small segment of our travel population. \u201d When I spoke with her by phone, Ms. Ritter acknowledged that she hadn\u2019t used state money to promote pot tourism because most of the funds would, by definition, be spent outside of Colorado and, as she explained, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that that\u2019s a federal offense. \u201d Recently, the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce pushed a bill in the state that would allow producers and sellers to open tasting rooms, as wineries and breweries have, and yet the real work of turning Denver into a pot Napa Valley may in the end rest with people on the ground like Mr. Schaefer or like Pepe Breton, whose greenhouse lab we visited after brunch. Mr. Breton\u2019s story was, by then, familiar: He was a former stockbroker who had gone in search of profit as a marijuana farmer. But it seemed to me that he had a different  \u2014   and slightly darker  \u2014   take on the future of the industry. \u201cThe big boys are coming,\u201d Mr. Breton said as we walked through his lab. \u201cAnd when that happens, I won\u2019t be able to compete anymore. I just hope I can sell at the right time and get a good price. \u201d That evening, after my massage (no, you don\u2019t get high) I went for a long walk through the city. In the twilight, set against the mountains, Denver was changing. You could see it  \u2014   in the construction cranes, in the old brick buildings giving way to boxy condominiums, in the faces of the tourists on the 16th Street pedestrian mall. What would happen, I wondered, when, like Mr. Breton suggested, Philip Morris and Pfizer  \u2014   the big boys  \u2014   arrived, and the quirky, prepubescent marijuana trade suddenly grew up and then went corporate? It was already grasping now, but then? By that point I had crossed the South Platte River to the Highlands again. In the neighborhood of quiet streets, I came across a burger joint and went inside for dinner. The room was warm, college basketball was playing on TV, and I took a seat among the large crowd at the bar. Ordering a beer, it occurred to me that I was very glad to have visited Denver when I did.'"}, "time": 1742562009.535593}
