Trump, we had no idea that his column would touch off a   of its own. In it, Mr. Friedman compared a remark by Donald J. Trump  \u2014   widely interpreted as a call for gun owners anxious about Hillary Clinton to take the law into their own hands  \u2014   to the kind of incendiary political language that Mr. Friedman said had incited the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel in 1995. \u201cHis children,\u201d Mr. Friedman wrote of Mr. Trump, \u201cshould be ashamed of him. \u201d Right before we taped the show, a prominent fellow journalist, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, scolded Mr. Friedman for engaging in \u201chyperbolic\u201d and \u201cexcessive\u201d criticism in the column by mentioning Mr. Trump\u2019s children as he did. \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d said Mr. Woodward, who argued that there should be a \u201czone of protection\u201d around a candidate\u2019s children. On today\u2019s episode, Mr. Friedman rejects that argument, saying that Mr. Trump had forfeited any such \u201czone of protection\u201d when his children became top advisers to his campaign and highly public spokesmen for it. \u201cOh my God. I mean, who are the main speakers at Trump\u2019s convention?\u201d Mr. Friedman asked. \u201cThey are his kids. Who has he cited as his top advisers? His kids. \u201d An edited excerpt from our interview: I asked whether Mr. Friedman was trying to encourage Mr. Trump\u2019s children to intervene and rein in their father.  \u201cIf you want to change his behavior, it seems to me legitimate to call on them,\u201d he said. In the same episode, we asked a former top employee of Mr. Trump\u2019s, Barbara Res, once the head of construction at his company, whether the inflammatory language he is now using resembled his choice of words and his shading of the truth as a boss in the workplace. Her answer? \u201cAbsolutely. \u201d Ms. Res, the author of \u201cAll Alone on the 68th Floor,\u201d a memoir about her days as a woman in the   construction industry, said Mr. Trump\u2019s inaccurate claim that Hillary Clinton was a \u201cfounder of ISIS\u201d reminded her of how he talked in the office. \u201cFor one thing he tends to exaggerate tremendously,\u201d she said. \u201cLike the thing about being the founder of ISIS. \u201d \u201cHe used to do that all the time. He would make a tremendously exaggerated remark, or make something up that wasn\u2019t even exaggerated, and then he would pounce on it and repeat it,\u201d Ms. Res recalled.
