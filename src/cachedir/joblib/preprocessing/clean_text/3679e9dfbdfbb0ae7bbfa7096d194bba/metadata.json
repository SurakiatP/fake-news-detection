[Violence solves nothing. I want a rhino to fuck @SpeakerRyan to death with its horn because it\u2019s FUNNY, not because he\u2019s a #GOPmurderbro,  \u2014   Joss Whedon (@joss) January 14, 2017,   Whedon  \u2014   a longtime Democratic Party contributor and an outspoken   celebrity activist  \u2014   has been on a social media tear since shortly before the election, when he reinstated his Twitter account to launch an   political PSA featuring the stars of his Avengers movies. Earlier this week, the    director went after actress Nicole Kidman after she said that the country should unite in support behind Donald Trump. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Joss Whedon (@joss) January 13, 2017,  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Whedon\u2019s tweet about Ryan drew a swift response from the director\u2019s social media followers: @joss Talented writer and director.  Epic films.  Poor judgment. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Ken Zimmern (@KenZimmern) January 14, 2017,  . @joss People like you are why I stopped being a Democrat.

How is this at all appropriate to say?  \u2014   Sarah Quinlan (@sarahmquinlan) January 14, 2017,  @joss @SpeakerRyan Trump\u2019s win was worth it just for this. the meltdown is beautiful,  \u2014   Antoine Burke (@happyburkean) January 14, 2017,  Whedon has kept up his political activism since November. Shortly after Trump\u2019s victory over former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the filmmaker tweeted that Trump could \u201cnot be allowed\u201d to serve his first term in office. He also compared Trump to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and, when Clinton supporters began rioting immediately following Trump\u2019s victory, encouraged dissenters to keep protesting. This is simple: Trump cannot CANNOT be allowed a term in office. It\u2019s not about 2018. It\u2019s about RIGHT NOW,  \u2014   Joss Whedon (@joss) November 14, 2016,  Voter suppressionRussian hackingFBI collusionHe has the officeBUT HE IS NOT WELCOME HEREKeep investigatingKeep protesting#NEVERtrump,  \u2014   Joss Whedon (@joss) November 11, 2016,  Whedon\u2019s \u201cImportant\u201d PSA, released in September, became perhaps the most   celebrity political of the 2016 campaign, having been viewed more than eight million times since it was posted online. In the clip, Avengers stars Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo Don Cheadle and a slew of other celebrities remind ordinary Americans that Election Day is on November 8 and that voting is a serious matter.
