Articles about that research have energized protests against Exxon Mobil and the fossil fuel industry and had a role in initiating queries by at least five attorneys general, led by Eric T. Schneiderman of New York. Early on, his office demanded extensive emails, financial records and other documents from the oil company, leaving many observers with the impression that a deeper look into the company\u2019s past was the focus of the investigation. But in an extensive interview, Mr. Schneiderman said that his investigation was focused less on the distant past than on relatively recent statements by Exxon Mobil related to climate change and what it means for the company\u2019s future. In other words, the question for Mr. Schneiderman is less what Exxon knew, and more what it predicts. For example, he said, the investigation is scrutinizing a 2014 report by Exxon Mobil stating that global efforts to address climate change would not mean that it had to leave enormous amounts of oil reserves in the ground as   \u201cstranded assets. \u201d But many scientists have suggested that if the world were to burn even just a portion of the oil in the ground that the industry declares on its books, the planet would heat up to such dangerous levels that \u201cthere\u2019s no one left to burn the rest,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. By that logic, Exxon Mobil will have to leave much of its oil in the ground, which means the company\u2019s valuation of its reserves is off by a significant amount. \u201cIf, collectively, the fossil fuel companies are overstating their assets by trillions of dollars, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. And if the company\u2019s own internal research shows that Exxon Mobil knows better, he added, \u201cthere may be massive securities fraud here. \u201d Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, dismissed the idea that its forecast could be viewed as fraudulent. \u201cIf it turns out to be wrong, that\u2019s not fraud, that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we adjust our outlook every year, and that\u2019s why we issue the annual forecast publicly, so people can know the basis of our forecasting. \u201d The company has said allegations that it secretly developed a definitive understanding of climate change before the rest of the world\u2019s scientists are \u201cpreposterous. \u201d Mr. Schneiderman has praised reports from publications, including Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times, that detailed Exxon Mobil\u2019s past research. And all indications were that his office planned to use its subpoena powers to unearth new documents that might show a disconnect between what the company was saying publicly and what it was saying privately about climate change over several decades. In the interview, however, Mr. Schneiderman said his focus lay elsewhere. \u201cThe older stuff really is just important to establish knowledge and the framework and to look for inconsistencies. \u201d He called his efforts a straightforward fraud investigation, like many that he and his predecessors have taken on in subjects as   as the crash of   securities and Volkswagen\u2019s diesel engine deceptions. Mr. Schneiderman also mentioned, as an example of questionable public statements by Exxon Mobil,  congressional testimony in 2010 by its chief executive, Rex Tillerson, who said that while the company acknowledged that humans were affecting the climate through greenhouse gas emissions to some degree, it was not yet clear \u201cto what extent and therefore what can you do about it. \u201d Mr. Tillerson added, \u201cThere is not a model available today that is competent\u201d for understanding the science and predicting the future. Mr. Schneiderman disagrees, and cited the industry\u2019s own extensive climate research and the actions it has taken in response, including exploration in the melting Arctic and raising the decks of offshore oil platforms to compensate for rising sea level. \u201cThese guys have the best science for their engineering purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re confident they\u2019re not wasting shareholder dollars to do things that are inconsistent with the science they have internally. \u201d Since November, when the investigation was first revealed, and as other state attorneys general announced their support, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s intentions have been questioned and, he said, misconstrued. Supporters of Exxon Mobil have accused him and his colleagues of using prosecutorial powers to pursue political ends and of trying to squelch the First Amendment rights of the company, its scientists and anyone who agrees with them. Lamar Smith, a congressman from Texas and chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, accused the attorneys general of \u201cpursuing a political agenda at the expense of scientists\u2019 rights to free speech\u201d and has issued subpoenas demanding internal documents from Mr. Schneiderman and another state attorney general, as well as eight groups that have supported the investigations. Hans von Spakovsky, a conservative commentator, compared the investigation by the attorneys general to the Spanish Inquisition, and the Daily Caller asked whether Mr. Schneiderman had suggested \u201cjailing global warming skeptics. \u201d Mr. Schneiderman talks about such accusations with incredulity. \u201cThis is an investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a civil fraud case. No one is being prosecuted  \u2014   we\u2019re not out to silence dissenting views. \u201d He has said, however, that if criminal actions turn up in the evidence the state gathers, criminal charges could be filed. When asked about the First Amendment implications of investigating Exxon\u2019s statements, he repeated a sentence he has uttered many times: \u201cThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t protect you for fraud. \u201d He added, \u201c  monte operators can\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m just exercising my First Amendment rights! \u2019\u201d When asked about the focus of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s investigation, Joel Seligman, an expert in securities law who is the president of the University of Rochester, said that \u201cat some level, this is a   investigation  \u2014   and there is no guarantee it will lead to a case. \u201d Exxon Mobil has sued to block subpoenas from Massachusetts and the United States Virgin Islands, but the company has provided hundreds of thousands of pages of documents to New York. If the investigation does turn up the kind of evidence that could lead to a civil case, it is still unclear whether New York or the other states might win, said David M. Uhlmann, a former top federal prosecutor of environmental crime and a professor at the University of Michigan law school. Until governments impose the kind of regulations that will lead to concrete action to slow or reverse climate change, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to drill for oil and frack for gas. \u2019\u2019 In that case, he continued, Exxon may \u201cutilize a significant portion of its reserves, which means it may not even be wrong when it states that it expects to utilize its reserves. \u201d Even if Exxon is wrong in saying that it expects to be able to use all its reserves, \u201cThe question is whether they know that they are wrong and are therefore lying to investors,\u201d he added. The investigation, Mr. Schneiderman said, mirrors an earlier inquiry into a coal giant, Peabody Energy. In 2013, he issued subpoenas for internal documents related to climate change, and found false statements to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cSimple stuff like \u2018it\u2019s impossible to predict the effect of a carbon tax on the coal market,\u2019 and they paid a consultant a lot of money to predict the effect of a carbon market,\u201d he said. Peabody signed an agreement  pledging to properly disclose the climate risk to its business. Mr. Schneiderman has also been accused of conspiring with environmental groups, but he said, \u201cPeople bring information to us all the time. If it\u2019s got merit to it, we follow up on it. \u201d Groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists have investigated the fossil fuel industry for years, he said, and so \u201cit would be malpractice for us not to meet with people like this. \u201d The industry\u2019s tactics come \u201cstraight out of the tobacco playbook,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s delay, and sowing doubt. \u201d Mr. Schneiderman has refused to comply with the congressman\u2019s subpoena, stressing the importance of federalism  \u2014   normally an argument used by conservatives against federal overreach. When asked for comment, Kristina Baum, a spokeswoman for the Science committee, said that Mr. Smith was unavailable.'"}, "time": 1742562441.567371}
