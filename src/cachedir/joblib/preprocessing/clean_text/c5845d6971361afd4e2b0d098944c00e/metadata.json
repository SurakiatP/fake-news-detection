Trump, will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning \u2014  and Washington, D. C. elites are gathered at their favorite watering holes throughout the city to watch the giant   testimony.  Breitbart News will be covering the political class celebration from here, with this livewire including updates on Comey\u2019s testimony and the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites. Union Pub, a landmark Washington, D. C. bar across the street from the Heritage Foundation on Capitol Hill, is offering all patrons who come here to watch the testimony free drinks whenever President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing throughout its duration until 4 p. m. UPDATE 12:54 P. M. President Trump did not Tweet throughout the entire event, but Union Pub is still giving out a few round of   Budweisers to everyone here! The specialty Budweiser cans, which servers are passing out now, have the special \u201cAmerica\u201d name in place of \u201cBudweiser\u201d on the label and a camouflage design instead of the traditional red cans. Here\u2019s a photo from Breitbart\u2019s Kristina Wong: . @UnionPub giving out free America Budweisers at #ComeyHearing #Covfefe: pic. twitter.   \u2014   Kristina Wong (@kristina_wong) June 8, 2017,  And another from Breitbart News\u2019 Penny Starr: Cheers! Comey reveals he\u2019s a leaker and New York Times pushes FAKE NEWS! @BreitbartNews #comey pic. twitter.   \u2014   Penny Starr (@PennyStarrDC) June 8, 2017,  That\u2019s all folks, we\u2019ll leave it there for today. COVFEFE to everyone and thanks for tuning in! UPDATE 12:50 P. M. As the public part of the hearing adjourned, and Comey has completely vindicated Trump ahead of a later closed session hearing where he and senators are likely to discuss classified information he could not bring up during the televised hearing, the whole thing turned out exactly like Breitbart News Network told you it would: A giant  . Except for the fact that Comey admitted he is a leaker, has a network through which he has leaked information designed to harm President Trump. Oh, and that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Obama administration officials may have engaged in serious misconduct worthy of further investigation \u2014  which Comey testified about today. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2014  from the podium at the press briefing \u2014  has told reporters that President Trump is not, despite what the leaker James Comey says, a liar. . @SHSanders45: \u201dNo, I can definitively say the president is not a liar. It\u2019s frankly insulting that that question would be asked.\u201d  \u2014   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) June 8, 2017,  And, of course, nevertheless President Trump persisted. He\u2019s right back out there fighting for American workers while Democrats waste their time on   nonsense. Trump takes the stage at Faith and Freedom conference \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be here with all of my friends\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 8, 2017,  \u201cYou fought for me, now I will fight for you\u201d Trump tells Faith and Freedom audience,  \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:40 P. M. Sen. John McCain ( ) a grumpy old   Republican, made no sense during his questioning of Comey. Breitbart\u2019s own Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, questions whether everyone else had trouble following along with McCain\u2019s nonsensical line of questioning: Am I the only one not able to follow along with senator McCain\u2019s line of questioning? ???  \u2014   Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) June 8, 2017,  Even the New York Times\u2019 people questions whether McCain is losing his mind: McCain seems to be confusing the Clinton email case with the Russia investigation.  \u2014   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  Trump, who has not Tweeted during the hearing at all, apparently made the decision to avoid Tweeting last night. Politico\u2019s Tara Palmeri has the scoop of why the President would not Tweet today, infuriating all the Union Pub   who did not get any free drinks since President Trump did not Tweet. Trump decided the night before #comeyhearings that he would not   his rebuttal https:  .   \u2014   Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) June 8, 2017,  \u201cWhy would I?\u201d Trump apparently told White House aides about   Comey\u2019s appearance before Congress, according to a \u201csenior White House official\u201d who spoke with Politico\u2019s Palmeri. Read the whole thing, including the details on how the president\u2019s mood is \u201clight\u201d during the Comey testimony. UPDATE 12:37 P. M. Their hopes and dreams dashed by Comey completely vindicating Trump in this open hearing, and instead implicating   administration officials like Loretta Lynch \u2014  and implicating himself as an   leaker with a network through which he has leaked damaging information against the president \u2014  the left and media are pinning everything on a last ditch line of questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris ( ). This line of questioning from @SenKamalaHarris regarding the Attorney General is extraordinarily important  \u2014   not to be overlooked,  \u2014   Matt House (@mattwhouse) June 8, 2017,  Here\u2019s video of her comparing Trump to an armed robber though, so take whatever she says with a grain of salt: Sen.

Bottom line for #ComeyDay: Comey a highly credible witness. Trump isn\u2019t. Comey makes damning accusations. Trump denials unconvincing.  \u2014   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) June 8, 2017,  Flashback, though, to when Comey was fired and Boot with some bold predictions back on May 9: Congress needs to ask Comey to testify  he needs to tell all he knows about Kremlingate. If he does Trump may regret firing him.  \u2014   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  Don\u2019t tell Max Boot about the black helicopters coming for him. Seriously. \u201cKREMLINGATE\u201d? What is wrong with these people? Anyway, another wonderfully fantastic flashback of this Never Trumper from when Comey was fired in May: Prediction: If Democrats take control of Congress in 2018, the firing of Comey will form one of the articles of impeachment.  \u2014   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  UPDATE 12:24 P. M. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is calling for the Senate to officially subpoena the documents James Comey ordered leaked through his network of leakers. Senators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him.  \u2014   Alan Dershowitz (@AlanDersh) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:21 P. M. Loretta Lynch is in serious trouble right now. Looks like the Democrats\u2019 efforts may have backfired. Loretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony,  \u2014   Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) June 8, 2017,  If it wasn\u2019t for Trump becoming president, the corruption with Obama\u2019s Department of Justice would be a major story. https:  .   \u2014   Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) June 8, 2017,  Comey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could \u201ccredibly deny\u201d the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation, and that she had a serious conflict of interest. He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn ( ) the Senate Majority Whip, that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal. He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal, but decided against it. UPDATE 12:08 P. M. Oh my. Now confirmed leaker James Comey\u2019s leak network has been outed, or at least part of it has: Only in Washington: Someone nursing a pint of beer shouts out to a crowded bar: \u201dDaniel Richman of Columbia\u201d https:  .   \u2014   Alexander Panetta (@Alex_Panetta) June 8, 2017,  So the collusion involves former FBI director, mainstream media, and the   academy to bring down the elected president #ComeyHearing https:  .   \u2014   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  And now Comey\u2019s   leak network is confirming to the media that Comey is a leaker: Columbia Law Prof Daniel Richman confirms to @ZCohenCNN that he is the friend that provided excerpts of the Comey memo to reporters.  \u2014   Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 8, 2017,    UPDATE 12:05 P. M. There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General from the Obama administration, will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her. Legit question: is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony?  \u2014   Mike Shields (@mshields007) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, Comey\u2019s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School makes the case Comey may be in serious trouble: Comey admits that he leaked the internal memo through a Columbia law professor in order to force Special Counsel. Yet, that raises questions,  \u2014   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  Comey is doing well but leaking info runs against Comey\u2019s image, particularly in light of the leak controversy hoiunding the Administration,  \u2014   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  The memos could be viewed as gov\u2019t material and potential evidence .  Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions.  \u2014   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:02 P. M. Donald Trump, Jr. highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt ( ) to Comey. Comey did not have a great answer. Sen Blunt: If you told Sessions you didn\u2019t want to be alone with Trump again, why did you continue to take his calls?  \u2014   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:01 P. M. From our RNC friends, here\u2019s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey.  Basically, Comey was so concerned about President Trump\u2019s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it. In other words, this whole thing is a giant  . Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker. UPDATE 11:58 A. M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing. He admitted he\u2019s a leaker, and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press. In addition, he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago. White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter: Because if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under   it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017,  President Trump still has yet to Tweet, so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub. Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now. UPDATE 11:54 A. M. Oh, man, this keeps getting better and better. Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media. Oh Boy. Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just \u201ddead wrong\u201d  \u2014   Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) June 8, 2017,  I wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they\u2019re wrong. Not holding my breath. UPDATE 11:50 A. M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen. One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner, he had to break a date with his wife. Comey says Trump called him at his desk. \u201dFree for dinner tonight? \u201d\u201dI said yessir  \u2026    I had to call my wife and break a date with her.\u201d  \u2014   Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 8, 2017,  That\u2019s not the only   Comey testimony: COMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant: \u2019Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest\u201d  \u2014   Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, even CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta \u2014  a vehemently   media figure in the heart of the opposition party\u2019s mothership CNN \u2014  is joining in on the   fun. Giving info to media \u201dlike feeding seagulls at the beach?\u201d Fact check: True.  \u2014   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:48 A. M. The leaky Capitol Hill GOP swamp aides are attacking Trump, despite the fact Comey has vindicated the president and implicated himself in potentially illegal leaks. Senate R aide: Holding nose and defending Trump is taking a lot out of these GOP senators  \u2014   and they will demand some kind of repayment  \u2026      \u2014   Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 8, 2017,  The fact that Swamp Creatures on the \u201cRepublican\u201d side on Capitol Hill are throwing shade on their own president, and party, as the GOP and Trump likely emerge from today\u2019s masquerade mostly out of the woods is simply incredible but unsurprising. Swamp Things are going to Swamp. UPDATE 11:45 A. M. Comey\u2019s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble, the New York Times people note. That\u2019s the story folks. He vindicated Trump, and implicated himself. Wow, what a day. Can\u2019t remember the last time someone in DC openly acknowledged orchestrating a leak  \u2014   and without any senator having even asked.  \u2014   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:39 A. M. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica says that President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will make a statement at the end of Comey\u2019s public testimony. Marc Kasowitz, Trump\u2019s lawyer outside the White House, will make a statement at the end of James Comey\u2019s Senate testimony,  \u2014   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:35 A.

M. While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart\u2019s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2014  the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee \u2014  for obstruction of justice. Big takeaway from the Comey hearing: urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for obstruction,  \u2014   John Hayward (@Doc_0) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:29 A. M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media\u2019s and the Democrats\u2019 efforts to taint President Trump with \u201cobstruction of justice. \u201d \u201cDemocrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  \u2014   and reversing the 2016 elections  \u2014   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair,\u201d Pollak writes, pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch ( ). Read his whole story here. UPDATE 11:26 A. M. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has trolled Trump as much as he possibly can over the campaign and since, is joining with Union Pub patrons \u2014  who get free drinks if President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing \u2014  in raising concerns with the lack of Tweets today from President Trump. . @realDonaldTrump\u2019s silence on #ComeyDay concerns me. What\u2019s  going on, Don? I hope you don\u2019t hurt your fingers ranting against Comey later.  \u2014   Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:25 A. M. Entirely unsurprising, but leading Never Trumper Ana Navarro bashes the president \u2014  again \u2014  and praises Comey. Lot of time left, but so far, Comey is coming across as the consummate professional. A man who loves his country, colleagues  agency.  \u2014   Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:24 A. M. Since Comey has blown up the entire media narrative, essentially, Ric Grenell \u2014  a leading conservative   advocate \u2014  notes that the media is only using \u201cfacts\u201d that fit their worldview. Breaking: DC reporters are NOT tweeting the line where Comey destroys their anonymous sourced narratives.  \u2014   Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) June 8, 2017,  Kayleigh McEnany, one of the only   voices on the opposition party network CNN, Tweets another homerun: Of all the leaks, the one thing that never leaked was that the President was NOT under investigation.   Very suspicious! #ComeyDay,  \u2014   Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) June 8, 2017,  And Ann Coulter for the win: OBVIOUSLY Trump\u2019s request re: Flynn was to \u201clet go\u201d of Trump\u2019s firing of him. MSM was falsely claiming reason 4 firing was contacts w Russia,  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:21 A. M. from this morning\u2019s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXMTom Fitton of Judicial Watch,  says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by President Trump or his team. And he called the special counsel \u201cwasteful. \u201d If Robert Mueller, the special counsel, comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him, it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars \u2014  and of Americans\u2019 time \u2014  in a long time. Listen to the audio here, or at the link to the story from our own Dan Riehl: UPDATE 11:16 A. M. James Comey finally confirms before a congressional committee in a public setting \u2014  on video \u2014  that President Donald Trump is not under FBI investigation. James Comey confirms President Trump was not under investigation while he was FBI director https:  .  https:  .   \u2014   CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:15 A. M. During Comey\u2019s back and forth with Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) the former 2016 Trump GOP primary rival astutely noted that basically the only thing that did not leak to the press is the one fact that would have helped Trump \u2014  that Trump himself was not under investigation. That is despite the fact that Congressional leaders were briefed on that point. Rubio Comey back forth indicates Gang of 8 was briefed that Trump was not personally under investigation.  \u2014   Laura Rozen (@lrozen) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:11 A. M. Donald Trump, Jr. joins the fray on Twitter, defending his father \u2014  the president \u2014  from Comey\u2019s ambiguous claims.   Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear \u201dI hope nothing happens but you have to do your job\u201d  \u2014   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,    very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction!  \u2014   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  Trump, Jr. says there is no way Comey would have misunderstood the president.   Knowing my father for 39 years when he \u201dorders or tells\u201d you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,  \u2014   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  He also notes that Comey has testified that he could be \u201cwrong. \u201d Comey \u201dI could be wrong\u201d  \u2014   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  Donald Trump, Jr. \u2019s Tweets come as many here at Union Pub \u2014  who will get free drinks if the president himself Tweets about Comey \u2014  are disappointed that President Trump himself is not Tweeting. This is probably the first time ever that people in Washington, D. C. \u2014  the Swamp \u2014  are upset that President Donald Trump is NOT Tweeting. UPDATE 11:10 A. M. Video of Comey wishing there are tapes of his conversations with Trump: Comey: \u201dI\u2019ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d (via @MSNBC) pic. twitter.   \u2014   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:07 A. M. Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey\u2019s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him. \u201cFormer FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about \u2018shifting explanations\u2019 for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration,\u201d Pollak writes. \u201cComey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration\u2019s statements about the matter \u2018confused me and increasingly concerned me.\u2019 He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay. \u201d Read the whole thing. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal \u2014  not some rightwing blog by any stretch \u2014  even says that Comey\u2019s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him. Which is exactly what President Trump did. Read the Journal\u2019s editorial board piece here. UPDATE 11: 00 A. M. The GOP war room is up and running. Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey\u2019s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump, despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say:  Politico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning. Read the whole thing here. Politico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey\u2019s testimony. \u201cThe RNC\u2019s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different,\u201d Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director, told Politico. \u201cAnd we prepare for everything, and we\u2019re prepared for the hearing this week. \u201d Read the whole piece here. UPDATE 10:59 A. M. Despite the fact there have been a number of inaccurate pieces throughout the establishment media, the establishment media is celebrating itself. Most interesting part of Comey memo: How damn good the reporting has been. On. The. Nose.  \u2014   Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) June 8, 2017,  Also, fun: Sen.

We see you, @SenFeinstein. \ud83d\udcaf pic. twitter.   \u2014   ClotureClub. com (@ClotureClub) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:57 A. M. Feinstein tells Comey he\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cstrong,\u201d then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him. He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance. \u201cI hope there are tapes,\u201d Comey also said of his meetings with Trump, noting he has seen the president\u2019s Tweet about the possibility of tapes. UPDATE 10:55 A. M. Comey, under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation, and he said \u201cyes, because the President said so. \u201d Here in Union Pub, the   crowd broke out into laughter. UPDATE 10:53 A. M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d that the media is building, as fast as they began building it. He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation. UPDATE 10:51 A. M. The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza: The fired former FBI director\u2019s use of the word \u201clie\u201d twice, and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump. Establishment media going to do their thing. Comey has now used \u201dlie\u201d twice. 1. Referring to WH defaming him and the FBI: \u201dthose were lies\u201d:2.

M. Since Comey has nothing, and the whole case is falling apart, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s   Brian Fallon is sadly offering up that special counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump. WH plan of declaring victory because Trump was not being investigated in January is now moot. Comey made clear Mueller is investing him now,  \u2014   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  But, sadly, if they have no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians \u2014  probably because it is likely no evidence even exists \u2014  then the special prosecutor will find the same thing that Comey found: NOTHING. But, nevertheless Hillary Clinton\u2019s acolytes persisted: Comey said he expects Mueller to assess, as part of his investigation, whether Trump obstructed justice. That would mean he\u2019s a subject now.  \u2014   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:40 A. M. Comey testified that he was \u201cconfused\u201d about being fired by President Trump. And he said Trump spread \u201clies\u201d about the FBI. Comey describes being \u201cconfused\u201d by firing, \u201clies\u201d about FBI being in disarray pic. twitter.   \u2014   Washington Post (@washingtonpost) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:38 A. M. Since Comey believes that no votes were altered in the 2016 presidential election \u2014  he testified he is \u201cconfident\u201d none were \u2014  then what is the point of this hearing? #Comey says that he is \u201dconfident\u201d that no votes in 2016 were altered #ComeyHearing,  \u2014   Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:32 A. M. Despite the fact that Comey has nothing, but instead actually ended up in his written opening statement vindicating President Trump, the media elites in Washington are celebrating Comey\u2019s \u201cpoker face\u201d \u2014  as if it means something substantive. James Comey\u2019s poker face is savage. #ComeyTestimony,  \u2014   Michelle Ruiz (@michelleruiz) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:30 A. M. As Comey comes under questions from Burr, our very own Joel Pollak notes that Comey\u2019s altered opening statement was a deeply personal statement furthering the giant nothingburger he put out last night through the committee. Comey failing again so far, just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year. So far the Comey testimony is all about him  all about political retribution against the president for firing him. Disgraceful performance,  \u2014   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:26 A. M. Washington, D. C. elites are having a ball for themselves. Our intern Alex Clark with these photos: The Comey Pub Crawl!   pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alex Clark (@AlexCla59967291) June 8, 2017,  The Comey Pub crawl!   pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alex Clark (@AlexCla59967291) June 8, 2017,  The Comey Pub Crawl!   pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alex Clark (@AlexCla59967291) June 8, 2017,  The Comey Pub Crawl!   pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alex Clark (@AlexCla59967291) June 8, 2017,  But Union Pub is hardly the only place off the hook with the parties: We moved to another bar in DC. It is packed to capacity for Comey. People are WHISPERING to order their drinks so they can hear the TV. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) June 8, 2017,  There are many more. We\u2019ll get updates up soon. UPDATE 10:20 A. M. Audible gasps of disappointment were heard throughout Union Pub as Comey said he will not   his opening statement published online last night, a statement that completely vindicated President Trump. Comey, however, admits that the President can fire him whenever he wants. He also says that he heard Donald Trump thought he was doing a \u201cgreat job. \u201d But here in Union Pub, cheers erupted as a champagne bottle was popped open for more Washington, D. C. mimosas. UPDATE 10:17 A. M. As Warner wraps his righteous opening statement, in which he stated \u201cthis is not a witch hunt\u201d and \u201cthis is not fake news,\u201d the STANDING ROOM ONLY crowd at Union Pub laughs as Comey is forced by the chairman to stand and be sworn in under oath for his testimony. UPDATE 10:15 A. M. This real life parody is getting more and more out of control. Fired  . S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara is joining Comey in the hearing room. Yes, that is Preet Bharara sitting behind James Comey. Banquo\u2019s ghost.  \u2014   Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, our COVFEFE LIVEWIRE has earned the attention of New York Times media correspondent Michael Grynbaum. Breitbart\u2019s @mboyle1 is at Union Pub in DC to cover \u201cthe reaction of the crowd of Washington elites\u201d https:  .   \u2014   Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:12 A. M. Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate committee, opens up with his opening statement saying that this hearing has drawn focus from a lot of Washington, D. C. and that ordinary Americans really don\u2019t care and aren\u2019t paying attention. Maybe Congress could focus on real policy issues when this charade is over, but that would probably be asking too much of our elected representatives. UPDATE 10:11 A. M. Fox News is reporting that President Trump is expected to issue a statement disputing parts of Comey\u2019s testimony. UPDATE 10:10 A. M. Burr to Comey: \u201cThe American people need to hear your side of the story. \u201d UPDATE 10:04 A. M. As Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, opens the hearing, a hush comes over the crowd inside Union Pub. COVFEFE everyone! Here we go. UPDATE 10:03 A. M. James Comey has walked into the room where is going to testify in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Folks at Union Pub don\u2019t really seem to care much as they are engaged in deep conversation, very loudly, so loud one cannot hear the television. UPDATE 10:02 A. M. Comey\u2019s written testimony published last night basically proved he had nothing on Trump, and this whole case is going nowhere. Even   Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) admits that, saying none of this makes any sense on TV this morning. \u201dNobody in their right mind who believed they had a case, would take their star witness  allow them to go before the nation\u201d  \u2014   Sen. Graham pic. twitter.   \u2014   CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:00 A. M. Union Pub is up and running as the Comey hearing is about to begin.

M. Owen, a federal government employee who did not want us to publish his last name but is here partying as Comey is set to testify, said about the crowd size here \u201cit\u2019s about what you\u2019d expect \u2014  people here [in Washington] are easily more engaged than everyone else in the country. It\u2019s a symbol of a healthy, vibrant democracy. \u201d Bloody Mary\u2019s and Mimosos and beers by the pint are being poured by the hundreds already and Comey has not yet taken the stand. UPDATE 9:50 A. M. Breitbart\u2019s summer intern Alex Clark joins us here and spoke with Union Pub\u2019s general manager Ashley Saunders who told us \u201cI\u2019m way too busy \u2014  I\u2019m swamped\u201d when he asked if she could do a brief interview before the hearing begins. Union Pub is packed to the brim with Washingtonians celebrating Comey\u2019s testimony.'"}, "time": 1742564437.0162034}
