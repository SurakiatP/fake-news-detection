[In a discussion of University of Michigan women\u2019s swim team member G Ryan, ESPNW writer Katie Barnes notes that Ryan \u201cidentifies as genderqueer or  . \u201d She goes on to insist that the pool is \u201can oasis in a society obsessed with gender. \u201d  That \u201cobsession,\u201d Barnes claims, creates \u201cissues for Ryan where there do not need to be. \u201d Indeed, Ryan goes on to complain about her sport, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s still hard to get up and put on a suit some days. It\u2019s not the best sport. You\u2019re wandering around half naked for hours at a time. \u201d Barnes seems to find the subject difficult too, as throughout the piece she refers to Ryan  \u2014   who was born female  \u2014   as \u201cthey\u201d every time a personal pronoun is needed in the article. Barnes notes that Ryan demands that people call her \u201cthey\u201d or \u201cthem\u201d when talking of her, according to Newsbusters. org, As Barnes notes,   is used as a \u201c  option to the more common   or   pronouns because they better reflect their identity as genderqueer. \u201d The University of Michigan bent over backwards to accommodate Ryan\u2019s demands for the use of  . Barnes writes: Ryan came out to the team as   nearly a year ago  \u2026     Over the past year, the team has made adjustments to the language it uses because, frankly, Ryan\u2019s presence challenges the very binary that governs classification in athletics. The team Ryan swims on is commonly referred to as \u201cTeam 42\u201d rather than the women\u2019s team (it is the 42nd edition of the \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d team) and emails are addressed using   language such as \u201cBlue\u201d or \u201cAll Michigan athletes. \u201d Barnes\u2019 revelations of how Coach Mike Bottom is dealing with all this is typical of the tortured logic and grammar employed to bend to Ryan\u2019s demands (my bold): \u201cWe sing about their growth,\u201d Michigan swimming and diving coach Mike Bottom said of Ryan. \u201cAs they begin to understand themselves, there\u2019s been a strength that\u2019s moved into the water, and out of the water. That\u2019s been the excitement. \u201d Naturally, Barnes had to shift from Ryan\u2019s complaints, and the Michigan swim team\u2019s reaction, to politics. It is a simple change but not an easy one. Ryan\u2019s presence asks the complicated question, of what does inclusion of   athletes look like in an athletic system defined as a binary? There is no simple answer to that question, and it is one being grappled with across the United States. At times the lack of understanding of trans identity is used as a cudgel to ostracize trans people, as seen in North Carolina with HB2 and more recently in Texas with Mack Beggs and the consideration of SB6. But as Newsbusters\u2019 Jay Maxson notes, there has been a lot of use of the \u201ccudgel\u201d to \u201costracize\u201d Americans who want to continue recognizing biological and traditional gender identifications, not to mention those who have safety and religious concerns. So, while ESPN\u2019s Barnes slams the country for this \u201cobsession with gender,\u201d she indulges her own obsession with rewriting the rules for how we address gender.
