[\u201cKaren Handel\u2019s opponent in #GA06 can\u2019t even vote in the district he wants to represent because he doesn\u2019t even live there!\u201d Trump scoffed on Twitter about Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff. \u201cHe wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare. \u201d  Trump urged voters to vote for Handel during the last day of campaigning. The election is Tuesday. Handel is running to succeed Tom Price, who left office to work as the Secretary for Health and Human Services for the Trump administration. Polling shows the two candidates locked in a statistical tie as Republicans and Democrats have spent roughly $50 million on the race. A loss for Handel will be interpreted by the media as a sign that Trump\u2019s agenda is no longer supported by the American people who elected him. Handel also recently welcomed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to campaign for her, as well as House Speaker Paul Ryan. The group \u201cBikers for Trump\u201d was also recently spotted in Georgia campaigning for Handel.'"}, "time": 1742628508.5455525}
