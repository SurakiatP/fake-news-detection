It is good for growing cotton and cucumbers, the crops she worked as a child and hated. And it is bad for burying things  \u2014   in particular, septic tanks. So Ms. Rudolph, 64, did what many people around here do. She ran a plastic pipe from her toilet under her yard and into the woods behind her house. Paying to put in a septic tank would cost around $6, 000  \u2014   a little more than half of her family\u2019s annual income. \u201cIt was a whole lot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is. \u201d Here in Lowndes County, part of a strip of mostly poor,   counties that cuts through the rural center of Alabama, less than half of the population is on a municipal sewer line. While that is not a hardship for more affluent communities  \u2014   about one in five American homes are not on city sewer lines  \u2014   the legacy of rural poverty has left its imprint here: Many people have failing septic tanks and are too poor to fix them. Others, like Ms. Rudolph, have nothing at all. That is not so uncommon. Nearly half a million households in the United States lack the basic dignity of hot and cold running water, a bathtub or shower, or a working flush toilet, according to the Census Bureau. The absence has implications for public health in the very population that is the most vulnerable. Crumbling infrastructure has been a theme of this country\u2019s reinvigorated public conversation about race  \u2014   for instance, a botched fix for old pipes in Flint, Mich. that contaminated the city\u2019s drinking water with lead. But in poor, rural places like Lowndes County, there has never been much infrastructure to begin with. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything  \u2014   no running water, no inside bathrooms,\u201d said John Jackson, a former mayor of White Hall, a town of about 800 in Lowndes that is more than 90 percent black and did not have running water until the early 1980s. \u201cThose were things we were struggling for. \u201d There is no formal count of residents without proper plumbing in Lowndes, but Kevin White, an environmental engineering professor at the University of South Alabama, said that a survey that he did in a neighboring county years ago found that about 35 percent of homes had septic systems that were failing, with raw sewage on the ground. Another 15 percent had nothing. \u201cThe bottom line is, I can\u2019t afford a septic system,\u201d said Cheryl Ball, a former cook who had a heart attack several years ago and receives disability payments. She lives in a grassy field on which only three of seven homes have septic tanks. Most banks now require proof that a home has proper sewage disposal before lending, but Ms. Ball paid cash for her mobile home  \u2014   $4, 000. This area, known as the Black Belt (so called more for its soil, than its demographics) is haunted by its history of white violence toward   and a deep, biting poverty. Lowndes is one of the poorest counties in the country, and its rural population, whose trailers and small houses dot the lush green landscape, often cannot afford the thousands of dollars it costs to put in a tank. Municipalities, with low tax bases, cannot afford extensive sewer lines. Ms. Rudolph, a retired seamstress, and her husband, a carpenter, live in a tiny, white clapboard house that he built after he, his parents and his siblings fled their home on land owned by a white man who forbade the family to vote. She remembers, as a young girl in the 1950s, not having electricity. They obtained running water in the early 1990s, she said, and used an outhouse until the  . So their white toilet with a fuzzy green cover was a marker of progress. A plastic pipe carries its contents outside and empties into a wooded area not far from the house. There is no visible pooling of sewage, but there are other problems. \u201cThe smell gets so bad,\u201d said Ms. Rudolph, sitting on her porch guarding her chicken coop against a marauding fox. When it rains, she wages war with her toilet. One recent downpour brought its contents gurgling up to the rim. \u201cI was sitting there looking at it and got me a plunger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me some plunging to get it clear. I was scared it was going to come back and go on the floor. Horrible. \u201d She added, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. \u201d The problem is prickly for the state. Parrish Pugh, an official with the Alabama Department of Public Health, agrees that money plays a part. \u201cThat\u2019s where the rubber hits the road,\u201d he said. But Alabama law forbids the use of \u201cinsanitary sewage collection,\u201d and the responsibility for that rests squarely with the homeowner,\u201d Mr. Pugh said. Resisting is not only illegal, but could have health consequences: Raw sewage can taint drinking water and cause health problems. \u201c\u2018My parents had a pipe that ran into the woods, and that\u2019s good enough for me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pugh said, explaining a common argument. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know as much about disease back then. People are more educated nowadays. They are more concerned. \u201d The state health department begs, cajoles, and eventually cites people who have problems and do not fix them. In the early 2000s, the authorities even tried arresting people. That prompted a public outcry and the practice soon stopped, but one person spent a weekend in jail and others were left with criminal records. The department cited about 700 people in the 12 months that ended in March, often because someone complained. The clay soil makes the problem worse. \u201cRural wastewater is usually managed with a septic tank and a drain field, which slowly infiltrates the wastewater into the ground,\u201d Professor White said. \u201cWell, it won\u2019t go into the ground here. Period. \u201d He added: \u201cThere are some options that may be available, but it\u2019s going to cost thousands of dollars, and most people here can\u2019t afford it. The answer, quite frankly, is not out there yet. \u201d Experts and advocates have tried to find one. Grants from the state and federal governments to study the problem have come and gone, as have academics wielding surveys. There was even talk of   toilets. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re going in circles,\u201d said Perman Hardy, a cook in Tyler who even did a urinalysis for a study of health effects. For years, her sewage backed up every time it rained. In December, she spent all the money she had saved for Christmas presents on a new septic tank. Some change is happening. The town of White Hall recently received funding to connect about 50 homes to sewer lines, the first in its history. Town officials are thrilled: City sewer lines are critical to attract businesses that would bring jobs. But the pace is glacial. Eli Seaborn, 73, a White Hall councilman, said progress would be slow, like the pace of civil rights gains, where legal discrimination is gone but lingers in other forms. Similar patience is required for sewage, he added. \u201cTime is going to be the only thing that solves this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took more than 50 years for it to happen. But hopefully, it won\u2019t take more than 50 years to fix it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562363.515754}
