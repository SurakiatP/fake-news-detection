The 300 closings mentioned in its Q3 earnings report, first announced in August, are on top of 400 closures already planned since 2014. \\nWhile the plan to merge with rival Staples would have created an international office supply juggernaut with an impressive brick-and-mortar presence to neutralize the growing threat posed by online competition, Staples and Office Depot are now once again rivals, each scrambling to figure out what comes next. On a conference call with analysts Wednesday, though, Smith insisted that its plans are clear and reiterated a strategy to build business contracts sales and streamline its supply chain in the name of \u201coptimizing and reinventing retail.\u201d \\n\u201cWe believe there are significant additional opportunities to transition to a more effective sales coverage model for accounts of all sizes by balancing the benefits of an inside and outside sales coverage model,\u201d Smith said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript . \u201cWe are pleased with our initial progress in these areas and expect the sales trends in our Business Solutions Division to improve in the coming quarters as we continue to grow our sales pipeline and convert customer commitments into revenue and profit.\u201d Post navigation Warning : array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /home/content/p3pnexwpnas07_data02/05/3222705/html/wp-content/plugins/widget-options/core/functions.widget.display.php on line 182 Warning : array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /home/content/p3pnexwpnas07_data02/05/3222705/html/wp-content/plugins/widget-options/core/functions.widget.display.php on line 182 Warning : array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /home/content/p3pnexwpnas07_data02/05/3222705/html/wp-content/plugins/widget-options/core/functions.widget.display.php on line 182 Warning : array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /home/content/p3pnexwpnas07_data02/05/3222705/html/wp-content/plugins/widget-options/core/functions.widget.display.php on line 182 RESOURCES'"}, "time": 1742562104.3952677}
