[Suspicions arose after the Washington Post\u2018s Adam Entous reported Wednesday that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) \u201cmade a politically explosive assertion in a private conversation on Capitol Hill with his fellow GOP leaders: that Trump could be the beneficiary of payments from Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201d  The story was treated by other news outlets as a potential \u201csmoking gun\u201d implicating Trump. A closer look, however, raises serious questions about the story, as well as its sources. The Post based its reporting on an audio recording of a conversation between McCarthy and Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers ( ) Steve Scalise ( ) and Patrick McHenry ( ) on June 15, 2016. It is not clear who recorded the conversation, or what kind of device was used. (Entous did not return a request for comment.) The Post did not post the actual audio recording for readers to listen to and judge for themselves. Instead, it posted a supposed transcript of the recording, riddled with typographical errors that would be atypical for the Post, at least in an important story. (The Post routinely accuses conservative journalists like James O\u2019Keefe  \u2014   falsely  \u2014   of editing their videos in a misleading manner. In 2012, the Post\u2018s media critic, Erik Wemple, mocked O\u2019Keefe: \u201cA great deal of work is required to heavily edit surreptitious encounters with folks throughout the professional world. \u201d Yet now the Post has published a blockbuster story based on audio that may be edited deceptively  \u2014   and there is no way to know.) On Wednesday evening, Entous told Lawrence O\u2019Donnell on MSNBC: \u201cThe source, which basically let us listen to the recording, has not provided us with the audio for us to release, otherwise I think we would. So I have listened to it, and some of my colleagues have listened to it several times   \u2026     There\u2019s about four of us that listened to it. \u201d He did not say how they had listened to it  \u2014   whether over the telephone, or in a voice mail, or as an email attachment. The Post does not appear ever to have had the audio in its possession. Entous merely wrote that the audio \u201cwas listened to and verified by The Washington Post. \u201d The term \u201cverified\u201d could mean anything  \u2014   it could simply mean the audio Entous heard matched the transcript. It does not mean that the Post had confirmed that the audio was unedited, nor does it mean that the Post confirmed the authenticity of the recording with the people present. Curiously, the dateline on Entous\u2019s story was Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. McCarthy and Ryan held talks earlier that day with Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman on Capitol Hill. None of the Post reporters involved in the story  \u2014   including \u201cAndrew Roth in Moscow, Michael Birnbaum in Brussels and Robert Costa in Washington\u201d  \u2014   is based in Ukraine. It is not clear why overseas reporters were involved in the story. Breitbart News\u2019 sources, who agreed to speak about the Post story without attribution, raised suspicions about Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent who ran a small   presidential campaign in 2016. McMullin was the policy director of the House Republican Conference at the time of the conversation, and reportedly participated in the discussion. In February, McMullin publicly encouraged U. S. intelligence officials to leak information about President Trump, taking to Twitter and appearing on CNN to claim that intelligence agents who were breaking the law were doing so in service of their oath to defend the Constitution against \u201cdomestic and foreign enemies. \u201d He told CNN that \u201cDonald Trump presents a threat to the country,\u201d and referred to \u201ca security threat coming from the White House. \u201d He also offered Entous a comment for his story in the Post: \u201cIt\u2019s true that Majority Leader McCarthy said that he thought candidate Trump was on the Kremlin\u2019s payroll. Speaker Ryan was concerned about that leaking,\u201d he said. The transcript itself suggests McCarthy was joking. The context of the private conversation was a discussion about how Russian propaganda has infiltrated Ukraine and beyond. McCarthy told his colleagues that the Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee to find opposition research on Trump, and then laughed. According to the transcript at the Post, the conversation then proceeded as follows  \u2014   punctuated by repeated bouts of laughter: McCarthy: The Russians hacked the DNC and got the opp [sic] research that they had on Trump. McCarthy: laughs, [Crosstalk] Ryan: The Russian\u2019s [sic] hacked the DNC  \u2026     McHenry:   \u2026    to get oppo  \u2026     Ryan:   \u2026    on Trump and like delivered it to  \u2026    to who? [Unintelligible] McCarthy: There\u2019s  \u2026    there\u2019s two people, I think, Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump  \u2026    [laughter]  \u2026    swear to God. Ryan: This is an off the record  \u2026    [laughter]  \u2026    NO LEAKS  \u2026    [laughter]  \u2026    alright?! [Laughter] Ryan: This is how we know we\u2019re a real family here. Entous seemed determined to portray that exchange as a serious revelation of evidence against Trump. Several paragraphs into his article, he admitted: \u201cIt is difficult to tell from the recording the extent to which the remarks were meant to be taken literally. \u201d Yet he has since been at pains to paint McCarthy\u2019s statement as a serious one. On MSNBC\u2019s Hardball, Entous told Chris Matthews: \u201cI listened to it very carefully, and he says it very seriously. \u201d Later, he told O\u2019Donnell, \u201cI want to be really honest   \u2026     Frankly, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell. Certainly the conversation is very, very serious. \u201d (O\u2019Donnell chimed in to offer \u201cCatholic boy guidance,\u201d saying that \u201cpeople with names like Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan,\u201d the phrase \u201cswear to God\u201d means that a statement is to be taken literally.) Entous went on to say that McCarthy had spoken \u201cvery  \u201d but admitted \u201csome people in the room laugh[ed]. \u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
