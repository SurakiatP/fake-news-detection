Limbaugh said despite the lack of evidence of such ties, there are these investigations underway and that it goes beyond incompetence, which he called a \u201csilent coup. \u201d Limbaugh went on to criticize former FBI Director James Comey, who he suggested exhibited odd behavior regarding his interactions with Trump. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy RushLimbaugh. com): I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a lot of incompetence here. I know what you mean by that, but I think (sigh) this is all being fairly well executed by the people who have a strategy behind it. I mean, you have to have a lot of pieces in place to be able to carry out a story for which there\u2019s no evidence for over a year. You have to have a  \u2026     You want to talk about a conspiracy? I mean, people love conspiracy theories. How\u2019s this happen? How do we get no evidence of anything into five investigations on Capitol Hill, numerous media investigations, and the big investigation by the real pros: The CIA, the NSA, and the FBI? Those are the people that can survival and wiretap, and there\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s not a scintilla. There\u2019s not a whit. There\u2019s no evidence whatsoever. And yet theirs no end is in sight to this. That\u2019s a pretty good trick, and it takes a conspiracy. It takes a lot of people conspiring together to make this happen. All it would take to unravel this is for one of these people on the left to say, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any evidence. \u201cWhat are we doing here? We\u2019re wasting our time. We need to look at something else. We\u2019re not gonna find any evidence. There\u2019s no evidence!\u201d All it would take is one person in the media, in the FBI, the CIA, the NSA. All it would take would be one staffer somewhere of one Democrat. All it would take would be one renegade media member. And not a single leak, not a single betrayal of this. So I don\u2019t think this is incompetence. I think it\u2019s much worse. I think it has a purposeful, studied effort and outcome, which is a coup. We are watching a silent coup here to oust a duly elected president, and this coup is being mounted by career government people who can traffic anonymously and who are protected by people in the media and within the Democrat Party. Stop and think of it, folks. A year. How many  \u2026    ? Hasn\u2019t the Washington Post at one time admitted that they have over 30 anonymous sources for all of this? That\u2019s just one newspaper, 30 anonymous sources there. How many anonymous people are talking New York Times? How much overlap? How many sources are talking to both places? All these deep state career government people,   people that are civilians now? We don\u2019t know. But it is a lot of people, and there isn\u2019t any evidence. There\u2019s none! And it\u2019s gonna continue whether or not  \u2026     Not only is there no evidence, there\u2019s nothing to suggest the need of a special counsel. They can\u2019t even find a   to cover up the fact that there\u2019s no evidence. What is the  ? When you don\u2019t have a crime, then what the hell is being covered up? But they\u2019ve got people believing that there\u2019s a scandal here, and you know what the scandal is? Firing Comey. That\u2019s not a scandal. Firing Comey? The president can do that any time he wants for whatever reason he wants, and he doesn\u2019t need anybody\u2019s permission. But that is the supposed scandal. Now, about Comey, I mentioned earlier that I was reading some things last night about it and I said, \u201cThis is embarrassing. This is really a bit of desperation here. \u201d You have to balance what\u2019s coming up here with another reputation that we\u2019ve been presented with. In the case of James Comey  \u2014   and this goes back to the Bush presidency when he was a deputy attorney general for John Ashcroft. That\u2019s when I first became aware of the name of James Comey, and from that day forward James Comey has been presented as a lawyer beyond repute. He is a lawyer who exudes integrity. He is flawless. He has never slipped up. This man is the epitome of honesty. This man is the epitome of courage. This man is the epitome of independence. This is the reputation of James Comey. This is why the Clinton campaign went through such conniptions when Comey was doing what he was doing, because he was doing all of that with the finest reputation anybody in Washington has ever had. Now that reputation\u2019s beginning to crumble. That\u2019s the dirty little secret. That reputation\u2019s starting to take some hits, and not because of anything Trump did. Because of things Comey has done. The July 5th press conference, the October 28th letter to Congress, the listing of charges but there\u2019s not gonna be any prosecution. That just isn\u2019t done. There\u2019s all kinds of things being done. And now this guy with the impeccable reputation all of a sudden some people are whispering he\u2019s got a power complex. People are starting to whisper, \u201cThis man\u2019s trying to make it all about himself. This man\u2019s trying to figure out where the bright lights are in every story and end up right in them. \u201d Well, those are serious, serious assaults if you have spent your life crafting and building this impeccable reputation for virtue and for honesty and for integrity. So it\u2019s against all that that this now is beginning to happen. So here\u2019s the first thing. This is Washington Examiner: \u201cComey Hid Among White House Curtains to Avoid Trump. \u201d I\u2019m sorry. The only reason we know this is because Comey told somebody, and the fact that Comey\u2019s telling people this so that they will then tell the media? I would be embarrassed, is what I\u2019m saying. This is embarrassing. \u201cFormer FBI Director James Comey now says he tried to hide among the tall, blue curtains adorning a White House meeting room in an attempt to hide from President Trump at an Inauguration Day event. \u201cComey said the incident was one example of what he believed were times Trump tried to create a public image that showed Comey was on his side. \u201d So we have image protection going on here. (translated) \u201cWe have my independence is at stake here! I\u2019ve got to do something! That\u2019s bad. So now I\u2019m gonna tell people I had to hide in the curtains. This guy Trump? This guy Trump was so eager to corrupt me, so eager to make it look like he and I were buds, I had to hide in the curtains!\u201d The FBI director is admitting that he hid from the president of the United States in the curtains on Inauguration Day. This is embarrassing! Benjamin Wittes, who runs a blog  \u2014   Lawfare or some such thing  \u2014   is said to be a good Comey friend. Quote, \u201cComey described really not wanting to go to that meeting\u201d on Inauguration Day, \u201cfor the same reason he later did not want to go to the private dinner with Trump: the FBI director should be always at arm\u2019s length from the president, in his view. \u201cThere was an additional sensitivity here too,\u201d Benjamin Wittes said, \u201cbecause many Democrats blamed Comey for Trump\u2019s election, so he didn\u2019t want any shows of closeness between the two that might reinforce a perception that he had put a thumb on the scale in Trump\u2019s favor. \u201d This is so embarrassing. This is a window into the way Comey\u2019s thinking, and all he\u2019s thinking about is himself! He\u2019s making all of this about him! Most people do. Most people\u2019s egos are such that everything ends up being about them. But this is not about James Comey, and yet he\u2019s trying to make it about him, and this is about trying to save and protect his reputation. And then he goes on to say (paraphrased) \u201cI didn\u2019t want to shape Trump\u2019s hand. You know, Trump when he shakes your hand he pulls you to him and he tries to make it look like you\u2019re buddies and friends. \u201d No, no, no, no. You people, you\u2019ve been in politics so long, you don\u2019t understand how people actually interact with each other in the real world. But Comey thought that Trump was engaging  \u2026     Everything Trump was doing was designed to create an image that he and Comey were buds. (scoffs) But Benjamin Wittes said, \u201cMr. Comey also felt he could not refuse a presidential invitation, particularly not one that went to a broad array of law enforcement leadership. \u201d So it wasn\u2019t just Comey? You\u2019ve got all other kinds of law enforcement people there, and yet Comey admits to hiding in the curtains so that Trump will not notice him? (scoffs) This is like my cat thinking I can\u2019t see her when her head\u2019s poking around the corner. How in the world do you hide in the curtains and think you\u2019re not going to be seen in more importantly: Why would you then like this story? Because it feeds the lunatic left.
