I am not sure sometimes, but it is indeed worrisome that an individual has the resources and connections to even attempt a color revolution. However, a similar \u201crocking of the boat\u201d has been taking place in the U.S. with Ayles and the Koch brothers bankrolling a deep right revolution of the government. W ikileaks\u2019 Podesta Files shed light on US billionaire George Soros\u2019 deep concerns about the lack of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cconstitutional democracy\u201d in Malaysia under Najib Razak. Soros\u2019 concerns may serve as a prelude for a series of \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d in Southeast Asia, Mathew Maavak of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia assumed in an interview with Sputnik.\\nThe latest set of documents released by Wikileaks indicates that George Soros and his Open Society Foundation are very concerned about the situation in Malaysia, one of the US\u2019 longstanding allies in Southeast Asia. \\nA memo , sent by Michael Vachon, US billionaire George Soros\u2019\u201cright hand,\u201d on March 6, 2016, to Chairman of Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign John Podesta shed light on the Malaysian \u201ccorruption crisis\u201d and blamed the country\u2019s Prime Minister Najib Razak for \u201cdamaging the US\u2019 credibility in the region.\u201d \\n\u201cMalaysia could one day be a good ally of the United States in countering Islamic State [Daesh in Arabic] extremism, but not before it has achieved the freedom and constitutional democracy that its people have been denied,\u201d the memo read. However, it seems that the US financial and political elite have yet another reason to be dissatisfied with the Malaysian prime minister, besides his alleged involvement in corruption scandal. \u201cMalaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak heads to China next week to build closer ties and seek investment, which may further dent US aims in Southeast Asia after a push by President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines to bolster China ties,\u201d Reuters reported Thursday. Both Malaysia and the Philippines have long been in dispute with China over the South China Sea . However, Kuala Lumpur may follow in the footsteps of Manila, seeking to ease tensions with Beijing in exchange for economic benefits, the media outlet assumed. So, what did Soros mean by highlighting the need for democratic change in Malaysia? \u2018There is no Business like the Revolutions Business\u2019 \u201cFirst and foremost, one needs to understand Soros and his business model,\u201d Mathew Maavak, a doctoral researcher in Risk Foresight at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and regular contributor to CCTV told Sputnik. \u201cThere is no business like the \u2018revolutions business.\u2019 It is more lucrative than the show business which can flop due to an unforeseen shortcoming. Revolutions, on the other hand, only need to tap into the evergreen market of public discontent. NGOs and the West-friendly media constitute a major subsidiary of the global social revolutions enterprise. Together, they seek out, identify and amplify public discontent in nations not aligned to the United States. Such US-engineered activisms have never led to more equitable societies; rather they have engendered endless bloodshed and global terrorism,\u201d the researcher emphasized. Maavak dubbed these human rights entities and philanthropists \u201cagitprop entrepreneurs.\u201d \u201cTo the agitprop entrepreneur, the returns on revolutionary investments are immense,\u201d he underscored. \u201cA wealthy hedge fund manager can short a targeted market before executing a pre-planned \u2018revolution.\u2019 The resultant stock market and currency meltdown would provide self-evidentiary \u2018proof\u2019 to an anxious public, exerting more pressure on the government of the day to either capitulate or concede to \u2018popular demands\u2019 that are actually drafted abroad, likely by the IMF!\u201d \u201cTherefore, even if a revolution fails, the subsequent economic fallout would render local assets cheap for foreign acquisition,\u201d the researcher remarked. Soros\u2019 Alleged Role in Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 Maavak referred the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which started in Thailand with the financial collapse of the Thai baht, the country\u2019s national currency. \u201cThat seemed like Soros business plan for Malaysia and the ASEAN region during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis,\u201d he noted. Indeed, some observers blame George Soros for the slump. South China Morning Post\u2019s columnist Zhou Xin went even further, stressing that Soros, \u201cwhose aggressive currency trades were blamed for destroying the Thai and Malaysian economies\u201d in 1997 made yet another attempt to destabilize Asia\u2019s economies by targeting Hong Kong markets in 1998. \u201cThe entire region was in turmoil, and the name of George Soros featured prominently in this sordid saga. The \u2018Reformasi\u2019 [protest] movement led by sacked [Malaysian] Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim \u2014 who had close to ties to Washington hawks \u2014 failed to topple the government of the day,\u201d Maavak recalled. The Reformasi, kicked off in September 1998, consisted of civil disobedience, demonstrations, sit-ins, rioting, occupations and online activism, involving thousands across Malaysia protesting against the government. However, despite execrating Soros for his role in shorting the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, and for supporting the Reformasi movement, former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad did little to stem the vast NGO and alternative media networks that were being built by the Open Society Foundation and its affiliates, backed by the US State Department, Maavak pointed out. \u201cThere was a good reason for Mahathir\u2019s lack of decisiveness, apart from the occasional arrests and police raids,\u201d Maavak suggested, \u201cUpon stepping down from power, he used these same networks to oust his successor Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, and is now using the same Fifth Column to attempt the ouster of current Prime Minister Najib Razak.\u201d A Series of Domino \u2018Color Revolutions\u2019 in Southeast Asia \u201cWithout chaos in ASEAN, Soros and the transnational capitalist class may stand to lose a lot of money,\u201d the researcher suggested. \u201cThey need Najib ousted as a prelude to a series of domino \u2018color revolutions\u2019 in the region. In Malaysia, the color chosen was yellow and it is used by the Bersih (Clean) coalition that probably sees [Democratic presidential nominee] Hillary Clinton as the paragon of virtue and transparent governance,\u201d he assumed. Maavak\u2019s prognosis is by no means groundless, given the fact that ASEAN countries have signaled their willingness to strengthen their ties with China, drifting away from Washington. \u201cWashington has suffered geopolitical setbacks in virtually every nation in Asia Pacific,\u201d Tony Cartalucci, a Bangkok-based geopolitical analyst, noted in his recent article for New Eastern Outlook, stressing that the US\u2019 influence is rapidly waning across the Asia Pacific region . \\nBidding for hegemony in Asia Pacific US financial and political elite will do whatever it takes to curtail China\u2019s influence and pressure ASEAN economies into obeying Washington, according to Maavak. \\nNote to Commenters Due to severe hacking attacks in the recent past that brought our site down for up to 11 days with considerable loss of circulation, we exercise extreme caution in the comments we publish, as the comment box has been one of the main arteries to inject malicious code.
