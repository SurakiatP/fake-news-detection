Hackers exposed her secrets then her husband\u2019s sex scandal opened the floodgates\u2026 Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\u2019s top assistant for years, has perhaps become the most significant\u00c2 figure in the final weeks of the 2016 Election. Born in the United States, Abedin\u2019s family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was two. At age 18, she returned to the United States, and, in 1996, at age 20, started interning for Hillary Clinton. From 2002-2008, she also worked for her mother\u2019s radical Muslim magazine, the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs. Reportedly, the Journal advocates Sharia law and denounces the right of women. Through WikiLeaks, we recently learned just how close Huma was to Hillary.

It makes sense, now, to conclude that Huma knew much more about the email scandal that has plagued the Clinton Campaign for some time. Justin Cooper was the Clinton aide who set up the email server.

Or, did Anthony Weiner create the folder, for his own bargaining options? So did Huma steal 10,000 emails and saved it on her comp just in case Clinton targeted her? \\nHence: \u201clife insurance\u201d \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x94 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 30, 2016 FBI Source: Weiner singing like a bird for a deal; he knows what happens to pedophiles in prison \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x94 Jack Posobiec \u0111\\x9f\\x87\u015f\u0111\\x9f\\x87\u00b8 (@JackPosobiec) October 30, 2016 \\nSome news outlets have wondered if Huma Abedin is actually a spy. \\nGiven Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner\u2019s backgrounds, all of these questions are legitimate. \\nConsider this revealing video, created by the hacking group, Anonymous: Anonymous said it best: \u00e2\\x80\\x9cWho is Huma?\u00e2\\x80\\x9d'"}, "time": 1742628519.9849489}
