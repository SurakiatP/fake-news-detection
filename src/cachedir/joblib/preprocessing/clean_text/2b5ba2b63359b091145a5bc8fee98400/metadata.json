So three years ago, she quit to take a job in Japan. A garment factory there promised Ms. Liu three times her $   Chinese wage, and she hoped to save thousands of dollars for her family, which was growing with the recent birth of a son. \u201cIt seemed like a big opportunity,\u201d she recalled. Call it an opportunity, maybe, but don\u2019t call it work. Legally, the time Ms. Liu spent ironing and packing women\u2019s wear in Japan is considered \u201ctraining. \u201d She had entered the murky and at times abusive world of Japan\u2019s technical trainees  \u2014   essentially   laborers brought in from abroad to fill jobs that Japanese citizens aren\u2019t taking. Just like the United States and other developed countries, Japan has a hard time finding people to pick vegetables, collect   bedpans and wash restaurant dishes. In America, many of these     jobs are filled by illegal immigrants, an arrangement attacked by President Trump during his campaign. Japan, on the other hand, long ago achieved what Mr. Trump has promised: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking   work. Now, though, its tough stance on immigration  \u2014   legal and illegal  \u2014   is causing problems. Many Japanese industries are suffering from severe labor shortages, which has helped put a brake on economic growth. That is prompting Japan to question some fundamental assumptions about its labor needs. The debate is politically delicate, but changing realities on the ground  \u2014   in Japan\u2019s factories and fields  \u2014   are forcing politicians to catch up. Japan\u2019s total   labor force topped one million for the first time last year, according to the government, lifted in part by people entering the country on visas reserved for technical trainees. That growth has also led to an increase in cases of worker abuse and fraud, labor activists say. Ms. Liu is part of that debate. She arrived in Japan in debt after paying brokers $7, 000 to arrange her visa. Once there, she said, she found onerous working conditions and    pay. Her bosses, she said, \u201ctreat us like slaves. \u201d Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers at her factory came to Japan through a   internship program. Its purpose is to square the circle between Japan\u2019s labor shortage and its ban on   immigration. Farms,   businesses and many manufacturers would struggle to stay afloat without foreign trainees, specialists say. \u201cPractically every vegetable in the supermarkets of Tokyo was picked by a trainee,\u201d said Kiyoto Tanno, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University. To appease business groups, the government has created immigration loopholes, and hundreds of thousands of   workers like Ms. Liu have poured through them. They come from China and Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia, and they are filling empty jobs in Japan as the Japanese population shrinks, becoming a crucial if underacknowledged motor of the economy. Their numbers are soaring. The trainee program has doubled in size in the last five years, to over 200, 000, according to official data, and the government is planning to expand it. The biggest source of workers has been China, but much of the recent growth has come from Vietnam. Few doubt that \u201ctraining\u201d is a fig leaf. Beyond a short period of language study, most trainees receive little or no instruction that would distinguish them from regular manual laborers, specialists and participants say. \u201cThe system is like calling a crow white,\u201d said Yoshio Kimura, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who heads the party\u2019s labor committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really doing is importing labor. \u201d Training is not the only way around Japanese immigration restrictions. There are also students in   jobs, asylum seekers waiting for refugee applications to be processed  \u2014   almost all are ultimately rejected  \u2014   and South Americans of Japanese descent who can obtain special visas based on their ancestry. Demand still outstrips supply. The number of   Japanese has been falling since the   a consequence of decades of low birthrates. Nationwide unemployment is just 3 percent, and in some places, jobs are simply going begging. There are three to four positions open in nursing care and construction for every person who applies, according to government surveys. Eventually, Japan plans to lengthen the maximum time that trainees can stay in the country to five years, from three, and allow more kinds of businesses to hire them, including nursing homes and cleaning companies for offices and hotels. Parliament approved the creation of a new agency to oversee the trainee program last year, in response to criticism over worker exploitation. Once it is in place, the plan is to bring in more workers. Mr. Kimura and some other lawmakers want to go further, by establishing a formal guest worker system. Though it would not open a path to immigration  \u2014   workers would still be expected to go home eventually  \u2014   it would be more forthright than the current approach. Business groups favor the proposal, and the Liberal Democrats approved it as party policy in May. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has not indicated whether it will follow through. \u201cIf we want economic growth in the future, we need foreigners,\u201d Mr. Kimura said. Nobuya Takai, a lawyer who has represented foreign trainees in labor disputes, said the pretense that trainees are not workers contributes to problems. Companies do not hire them directly, but through a byzantine system of government and   middlemen. Most trainees end up thousands of dollars in debt to pay broker fees before they even arrive, say Mr. Takai and others who have studied the program. And because trainees cannot easily switch jobs  \u2014   their visas tie them to a single company  \u2014   they lack what should be major leverage: the ability to walk out on a bad employer. \u201cThey can\u2019t change jobs, and they lose money if they go home,\u201d Mr. Takai said. In 2011, an American State Department report on human trafficking flagged the trainee program for what it said were inadequate protections against \u201cdebt bondage\u201d and other abuses. When trainees don\u2019t save enough to repay broker fees, they sometimes stay on illegally. Almost 6, 000 did so in 2015, according to Japan\u2019s Justice Ministry. (There are about 60, 000 foreigners total in Japan without valid visas, according to the government, compared with an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States.) The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen trainees. All of them said they had paid labor brokers in their home countries, usually $7, 000 to $11, 000, to come to Japan to work. Most borrowed the money from family or banks. The trainees came from several countries in Asia and worked in different industries, in different parts of Japan: a Cambodian construction worker, a Chinese lettuce picker, seamstresses from China and Vietnam. Complaints about unpaid labor were common. Cao Bao, a    from Jilin Province in northeast China, worked for Kishimoto Manufacturing, a small auto parts supplier in central Japan. He said Chinese trainees there were made to clean and paint the factory on their days off, without pay, when managers found errors in their work. He was fired when he complained, he said, and a Japanese labor union has taken up his case. \u201cSome Japanese are helpful and nice, but the people at the company are different,\u201d Mr. Cao said. Masahisa Kishimoto, the company\u2019s president, said Mr. Cao had left of his own accord, and he blamed cultural differences for problems at the factory. In China, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t clean. \u201d \u201cThere are no rules,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you if you don\u2019t get caught, you can do anything. \u201d Mr. Kishimoto referred other questions to Joho Highway   an employers\u2019 association that recruits trainees on behalf of Kishimoto Manufacturing and other local businesses. The   said that Kishimoto had been imposing \u201cpenalty\u201d overtime on both Japanese and Chinese workers, in violation of labor rules, and that Kishimoto had compensated the employees after the   intervened. Mr. Kishimoto said the company had fully complied with labor laws. Government data on workplace accidents shows that trainees are more likely to be hurt on the job than Japanese workers  \u2014   a result of poor training, language barriers or more dangerous assignments. Since 2010, two trainee deaths have been recognized by the government as cases of karoshi, the Japanese term for death by overwork. Given widespread underreporting of overtime, the true number could be higher. In the financially struggling garment industry, abuses are pervasive enough that the minister of economy, trade and industry promised an inquiry last year, during a debate in Parliament over expanding the trainee program. Tham Thi Nhung, 32, a mother of two from Vietnam, said she worked from 8 a. m. to 9 or 10 p. m. Her job was to sew jackets, coats and dresses at a small clothing factory in Aichi prefecture, an industrial region in central Japan. All but one of the business\u2019s six seamstresses were Vietnamese, Ms. Nhung said. They hadn\u2019t had a day off in four months, she said, but the owner was recording only part of their overtime. In November, after the women complained that they were being underpaid by $712 a month, the owner sent a letter saying the factory was closing, and they were being laid off. A telephone number registered for Ms. Nhung\u2019s employer, Fashion Ai, was not working, and a lawyer representing the company declined to comment. \u201cWe told the boss, but she said she wouldn\u2019t pay more,\u201d Ms. Nhung said. \u201cShe told us to keep working or go back to Vietnam. \u201d Ms. Liu said she emptied her savings and borrowed from relatives to cover the visa fee. Ms. Liu and her colleagues said their employer had been paying them less than the legal minimum wage for overtime, and had been overcharging them for company housing. The employer was    Takeshi Nakahara, who along with his wife owns several small garment factories in Gifu, near Aichi. He started using Chinese trainees 15 years ago, he said in an interview, because \u201cno Japanese want to work in the apparel industry. \u201d Low wages are the only way to compete with cheap foreign factories, he added. \u201cMost manufacturers have moved overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to stay profitable. \u201d Mr. Nakahara said he had been paying Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers less than minimum wage for overtime, though he said the idea had been theirs. \u201cThey demanded more overtime work,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them it wouldn\u2019t be profitable for the company, and they said they were willing to work for less. \u201d Although the arrangement was illegal, he said he felt betrayed when the women, nearing the end of their   contracts, made demands for back pay. The workers sought help from Zhen Kai, a Chinese labor activist who has lived in Japan for decades. He operates a small union office in Gifu that includes temporary rooms in which workers can stay. Mr. Zhen says that he sympathizes with the businesses and that many would have folded without the trainee program. The government, he says, has effectively kept such businesses alive by letting them exploit workers. \u201cOwners often say to me, \u2018Are you trying to destroy my company? \u2019\u201d he said. Mr. Zhen negotiated with the Nakaharas, who offered a settlement, initially about $5, 800. Fed up and homesick, Ms. Liu accepted the offer and was getting ready to go back to China, even though she still owed money to the relatives who helped her pay for her visa. The other four women decided to stay in Japan to fight for more compensation, and a few weeks later accepted offers of $10, 000 to $16, 000. Asked if they had learned anything during their ostensible training, they laughed bitterly. \u201cOnly hardship,\u201d Ms. Liu said. \u201cMy image of Japan,\u201d she said, \u201cwas that it was a good country. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562285.6499462}
