New reports, however, suggest the Saudis may be breathing new life into the matter. \\nPublicly, the Saudi government has not commented on the plan yet, but those familiar with the situation say that most if not all of the leadership supports the plan , and that they\u2019ve been quietly pushing Hadi in the direction of allowing it as a basis for peace talks. \\nThe plan would allow Hadi to hold a nominal leadership position, but insists it would be entirely a figurehead position with little to no real power. Hadi became Yemen\u2019s president in 2012 in a one candidate vote, and unilaterally extended his two-year term in office beyond that date. \\nThe United Arab Emirates has already publicly backed the peace deal, becoming the first member of the Saudi coalition to do so. Saudi Arabia attacked Yemen in March of 2015, vowing to reinstall Hadi as president after he resigned two months prior. The ongoing war has caused growing international outcry, however, and there is more pressure to resolve the situation. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz\""}, "time": 1742563226.9454224}
