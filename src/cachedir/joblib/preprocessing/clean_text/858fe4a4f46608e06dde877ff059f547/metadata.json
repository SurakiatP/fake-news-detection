House Republican leaders met with members of their party late into the night on Wednesday as they struggled to muster support for the bill, scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, worked through the day to placate conservative House Republicans who said that the bill did not do enough to lower health insurance costs by reducing federal regulations. The legislation would roll back major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significantpillar of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. But in trying to satisfy conservatives, the Trump administration and House Republican leaders risked jeopardizing support for the bill among more moderate Republicans. On the eve of the crucial vote, party leaders appeared to be short of a majority and were working into the night to whip their members into line. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed optimism on Wednesday night that talks with Republican leaders would lead to revisions to the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged tonight, just based on the real willingness of not only the White House, but our leadership, to make this bill better,\u201d Mr. Meadows said, crediting the personal involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. But Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a leader of a moderate bloc of lawmakers known as the Tuesday Group, said late Wednesday night that he would oppose the bill. \u201cI believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for    income and older individuals,\u201d Mr. Dent said. And the powerful conservative network funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch issued a direct challenge to the president and said that it would provide financial support to members who voted against the plan. \u201cWe will stand with lawmakers who keep their promise and oppose this legislation,\u201d said James Davis, executive vice president of Freedom Partners, the umbrella organization responsible for the Koch brothers\u2019 political efforts. About two dozen conservative Republicans, including Freedom Caucus members, met Wednesday with top administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think they changed any minds,\u201d Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, said after the meeting. The tenacity and persistence of the conservatives appeared to give them outsize influence as Mr. Ryan struggled to round up votes for the repeal bill, which faces solid opposition from House Democrats. Supporters of their bill have put their faith in Mr. Trump, whose young presidency could be badly damaged by a public and consequential loss. \u201cWhen the president calls someone and says, \u2018I need your vote on this,\u2019 it\u2019s very hard to say no to the president of the United States when this torpedoes our entire conference, Trump\u2019s entire presidency, and we end up losing the Senate next year and we lose members in the House,\u201d said Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and a top Trump supporter in the House. But conservative opposition was over substance, not politics. Conservatives are upset over the failure of the House bill to repeal a set of regulations in Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health law, which require insurers to cover a base set of benefits, like maternity care, preventive services, wellness checkups and rehabilitative services. These \u201cessential health benefits\u201d raise the cost of insurance and prevent companies from offering   options, the conservatives say. \u201cHow can you talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, without repealing the essential health benefits?\u201d asked Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who attended the meeting with Mr. Pence. Republican leaders say that if the House makes such changes to the bill, it could imperil their ability to push the legislation through the Senate using expedited procedures that neutralize the threat of a filibuster. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, likened the swirling cloud of uncertainty to the situation in November 2003, when the House approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare after a   vote that lasted nearly three hours in the middle of the night. The bill passed, 220 to 215, after House Republican leaders put down a conservative rebellion. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to pass controversial things, especially when Republicans have different ideas,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. Eventually, he predicted, House leaders will get the votes they need, though they may need to tweak the repeal bill. Representative Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, said the administration tried to sell the House bill, known as the American Health Care Act, by arguing that it could be improved later in the Senate. But House members rarely relish handing their political fate to the other chamber. \u201cI am more skeptical,\u201d Mr. DesJarlais said. \u201cI like to see what I\u2019m going to get when I vote for it, not promises that I get later. \u201d Asked if supporters of the bill had the votes to pass it in the House, Mr. DesJarlais said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they do. \u201d A spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus, Alyssa Farah, said that more than 25 members of the caucus were \u201cno\u201d votes on the health care measure  \u2014   enough to sink the bill in the House, though that count could not be independently verified. Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, said that despite recent changes to the health care bill, he was unable to vote for it. \u201cThis legislation simply won\u2019t lower premiums as much as the American people need, and lowering the cost of coverage is my primary goal,\u201d said Mr. Harris, an anesthesiologist and member of the Freedom Caucus. House leaders were also contending with opposition from more moderate Republicans worried about the toll that the health bill could take in their districts. Representative Dan Donovan of New York, who attended a meeting at the White House with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, said Wednesday that he would vote against the bill. \u201cRecognizing that the status quo is failing isn\u2019t, on its own, a compelling reason to vote \u2018yes\u2019 on the current replacement plan,\u201d said Mr. Donovan, the only Republican House member from New York City. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was sure the House would pass the repeal bill. \u201cSlowly but surely we\u2019re getting there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no Plan B. There\u2019s Plan A and Plan A. We\u2019re going to get this done. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562958.6248841}
