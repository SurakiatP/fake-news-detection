This time of year, especially, he spends a lot of quality time with his bats, twirling them like batons in the San Diego Padres\u2019 clubhouse, gripping and waggling them around in his massive hands. He needs to build up calluses on his palms. \u201cThey\u2019re a little soft now,\u201d said Myers, the Padres\u2019 first baseman. \u201cI\u2019m already cracking there a little bit. \u201d Feelings are raw, too, on the San Diego sports scene. The departure of the Chargers for Los Angeles last month did not hit Myers personally he is not a football fan, not even of the Carolina Panthers, who play less than a mile from his   home in North Carolina. But the Chargers\u2019 move leaves the Padres as the only major pro sports team in town, and a singular entity in baseball. Every other team in the majors has at least one neighbor in the N. F. L. the N. B. A. or the N. H. L. Only the Padres have a whole market to themselves. Yet after their sixth losing season in a row, at   they cannot offer a winning alternative to soothe the loss of the Chargers. \u201cIt stings, collectively, throughout the city, and everybody feels that,\u201d Padres Manager Andy Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really our responsibility to try to replace the Chargers I don\u2019t think we\u2019re capable of doing that, nor are we trying to do that. But we\u2019re going to try to rally this city together behind a team that is building something for the future of San Diego and recognizing that we\u2019re San Diego\u2019s team. \u201d The Padres have been San Diego\u2019s team since 1969, when they joined the National League as a    expansion franchise that lost 110 games. All these years later, in generic white and navy, they still have not won a championship. The Chargers never won a Super Bowl, either they were routed in their only appearance, in 1995, just as the Padres were swiftly beaten in the World Series of 1984 and 1998. The memory of that latter run, at least, sustains the current group. \u201cYou talk to Trevor Hoffman, and he talks about what the fans were like when they were making their World Series push,\u201d said Austin Hedges, a young catcher who lives in town, speaking of the Padres\u2019 former star closer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible city that loves their sports teams. We don\u2019t really think about the Chargers being gone we just know what we\u2019re capable of and what we want to bring to the city, and that\u2019s a championship. \u201d For this season, anyway, the Padres might be further from that goal than any other team. They recently signed Myers, who had 28 homers and 28 steals last season, to a   $83 million contract extension. But several positions are unsettled, and with few reliable starters, Green has said he may consider a piggyback style of game management, with starters replaced quickly by long relievers. Far below the surface, though, the Padres believe they are positioned well. Last summer, with several   teams restricted in their spending allotments, General Manager A. J. Preller poured $70 million into the draft and international markets. He also made several trades for prospects, bolstering a farm system whose talent level has risen to third in baseball, from 20th, in rankings by ESPN\u2019s Keith Law. Only the Braves and the Yankees rank higher. Preller was perhaps too aggressive in his trades he was suspended for a month late last season after the commissioner\u2019s office determined the Padres had not provided complete medical records to rival teams. But the result of the whirlwind season, Preller hopes, will be the kind of foundation that has helped his old team, the Texas Rangers, win throughout this decade. \u201cWhen you build something, you\u2019re not trying to be mediocre, where you have a team that, if you hit everything, can win 85 games and get a wild card,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019re able to build it where you\u2019ve got a chance to have a window for a number of years and you have waves of talent coming in, so even if you don\u2019t get a lot of things right, you still have so much depth and so many players that you can have a chance to win   games every year and compete for a World Series. That\u2019s the   we have, and I think the fans understand. \u201d Soon after the Padres hired Preller in August 2014, he engineered a flurry of trades for veterans like Matt Kemp, Craig Kimbrel and Justin Upton. The fans responded, with attendance rising to 2. 45 million in 2015, the highest since 2007, when the Padres were coming off consecutive division titles. But when the 2015 team flopped, Preller pivoted quickly, dealing away some of the newcomers and letting others leave for   compensation. While one trade backfired badly (acquiring Kemp from the Dodgers for catcher Yasmani Grandal) it was a worthwhile strategy the Padres needed a jolt, and Preller had planned to rebuild the farm system, anyway. He said it was healthy to raise expectations at the start, so fans would understand that the team would try anything to win. \u201cYou find out a lot when people expect you to do well,\u201d Preller said. \u201cSometimes it can be easier when people view you as the underdog and there\u2019s not a lot of expectation on exactly what you\u2019re going to do. When you really have it going well is when you have expectations for your franchise and you\u2019re able to meet or exceed those expectations every year. That\u2019s the franchise we want to get to, and we\u2019re hopefully building toward that. \u201d The Padres acquired their best prospect, the    center fielder Manuel Margot, before last season in a trade with the Boston Red Sox. Last summer, in the Futures Game in San Diego, Margot made a leaping catch to rob a home run. He returned for a   cameo after hitting . 304 with 30 steals in Class AAA. \u201cManny Margot is a really exciting baseball player,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe plays with a big smile on his face. He flies around the field. He\u2019s kind of a slasher at the plate who\u2019s going to hit the ball all over the yard, take competitive   and be a real threat on the basepaths. \u201d Padres fans have heard about prospects before, of course every losing team likes to promote its future. The difference now is that fans have no local alternative. The spotlight is theirs, and the Padres promise a good performance. They just need time. \u201cWe could become very popular,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe start winning, the city rallies around us  \u2014   once we do take that next step to being a great team, I think it could be really cool for the city. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563584.412626}
