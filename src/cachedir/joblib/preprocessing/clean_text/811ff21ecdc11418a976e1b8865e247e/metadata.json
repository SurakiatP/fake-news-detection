He slung his arms around co-defendants Neil Wampler \u2014 clutching a hotdog from the victory barbecue and a stack of newspapers with his face on them \u2014 and Shawna Cox. Jeff Banta stood to the far right. An alternate juror named Sarah Foultner stood between them while a supporter cycled through phones to capture the moment for everyone. \\nThe prosecution didn\u2019t picture the trial ending like this. \\n\u201cDisappointing,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams of the not guilty verdicts. \u201cBitterly so.\u201d \\nJust as quickly as the defense proclaimed a victory for rural America, occupation opponents dubbed the result an embarrassing loss for the prosecution. And supporters of other movements \u2014 #BlackLivesMatter and #NoDAPL to name two \u2014 wondered aloud about the meaning of justice. \\nBut 41 days and eight months later, the leaders of the armed occupation in eastern Oregon were found not guilty by a jury of peers. \\nStill, questions remain: How did it happen? And what happens next? Ammon Bundy Hometown: Emmett, Idaho NOT GUILTY \\nLeader of the Malheur refuge occupation. Before Oregon, Ammon Bundy was less prominent than his siblings in protesting the federal government. Ryan Bundy Hometown: Cedar City, Utah NOT GUILTY \\nEldest of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy\u2019s 14 children. Worked alongside his brother, Ammon Bundy, as a leader of the Malheur occupation. The Charges \\nAmmon Bundy, Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiracy to impede federal employees from doing their jobs by force, threat or intimidation. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a favorite charge of prosecutors,\u201d said Portland defense attorney Kevin Sali before the trial began. \u201cWhen people are involved in a conspiracy they can be liable \u2026 for things their co-conspirators did.\u201d \\nThe Bundys, Fry, Banta and Cox also faced weapons charges. (Prosecutors dropped those against Cox .) Ryan Bundy and Kenneth Medenbach were also charged with theft of government property. Internet radio show host Pete Santilli also faced a conspiracy charge but it was later dropped . \\nThe jury found the defendants not guilty on all but one charge. They failed to reach consensus on Ryan Bundy\u2019s theft charge stemming from the removal of government surveillance cameras at the refuge. \\nIn light of the verdict, questions swirled about whether the prosecution brought the proper charges. \\nWilliams, the U.S. Attorney for Oregon, said prosecutors could have brought criminal trespass charges and tried the occupiers in state court. But misdemeanor trespassing didn\u2019t seem to pass for muster \u2014 prosecutors wanted to bring felonies. \\n\u201cIf there had been some other federal statute that specifically addresses the conduct, we would have considered using it,\u201d Williams said in an interview with OPB\u2019s Amelia Templeton . \u201cWe have and still believe we brought the most applicable and appropriate charges under the evidence, which is our duty.\u201d A watch tower at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Andy Dunbar, a rancher who lives adjacent to the refuge, explained his view of the occupation in court. Amelia Templeton/OPB The Prosecution \\nSome described the prosecution\u2019s case as a \u201cslam dunk.\u201d In basketball, a slam dunk is a show of force. \\nMike Arnold, Ammon Bundy\u2019s previous attorney, told OPB\u2019s Anna Griffin he thinks the prosecution brought felony charges to make a powerful statement with \u201cserious prison time.\u201d \\n\u201cTheir goal is to prevent any sort of activity like this in the future from the actual defendants themselves and other like-minded folks,\u201d Arnold said. \\nProsecutors brought mounds of evidence to the table \u2014 sometimes literally, like when they brought a large display of firearms and ammunition into the courtroom. \\nAnd rarely did defendants dispute the facts of the case. They admitted to illegally taking over a federal facility, even to bringing their arms. \\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me to be arrested because I\u2019m where I want to be right now,\u201d Medenbach said on the stand . \u201cLike the Bundys, I\u2019ve been called by a higher power \u2026 we all know this is what God called us to do.\u201d \\nBut prosecutors missed the dunk. And just like in basketball, a missed dunk in the courtroom can be humiliating. \\nJuror No. 4 \u2014 who earlier sparked a fellow juror\u2019s dismissal by questioning his impartiality \u2014 wrote the Oregonian/OregonLive saying the prosecution came off as arrogant in its case. \\n\u201cThe air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us,\u201d the juror wrote. \\nThe prosecution moved through its case quickly. Prosecutors rested after 13 days. They cross-examined Ammon Bundy for just 15 minutes . Their closing argument lasted less than two hours. \\nWilliams admitted the hurry with which prosecutors prepared their case may have hurt it. He called the legal timeline \u201cextraordinary.\u201d \\nThe prosecution focused heavily on the occupiers\u2019 intent behind the refuge takeover. But the jury ultimately determined the prosecution failed to prove impeding federal employees was the occupiers\u2019 goal \u2014 even if the occupation actually did impede employees. The Defense \\nMatt Schindler, Medenbach\u2019s hybrid counsel, delivered a thunderous closing argument on Oct. 19. \\nThe charge all seven occupiers faced was conspiracy to impede federal employees from doing their jobs by threat, force or intimidation. \\n\u201cI just sat through five weeks of a trial about threatening federal employees without hearing a single threat,\u201d Schindler said in his closing argument. \\nThe defense tried to make its case bigger than the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife employees in Harney County. \\nFive defendants ended up taking the stand, speaking at length about the U.S. Constitution, land management, divinity, and the 2014 standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada. Ryan Bundy questioned his wife on the stand. David Fry giggled when prosecutors asked him about using government computers. Medenbach reveled in the glory of public testimony after decades of protesting the federal government. \\nIn their closing arguments, defense attorneys attempted to instill into the jurors a sense of political responsibility. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re counting on you to stop government overreach,\u201d Marcus Mumford, Ammon Bundy\u2019s attorney, told the jury. \u201cOur trust is in you.\u201d \\nA jury found seven defendants charged in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge not guilty, following a trial that lasted several weeks. The Verdict \\nDefense attorneys expressed shock at the verdict; even they did not expect such a result. It came despite scrutiny from U.S. District Court Judge Anna Brown and prosecutors for lack of organization . \\nDefendants and their supporters erupted into tearful celebration outside the federal courthouse in downtown Portland (and streamed it live online, just like much of the occupation). \\n\u201cWe came to Oregon \u2014 to Harney County \u2014 seeking justice,\u201d defendant Neil Wampler said after his acquittal, \u201cand today we found it.\u201d \\nBut despite defendants\u2019 and supporters\u2019 cries of victory, Juror No. 4 wrote in his letter to the Oregonian that the verdict was not an endorsement of the occupiers\u2019 political beliefs. \\n\u201cIt should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove \u2018conspiracy\u2019 in the count itself \u2014 and not any form of affirmation of the defense\u2019s various beliefs, actions or aspirations,\u201d the juror wrote. \\nDefendants and their supporters celebrated a not guilty verdict in the trial of seven people involved in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The Celebration \\nThe mood was jubilant among occupiers and their supporters, who grilled, milled and posed for cameras in downtown Portland on the Friday following the verdict. \\nMany people have said they fear the verdict will embolden defendants and their supporters. Cox and Fry both said they would participate in protests like the Oregon Standoff again. \\n\u201cIf I have a compelling urge to come out here to join a protest, if I think it\u2019s a legitimate reason to come, I\u2019ll absolutely protest,\u201d Fry told OPB. Teressa Raiford speaks at a Don\u2019t Shoot PDX-organized rally on Portland State University\u2019s campus. Bradley W. Parks/OPB \\nThe reaction was different just a few blocks away. \\nDon\u2019t Shoot PDX, a Portland activist group supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, was holding what was supposed to be a rally, unrelated to the trial, at Portland State University. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can keep telling people to protest,\u201d lead organizer Teressa Raiford told the crowd. Raiford seemed exhausted. \\nThe occupiers\u2019 acquittal came the same day more than 100 protesters in North Dakota were forcibly removed from the construction site of the Dakota Access Pipeline and arrested. It came weeks after Don\u2019t Shoot PDX protesters were pushed out of City Hall and pepper-sprayed by Portland police. \\nRaiford expressed anger at having to discuss the Malheur trial verdict. She and countless others on social media highlighted what many see as a double-standard in how law enforcement and the justice system punish people of color. With the exception of David Fry, defendants in the occupation case were all white. All jury members were also white. \\n\u201cForty-one days at a compound on federal land,\u201d Raiford said, pointing to weapons at the refuge, occupiers\u2019 refusal to leave, and threats made by occupiers against the FBI. \\n\u201cThe difference is we would have been murdered,\u201d Raiford said. \\nJarvis Kennedy, of the Burns, Oregon, Paiute tribe told OPB\u2019s Amanda Peacher he was angry with the verdict. Kennedy and the Paiute tribe have been vocal opponents of the Malheur occupation from the start. However, Kennedy added he was now more motivated to fight for Native lands and rights . \\nDon\u2019t Shoot PDX eventually marched past the occupation supporters\u2019 barbecue Friday, where they staged a die-in near the courthouse steps and burned an American flag . \\nAfter a brief shouting match, Bundy supporters went back to the grill and Don\u2019t Shoot PDX continued to City Hall. A member of the Pacific Patriots Network at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in January. Many wonder if the verdict in the Oregon occupation trial will embolden militia groups to take up armed land battles throughout the West. Dave Blanchard/OPB The Implication \\nAmmon and Ryan Bundy are still in federal custody, despite an animated effort by Marcus Mumford to win his client\u2019s release upon receiving the verdict. \\nAfter arguing with Judge Brown for Ammon Bundy to be let go, Mumford was tackled by U.S. Marshals, allegedly tased, briefly detained and later released. \\nThe Bundy brothers still face charges for the 2014 standoff in Bunkerville led by their father, Cliven Bundy. \\nSeven Oregon occupiers still await trial in February, though the status of those proceedings could be in limbo. \\nShawna Cox called Thursday\u2019s outcome \u201cjust one win\u201d in a larger movement to change how the federal government manages land in the American West. \\nU.S. Attorney Billy Williams seemed to hope more people would shun the Bundys\u2019 form of protest. \\n\u201cThere are a good number of folks in rural America who are of the mind that you don\u2019t take arms and take over a federal facility to prove your point,\u201d Williams said. \\nThe Oregon verdict will certainly color the conversation around the impending trial in Nevada. The result there \u2014 where the penalties for alleged crimes are slightly more harsh than Oregon \u2014 has the potential to make even bigger waves in the so-called patriot movement . \\nBut occupiers and their supporters cooking out in downtown Portland took heart in the Oregon verdict and envisioned a long fight ahead of them on behalf of rural Americans. \\nUnder downtown shade-trees, defendant Jeff Banta approached supporter David Zion Brugger, who decorated his hat and shirt with \u201cNOT GUILTY\u201d buttons, and shook his hand. \\nIn a hushed voice, Banta said, \u201cSee you down the road.\u201d Share On:'"}, "time": 1742628474.1713145}
