[The pontiff expressed his \u201cdeep condolences\u201d to the Coptic patriarch, Tawadros II, calling him \u201cmy brother,\u201d to the Coptic church and \u201call of the dear Egyptian nation,\u201d and said he was praying for the dead and injured in the attack that occurred just hours earlier as Francis himself was marking Palm Sunday in St. Peter\u2019s Square.  The pontiff asked God \u201cto convert the hearts of those who spread terror, violence and death, and also the hearts of those who make, and traffic in, weapons. \u201d The pope\u2019s remarks on the church attack were handed to him on a piece of paper after he remembered the victims of the Stockholm attack Friday night. The Palm Sunday celebrations in St. Peter\u2019s Square were held under tight security, with streets surrounding St. Peter\u2019s Square blocked to traffic and security search of the faithful entering the square. The pope and cardinals in red robes led a solemn process clutching elaborately braided palm fronds as they walked through the throngs, followed by the papal blessing of palm fronds and olive branches. The processions recalls the bittersweet nature of Holy Week, with the faithful clutching simple palm fronds and olive branches to commemorate Jesus\u2019 triumphant entrance into Jerusalem only to be followed later by his death on a wooden cross. In his homily, the pope remembered the suffering in the world today, citing those who \u201csuffer from slave labor, from family tragedies, from diseases   \u2026     They suffer from wars and terrorism, from interests that are armed and ready to strike. \u201d After his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope circled the square in the pope mobile to greet the faithful.'"}, "time": 1742564338.2188394}
