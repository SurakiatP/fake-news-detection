He is endorsed by Bernie Sanders\u2019 organization \u201c Our Revolution \u201d and is the state director of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), an organization revealed as being used by communists to influence Democratic policy by former communist Marvin Treiger in Trevor Loudon\u2019s film, the \u201c Enemies Within .\u201d \\nChris Schwartz was described at The Nation in 2007 as \u201ca recent graduate of the University of Northern Iowa and one of CAN\u2019s vocal leaders.\u201d CAN is the Campus Antiwar Network , which is \u201cwidely perceived to have been dominated by students from the ISO.\u201d \\nISO stands for the International Socialist Organization , a Trotskyist, communist group. ISO is notorious for supporting the Palestinian and Arab causes in the Middle East and led many militant protests against America\u2019s war effort in Iraq. Additionally, virtually all leaders of the now-defunct CAN were members of ISO. In line with ISO policy, Schwartz was involved in anti-Israel activities and led an anti-Iraq war rally in support of Cindy Sheehan, who became a vocal critic of the Iraq war after her son was killed during his service in Iraq. \\nISO\u2019s website, SocialistWorker.org has quoted Chris Schwartz here and here . \\nAn insight into Chris Schwartz\u2019s anti-business, pro-government mentality is revealed in this 2011 blog post by Paul Deaton at the self-described \u201conline information resource for Iowa\u2019s progressive community:\u201d \\n\u201cTo wrap up the speakers, Chris Schwartz of Working Families Win, Iowa spoke, with a list of grievances about the government.
