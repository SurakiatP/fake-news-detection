According to Limbaugh, one of those reasons dealt with a racial component, which he explained if Obama had been white, many would not have voted for Obama. Partial transcript as follows: What the Democrats don\u2019t get into, what they don\u2019t dare get into  \u2014   and I guarantee you they know this, too I will wager. I\u2019m having to guess here because there\u2019s no data in this story to support this. But the data that is used, I think, is erroneous. You can\u2019t ignore the fact that a lot of people, particularly in 2008, voted for Barack Obama because of the racial component and a desire to end the racial divide in America. There were people who believed that if the United States elected an   president, that it would forever end all of these allegations and discussions America is a racist nation. There were people  \u2014   and that\u2019s the only reason a lot of people voted for Obama. Now, you can throw in disgust with Bush, disgust with the Republicans after the media\u2019s four years of destruction of both Bush and the Republicans. But you cannot deny the racial component here. I think it\u2019s the big reason why so many Obama voters didn\u2019t vote for Hillary. They wouldn\u2019t have voted for Obama, either, if he were white. I really believe it. I don\u2019t know what the number is. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a majority of people. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s enough people who voted for Obama who didn\u2019t vote for Hillary. This is what this latest analysis is pointing to as the real reason she lost. No mention of the Russians in this analysis. It\u2019s strictly an analysis of voting patterns as best these people can come up with them. But the one thing that they\u2019re honest with themselves about is the racial component. Of course, they don\u2019t dare go there because this is now   time for Obama. And you cannot build a serious, solid legacy if you include the fact that the only reason a lot of people voted for him was because they thought in doing so they could end this argument that America\u2019s racist and they could end the racial strife. As I so adeptly pointed out, all it did was exacerbate it. It did not  \u2026     And I predicted it the day after it happened, that it was not going to ameliorate the racial divide whatsoever.
