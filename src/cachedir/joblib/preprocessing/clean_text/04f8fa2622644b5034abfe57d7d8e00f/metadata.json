Silicon Valley shunned the Republican candidate and all he stood for. It mobilized its technology for his defeat and warned of dire consequences if he should somehow win. Now that the impossible has happened, tech\u2019s day of reckoning is here  \u2014   next Wednesday afternoon, to be precise. The   is summoning leaders of the biggest tech companies to New York for a   discussion, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations. The agenda is undisclosed and perhaps still under consideration, but it is unlikely to produce the sort of love fest that existed between President Obama and Silicon Valley. Tech culture celebrates disruption as the tool that produces a better future for all. Many of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters, on the other hand, see it as pushing them down. How to reconcile these views is the task of Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and Facebook board member whose role is to formulate a tech policy for the new administration. Mr. Thiel secured this position by making a contrarian bet on Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, which paid off. The   invitations are from Mr. Thiel Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s    and Reince Priebus, the incoming chief of staff. If the past is any precedent, Mr. Trump might suggest or even order the tech overlords to do what he thinks necessary. The   met on Tuesday with Masayoshi Son, the founder and chief executive of SoftBank Group, which recently created a new investment fund that could invest up to $100 billion in tech companies worldwide. Afterward, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that Mr. Son agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and create \u201c50, 000 new jobs. \u201d Two Silicon Valley chief executives appeared willing to test the waters: Safra Catz, of the software maker Oracle, confirmed her participation in next week\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump. So did Chuck Robbins of Cisco Systems, the networking gear maker. Representatives for other leading tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple, declined to comment. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Mr. Thiel has said in interviews that the benefits accruing to tech investors like himself should be more widely shared outside a few ZIP codes in New York and around San Francisco. One role of the meeting is to spur ideas for changing this situation. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment. In Apple\u2019s case, Mr. Trump has said he told its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, in late November that he wants the company to build \u201ca big plant\u201d in the United States  \u2014   or even better, \u201cmany big plants. \u201d Apple itself does not do any manufacturing in the United States. A contractor, Flex, manufactures   desktop computers on its behalf in Austin, Tex. employing about 2, 000 people. A vast majority of Apple\u2019s production is in China, where there is an enormous ecosystem devoted to it. Many economists say that reproducing such an interlocking web of suppliers here would push the cost of iPhones up considerably. Mr. Trump also tangled with Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, during the campaign, saying that Mr. Bezos has \u201ca huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much. \u201d Amazon is overwhelmingly the dominant force in  . In its original business of books, for example, it is by far the most important retailer of both physical and electronic books. In several spheres, it is developing technology that eliminates the middleman  \u2014   in other words, jobs. This week, the company debuted a new system for operating stores without cashiers. How much Silicon Valley is reconciling itself to the thought of President Trump is a complicated question. Last week, David O. Sacks, the chief executive of the   software   Zenefits, said he was stepping down after having had discussions about helping Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. Mr. Sacks is a longtime associate of Mr. Thiel\u2019s. If there are some overtures being made in Silicon Valley, there are also some lines being drawn. Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week\u2019s meeting: defiance. \u201cIf an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company\u2019s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him,\u201d Mr. Sacca said. Or perhaps everyone will get along fine. Some in Silicon Valley speculate that the rough moments between Mr. Trump and the tech industry come not because they are so different but because they are at the bottom so similar. \u201cTrump embodies the harsher aspects of Silicon Valley  \u2014   a brash and arrogant disrupter, convinced that the world is all wrong as it is and only he can change it for the better,\u201d said Shiva Ramesh, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Even Mr. Trump\u2019s    plans have a familiar ring. \u201cSounds like the pitch of some  : \u2018It is all there in my head and in a   plan, it will all work out, I can do it, trust me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.'"}, "time": 1742628588.6495461}
