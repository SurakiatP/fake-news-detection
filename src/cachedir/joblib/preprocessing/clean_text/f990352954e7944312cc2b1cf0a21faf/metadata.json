Trump, then   reacted with characteristic swagger. He vowed to stop the North from developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. But six weeks later, after North Korea defiantly launched a missile into the sea, Mr. Trump, now president, reacted with surprising restraint. Appearing before cameras late at night on Saturday in Florida with his golfing guest, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, Mr. Trump read a statement of just 23 words that pledged American support for Tokyo without even mentioning North Korea. The muted comment stood in sharp contrast to his response after Iran tested a ballistic missile, when he directed his national security adviser to publicly warn Tehran that he was \u201cofficially putting Iran on notice\u201d and followed up with sanctions. If North Korea was testing the new president, as many analysts believe, then Mr. Trump seemed intent on showing that he would not be baited into a confrontation every time an American adversary tried to provoke him. At least not right away. In his short time in office, Mr. Trump has shown that he can respond to events in measured ways one moment and with hotheaded bluster the next. But even after waking up on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump chose to publicly feud with Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, rather than the maverick leader of North Korea. \u201cI assume they don\u2019t have a strategy yet, so Trump with Abe by his side was properly taciturn, surprisingly so,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, an Asia scholar at the Brookings Institution who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s Asia adviser. \u201cBut that can\u2019t hold. At some point you need to articulate a strategy. \u201d The tempered response may also have reflected the fact that the missile launched on Sunday by North Korea was either a   or an   missile, according to the American military, and not an intercontinental missile, or ICBM, capable of reaching the United States. The missile flew 310 miles before dropping harmlessly into the Sea of Japan, according to the South Korean military, which identified it as an   Musudan. North Korea regularly tests missiles in violation of United Nations resolutions, including roughly two dozen last year, but has boasted that it could test an ICBM \u201canytime and anywhere. \u201d The kind tested on Sunday poses a potential threat to American allies in Japan and South Korea and American forces in the Pacific, but could not strike the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s yet unclear what missile was tested,\u201d said Thomas Karako, a missile expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cWhat is certain is that North Korea has now begun 2017 by continuing the aggressive pace of missile testing they\u2019ve shown in recent years. \u201d North Korea challenged Mr. Obama early in his tenure, too, with an underground nuclear blast four months after he took office. The effect was to harden Mr. Obama\u2019s attitude toward North Korea for the rest of his presidency, according to former aides. Rather than try to negotiate, as both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did, Mr. Obama focused on tightening international sanctions and bolstering alliances with Japan and South Korea. Three weeks in office, the Trump administration is still trying to find its footing on foreign policy, especially in areas like North Korea that have not been Mr. Trump\u2019s main focus. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was sworn in on Feb. 1 and does not even have a deputy, much less a full team of trusted advisers, in place. That North Korea\u2019s latest test came while Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe for a multiday set of meetings, meals and golfing, first at the White House and then at Mr. Trump\u2019s    estate in Palm Beach, Fla. was seen as no accident. And it may be that Mr. Abe counseled Mr. Trump on his response. In his own comments while he stood beside Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe called the launch \u201cabsolutely intolerable. \u201d Asia experts and members of Congress praised Mr. Trump for reaffirming American support for Japan but lamented that he did not mention South Korea at the same time. \u201cI was glad he issued the statement with the prime minister of Japan, but he ought to do it quickly with South Korea,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cSouth Korea is probably more susceptible to North Korea\u2019s virulence than any other country. \u201d White House officials on Sunday remained quiet about the test and their emerging strategy. Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s senior adviser for policy, said Mr. Trump had sent a strong signal with his joint appearance with Mr. Abe. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to be sending another signal very soon, and that signal is when we begin a great rebuilding of the armed forces of the United States,\u201d he said, also on \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d \u201cPresident Trump is going to go to Congress and ask them to invest in our military so once again we will have unquestioned military strength beyond anything anybody can imagine. \u201d Short of military action, the menu of options available for Mr. Trump is not significantly better than it was for his predecessors. The United States and the United Nations have already imposed an array of wrenching sanctions and have largely isolated North Korea from much of the world. On his first overseas trip since taking office, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Japan and South Korea to reassure them of America\u2019s support despite statements by Mr. Trump during the campaign that called it into question. South Korean officials agreed to press ahead with development of a new missile defense system called Terminal   Area Defense, or Thaad. Most policy makers consider China crucial to any meaningful response to North Korea, given the nations\u2019 extensive economic and political connections, but it remains uncertain that Mr. Trump would have any better chance of persuading Beijing to take tougher action. Mr. Trump had a   telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China last week and promised to stick by America\u2019s longstanding \u201cOne China\u201d policy, reportedly at Mr. Tillerson\u2019s urging. But the president has been an unrelenting critic of China on trade and currency matters, and some of his top advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, view China as a   adversary. \u201cWe will learn an enormous amount about his policy and his administration by how he deals with North Korea,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former Obama adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s the land of really bad options, and the threat is only becoming more serious and the window is closing. It will probably become the defining security challenge for the next president in Asia, if not globally. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563671.9705486}
