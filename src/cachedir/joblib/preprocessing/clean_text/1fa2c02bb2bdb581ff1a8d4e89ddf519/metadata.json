Cushing Assistant City Manager Jeremy Frazier told a news conference late Sunday that a few minor injuries had been reported. He said the damage appeared to be contained downtown. \\nOklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday\u2019s quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week. \\nFearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Frazier said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled Monday classes. \\n\u201cStay out of the area,\u201d said City Manager Steve Spears, who noted that while some damage was superficial, compromised foundations and other potential problems would be difficult to assess until daylight in the city of 7,900 about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. \\nThe Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake\u2019s epicenter. \\nThe quake struck at 7:44 p.m. Sunday and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said Sunday\u2019s quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0. \\n\u201cI thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,\u201d said Cushing resident Cindy Roe, 50. \u201cIt was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground. \\n\u201cIt was awful and I don\u2019t want to have another one.\u201d \\nCushing\u2019s oil storage terminal is one of the world\u2019s largest. As of Oct. 28, tank farms in the countryside around Cushing held 58.5 million barrels of crude oil, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The community bills itself as the \u201cPipeline Crossroads of the World.\u201d \\nFrazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late Sunday but that the community hadn\u2019t heard from all companies. Gov. Mary Fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at Cushing\u2019s oil storage terminal \\nMegan Gustafson and Jonathan Gillespie were working at a Cushing McDonald\u2019s when the quake hit. \\n\u201cIt felt like a train was going right through the building, actually,\u201d Gustafson, 17, said Sunday night as she and her co-workers stood behind a police barricade downtown, looking for damage. \u201cI kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit.\u201d \\nGillespie said the building shook for about 10 seconds, but that he wasn\u2019t as alarmed as Gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes, especially in recent years. \\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was anything new,\u201d he said. \\nAccording to USGS data, there have been about two dozen earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume. \\nA 5.8 earthquake \u2014 a record for Oklahoma \u2014 hit Pawnee on Sept. 3. Shortly afterward, geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault. \\n\u201cI was at home doing some work in my office and, basically, you could feel the whole house sway some,\u201d Spears, the Cushing city manager, said Sunday night. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning to become normal.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561793.2488432}
