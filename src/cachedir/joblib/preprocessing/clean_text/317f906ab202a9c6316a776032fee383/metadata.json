And make sure Iran scores $150 billion in sanctions relief. \\nThat\\'s how we got here . It\\'s SmartPower, which is neither smart nor powerful. \\nEarlier this month US Navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from Houthi-controlled Yemen. \\nThis was likely the first time in history the Navy had to take such measures, and officials are now saying they think Iran is behind the attacks. \\n\"We believe that Iran is connected to this,\" Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan told NBC News. In fact, the US has intercepted many shipments of weapons from Iran to the Houthi militants, who oppose Yemen\\'s internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population. \\nThe intercepted shipments \"were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles, boats that we believe were explosive boats, other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw,\" Donegan said. \\nI\\'m sure there\\'s no chance that the billions Obama lavished on Iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own Jihadi candy store. Not a chance. \\nAnd I\\'m sure that when Iran gets the nuclear weapons that Obama is enabling, it will use them as responsibly as it\\'s using its cruise missiles.'"}, "time": 1742628571.8549056}
