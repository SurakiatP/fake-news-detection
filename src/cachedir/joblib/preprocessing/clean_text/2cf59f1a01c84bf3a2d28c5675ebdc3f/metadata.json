Gorka branded the protesters \u201cvictims of fake news. \u201d   \u201cEight out of ten times, I can read something written in the daily paper about an event that occurred the night before, and it is literally 180 degrees incorrect,\u201d said Gorka in his remarks to the crowded room. \u201cIt is totally contrary to what happened inside the building 80 percent of the time. That\u2019s something that has opened my eyes to the lack of true investigative journalism. \u201d  In conclusion, Gorka said: What we are witnessing today \u2014  whether it\u2019s RT, whether its ISIS tweets, Telegram \u2014  none of it is new. The platforms may be new, but the concepts of propaganda, dezinformatsiya, Maskirovka, none of these are true. They are just being packaged in new and far more effective ways. And this administration, with our allies and partners, including Israel, intends to take it very, very seriously. Thank you. None of the few demonstrators congregated would talk to Breitbart News when Edwin Mora asked them to share their position on camera. Mora worked with Gorka during the latter\u2019s tenure as Breitbart News\u2019s National Security editor. Instead, the protesters shared a document accusing Breitbart News of perpetrating fake news. No protesters responded to Gorka\u2019s request to verbally defend their protest before the panel. Follow Adelle and Edwin on Twitter @AdelleNaz and @EdwinMora83'"}, "time": 1742563502.9010904}
