[During an episode of the   show  \u2014   which debuted on the streaming service this week  \u2014   Nye introduces Bloom\u2019s performance as \u201cvery special\u201d and a \u201ccool little segment. \u201d  Bloom, perhaps best known for her role in the sitcom Crazy   proceeds to give a performance of a song titled \u201cMy Sex Junk,\u201d which includes lyrics like: \u201cThis world of ours is so full of choice. But must I choose between only John or Joyce? Are my options only hard or moist? My vagina has its own voice. \u201d Other lines in the performance, which features Nye behind a DJ booth and a man ripping his trousers off, include: \u201cVersatile love may have some butt stuff. It\u2019s evolution, ain\u2019t nothing new. There\u2019s nothing taboo about a sex stew. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the right message, Rachel, nice job,\u201d Nye says as Bloom finishes her performance. The video was quickly excoriated by viewers, with the YouTube version receiving more than 10, 000 \u201cdislikes\u201d compared with just 170 \u201clikes. \u201d Twitter users also blasted the video, with some claiming that Nye\u2019s perspective on gender is not backed by science. *curled up in a therapist chair, shivering arhythmically, scratching my inner elbow* alright so it all began with this video, \u201dmy sex junk\u201d,  \u2014   C\u272aRBYNISTA (@fuckmuir) April 24, 2017,  Well @BillNye shot his credibility when he decided there\u2019s no science to gender. Oh, and that was SAD. #mysexjunk,  \u2014   Wrongthink Radio (@wrongthinkradio) April 24, 2017,  I\u2019ve seen some stuff in my life, but nothing as bad as \u201dMy Sex Junk\u201d. #RachelBloom,  \u2014   Hazel (@RoseHazel12) April 24, 2017,  Reviewing the rest of Nye\u2019s show, which is intended to inform viewers about science, Maddie Stone of Gizmodo describes it as \u201ca small amount of information packaged to promote a   understanding of a complex science issue, slanted to the POV of an unabashedly political science comedian. \u201d She adds that Nye spends the majority of the show just \u201cyelling at his audience. \u201d Earlier this week, Nye told MSNBC that he wanted to remind the Trump administration that \u201cscience is political,\u201d arguing that the Constitution grants Congress the power \u201cto promote the progress of science and useful arts. \u201d However, Nye\u2019s understanding of the Constitutional passage has since been shown to be incorrect.
