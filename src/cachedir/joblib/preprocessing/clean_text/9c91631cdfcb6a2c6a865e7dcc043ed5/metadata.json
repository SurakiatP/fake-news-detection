The president of France revealed that what purported to be his native tongue was in fact complete gibberish, admitting the French really speak English, except in the presence of the British. This comes as Wikileaks published cables sent by French diplomats to countries such as Spain, China and Russia which were all found to be written in English. \\nDuring a speech given in received pronunciation, the French President came clean, stating that it all started off as a joke during William the Conquerer\u2019s invasion to make the aggressors seem a bit more exotic. \u201cWhat was initially a prank snowballed and after a few years we realised we\u2019d look silly revealing the truth, so we had to keep up the fa\u00e7ade,\u201d said the Premier. \u201cIn the company of any Brits we would try to make convincingly \u201cFrench\u201d sounds, a mixture of guttural grunts and rapid-fire syllables. \\nBut as soon as we were on our own we\u2019d all heave a huge sigh of relief and revert to English. We developed a heavy reliance on hand gestures to cover up when we ran out of likely noises, and the shrug was a particular boon if inspiration dried up. In the end we became quite the raconteurs, with an impressive array of supposed vocabulary. So what began as a game for the \u00e9lites, became a hobby across all levels of society, and it shocked us that the Brits were so na\u00efve as to not see through the charade.\u201d \\nSarkozy claims Wikileaks will soon expose a number of other \u201clanguages\u201d. \u201cI mean, seriously guys, has anyone ever actually listened to \u201cArabic\u201d? Je ne sais pas\u2026..\u201d \\n16 February 2011'"}, "time": 1742562086.5598695}
