Trump\u2019s   education venture, Trump University, rejecting a   objection to the deal. The judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, in San Diego, issued his order after considering a challenge from Sherri Simpson, a former Trump University student from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. whose lawyers say she should have had a chance to opt out of the   settlement and individually sue President Trump, perhaps forcing a trial. The civil settlement was not enough for Ms. Simpson, who wanted to see Mr. Trump tried on criminal racketeering charges. She also wanted an apology. But Judge Curiel, in his ruling, sided with the   plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, who had urged him to approve the agreement, saying it was the best possible outcome for roughly 3, 730 students. They could recoup more than 90 cents on the dollar of what they spent at Trump University. \u201cThe court finds that the amount offered in settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and accordingly concludes that this factor weighs in favor of final approval,\u201d wrote Judge Curiel, who approved the agreement and dismissed the objection in a   order. It is subject to appeal. The approval of the settlement, assuming it stands, brings to a close a case that garnered outsize national attention during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. He faced two suits in California and one in New York brought by Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general. The suits contended that Trump University students had been cheated out of thousands of dollars in tuition through   sales techniques and false claims about what they would learn. Mr. Trump and his lawyers continued to deny those claims, even after the settlement was first announced in November, soon after his election. Mr. Schneiderman, in a statement, said the settlement would provide \u201crelief  \u2014   and hopefully   closure  \u2014   to the victims of Donald Trump\u2019s fraudulent university. \u201d The plaintiff\u2019s lawyers  \u2014   who said they would waive their fees after years of litigating the case  \u2014   applauded the decision, with one of them, Jason Forge, saying in an interview that it would be \u201cbulletproof\u201d if appealed. Mr. Forge said he was satisfied that former students, some of them elderly, would receive sizable payments as a result of the deal. \u201cOnce in a long while, this profession yields some good feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one of those times. \u201d As they pushed for approval of the settlement, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said that the objection could cause delays in settlement checks being distributed or disrupt the deal by exposing Mr. Trump to individual lawsuits from former students like Ms. Simpson. \u201cWhat she is looking for is an apology, and you can\u2019t get that,\u201d Patrick Coughlin, another of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said at a court hearing on Thursday. Ms. Simpson\u2019s lawyer, Gary Friedman, argued in court on Thursday that it was \u201cnot fair\u201d for the case to reach \u201cthe point of settlement and say, \u2018We\u2019re not giving you the chance to opt out. \u2019\u201d When Judge Curiel reiterated during the hearing that a jury trial could lead to less favorable results, Mr. Friedman said, \u201cThat is a risk analysis that Sherri Simpson has the right to make. \u201d It is unclear if Ms. Simpson will appeal, and Mr. Friedman did not return messages seeking comment. In a court filing last week, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers asked the judge to give final approval to the settlement. Mr. Trump was motivated to agree to the sweeping deal because it would resolve the claims and avoid trial. His lawyers did not respond to request for comment. Mr. Trump rebutted the fraud claims during his presidential bid, at one point questioning Judge Curiel\u2019s impartiality based on his Mexican heritage. He pointed to positive reviews of the program and vowed to reopen the university after what he said would be a victory at trial. His political opponents seized on the allegations, and angry former students  \u2014   including Ms. Simpson  \u2014   spoke out, painting Mr. Trump as a huckster who had conned ordinary people for personal profit. After his election in November, Mr. Trump reversed course and agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the litigation. He did not admit fault, and he maintained in posts on Twitter after the settlement announcement that he \u201cdid not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. \u201d The case was scheduled to go to trial late last year, setting up a situation in which Mr. Trump would have probably had to testify during his transition to the White House. At trial, Mr. Trump would have faced reams of evidence about the business practices of Trump University. Dozens of students and instructors wrote sworn statements describing their experiences, with some calling it a fraud or describing how they were taken advantage of. Other materials, among them sales playbooks, described a technique that used \u201cthe roller coaster of emotions\u201d to persuade students to pay for courses costing as much as $35, 000 for the \u201cGold Elite\u201d program. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were surprised and disappointed that Ms. Simpson objected to the settlement, fearing that it would delay payments to other students for months, if not years. Judge Curiel, who has overseen the case for the last four years, said at the hearing Thursday that the amount of money the plaintiffs would recover in the settlement was \u201cextraordinary. \u201d He said there would be significant hurdles to reaching a similar settlement during a trial. Ms. Simpson\u2019s lawyers argued that a 2015 notice to students about the   case gave the impression that they would have an opportunity to be excluded from a settlement at a later date. The   lawyers say that it was abundantly clear that students were required to opt out in 2015, and that Ms. Simpson\u2019s lawyers mischaracterized the notice. Judge Curiel wrote in his decision that t there is \u201cno blanket rule that due process requires a     opportunity. \u201d In 2010, Ms. Simpson, who is a lawyer herself, spent about $19, 000 on Trump University programs. After the agreement was announced, she submitted a claim to partake in the settlement, before filing the objection. In an interview earlier this week, Ms. Simpson said she hoped her objection would not \u201cblow up the settlement. \u201d But she said she believed she could fare better at trial. \u201cFor him to go out there and say, well, \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u2019 it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cI want an apology. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563552.4559557}
