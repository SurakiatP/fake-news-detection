C. said a video of the fatal shooting that set off two nights of violent protests did not offer \u201cabsolute, definitive visual evidence\u201d that the victim, Keith Scott, was pointing a gun. A lawyer for the dead man\u2019s family said the video showed his hands were by his side when he was shot. In another fatal shooting that has prompted anger over race and policing, Officer Betty Shelby, who killed Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Okla. was charged with manslaughter. _____ 2. Donald Trump, set to speak about fracking in Philadelphia, opened with comments about the unrest in Charlotte and, more broadly, about violence in largely black urban areas. \u201cDrugs are a very, very big factor in what you\u2019re watching on television at night,\u201d he said. Hillary Clinton, who has called the recent spate of police killings of black suspects \u201cunbearable,\u201d had a day off from campaign events. But she did appear on the mock celebrity interview show \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d answering the oblivious questions of Zach Galifianakis, who asked how fast she typed as secretary, and how President Obama liked his coffee. _____ 3. Yahoo reported a vast email breach by an unnamed \u201c  actor\u201d dating to 2014. Some 500 million accounts were hacked  \u2014   a number larger than the population of the United States  \u2014   yielding names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, passwords, and in some cases security questions. Yahoo said it had begun notifying potentially affected users. Here\u2019s what you can do to protect yourself. _____ 4. The father of the man accused of carrying out bombings last weekend in New York and New Jersey spoke to our reporters, clarifying the warnings he gave to federal agents about his son two years ago. He said he explicitly warned agents that Ahmad Rahami was interested in terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and fascinated by jihadist music, poetry and videos. \u201cIn two months, the F. B. I. came back to me and said he\u2019s clean,\u201d the father said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t find anything on him. But they didn\u2019t interview him. \u201d _____ 5. President Obama honored some of the country\u2019s top filmmakers, artists and musicians at the White House, including Mel Brooks, above, Audra McDonald, Wynton Marsalis and 21 other luminaries. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Terry Gross,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to the \u201cFresh Air\u201d host, \u201cand a whole bunch of people who Terry Gross has interviewed. \u201d The MacArthur Foundation also awarded its \u201cgenius\u201d grants. Among the 23 recipients of the fellowship  \u2014   $625, 000 over five years  \u2014   are a few relatively   figures, like the poet Claudia Rankine. Many appeared to be hard to categorize, working across existing genres, disciplines and institutions. _____ 6. \u201cAfter what happened I had no short or long term plans, I just figured out how to get my life back together, to regain trust and hope that this world wasn\u2019t a horrible place. \u201d That was the    woman above, one of 11 women who were brutally sexually assaulted during protests in Mexico State a decade ago. International human rights officials are demanding an investigation, which would sweep in President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who ordered the crackdown as governor of the state. _____ 7. Scientists are warning of a surprisingly invasive species you may be familiar with  \u2014   from your aquarium. Improperly released pet goldfish have spawned, swollen to the size of footballs, migrated, interbred with other species and become an ecological nightmare in places ranging from Australia to Nevada. So, the experts say, if you\u2019re tired of your goldfish, give it back to the store or to a friend, or kill it in an ice slurry. Don\u2019t toss it in a stream or flush it. _____ 8. Baseball fans  \u2014   and regulators  \u2014   want to know: What\u2019s with all the home runs? A surprisingly long list of players are at or near 30 for the season, including previously unspectacular hitters like shortstop Brad Miller of the Tampa Bay Rays, above. Possible explanations: \u201cjuiced\u201d balls, with   interiors, a rush of doping  \u2014   or maybe just the game\u2019s turn toward raw power for both pitchers and hitters. _____ 9. No less a reviewer than the novelist Richard Ford (\u201cThe Sportswriter,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day\u201d) offers high praise for Bruce Springsteen\u2019s memoir, which comes out next Tuesday. Writing as one of \u201cnine jillion\u201d fans, he says \u201cBorn to Run\u201d helps, as much as anything can, explain how the singer went from a New Jersey backwater to going \u201cin front of 90, 000 people for   years in 40 different countries. \u201d He also says: \u201cYou\u2019d think a guy who wrote \u201cSpanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night\u2019 \u2019u2009With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a   old Buick . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. \u201d could navigate his way around a complete and creditable American sentence. And you\u2019d be right. \u201d _____ 10. Nine arrests in a corruption case dealt a serious blow to the inner circle of New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo. A former aide, Joseph Percoco, above with Mr. Cuomo, was among those accused of bribery, extortion and fraud linked to \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts and other official state benefits\u201d in economic development programs. The case, the latest in a string of corruption cases plaguing Albany and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s associates, spared the governor himself. _____ 11. Finally, it\u2019s the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, so happy fall. And if you\u2019re feeling a little less than fulfilled, here\u2019s a lesson from one of Stanford University\u2019s most popular courses, Designing Your Life. Try using the same approach that goes into making successful products: prototyping, building teams and bias to action (meaning rapid decision making). \u201cThe question of \u2018What do I do with the rest of my one wild and wonderful life?\u2019 is on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201d said one of the course\u2019s two professors. _____ Martin Tsai contributed reporting.  _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
