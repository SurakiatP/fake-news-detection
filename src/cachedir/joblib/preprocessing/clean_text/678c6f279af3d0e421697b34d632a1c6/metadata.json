Man wearing only his underwear takes blowtorch to his neighbors' Trump sign \u2014 and they caught it all on camera https://t.co/XxdHdjAveM pic.twitter.com/mwWFZAwlBI \\n\u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 26, 2016 \\nAccording to Jane Leighty, witnesses walked past the scene of the crazed man setting his neighbor\u2019s sign on fire and did nothing to stop him. \\nAlthough I wouldn\u2019t recommend going near a crazy man with a blowtorch in his underwear, as Leighty noted, they didn\u2019t even have to \u2014 they could have just called the police. Instead, according to the homeowner, some even congratulated the man for his criminal activity. \\nThe people going by is what really hurts too that no one called the police just to say \u201chey go check this out.\u201d They didn\u2019t have to confront him. The two guys that come up and fist pumped him and go \u201cyeah alright!\u201d Really? \\nLeighty made it clear that she wasn\u2019t going to back down in the face of a crazed fool and some punks who think it\u2019s hilarious to set fire to someone\u2019s property: \\nAll we had was a little sign, you know, and if they\u2019re offended by it they should have probably left that one there because every time they take it down it\u2019s coming up bigger and better and the next one\u2019s going to be a billboard. \\nGood for them. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs when you can\u2019t express your support of a candidate without someone vandalizing your property, but here we are. \\nThere have been numerous instances throughout the election cycle of Trump supporters having their yard signs vandalized and in some cases being physically and verbally harassed and/or threatened for their support of the candidate. \\nEven with all these instances, the media has chosen to focus primarily on any incident they can dredge up at Trump rallies \u2014 which we now have confirmation, thanks to Project Veritas , that Democrat operatives incite via a tactic called \u201cbirddogging.\u201d \\nThese anti-Trumpsters \u2014 often liberals, although it\u2019s unclear what this man\u2019s political bent was for sure \u2014 have shown their true colors throughout this election cycle. They can\u2019t handle the fact that someone else may not think the same way they do, which is truly pathetic. \\nGood for the Leighty\u2019s; it takes guts to stand up for your rights, and that\u2019s exactly what they are doing by not giving in to a crazed bully.\""}, "time": 1742561928.567691}
