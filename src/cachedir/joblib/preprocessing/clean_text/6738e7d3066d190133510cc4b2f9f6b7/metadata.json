[\u201cBreitbart notes correctly that its recent story on food stamps didn\u2019t address fraud,\u201d reads an updated version of Wemple\u2019s Post article.  You\u2019ll recall, Huntsman corrected an earlier report in which she said that \u201c$70 million were wasted on food stamp fraud. \u201d Huntsman\u2019s   correction was purportedly demanded by a USDA spokesperson, who had implied that Breitbart News was the source for the fake food stamps fraud figure. \u201cWe are not quite sure where this came from,\u201d the USDA spokesperson said, according to Wemple. \u201cWe saw that there was as story on Breitbart. \u201d Sure, there was a food stamps story on Breitbart News about the growth in overall food stamp use during President Barack Obama\u2019s two terms. But that article never mentioned fraud in the food stamps program. Wemple failed to make that fact clear. Wemple\u2019s correction came only after several   journalists took to Twitter to smear Breitbart News for peddling \u201csham journalism. \u201d After publishing his   article, which included an unconfirmed rumor from a government agency to attack Breitbart, Wemple tweeted the article to his 22, 000 Twitter followers.
