Russian President Vladimir Putin, following his address to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo) \\nA case in point is Tuesday\u2019s editorial in The Washington Post, entitled \u201cThe Putin-Trump worldview\u201d (in print) and \u201cTrump and Putin share a frightening worldview\u201d (online). The editorial quotes Putin as \u201cobserving that Mr. Trump \u2018represents the interests of the sizable part of American society that is tired of the elites that have been in power for decades now \u2026 and does not like to see power handed down by inheritance.\u2019\u201d \\nThe Post\u2019s editorial writers then snidely note that \u201cMr. Putin and Mr. Trump have an uncanny way of echoing each other\u2019s words.\u201d \\nBut that is a classic example of McCarthyistic sophistry. Just because some demonized figure like Putin says something that is undeniably true and an American sees the same facts doesn\u2019t make that American a \u201cPutin puppet\u201d or a \u201cMoscow stooge\u201d or any of the other ugly names now being hurled at people who won\u2019t join in today\u2019s trendy Russia bashing and guilt by association. \\nPutin is not wrong that many of Trump\u2019s supporters \u2013 along with many Americans who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 are \u201ctired of the elites\u201d that have behaved arrogantly and stupidly for decades. Many Americans also don\u2019t believe that a family\u2019s name should decide who becomes the leader of the United States, whether that be the Bushes or the Clintons. \\nIndeed, what Putin is saying amounts to almost a truism, yet here is The Washington Post not only suggesting that because Putin is saying something that it must be false but then smearing Trump (or anyone else) who detects the same reality. \\nDouble Standards \\nThe same Post editorial also goes to great lengths to reject any comparisons between the Russian and Syrian government airstrikes on the Syrian neighborhoods of east Aleppo \u2014 to root out Al Qaeda-connected jihadists and their supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel allies \u2014 and U.S. and Iraqi government airstrikes on the Iraqi city of Mosul under the control of Al Qaeda\u2019s spinoff group, the Islamic State.

[Screenshot from the YouTube video] Insisting that the two similar operations are nothing alike, the Post\u2019s editors white-out the central role of Al Qaeda in commanding the rebel forces in east Aleppo. While ignoring Al Qaeda\u2019s dominance of those neighborhoods and its terror rocket attacks on civilian areas of west Aleppo, the Post only says, \u201cthe rebel forces in Aleppo include Western-backed secular groups who seek only to overturn the blood-drenched Assad regime.\u201d\\nNote the Post\u2019s characterization that rebel forces \u201cinclude Western-backed secular groups\u201d rather than an honest admission that those supposedly \u201csecular groups\u201d have served mostly as cut-outs in diverting sophisticated U.S. military weapons, such as TOW missiles, to the jihadist cause, a reality recognized by U.S. military advisers on the ground. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201c How the US Armed-up Syrian Jihadists. \u201c] \\nMany of these supposedly \u201csecular groups\u201d have openly allied themselves with Al Qaeda\u2019s recently rebranded Nusra Front (now called the Syria Conquest Front). This so-called \u201cmarbling\u201d of the \u201cmoderates\u201d in with the jihadists was one of the sticking points in the failed limited cease-fire in which the Post\u2019s beloved \u201csecular groups\u201d rebuffed Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s plea that they separate themselves from Al Qaeda. \\nAn intellectually honest newspaper would have at least admitted some of these inconvenient truths, but that is not the modern-day Washington Post with its own \u201cblood-drenched\u201d editors who played a crucial role in rallying support behind President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. \\nThe Post and its editors have on their hands the blood of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who died as a result of that illegal aggressive war, but those editors have not suffered a whit for their participation in war crimes. Instead, exactly the same senior editorial-page editors \u2013 Fred Hiatt and Jackson Diehl \u2013 are still there, touted on the newspaper\u2019s masthead, still misleading the Post\u2019s readers. \\nBy contrast, The Wall Street Journal (of all places) did some serious reporting on the key question of \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels allied with Al Qaeda. The Journal reported on Sept. 29: \u201cSome of Syria\u2019s largest rebel factions are doubling down on their alliance with an al Qaeda-linked group, despite a U.S. warning to split from the extremists or risk being targeted in airstrikes. The rebel gambit is complicating American counterterrorism efforts in the country at a time the U.S. is contemplating cooperation with Russia to fight extremist groups.\u201d \\nIf even Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal can acknowledge this important context, why can\u2019t The Washington Post? \\nDangerous Terrain \\nBut the whipping up of a New Cold War with Russia and the demonizing of Vladimir Putin extend beyond The Washington Post to virtually the entire U.S. political/media establishment which has plunged into this dangerous terrain without any more serious thought and analysis than preceded the Iraq invasion, except now the target for \u201cregime change\u201d is nuclear-armed Russia and this adventurism risks the extermination of life on the planet. Lawyer Roy Cohn (right) with Sen. Joseph McCarthy. \\nDespite these grave dangers, the Democrats and the Clinton campaign have settled on a strategy of exploiting the New McCarthyism of the New Cold War to discredit Trump through \u201cguilt by association\u201d to Putin even though the two men have apparently never met. \\nMostly this New McCarthyism has been used to divert attention from developments threatening to Hillary Clinton\u2019s electoral chances, such as the release of embarrassing emails among Democratic insiders hacked from the personal account of Clinton adviser John Podesta and, since last Friday, the statement by FBI Director James Comey that he has reopened the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of an unsecured email server because of emails found on a computer in the home of Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. \\nIn the first instance, the Clinton campaign sought to redirect attention from the content of the emails, including the text of speeches that Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and other financial interests, to the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia was probably behind the hack. \\n\u2018A Witch Hunt\u2019 \\nIn the Comey situation, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has sought to counter Comey\u2019s stunning announcement last Friday by calling on the FBI director to also disclose whatever the FBI may have discovered about links between Trump\u2019s aides and the Kremlin. \\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that Democrats have raised suspicions about Carter Page, an early-on Trump adviser and former Merrill Lynch banker who gave a speech last summer criticizing the United States and other Western nations for a \u201chypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change\u201d in Russia and other parts of the old Soviet Union. \\nPage termed Reid\u2019s efforts to transform a political disagreement into a criminal case \u201ca witch hunt,\u201d a phrase familiar from Sen. Joe McCarthy\u2019s Red-scare investigations of the late 1940s and early 1950s into the loyalty of Americans. \\nAnother Trump adviser caught up in the Democrats\u2019 attempts to smear the Trump campaign over alleged ties to Moscow is Roger Stone. The Times reported that Democrats have accused Stone \u201cof being a conduit between the Russian hackers and WikiLeaks,\u201d which published Podesta\u2019s hacked emails, because Stone has said he had contacts with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and seemed to anticipate the damaging disclosures, though Stone has denied any prior knowledge. \\nAn irony from this case of \u201ctrading places\u201d \u2013 with the Democrats now darkly suggesting Republican ties to Moscow rather than the opposite during the McCarthy era \u2013 is that Roger Stone was a longtime associate of the late Roy Cohn, who was the controversial counsel on Sen. McCarthy\u2019s Red-hunting investigations. \\nStone derided the Democratic attempts to discredit Trump and himself with claims of ties to Moscow as \u201cthe new McCarthyism.\u201d \\nDespite the irony, Stone is not wrong in his assessment. Rarely in American politics since the dark days of Joe McCarthy have so many unsubstantiated accusations of disloyalty been directed at any major political figure as the Democrats have done to Donald Trump. \\nIn the third debate, Clinton even accused Trump of being a Putin \u201cpuppet.\u201d If such a remark were made by Joe McCarthy or his Red-baiting ally Richard Nixon, there would have been understandable outrage. But Clinton\u2019s ugly charge passed without controversy. \\nThough there are plenty of legitimate reasons to oppose the eminently unqualified Donald Trump for President, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats risk setting in motion dangerous international forces with their promiscuous Russia-bashing. Recognizing the terrifying potential of nuclear war, a more responsible course would be to tone down the rhetoric and address the legitimate questions raised by the email issues. \\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.
