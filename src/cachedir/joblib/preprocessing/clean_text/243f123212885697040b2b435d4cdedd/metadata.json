Nothing has been found.\u201d \\nResearchers will repeatedly scan the star for eight hours per night over the next two months to examine its extremely unusually dimming behavior. The star randomly dims by as much as 22 percent of its output at extremely irregular intervals. This is consistent with large orbiting masses, much larger than planets, blocking out some of the star\u2019s light when they pass in front of it. All the natural forms of large masses which could cause KIC 8462852\u2019s dimming aren\u2019t consistent with the star\u2019s age . \\nScientists found the first possible evidence of this extraterrestrial civilization around KIC 8462852 last October , when astronomers with Yale University and other top schools published a study that used NASA\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope. \\nSo far, astronomers haven\u2019t found a single naturalistic explanation for the star\u2019s exceedingly unusual dimming, which explains the extremely unusual behavior of the star. Astronomers have examined 500 other stars in the vicinity of KIC 8462852, and seen nothing else like it. \\nThe dense formations near KIC 8462852 are similar to \u201cDyson Spheres,\u201d hypothetical, are energy-harvesting \u201cmegastuctures\u201d theoretical aliens could hypothetically build by rearranging the solar system. Scientists have pondered the existence of Dyson Spheres since the 1960s, thinking they could be a potential solution to energy problems faced by an extremely old civilization. SETI scientists have long argued humans could detect distant alien civilizations by looking for technological artifacts like Dyson Spheres orbiting other stars. \\n\u201cWe spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasn\u2019t real. We just weren\u2019t able to,\u201d Ben Montet, a Caltech astronomer who co-authored research on the star, told Gizmodo . \u201cNone of the considered phenomena can alone explain the observations.\u201d \\nThe best naturalistic explanation favored by astronomers, involves a huge mass of comets erratically orbiting the star and creating enough dust to dim the light, but a January analysis of the star\u2019s history renders that hypothesis implausible, since the unprecedented dimming has continued for over a century. In order to dim for such a long time period, the star would need to have millions of times more dust and comets orbiting it than is the case. \\nAstronomers estimate that the dimming would require roughly 648,000 giant comets of 200 kilometers in diameter, all aligned to pass in front of the star. The chances of such a formation render it essentially impossible, and there is currently no remotely plausible scientific explanation for what is going on with KIC 8462852. \\nAstronomers have previously frequently misjudge abnormal stellar occurrences and, usually, the abnormalities are simply a new phenomenon. \\nA graduate student in astronomy, found an usual pulsing radio signal so predictable it seemed to be a sign of intelligent life in 1967. The astronomers even nicknamed the signal LGM-1, for \u201clittle green men,\u201d and believed they had detected a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization , but it turned out to be the first pulsar.'"}, "time": 1742562871.4311435}
