Trump\u2019s lawyers agreed on Thursday to enter settlement talks in a   fraud lawsuit involving the   and Trump University, now defunct, raising the possibility of a quick end to the    case just before it goes to trial. Daniel Petrocelli, Mr. Trump\u2019s lead lawyer on the case, also asked to delay the trial to early next year, saying Mr. Trump needed time to work on the transition to the presidency. \u201cThe good news is that he was elected president,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli told Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of Federal District Court. \u201cThe bad news is that he has even more work to do now. \u201d Mr. Trump has accused Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana, of bias in the case because of his Mexican heritage. Both sides accepted Judge Curiel\u2019s offer to work with Judge Jeffrey Miller of Federal District Court on a possible settlement. \u201cI can tell you right now I\u2019m all ears,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli told Judge Curiel. Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer for the former students who sued, told reporters that previous attempts failed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been miles apart,\u201d he said. Judge Curiel said more than 100 potential jurors would be in court on Nov. 28, and nine would be picked to begin hearing arguments no more than two days later. He said he expected both sides to finish presenting their cases around Dec. 14. Mr. Petrocelli said it was unlikely that Mr. Trump would attend the trial, and Judge Curiel said he did not expect he would. The lawsuit, filed in 2010 on behalf of former students, says Trump University gave seminars and classes across the country under the guise of being an accredited school and pressured people to spend up to $35, 000 on mentorships from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201chandpicked\u201d instructors. The claims largely mirror another   complaint in San Diego and a lawsuit in New York.'"}, "time": 1742562101.895125}
