On Tuesday, Mr. Duterte released a statement saying he regretted that his curse \u201ccame across as a personal attack on the U. S. president. \u201d He blamed his words on \u201ccertain press questions that elicited concern and distress. \u201d Mr. Duterte had warned Mr. Obama not to ask him about extrajudicial killings related to his crackdown on drug dealers, a campaign pledge that helped sweep him to victory in the country\u2019s presidential election in May. \u201cI am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,\u201d Mr. Duterte told reporters before he left his country for Laos, where he and Mr. Obama will attend the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \u201cI do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody,\u201d he said in remarks published by The Associated Press. Apparently addressing Mr. Obama, he added: \u201cYou must be respectful. Do not just throw questions. \u201d Then, using a curse in Tagalog that can be translated as \u201cson of a bitch,\u201d he added, \u201cI will swear at you in that forum. \u201d Mr. Obama, who was in China for a Group of 20 meeting, departed on Monday for Laos, becoming the first American president to visit the nation. He is also scheduled to take part in the East Asia Summit and speak at a forum with young people. Mr. Obama had planned to meet Mr. Duterte in Laos, but the White House said early Tuesday that the meeting had been canceled. \u201cClearly, he\u2019s a colorful guy,\u201d Mr. Obama said Monday. \u201cI always want to make sure if I\u2019m having a meeting that it\u2019s productive. \u201d Mr. Duterte acknowledged Tuesday that the meeting had been canceled and seemed to take a softer tone: \u201cWe look forward to ironing out differences arising out of national priorities and perceptions, and working in mutually responsible ways for both countries. \u201d Last month, the Philippines\u2019 top police official, Chief Ronald dela Rosa, told a Senate hearing that killings by the police and vigilantes in the country\u2019s war on drugs had soared to nearly 1, 800 in the seven weeks since Mr. Duterte, a former mayor of Davao, was sworn into office. Mr. Duterte\u2019s public image has been characterized by bouts of coarse language. He has lashed out at his critics, threatening to withdraw from the United Nations after human rights experts called for a halt to the killings. He joked about the rape of an Australian missionary during the presidential campaign, and he cursed Pope Francis and his entourage for causing huge traffic jams in Manila during the pope\u2019s visit to the Philippines in 2015.'"}, "time": 1742561669.784028}
