[The new mural is located on the south support pillar under Coronado Bridge at the Interstate 5 underpass in what is now called, \u201cChicano Park. \u201d  The location of the park was scheduled to become a new CHP substation in the early 1970\u2019s, but protestors from the \u201cBarrio Logan\u201d community staved off the plan, facing off against the state \u2014  seizing the land for \u201cchicanos\u201d and demanding that a park be constructed to showcase chicano art. The mural \u2014  painted by Salvador \u201cSal\u201d Barajas \u2014  one of the artists who painted the first \u201cHistorical Mural\u201d in the park in 1973 that highlights key figures and history of the Chicano movement, was commissioned by a border activist group known as Border Angels. Border Angel\u2019s founder, Enrigue Morones has been trying to raise the $10, 000 for nearly a decade \u2014  but credits Trumps election with the new enthusiasm. Morones spoke to NBC 7 \u2014  a local NBC affiliate out of San Diego: \u201cSince November 8 things have changed  \u2026    People are outraged, more volunteers, more funds. \u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re totally opposed to the wall   \u2026     We know that the wall kills people. \u201d Not everyone is happy about the new mural.  Some San Diego county residents are outraged \u2014  calling the mural \u2018incendiary\u2019 and \u2018 .\u2019 Suellen Shea of Vista, who took issue with some of the imagery Barajas used, told the  :  \u201cThe artist has talent, but, in my opinion, much of it is offensive and   especially the ICE agent choking the migrant worker,\u201d Shea reportedly said via email. \u201cAmerican Citizens want safety  sovereignty (enforced borders) for our country. Nothing strange or racist about that  \u2014   Mexico does too. \u201d Mural painter Barajas thinks the graphic violence depicted is justified, according to the the Los Angeles Times:  \u201cOne hand represents U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for deporting people from the U. S. [and t]he other hand represents Mexican government officials, whose corruption makes it necessary for Mexicans to migrate for work. \u201d Barajas admits that the \u201ctext \u2018No Border Wall\u2019 was one of the last things added to the piece,\u201d and is likely what inspired   donors to put up the money to denounce the looming border wall. San Diego has become the locus of the fight over President Trump\u2019s wall over the past few months \u2014  as prototypes will soon be constructed nearby in order to meet DHS\u2019s June 1st target date.  Organized protests and violent resistance is expected by the agency \u2014  and contractors are required to provide adequate security as part of their bids. A number of Californians have taken to social media to make their opposition known reports the LA Times.   \u201cSan Diego has many parks,\u201d wrote Carol Hamilton, of Imperial Beach. \u201cOnly one is splattered with garish posters and   slurs  \u2014   Chicano Park. A national shrine? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s time to whitewash it and use it as a park and not for politics. \u201d Chicano Park is not under the control of the city or county of San Diego \u2014  the land on which it stands is part of a state easement controlled by CalTrans, who reportedly could revoke the right for any mural to be on California state property.
