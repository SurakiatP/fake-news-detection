J. cycled through the summer\u2019s hottest rap and RB songs. As the event reached its climax, the ubiquitous opening notes of a guaranteed crowd pleaser  \u2014   \u201cWork,\u201d by Rihanna, featuring Drake  \u2014   vibrated through the room. But when the vocals on the demo recording started, it was obvious that this wasn\u2019t the version that spent nine weeks as the No. 1 song in the country. In place of Rihanna, the nimble, addictive patois was delivered by PartyNextDoor, 23, the Canadian producer and RB singer who wrote the song\u2019s   melody and helped to usher in a pop moment deeply indebted to the Caribbean. PartyNextDoor, gliding through the crowd to the D. J. booth, was not there to celebrate his role in the song of the summer, however, nor was he touting his contributions to Drake\u2019s latest album, \u201cViews,\u201d which spent 12 weeks atop the Billboard chart. \u201cPartyNextDoor 3,\u201d his own new album, had just been released, capping one of the more quietly influential runs of 2016. Now he was, somewhat reluctantly, the main attraction. As the first artist signed to Drake\u2019s OVO Sound label, a partnership with Warner Bros. in 2013, PartyNextDoor has had his fingerprints on every Drake release since, in addition to the steady flow of slurry, nocturnal RB under his own name. But Drake casts a wide shadow, and PartyNextDoor (born Jahron Anthony Brathwaite) has thus far been comfortable in the shade. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know anything about me, and that\u2019s how I like it,\u201d he said in a rare interview before the album release party. But with credits on a No. 1 song  \u2014   as well as   friends and collaborators like Drake, Rihanna and Kylie Jenner  \u2014   come more expectations. PartyNextDoor acknowledged that while his new album might not be his solo breakthrough to the pop mainstream, he hopes it is a step further. \u201cMore people\u2019s eyes are on me now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people are literally watching me find my voice. \u201d So far, that voice has been malleable:   and full of bravado, slipping easily into   cadences (\u201cRecognize\u201d) or pure and sweet, leaning more toward soul (\u201cJoy,\u201d a highlight from the new album). Most often, it is carnal and   as on \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d the decidedly noncommercial   intro to \u201cPartyNextDoor 3,\u201d which just sounds   (to say nothing of the lyrics). In daylight, PartyNextDoor was more   sitting at the kitchen table of a   Airbnb rental in Midtown Manhattan as he rolled a blunt on a takeout sushi container. He wore a     styled with safety pins, a   nose ring and a folded bandanna around his   skinny blond dreads. Prone to long pauses, as if avoiding verbal traps, he left more sentences dangling than he finished. Yet, after a string of niche projects that built his name and a dedicated online following, PartyNextDoor has become resigned to the fact that more visibility is a must for his career to progress. \u201cFrom here on, I will try to do better at interacting with my fans,\u201d he wrote in a note revealing the new album. Previous attempts at putting himself out there have been bumpy at best. This year, PartyNextDoor found himself drowning in internet drama after posting an   Instagram with a rumored ex, the singer Kehlani. (\u201cNo one knows the details, and I don\u2019t care to defend myself,\u201d he said.) Not long after, he was caught up with the Kardashians after a series of paparazzi photos and a subsequent music video surfaced, featuring him in the company of Ms. Jenner, the youngest sister. Asked if he had actively courted TMZ attention by casting a reality star as his love interest, PartyNextDoor would only say, \u201cI\u2019m grateful that really pretty girls like my music, and social media just happens to like really pretty girls. \u201d While flaunting a Kylie endorsement is one thing, he is less willing to chase what\u2019s hot musically. Raised in what he called a \u201csuper Jamaican household\u201d in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, PartyNextDoor has long peppered his songs with dance hall sirens and slang. But recently, he has leaned into his Caribbean roots on \u201cWork\u201d and \u201cSex With Me,\u201d another Rihanna track, along with Drake\u2019s \u201cWith You,\u201d a shimmering summer gem from \u201cViews. \u201d \u201cNot Nice,\u201d a thumping single from \u201cPartyNextDoor 3,\u201d has a similar vibe, and given the album\u2019s summer release and the trendiness of the sound, an entire record in that mold might have made sense. But a few songs aside, \u201cPartyNextDoor 3\u201d favors a grim,   palette. \u201cI could make a PartyNextDoor album that\u2019s clean, all hits,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I care about doing. \u201d The same goes for being a pop songwriter, he said. After dropping out of high school at 17, he signed a publishing deal to write for others, well aware that that wasn\u2019t his ultimate goal. He met Rihanna last year, during a writing camp at her Malibu home. \u201cThe first feeling I got was, \u2018Why am I here? \u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAll these guys have made hits already. \u201d But he was determined to create streamlined songs for her, requiring a different process than his looser, more experimental   productions. Even \u201cWork\u201d was not an immediate fit. Despite Rihanna\u2019s Bajan heritage, \u201cher label didn\u2019t care for Caribbean music at the time,\u201d PartyNextDoor said. He and Drake considered keeping the track, or giving it to Alicia Keys, but Rihanna\u2019s team came around \u201cwhen it was all that she could sing around the house,\u201d he said. \u201cShe fought for it,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe said, \u2018This is my family\u2019s favorite song. \u2019\u201d Collaborating with Drake may seem more fraught from the outside. During his chart dominance, Drake has been dogged by ghostwriting accusations, and observers have wondered whether OVO Sound, also home to Majid Jordan and Roy Woods, is just his \u201cpersonal hit factory,\u201d having not yet minted a star near the boss\u2019s level. (Drake\u2019s previous RB collaborator the Weeknd, by contrast, set out for  \u2014   and achieved  \u2014   pop stardom on his own.) PartyNextDoor insisted that their partnership was mutually beneficial. \u201cI openly share music with Drake, especially when it\u2019s time for him to have a project,\u201d he said. At the same time, \u201cI have an older brother I can text anytime, someone who\u2019s super invested because my name is tied into his. \u201cIt\u2019s just creatives cooking,\u201d he continued of their work together. \u201cIf he sees something in a song of mine that he feels he can spin around and make better, who am I to say I\u2019m going to selfishly keep it? As a fan of music, that\u2019s wrong. \u201d He added, \u201cOf course I want to be a superstar, but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and I see that from having a mentor. \u201d The two work in harmony, not in lock step, each playing his role. \u201cWe have similar stories, but not the same story,\u201d PartyNextDoor said. \u201cBeing a fan got me to him, but he needs me to be me. I need to be me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564077.2054186}
