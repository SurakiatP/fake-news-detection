[The selected inmates graduated from the Malachi Dads program at the Morgan County Correctional Complex, which teaches inmates   skills and fosters personal growth so inmates can become better fathers, WBIR reported.  \u201cI picked the streets before my family, and this program has shown me that God is first, then my family second,\u201d inmate Darryl Wiseman said. For the past year, Wiseman has been taking classes facilitated by volunteer mentors of the program. The program culminates Saturday with the Returning Hearts Celebration, where the fathers reunite with their families in the prison yard and participate in   activities with them. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to cry real hard first,\u201d Wiseman said ahead of Saturday\u2019s celebration. \u201cI\u2019m going to be nervous to see them because I want them to see a new side of me. They\u2019re going to be able to see that I have that glow, that I have that light and that I\u2019m walking for him now, for Jesus. They\u2019re going to see the gentler side of me. \u201d Wiseman, who has served three years out of a   sentence, says he found purpose in life as a result of these classes. \u201cIt changed my life, it really did. If changed me on how to be a man and a father to my children,\u201d he said. Robert Reburn, a public information officer for the Tennessee Department of Corrections, said there is no statistical data to measure the impact of the program but stated that corrections officers have noticed inmates\u2019 behavior change because of programs like Malachi Dads. \u201cWe can say for a fact that offenders who are still in our custody and enrolled in these programs are less argumentative, they get less discipline, they cause fewer problems and they are overall much more well behaved than those who are not participating,\u201d Reburn said. Other states have similar programs implemented in their prisons, mostly organized by   ministries. These programs have been   in Michigan, Colorado, and Wisconsin.'"}, "time": 1742628481.7269852}
