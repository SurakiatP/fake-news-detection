At 4:32 p. m. shortly after arriving at his    home in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump took to Twitter to write: The message was swiftly deleted, but 16 minutes later Mr. Trump posted a revised version. Restricted to 140 characters, he removed the word \u201csick,\u201d and added two other television networks  \u2014   ABC and CBS  \u2014   to his list of offending organizations. The president has referred to the media as the \u201copposition party\u201d to his administration, and he has blamed news organizations for stymieing his agenda. But the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent. \u201cOh boy,\u201d Carl Bernstein, the journalist who helped to uncover the Watergate scandal, said on Friday, after a reporter read him Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cDonald Trump is demonstrating an authoritarian attitude and inclination that shows no understanding of the role of the free press,\u201d he added. Historians pointed out similarities between Mr. Trump and Richard M. Nixon, who in 1972 told his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, \u201cThe press is the enemy. \u201d Mr. Bernstein said the president\u2019s language \u201cmay be more insidious and dangerous than Richard Nixon\u2019s attacks on the press. \u201d \u201cBut there is a similarity in trying to divide the country, and make the conduct of the press the issue, instead of the conduct of the president,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump and his top advisers strongly believe that an elitist news media lost its credibility by failing to anticipate his political rise. Still, the notion of the news media as an enemy of the public  \u2014   especially when voiced by a sitting president  \u2014   went a step beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s usual rhetorical turns. Mr. Trump\u2019s tactic of pitting the press against the public was mirrored in a survey distributed by the president\u2019s team on Thursday, which urged Trump supporters \u201cto do your part to fight back against the media\u2019s attacks and deceptions. \u201d Survey questions included, \u201cDo you believe that the mainstream media has reported unfairly on our movement?\u201d and \u201cOn which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing Republicans? (Select as many that apply. )\u201d Mr. Trump has deleted tweets in the past, sometimes to correct for typos or to refine his message, and publications are keeping track of these fleeting missives. On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his distaste for journalists in more populist terms, saying, \u201cmuch of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests. \u201d \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t believe you people anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cNow, maybe I had something to do with that. I don\u2019t know. But they don\u2019t believe you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562626.4336777}
