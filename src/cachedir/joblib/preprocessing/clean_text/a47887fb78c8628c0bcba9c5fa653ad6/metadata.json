But I assure you the press will fry up just like you will at 5,000 degrees. \\nThat issue is Syria. \\nHillary Clinton has committed herself to imposing a \u201cno fly\u201d zone over Syria. As I have pointed out on multiple occasions in this column there are two problems with that commitment. \\nFirst, the Russians are in there at Syria\u2019s invitation. They\u2019re protecting Syria\u2019s government at its request, exactly as we protected Kuwait at its request . They are therefore acting with the permission of the sovereign government of Syria, and we will not be. We will effectively be invading Syria. \\nSecond, Russia has missile systems deployed in Syria that we cannot reliably kill, and our aircraft and other flying equipment cannot reliably survive being fired upon by them either. While we can certainly find some of their batteries through intelligence and similar, and blow them up, doing so would be a clear act of war. If we do not do so then anything Russia does not want flying in the skies over Syria will not be flying. It will instead be in many pieces and any airmen inside said aircraft will be dead. \\nWill Russia allow us to dictate that there will be a no-fly zone and allow us to enforce it? \\nI doubt it. \\nIf we attempt to implement one anyway then conflict is inevitable. This is a conflict that has not happened thus far in the nuclear age between superpowers. Oh sure, there\u2019s been a plane forced down here and one shot down there, along with plenty of harassment, along with various proxy wars where this party or that was supplying arms to one side or the other (e.g. Afghanistan) but an actual face-off and exchange between US and Russian forces has never occurred. \\nOnce it happens, if it does, then someone will of course believe they \u201cwon\u201d and someone will believe they \u201clost.\u201d The question will then be whether the side who believes it \u201clost\u201d will admit to that and withdraw. \\nIf that side does not do so then we are facing nuclear war \u2013 a war that inherently involves the destruction of both nation\u2019s infrastructure and large percentages of their respective populations. \\nHillary Clinton has said she intends to walk this path. We do not know whether Trump will; he hasn\u2019t committed himself one way or the other. But his statements thus far tend to lead me, and many others, to believe he won\u2019t try to interfere in Syria\u2019s (or anyone else\u2019s) sovereign affairs. In fact he\u2019s made clear that he believes that we have had far too many foreign entanglements and they have not served us well. \\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that a President Trump would not find some reason to intervene, of course, and thus no guarantee that we don\u2019t ultimately wind up in the same place. Let\u2019s face it \u2014 Syria is a mess, and one that Hillary Clinton had a large hand in creating. \\nBut the choice here is between someone who might get pressed into a situation that leads to armed conflict, possibly nuclear conflict, and someone who has a vested interest in continuing what she started, who has declared her intent to take an action that by definition will violate Syria\u2019s sovereignty and, with near-certainty will lead to an exchange of weapons between the Syrian protectors, which are Russian, and the United States. \\nThat road has a high probability of being one way and at the end are events you will not like. \\nDon\u2019t vote to die \u2014 and kill your children. \\nIf you vote for Hillary you are in fact voting for nuclear war.'"}, "time": 1742562033.468947}
