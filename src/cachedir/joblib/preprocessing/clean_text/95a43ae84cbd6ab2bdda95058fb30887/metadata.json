I personally have fond memories of \u201ccampaigning\u201d for Ross Perot in second grade. The free exchange of ideas, and arguing your beliefs, has traditionally been an important, and fun, part of growing up. \\nSadly, that tradition appears to be coming to an end, at least at Jericho Elementary School in Centereach, where students will now be holding a mock election to choose their \u201cfavorite school lunch\u201d instead. \\nThe cancellation of the mock election came after some students were reportedly chanting \u201cTrump,\u201d and repeating \u201cnegative rhetoric about minorities.\u201d Some of the students had reportedly stated that they did not want Muslims here. \\nWhile some may find that offensive, this is an issue in the world, and in the news. Perhaps a better way to handle it would have been to have a discussion or a debate and allowed students to argue their feelings on the issue \u2014 instead of shutting down discussions entirely. \\nThe school\u2019s principal said in a statement that he decided to toss the learning experience aside to prevent minority students \u201cfrom feeling uncomfortable.\u201d \\n\u201cI mean, kids often repeat what they hear on the TV or the news, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK,\u201d school principal Glen Rogers said. \u201cWe have a diverse community here. We want all our students to feel valued.\u201d \\nComfortable or not, immigration is an issue in this election, which students should be free to explore and discuss. \\n\u201cSome people were getting angry because some people like Trump and some people like Clinton,\u201d Miranda Waters, a fifth-grader at the school told ABC News. \u201cSome people think Clinton\u2019s not good. Some think Trump\u2019s not good. So there\u2019s a lot of arguments going on, and I don\u2019t like that.\u201d \\nThe discouragement and shaming for discussing political beliefs, and attempting to silence voices which may stray away from what the left deems acceptable, has lead to a generation of college students who believe that they have a right to never be offended \u2014 and who are willing to trade free speech to ensure it.
