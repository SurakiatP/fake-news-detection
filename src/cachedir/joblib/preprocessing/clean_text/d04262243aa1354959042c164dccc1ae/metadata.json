Trump was emphatic in the second presidential debate: Yes, he had boasted about kissing women without permission and grabbing their genitals. But he had never actually done those things, he said. \u201cNo,\u201d he declared under questioning on Sunday evening, \u201cI have not. \u201d At that moment, sitting at home in Manhattan, Jessica Leeds, 74, felt he was lying to her face. \u201cI wanted to punch the screen,\u201d she said in an interview in her apartment. More than three decades ago, when she was a traveling businesswoman at a paper company, Ms. Leeds said, she sat beside Mr. Trump in the   cabin of a flight to New York. They had never met before. About 45 minutes after takeoff, she recalled, Mr. Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her. According to Ms. Leeds, Mr. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt. \u201cHe was like an octopus,\u201d she said. \u201cHis hands were everywhere. \u201d She fled to the back of the plane. \u201cIt was an assault,\u201d she said. Ms. Leeds has told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with The New York Times. Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that his crude words had never turned into actions was similarly infuriating to a woman watching on Sunday night in Ohio: Rachel Crooks. Ms. Crooks was a    receptionist at Bayrock Group, a real estate investment and development company in Trump Tower in Manhattan, when she encountered Mr. Trump outside an elevator in the building one morning in 2005. Aware that her company did business with Mr. Trump, she turned and introduced herself. They shook hands, but Mr. Trump would not let go, she said. Instead, he began kissing her cheeks. Then, she said, he \u201ckissed me directly on the mouth. \u201d It didn\u2019t feel like an accident, she said. It felt like a violation. \u201cIt was so inappropriate,\u201d Ms. Crooks recalled in an interview. \u201cI was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that. \u201d Shaken, Ms. Crooks returned to her desk and immediately called her sister, Brianne Webb, in the small town in Ohio where they grew up, and told her what had happened. \u201cShe was very worked up about it,\u201d said Ms. Webb, who recalled pressing her sister for details. \u201cBeing from a town of 1, 600 people, being na\u00efve, I was like \u2018Are you sure he didn\u2019t just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, he kissed me on the mouth.\u2019 I was like, \u2018That is not normal. \u2019\u201d In the days since Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was jolted by a 2005 recording that caught him bragging about pushing himself on women, he has insisted, as have his aides, that it was simply macho bluster. \u201cIt\u2019s just words,\u201d he has said repeatedly. And his hope for salvaging his candidacy rests heavily on whether voters believe that claim. They should not, say Ms. Leeds and Ms. Crooks, whose stories have never been made public before. And their accounts echo those of other women who have previously come forward, like Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, who said that Mr. Trump kissed her on the mouth more than once when she was a    pageant contestant. In a phone interview on Tuesday night, a highly agitated Mr. Trump denied every one of the women\u2019s claims. \u201cNone of this ever took place,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who began shouting at the Times reporter who was questioning him. He said that The Times was making up the allegations to hurt him and that he would sue the news organization if it reported them. \u201cYou are a disgusting human being,\u201d he told the reporter as she questioned him about the women\u2019s claims. Asked whether he had ever done any of the kissing or groping that he had described on the recording, Mr. Trump was once again insistent: \u201cI don\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t do it. It was locker room talk. \u201d But for the women who shared their stories with The Times, the recording was more than that: As upsetting as it was, it offered them a kind of affirmation, they said. That was the case for Ms. Taggart. Mr. Trump\u2019s description of how he kisses beautiful women without invitation described precisely what he did to her, she said. \u201cI just start kissing them,\u201d Mr. Trump said on the tape. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. \u201d Ms. Crooks and Ms. Leeds never reported their accounts to the authorities, but they both shared what happened to them with friends and family. Ms. Crooks did so immediately afterward Ms. Leeds described the events to those close to her more recently, as Mr. Trump became more visible politically and ran for president. Ms. Leeds was 38 at the time and living in Connecticut. She had been seated in coach. But a flight attendant invited her to take an empty seat in first class, she said. That seat was beside Mr. Trump, who did not yet own a fleet of private aircraft, records show. He introduced himself and shook her hand. They exchanged pleasantries, and Mr. Trump asked her if she was married. She was divorced, and told him so. Later, after their dinner trays were cleared, she said, Mr. Trump raised the armrest, moved toward her and began to grope her. Ms. Leeds said she recoiled. She quickly left the   cabin and returned to coach, she said. \u201cI was angry and shook up,\u201d she recalled, as she sat on a couch in her New York City apartment on Tuesday. She did not complain to the airline staff at the time, Ms. Leeds said, because such unwanted advances from men occurred throughout her time in business in the 1970s and early 1980s. \u201cWe accepted it for years,\u201d she said of the conduct. \u201cWe were taught it was our fault. \u201d She recalled bumping into Mr. Trump at a charity event in New York about two years later, and said he seemed to recall her, insulting her with a crude remark. She had largely put the encounter on the plane out of her mind until last year, when Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign became more serious. Since then, she has told a widening circle of people, including her son, a nephew and two friends, all of whom were contacted by The Times. They said they were sickened by what they heard. \u201cIt made me shake,\u201d said Linda Ross, a neighbor and friend who spoke with Ms. Leeds about the interaction about six months ago. Like several of Ms. Leeds\u2019s friends, Ms. Ross encouraged her to tell her story to the news media. Ms. Leeds had resisted until Sunday\u2019s debate, which she watched with Ms. Ross. When Mr. Trump denied having ever sexually assaulted women, in response to a question from Anderson Cooper of CNN, Ms. Ross said she immediately looked at Ms. Leeds in disbelief. \u201cNow we know he lied straight up,\u201d Ms. Ross recalled saying. In the days after the debate, Ms. Leeds recounted her experience in an email to The Times and a series of interviews. \u201cHis behavior is deep seated in his character,\u201d Ms. Leeds wrote in the message. \u201cTo those who would vote for him,\u201d she added, \u201cI would wish for them to reflect on this. \u201d For Ms. Crooks, the encounter with Mr. Trump was further complicated by the fact that she worked in his building and risked running into him again. A few hours after Mr. Trump kissed her, Ms. Crooks returned to her apartment in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn and broke down to her boyfriend at the time, Clint Hackenburg. \u201cI asked, \u2018How was your day? \u2019\u201d Mr. Hackenburg recalled. \u201cShe paused for a second, and then started hysterically crying. \u201d After Ms. Crooks described her experience with Mr. Trump, she and Mr. Hackenburg discussed what to do. \u201cI think that what was more upsetting than him kissing her was that she felt like she couldn\u2019t do anything to him because of his position,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was 22. She was a secretary. It was her first job out of college. I remember her saying, \u2018I can\u2019t do anything to this guy, because he\u2019s Donald Trump. \u2019\u201d Days later, Ms. Crooks said, Mr. Trump, who had recently married Melania, came into the Bayrock office and requested her phone number. When she asked why he needed it, Mr. Trump told her he intended to pass it along to his modeling agency. Ms. Crooks was skeptical, but relented because of Mr. Trump\u2019s influence over her company. She never heard from the modeling agency. During the rest of her year working at Bayrock, she made a point of ducking out of sight every time Mr. Trump came into view. When Bayrock employees were invited to the Trump Organization Christmas party, she declined, wanting to avoid any other encounters with him. But the episode stuck with her even after she returned to Ohio, where she now works for a university. When she read a Times article in May about the Republican nominee\u2019s treatment of women, she was struck by Ms. Taggart\u2019s recollection of being kissed on the mouth by Mr. Trump. \u201cI was upset that it had happened to other people, but also took some comfort in knowing I wasn\u2019t the only one he had done it to,\u201d said Ms. Crooks, who reached out to The Times to share her story. Both Ms. Leeds and Ms. Crooks say they support Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for president, and Ms. Crooks has made contributions of less than $200 to President Obama and Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Crooks was initially reluctant to go public with her story, but felt compelled to talk about her experience. \u201cPeople should know,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump, \u201cthis behavior is pervasive and it is real. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628491.5033479}
