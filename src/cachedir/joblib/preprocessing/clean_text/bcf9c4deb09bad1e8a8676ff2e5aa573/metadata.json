His toilet is a bucket, and when he and his wife need to refill their water jugs, they drive their creaky green Jeep a mile down the mountain and into town. Most people are kind, but the other day someone called them \u201chomeless vagrant beggars,\u201d Mr. Babbitt said. \u201cYes, we\u2019re homeless,\u201d he said, sitting in the shade of his camper here in the Arapaho National Forest. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not vagrants. No, we\u2019re not beggars. We just barely are making it. What you see is by the grace of God. \u201d To millions of adventurers and campers, America\u2019s national forests are a boundless backyard for hiking trips, rafting, hunting and mountain biking. But for thousands of homeless people and   wanderers, they have become a retreat of last resort. Forest law enforcement officers say they are seeing more dislocated people living off the land, often driven there by drug and alcohol addiction, mental health problems, lost jobs or scarce housing in costly mountain towns. And as officers deal with more emergency calls, drug overdoses, illegal fires and trash piles deep in the woods, tensions are boiling in places like Nederland that lie on the fringes of the United States\u2019 forests and loosely patrolled public lands. \u201cThe anger is palpable,\u201d said Hansen Wendlandt, the pastor at the Nederland Community Presbyterian Church. Some residents have begun taking photographs of hitchhikers or videotaping confrontations with homeless people camping in the woods and posting them online, including on a private Facebook page created recently called Peak to Peak Forest Watch. Some say the campers have cursed at them for driving past without picking them up, or yelled at them while they were cycling or hiking. They say they no longer feel comfortable in some parts of the woods. But as a homeless man named Julian, 30, hiked down from the hills and into Nederland one rainy afternoon, guitar and knapsack slung on his back, he said a passing driver yelled at him to get out of town. He said he, too, felt uncomfortable and was heading toward Estes Park, Colo. then on to Oregon. He did not give his last name because he said he did not want friends and family reading that he was homeless. Mr. Wendlandt serves lunch and hands out socks to needy campers every Thursday. But he has stopped provisioning people with blankets and sleeping bags, worried that what seemed like compassion could be exacerbating a problem. A wildfire in July was a tipping point. Two men from Alabama pitched camp without permission on a privately owned hillside near Nederland, lit a campfire and read their Bibles, they told the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The men told officials they put some rocks on the fire to put it out, and though they discussed whether they should do more to smother it, they decided not to. One smoldering cigarette or lightning strike can ignite an entire hillside in the parched,   forests across the West, and officials say the campfire galloped away and burned 600 acres of canyons and forests around Nederland. It destroyed eight homes, including that of a fire captain. The two men who started the campfire, Jimmy Suggs and Zackary Kuykendall, were arrested and charged with   arson. The day before their arrest on July 10, the two men and a female companion  \u2014   who was not criminally charged  \u2014   happened across a reporter for The Boulder Daily Camera who was interviewing evacuees from the   fire. \u201cWe were pretty close,\u201d Mr. Suggs told the newspaper. \u201cIt looked like the whole mountain range was on fire. \u201d Citing the fire danger, some residents have asked the Forest Service to do what many cities have done in cracking down on the homeless: impose tighter rules on camping, or ban it in parts of the woods that have attracted the most people. The Forest Service says it is working with thin law enforcement resources. One officer is assigned to Boulder County, which encompasses Nederland and the Roosevelt and Arapaho National Forests, which dominate the western part of the county. The service is spending more and more of its budget fighting wildfires, and has pared back on filling some law enforcement posts, said Chris Boehm, the agency\u2019s acting deputy director for law enforcement and investigations. \u201cThere may be some regions where we have one officer assigned to an entire forest or area,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we want, but fires are expensive. \u201d The Nederland fire was one of a handful across the West in recent years that officials have blamed on transient campers. In Anchorage this May, officials said a   brush fire appeared to start in a homeless camp. In Northern Arizona, where a homeless man was sentenced to a year in prison in 2010 for accidentally igniting a   wildfire, officials stepped up patrols this summer to look for illegal fires set by people living in the woods. For years, people searching for solitude or without better options have retreated to live in the woods, in buses, vans, tents or other improvised shelters, their numbers swelling every summer and dwindling when the snow comes. But officials say public lands researchers are just beginning to study who lives there, and why. A 2015 survey of 290 law enforcement officers for the Forest Service found that officers in the Rocky Mountain West and Southwest encountered   campers most often. About half of the officers said the number of these   campers was on the rise, and only 2 percent said it had declined. (The rest said the number had either largely held steady or fluctuated.) Lee Cerveny, one of the researchers who conducted the survey, said it was unclear how many people might be living on public lands at any given time. \u201cWhat is happening, and why are we seeing more people living in the forests?\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. \u201d National parks place strict limits on camping, but in national forests and open spaces managed by the Bureau of Land Management, people can pitch tents just about anywhere camping is not prohibited. Many forests allow camping for only two weeks at a time. In 2015, the Forest Service handled 1, 014 episodes related to violations of those rules. Around Nederland, crime reports, medical emergencies, unattended fires and other calls for help and extra patrols have soared at three Forest Service areas popular with homeless campers. The Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office was called there 388 times last year, up from 213 in 2013, and officials attribute some of the rise to Colorado\u2019s reputation as a mecca for legal marijuana, and Nederland\u2019s embrace of retail marijuana dispensaries. Rick Dirr, the Nederland fire chief, said his largely volunteer firefighters no longer answer nighttime calls in the woods without a marshal or sheriff\u2019s officer as backup. He said he has faced down one camper who carried a butcher knife, and searched the woods for another man who had attacked his girlfriend. There was the boy who swallowed a heroin baggie, he recalled, and a man who was hit in the head with a shovel. Others just do not understand how the forest works, he said. He responded to a report of an illegal fire to find a teenage boy and his    sister alone at their campsite, bags of garbage everywhere. They and their parents had been living out of their car, and the father asked Chief Dirr when someone would come by for garbage pickup. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the things going on unseen in the woods. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628459.4024398}
