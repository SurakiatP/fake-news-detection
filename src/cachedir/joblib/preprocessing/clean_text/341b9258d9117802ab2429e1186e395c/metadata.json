Trump, unlike even other Republicans, has insulted veterans and used them as props to boost his campaign. \\nWith less than a week to go until the presidential election, Trump is back to his old dirty tricks with veterans. With Medal of Honor recipients seated behind him, Donald Trump tells supporters: \"I\\'m brave \u2014 financially brave.\" https://t.co/uWUUhCtQso pic.twitter.com/EDd7F0PLHT \\n\u2014 ABC News (@ABC) November 4, 2016 \\nThe Republican presidential candidate was listing the Medal of Honor recipients at the rally, when he stopped and said, \u201cOh, they\u2019re so much more brave than me. I wouldn\u2019t have done what they did.\u201d \\nBut, that self-deprecation didn\u2019t last long. \\n\u201cI\u2019m brave in other ways,\u201d he said at the rally in Selma, a town 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. \u201cI\u2019m brave \u2014 I\u2019m financially brave. Big deal, right? These are real brave.\u201d \\nMedal of Honor honorees are given their medals for demonstrating extraordinary valor in combat, under fire. By comparison Trump has always led a life of privilege, including the way he avoided being drafted to serve in Vietnam, by citing mysterious \u201cbone spurs\u201d that disqualified him from going into the armed forces. Coincidentally, those debilitating \u201cbone spurs\u201d never showed up on Trump\u2019s official medical records. \\nOther instances of Trump insulting the military include his attack on Khizr Khan, the father of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq. Trump claimed that he had suffered \u201csacrifices\u201d like the Khans as well, while building luxury apartments and hosting a reality TV show. \\nTrump insulted Senator John McCain, who spent years in a Vietnamese POW camp. When he disagreed with McCain, Trump said he liked soldiers \u201cwho don\u2019t get captured,\u201d spitting in the face of the hundreds of prisoners of war. \\nThe nominee also used veterans as human shields while he was feuding with Fox News. Trump claimed he was holding a fundraiser for veterans when he decided to boycott a primary debate co-moderated by Megyn Kelly. But it turned out he never bothered to donate the money he had promised veterans until he was publicly shamed on being a cheapskate by the Washington Post . \\nFeatured image via screen capture'"}, "time": 1742628385.7188187}
