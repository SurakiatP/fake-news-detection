Like whatever that perfume is that Elizabeth Taylor hawked. Oh, right: White Diamonds. Barbra Streisand sounded like diamonds. And porcelain and a freshly drawn bath and consomm\u00e9. The voice is 74. So maybe the carats are fewer, but so what? It remains The Voice. Thursday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, it never asked to be received in pity, graded on a curve or helped across the street. There was some nervousness beforehand that it would be somehow   \u2026     off. But no: On, on, on. For example, its owner continues to make the finale of \u201cDon\u2019t Rain on My Parade\u201d sound like a space shuttle leaving Earth, the gravitational force enough to yank what looked like a   crowd to its feet. That came well into the second act during a \u201cFunny Girl\u201d \u201cFunny Lady\u201d stretch, in which Ms. Streisand walked us through the films\u2019 plots, while movie clips played on screen behind her. We didn\u2019t need any of that, but it made a kind of sense. This wasn\u2019t a star doing battle with a former self. It was a woman having fun with the past. Backed by an elastic band and aided by teleprompters, she spent a lot of her more than two hours onstage explaining the stories behind songs and performances and album covers. Her \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d soundtrack  \u2014   the   movie of 1976, by the way  \u2014   has that great image of a shirtless Kris Kristofferson palming the head of a shirtless Ms. Streisand, their mouths almost meeting, their hunger mutual. Staring up at that cover, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering what I was wearing during this shoot, it was musk. \u201d For well north of two hours, Ms. Streisand was like that: amusing,   at home. Before her encore, she chided us for keeping us from her dinner: \u201cMy pizza\u2019s getting cold!\u201d People would shout compliments or requests, and she\u2019d talk back. Early on, after \u201cEverything,\u201d from \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d she said, \u201cThere\u2019s just one more thing I want\u201d  \u2014   which turned into an endorsement for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy. Before doing \u201cPure Imagination,\u201d Gene Wilder\u2019s song from \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d she offered environmental entreaties that made you think she was going to do \u201cMercy Mercy Me\u201d instead. When it was over, she said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t vote for someone who believes climate change is a hoax,\u201d referring, presumably, to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponent, Donald J. Trump. So the arena became Ms. Streisand\u2019s living room, her audience became guests, and stage patter sometimes took cozy TED Talk turns. Meanwhile, the people in the front rows leapt up so often it was fair to ask whether she was delivering a State of the Union speech too. Ms. Streisand sang about two dozen songs  \u2014   the ones you\u2019d expect (\u201cPeople,\u201d \u201cEvergreen,\u201d lots of Stephen Sondheim) and a few, like \u201cPure Imagination,\u201d which you wouldn\u2019t. That one is on her new duets record, \u201cEncore,\u201d which comes out later this month and has her singing with stars from Melissa McCarthy and Anne Hathaway to Antonio Banderas and Chris Pine. (Her partner on \u201cPure Imagination\u201d is Seth MacFarlane.) Ms. Streisand introduced a little highlight reel from those recording sessions and eventually unveiled the actor Patrick Wilson to accompany her on \u201cLoving You\u201d from Mr. Sondheim\u2019s \u201cPassion,\u201d a number that required some acting from Mr. Wilson. He had to play both an ambivalent lover and a man who made perfect sense belting opposite Ms. Streisand. Mission accomplished. Whatever awe he had, he kept tucked away along with the tie he didn\u2019t wear with his black suit. Jamie Foxx arrived a few songs later, all awe. The crowd went cuckoo for him, and he went cuckoo for her, partly while impersonating Quincy Jones paying Ms. Streisand\u2019s derri\u00e8re a hilarious compliment. They sang \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d in a way that was more muscular than beautiful, their clasped hands making a better connection than their voices. The climb has rarely sounded so literal. But when they got to the top, the audience got up to cheer for them. So what was this show? I mean, besides a pleasure to behold. Officially, it\u2019s part of a   tour with a mouthful of a title, \u201cBarbra: The Music  \u2026     the Mem\u2019ries  \u2026     the Magic! ,\u201d that salutes six decades of albums. (\u201cEncore\u201d is her 35th studio record.) So in many ways this is a celebration of endurance, as opposed to a night of camp or even campiness. You need an \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d or \u201cHave I Stayed Too Long at the Fair\u201d for that, songs that would have been the equivalent of that thing Hulk Hogan would do where he\u2019d put his hand to his ear so we would cheer louder to amplify his triumph. Have I stayed too long? No, Barbra. Absolutely not! She really is too dignified to beg. As it was, she included \u201cNo More Tears (Enough Is Enough),\u201d the torch song she sang with Donna Summer, which   into a disco anthem. That came last in a medley that included \u201cStoney End\u201d and \u201cWoman in Love,\u201d and Ms. Streisand mostly vamped while her three very good backup vocalists did their thing at her side. Ms. Streisand has had a career like nobody else\u2019s. She remains this emblem of volition and charisma and power  \u2014   the movie star who sings, the singer who acts, the female director who was made to suffer for daring to do what men had always done. She could have spent the night doing nothing but   and no one would have minded. But it\u2019s funny: You don\u2019t go to a Streisand show purely for nostalgia, purely for \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d as much as to witness a great performer in her current formidable state. Nostalgia has always been built into her catalog. But can she make the distant past vital again? She tried to connect before to now. Her antidote to Mr. Trump, for instance, was \u201cPeople. \u201d Which is to say that it\u2019s not an artistically ambitious show. Its star, alas, is set in her ways. But those ways are what some people expect to see. We are at a new place with superstardom and age, though. Certain women of the    era can now seemingly go on forever. Their fame, in part, resides with an instrument that\u2019s been kept in astounding shape. Some of the nation is still recovering from Aretha Franklin\u2019s shedding a fur coat and bringing down the house in January at the Kennedy Center Honors. She and Ms. Streisand were born a month apart, and this sort of sustained virtuosity feels special among singers of their stature. Neither is the master of phrasing she once was. But what they now lack in contour (Ms. Streisand has even acquired a touch of Ms. Franklin\u2019s rasp) they make up for in dynamism. These two very different women are still giving everything they\u2019ve got. And that\u2019s enough. We came to Barclays to hear amazement as opposed to see a spectacle. Although the sight of Ms. Streisand singing \u201cPapa, Can You Hear Me\u201d from \u201cYentl\u201d while appearing to catch the holy spirit, before the end of the first act, was quite something. The power she summoned pimpled the skin and dampened the eyes. I don\u2019t know if Papa could hear this woman, but certainly heaven could.'"}, "time": 1742564126.740389}
