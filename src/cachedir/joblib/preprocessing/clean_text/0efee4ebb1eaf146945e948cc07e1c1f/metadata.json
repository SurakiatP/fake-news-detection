At a special Tuesday matinee,   supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2, 700  \u2014   and status as \u201cevent chair\u201d on offer for $100, 000  \u2014   the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. \u201cI cry every time,\u201d she said, after embracing the show\u2019s creator,   Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her \u201cHamilton\u201d bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show\u2019s signature numbers. \u201cAs Washington tells us, history\u2019s eyes are on us,\u201d she said at one point, invoking \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes On You. \u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not throw away our shot,\u201d she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show\u2019s most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause  \u2014   \u201cthe only thing,\u201d President Obama has joked, \u201cthat Dick Cheney and I agree on. \u201d The president headlined a Democratic   last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr. is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his   Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. \u201cAre you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who\u2019s building bridges?\u201d asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony   show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. \u201cRight now,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to hear from the 45th president. \u201d Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show\u2019s final number, \u201cWho Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,\u201d and the meaning of legacy. \u201cIt really is true that it matters whose stories are told,\u201d she said, \u201cand heard. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561698.2634897}
