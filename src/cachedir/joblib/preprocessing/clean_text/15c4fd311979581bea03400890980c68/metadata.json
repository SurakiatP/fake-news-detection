He was 68. The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to Gapminder, a foundation he established to generate and disseminate demystified data using images. Even before \u201c \u201d entered the lexicon, Dr. Rosling was echoing former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s maxim that everyone is entitled to his own opinions but not to his own facts. \u201cHe challenged the whole world\u2019s view of development with his amazing teaching skills,\u201d Isabella Lovin, Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister, said in a statement. On Twitter, Bill Gates remembered Dr. Rosling as a \u201cgreat friend, educator and true inspiration. \u201d A   \u201cedutainer,\u201d Dr. Rosling captivated vast audiences in TED Talks  \u2014   beginning a decade ago in front of live audiences and later viewed online by millions  \u2014   and on television documentaries like the BBC\u2019s \u201cThe Joy of Stats\u201d in 2010. Inviting animated visualizations and prosaic props (like apples and colorful Lego plastic blocks) defined him as a funky philosopher rather than a geeky professor. \u201cI produce a road map for the modern world,\u201d he told The Economist in 2010. \u201cWhere people want to drive is up to them. But I have the idea that if they have a proper road map and know what the global realities are, they\u2019ll make better decisions. \u201d In Dr. Rosling\u2019s version of those realities, the traditional divide between   and industrialized nations had become anachronistic, since so many countries were undergoing development, with some in Asia improving faster than some in Europe. He considered that five billion people continued to head toward healthier lives while one billion remained mired in poverty and disease that progress toward health and wealth had contributed to climate change and that the world was so poorly governed that possibilities to improve it abounded. \u201cI\u2019m not an optimist,\u201d Dr. Rosling once said. \u201cI\u2019m a very serious possibilist. \u201d He predicted that the United Nations\u2019 goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 was attainable because the tools to do so had been identified and the share of people living in that condition had already declined by more than half in 25 years. He also argued vigorously that overpopulation would no longer be problematic as the world grew wealthier and fertility rates declined. \u201cThere are so many who think that death keeps control of population growth,\u201d he said in an interview with The Guardian in 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s just wrong!\u201d He told The Economist: \u201cThe only way to reach sustainable population levels is to improve public health. Child survival is the new green. \u201d As a medical doctor, epidemiologist and academic, but with the flair of a seasoned performer (he once demonstrated his expertise as a sword swallower) he delivered counterintuitive factoids, accused advocates of tweaking statistics to advance their own causes, and debunked misapprehensions about the third world  \u2014   although not every expert concurred. He pointed out that Sweden had more children per woman than Iran, that Shanghai was just as wealthy and healthy as the Netherlands, and that the world\u2019s average life expectancy of 71 years was now closer to the highest (84 in Japan) than to the lowest (49 in Swaziland). \u201cThey just make it about us and them the West and the rest,\u201d Dr. Rosling told the journal Nature in December. \u201cHow could anyone hope to solve problems if they didn\u2019t understand the different challenges faced, for example, by Congolese subsistence farmers far from paved roads and Brazilian street vendors in urban favelas?\u201d Hans Gosta Rosling was born in Uppsala on July 27, 1948. His father was a coffee roaster. He studied statistics and medicine at Uppsala University and public health at St. John\u2019s Medical College in Bangalore, India, where he received his medical degree in 1976. In 1979, he and his wife, the former Agneta Thordeman, whom he met while she was studying to be a nurse, moved to Mozambique with their two young children. He was delivering on a pledge he had made years earlier to Eduardo Mondlane, the founder of the Mozambican Liberation Front, to help provide health services when the country became independent. Mr. Mondlane was killed in 1969, six years before independence was granted by Portugal. Dr. Rosling served as district medical officer in a northern province. He was the sole doctor for a population of 300, 000. His investigation of a paralytic disease called konzo in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was determined to be caused by ingesting naturally occurring cyanide in cassava roots, earned him a doctorate from Uppsala University. In addition to his wife, a pediatrician and researcher, he is survived by two sons, Ola and Magnus a daughter, Anna and a brother, Mats. With his son Ola and his    Anna Rosling Ronnlund, Dr. Rosling established Gapminder in 2006 while he was a professor of global health at the Karolinska Institute, the medical university outside Stockholm. The foundation aims to chart trends and fight what it calls \u201cdevastating ignorance with   worldviews everyone can understand. \u201d It derived its name from the London Underground\u2019s recorded warnings to passengers to \u201cmind the gap\u201d between a subway car and the platform. Gapminder\u2019s data images are designed to evoke the divide between statistics and the misleading ways in which they are sometimes interpreted. \u201cIt\u2019s like the emperor\u2019s new clothes, and I\u2019m the little child saying: \u2018He\u2019s nude! He\u2019s nude! \u2019\u201d Dr. Rosling told The Guardian. Brandishing his bubble chart graphics during TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) Talks, Dr. Rosling often capsulized the macroeconomics of energy and the environment in a favorite anecdote about the day a washing machine was delivered to his family\u2019s   flat. \u201cMy mother explained the magic with this machine the very, very first day,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe said: \u2018Now Hans, we have loaded the laundry. The machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.\u2019 Because this is the magic: You load the laundry, and what do you get out of the machine? You get books out of the machines, children\u2019s books. And Mother got time to read to me. \u201d \u201cThank you, industrialization,\u201d Dr. Rosling said. \u201cThank you, steel mill. And thank you, chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563025.1830342}
