He cowed manufacturers into shifting their investments from Mexico to the United States. He told Mexican leaders that he would cancel the trade agreement and levy punishing tariffs unless they capitulated to his demands in overhauling it. So, when a draft letter suggesting a softening of his views began circulating among members of Congress this week, Mexicans expressed a range of reactions, from welcome relief to cool, wonky reason to dark mistrust. The draft letter, signed by the acting United States Trade Representative, Stephen Vaughn, seemed to propose keeping much of the agreement in place. The language was bureaucratic and technical, devoid of the emotion and invective that has characterized many of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Nafta, which he has described as \u201cthe worst trade deal\u201d ever signed by the United States. Some Mexicans welcomed the shift in tone and viewed the document, however provisional, as a constructive step in the right direction. \u201cThe tone has changed and that should calm us all,\u201d Fernando Ruiz, head of the Mexican Council for Foreign Trade, Investment and Technology, said Friday. The generic nature of the document \u201chelps cool the waters, it gives us more tranquillity rather than uncertainty. \u201d But some also warned that the draft was by nature bureaucratic, not political. They cautioned that with months to go before negotiations could begin, and with the mercurial Mr. Trump at the helm, anything could happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really has a clue what\u2019s really going to happen,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Barrios G\u00f3mez, a former Mexican congressman and the president of the Mexico Image Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting Mexico\u2019s reputation abroad. \u201cThere\u2019s this entire optimism that the wolf isn\u2019t going to blow the house down, but it could be toppled over in one tweet. \u201d Trump administration officials seemed to encourage this caution, perhaps as a negotiating ploy, emphasizing that the draft was just a draft. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, even went so far as to seemingly disavow the document as a reflection of the administration\u2019s objectives in the negotiation. \u201cThat is not a statement of administration policy,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThat is not an accurate statement of where we are at this time. \u201d Mr. Spicer\u2019s comments only replenished Mexico\u2019s deep reservoir of wariness and resentment toward Mr. Trump, sentiments that took root with force starting with the debut of his presidential campaign, when he took shots at Mexican immigrants. His vow to build a border wall  \u2014   and make Mexico pay for it  \u2014   became a rhetorical motif of his candidacy, firing up his supporters and inflaming   sentiment. And he has long accused Mexico of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the United States under Nafta, or the North American Free Trade Agreement. This history has given some officials and business leaders pause when considering the draft letter this week. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to let our guard down,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Kalach, who is in charge of trade issues for Mexico\u2019s main business alliance, the Business Coordinating Council. The Mexican business community, he added, was preparing for all negotiating proposals. The administration of Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, did not comment publicly on the letter. The Mexican government has said it is committed to preserving Nafta and protecting the $1. 4 billion in bilateral trade that crosses the border every day, though it has said it is open to modifications. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration has argued that any renegotiation of the deal be accompanied by talks over a range of bilateral issues, including border security and immigration. Mexican officials and business leaders have also said that if negotiations go downhill, they are prepared to walk away from Nafta. In the meantime  \u2014   mindful of Mr. Trump\u2019s   threats  \u2014   Mexico has been exploring new trade deals with other countries and updating old ones. Several seasoned trade specialists in Mexico, among them former government officials, said the document circulating this week was encouraging. \u201cI think it\u2019s good news for Mexico,\u201d said Beatriz Leycegui, a partner at the consultancy SAI and a former undersecretary for foreign trade in Mexico who participated in the Nafta negotiations. \u201cI think this is a responsible letter, something that is indicating a willingness to cooperate, to work together in the competitiveness of the region, and this is extremely important for Mexico at a time when Mexico needs to have clarity and make progress on this front. \u201d Others, however, said there were items in the draft letter that could be particularly difficult for Mexico and could provoke a strong response here. Antonio   a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group, an international consulting firm, and a former head of economic affairs at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said he had concerns about several items in the letter, including a proposal for new tariffs if a surge of imports from one country threatens a domestic industry in another  \u2014   which could be imposed if, say, one country\u2019s goods flooded the other\u2019s markets. \u201cIt could lead to    protectionism,\u201d Mr.   said. \u201cThat particular issue would keep me up at night. \u201d Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, professor of international studies at CIDE, a Mexico City university, and head of a consultancy focused on international commerce, said she found nothing in the letter that was \u201cout of context, aberrant or particularly worrying. \u201d But she was troubled by Mr. Spicer\u2019s comments. \u201cBecause when are we really going to know what the stance of the White House is?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat is where all the uncertainty lies, more so than in the substance of this draft. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563176.4300106}
