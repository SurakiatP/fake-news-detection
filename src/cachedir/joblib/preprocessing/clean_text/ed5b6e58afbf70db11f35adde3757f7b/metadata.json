(VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey   \\nFor decades, gun-toting, ammosexual Right Wing Nut Jobs have claimed that the government is going to take their guns away. \\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has been preaching this kind of crap \u201cnews\u201d for years, and blaming it on Democratic presidents. It turns out that the organization has finally admitted that this is a lie. \\nWhen asked about it, President Barack Obama said : \u201cI\u2019m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I\u2019ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.\u201d \\nThe NRA responded with : \u201cCongress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms \u2014 from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama\u2019s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a \u2018pen and phone\u2019 to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent.\u201d \\nEven if Congress and the president were able to pass such a law, the Supreme Court would rule it unconstitutional if challenged since they would be going against the Second Amendment. \\nNot only has the NRA lied about taking away guns, but Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is spreading that BS as well. He said this about it back in May: \u201cHillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to abolish it. Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take the bullets away. She wants to take it.\u201d \\nAmericans really need to stop listening to these fear-mongering idiots. No one is coming after your guns. We need to keep guns out of the hands of people who abuse them and commit crimes with them. \\nHere is a clip from The Daily Show about Obama\u2019s last batch of gun control executive orders : \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .
