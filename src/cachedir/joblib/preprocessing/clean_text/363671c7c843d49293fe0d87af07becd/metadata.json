I think that was a big mistake,\u201d then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. \\n\u201cAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,\u201d she said. \\nUntil Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaper\u2019s office in Brooklyn. \\nChomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. \\nSpeaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that \u201canyone could support the idea \u2014 offered by a national political leader, no less \u2014 that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.\u201d \\nThe interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. \\nThen-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the \u201cpower of democracy,\u201d but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel\u2019s existence and espoused violence. \\nThat day in September 2006, Clinton made \u201codd and controversial comments,\u201d all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky \u201cheld onto all these years.\u201d \\n\u201cI went to my bosses at the time,\u201d Chomsky told the Observer. \u201cThe Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody \u2014 even a direct quote from anyone \u2014 in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn\u2019t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.\u201d \\nThe latest revelation comes after repeated accusations by the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump who says that the media and the political establishment have rigged the 2016 election against him. \\nIt would seem that the crooked Mrs Clinton thinks nothing of rigging any election to suit her agenda.'"}, "time": 1742628369.6261103}
