He was a dedicated employee of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice  \u2014   known abroad as the religious police  \u2014   serving with the   troops protecting the Islamic kingdom from Westernization, secularism and anything but the most conservative Islamic practices. Some of that resembled ordinary police work: busting drug dealers and bootleggers in a country that bans alcohol. But the men of \u201cthe Commission,\u201d as Saudis call it, spent most of their time maintaining the puritanical public norms that set Saudi Arabia apart not only from the West, but from most of the Muslim world. A key offense was ikhtilat, or unauthorized mixing between men and women. The kingdom\u2019s clerics warn that it could lead to fornication, adultery, broken homes, children born of unmarried couples and   societal collapse. For years, Mr. Ghamdi stuck with the program and was eventually put in charge of the Commission for the region of Mecca, Islam\u2019s holiest city. Then he had a reckoning and began to question the rules. So he turned to the Quran and the stories of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, considered the exemplars of Islamic conduct. What he found was striking and life altering: There had been plenty of mixing among the first generation of Muslims, and no one had seemed to mind. So he spoke out. In articles and television appearances, he argued that much of what Saudis practiced as religion was in fact Arabian cultural practices that had been mixed up with their faith. There was no need to close shops for prayer, he said, nor to bar women from driving, as Saudi Arabia does. At the time of the Prophet, women rode around on camels, which he said was far more provocative than veiled women piloting S. U. V. s. He even said that while women should conceal their bodies, they needed to cover their faces only if they chose to do so. And to demonstrate the depth of his own conviction, Mr. Ghamdi went on television with his wife, Jawahir, who smiled to the camera, her face bare and adorned with a dusting of makeup. It was like a bomb inside the kingdom\u2019s religious establishment, threatening the social order that granted prominence to the sheikhs and made them the arbiters of right and wrong in all aspects of life. He threatened their control. Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s colleagues at work refused to speak to him. Angry calls poured into his cellphone and anonymous death threats hit him on Twitter. Prominent sheikhs took to the airwaves to denounce him as an ignorant upstart who should be punished, tried  \u2014   and even tortured. I had come to Saudi Arabia to explore Wahhabism, the   Saudi strain of Sunni Islam that is often blamed for fueling intolerance around the world  \u2014   and nurturing terrorism. I spent weeks in Riyadh, Jidda and other cities speaking with sheikhs, imams, religious professors and many others as I tried to peel back the layers of a closed and private society. For the Western visitor, Saudi Arabia is a baffling mix of modern urbanism, desert culture and the   effort to adhere to a rigid interpretation of scriptures that are more than 1, 000 years old. It is a kingdom flooded with oil wealth, skyscrapers, S. U. V.s and shopping malls, where questions about how to invest money, interact with   or even treat cats are answered with quotes from the Quran or stories about the Prophet Muhammad. Religion is woven into daily life. Banks employ clerics to ensure they follow Shariah law. Mannequins lack heads because of religious sensitivities to showing the human form. And schoolbooks detail how boys should cut their hair, how girls should cover their bodies and how often a person should trim his or her pubic hair. While Islam is meant to be a complete program for human life, interpretation is key when it comes to practices. The Saudi interpretation is steeped in the conservatism of central Arabia, especially regarding relations between women and men. In public, most women wear baggy black gowns called abayas, designed to hide their forms, as well as veils that cover their hair and faces, with only thin slits for their eyes. Restaurants have separate sections for \u201cfamilies,\u201d meaning groups that include women, and for \u201csingles,\u201d which means men. Many Saudis mix in private, and men and women can usually meet in hotel lobbies with little problem. Others do not want to mix and see gender segregation as part of their cultural identity. In some conservative circles, men go their whole lives without seeing the faces of women other than their immediate family  \u2014   even their brothers\u2019 wives. Inside the kingdom, all other religions are suppressed. Not only are there no public churches, there is no Church\u2019s Chicken. (It is called Texas Chicken in the kingdom.) When asked about this, Saudis deny that this reflects intolerance. They compare their country to the Vatican, saying it is a unique place for Muslims, with its own rules. Officials I spoke with were upset by the kingdom\u2019s increasingly troubled reputation abroad and said over and over that they supported \u201cmoderate Islam. \u201d But what exactly did they mean by \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d? Unpacking that term made it clear how wide the values gap is between Saudi Arabia and its American ally. The kingdom\u2019s \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d publicly beheads criminals, punishes apostates and prevents women from traveling abroad without the permission of a male \u201cguardian. \u201d Don\u2019t even ask about gay rights. Instead of calls for jihad, what I heard were religious leaders insisting that the faithful obey the state. The Saudi royal family is terrified that the jihadist fervor inflaming the region will catch fire at home and threaten its control. So it has marshaled the state\u2019s religious apparatus to condemn the jihadists and proclaim the religious duty of obedience to the rulers. And while it was once common, I heard little disparaging talk about Christians and Jews, although it was open season on Shiites, whose faith is frequently bashed as part of the rivalry with Iran. The only Saudis who suggested I was an infidel were children. Once, a Saudi journalist proudly introduced me to his    daughter, whom he had put in private school so she could study English. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d I asked. \u201cMy name is Dana,\u201d she said. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201cI am 9. \u201d \u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201d Confused, she switched to Arabic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that in Saudi Arabia,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an infidel holiday. \u201d Shocked, her father asked where she had learned that, and she fetched one of her   textbooks, flipping to a lesson that listed \u201cforbidden holidays\u201d: Christmas and Thanksgiving. Birthdays had been part of the same lesson. Another time, I met a religious friend for coffee, and he brought his two young sons. When the call to prayer sounded, my friend went to pray. His sons, confused that I did not follow, looked at me   and asked, \u201cAre you an infidel?\u201d The first thing many Saudis will tell you about Wahhabism is that it does not exist. \u201cThere is no such thing as Wahhabism,\u201d Hisham   told me the first time we met. \u201cThere is only true Islam. \u201d The irony is that fewer people have a purer Wahhabi pedigree than Mr. Sheikh, a direct descendant of the cleric who started it all. In the early 18th century, Sheikh Mohammed ibn   called for a religious reformation in central Arabia. Feeling that Islam had been corrupted by practices like the veneration of saints and tombs, he called for the stripping away of \u201cinnovations\u201d and the return to what he considered the pure religion. He formed an alliance with a chieftain named Mohammed ibn Saud that has underpinned the area\u2019s history ever since. Then the Saud family assumed political leadership while Sheikh   and his descendants gave legitimacy to their rule and managed religious affairs. That mix proved potent among the warring Arabian tribes, as Wahhabi clerics provided justification for military conquest in some cases: Those who resisted the House of Saud were not just enemies, but infidels who deserved the sword. The first Saudi state was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1818, and attempts to build another failed until the early 20th century, when King Abdulaziz   undertook a campaign that put him in control of most of the Arabian Peninsula. But the king faced a choice: to continue expansionary jihad, which would have invited conflict with the British, or to build a modern state. He chose the latter, even crushing a group of his own warriors who refused to stop fighting. Since then, the alliance between the royal family and the clerics has endured, although the tensions between the quest for ideological purity and the exigencies of modern statehood remain throughout Saudi society. Fast forward to 2016, and the main players have transformed because of time and oil wealth. The royal family has grown from a group of scrappy desert dwellers into a sprawling clan awash in palaces and private jets. The Wahhabi establishment has evolved from a puritan reform movement into a bloated state bureaucracy. It consists of universities that churn out graduates trained in religious disciplines a legal system in which judges apply Shariah law a council of top clerics who advise the king a network of offices that dispense fatwas, or religious opinions a force of religious police who monitor public behavior and tens of thousands of mosque imams who can be tapped to deliver the government\u2019s message from the pulpit. The call to prayer sounds five times a day from mosques and inside of malls so clearly that many Saudis use it to organize their days. \u201cLet\u2019s meet after the sunset prayer,\u201d they would tell me, sometimes unsure what time that was. So I installed an app on my phone that let me look up prayer times and buzzed when the call sounded. And so it was, after the sunset prayer, that I met Mr. Sheikh, a proud   descendant of Mohammed ibn  . He was a portly man of 42 who wore a long white robe and covered his head with a schmag, or checkered cloth. His beard was long and he had no mustache, in imitation of the Prophet Muhammad, and he squinted through reading glasses perched on his nose while peering at his iPhone. We sat on purple couches in the   lobby of a Riyadh hotel and shared dates and coffee while he answered my questions about Islam in Saudi Arabia. \u201cI am an   person,\u201d he told me early on. It was clear that he hoped I would become a Muslim. His life had been defined by the religious establishment, but he proved to be a case study in the complexity of terms like \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d in Saudi Arabia. He had memorized the Quran at a young age and studied with prominent clerics before completing his doctorate in Shariah, with his thesis on how technology changed the application of Shariah. Now he had a successful career and a host of religious jobs. He trained judges for the Shariah courts, advised the minister of Islamic affairs, wrote studies for the clerics who advise the king and served on the Shariah board of the Medgulf insurance company. On Fridays, he preached at a mosque near his mother\u2019s house and welcomed visitors who came to see his uncle, the grand mufti. He had traveled extensively abroad, and when he found out I was American he told me that he loved the United States. He had visited Oregon, New York, Massachusetts and Los Angeles. On one trip, he visited a synagogue. On another, a black church. He had also visited an Amish community, which he found fascinating. A relative of his lived in Montgomery, Ala. and he had spent happy months there, often visiting the local Islamic center. The hardest part, he said, was Ramadan, because there were few eateries open late that did not have bars. \u201cAll I had was IHOP,\u201d he said. He said Islam did not forbid doing business or having friendships with Christians or Jews. He opposed Shiite beliefs and practices, but said it was wrong to do as the extremists of the Islamic State and declare takfir, or infidelity, on entire groups. When it came to birthdays, which many Saudi clerics condemn, he said he did not oppose them, although his wife did, so their children did not go to birthday parties. But they had celebrations of their own, he said, showing me a video on his phone of his family gathered around a cake bearing the face of his son Abdullah, 15, who had just memorized the Quran. They lit sparklers and cheered, but did not sing. He was on the fence about music, which many Wahhabis also forbid. He said he had no problem with background music in restaurants, but opposed music that put listeners in a state similar to drunkenness, causing them to jump around and bang their heads. \u201cWe have something better,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can listen to the Quran. \u201d Since much of what differentiates Saudi Arabia is the place of women, I wanted to talk to a conservative Saudi woman, which was tricky because most would refuse to meet with any unrelated male  \u2014   let alone a   correspondent from the United States. So I had a female Saudi colleague, Sheikha   contact Mr. Sheikh\u2019s wife, Meshael, who said she would meet me. But I asked Mr. Sheikh\u2019s permission. \u201cShe is very busy,\u201d he said, and changed the subject. So Ms. Sheikh met Ms. Dosary at a women\u2019s coffee shop in Riyadh, where women can uncover their faces and hair. Her marriage to Mr. Sheikh had been arranged, she said. They met once for less than an hour before they were married, and he had seen her face. \u201cIt was hard for me to look at him or to check him out as I was so shy,\u201d she said. They were cousins. He was 21 she was 16. He agreed to her condition for marriage that she continue her studies, and she was now working on a doctorate in education while raising their four children. She disputed the Western idea that Saudi women lack rights. \u201cThey believe we are oppressed because we don\u2019t drive, but that is incorrect,\u201d Ms. Sheikh said, adding that driving would be a hassle in Riyadh\u2019s snarled traffic. \u201cHere women are respected and honored in many ways you don\u2019t find in the West,\u201d she continued. She, too, is a descendant of Sheikh   and said proudly that her grandfather had founded the kingdom\u2019s religious police. \u201cPraise God that we have the Commission to protect our country,\u201d she said. The primacy of Islam in Saudi life has led to a huge religious sphere that extends beyond the state\u2019s official clerics. Public life is filled with celebrity sheikhs whose moves, comments and conflicts Saudis track just as Americans follow Hollywood actors. There are old sheikhs and young sheikhs, sheikhs who used to be extremists and now preach tolerance, sheikhs whom women find sexy, and a black sheikh who has compared himself to Barack Obama. In the kingdom\u2019s   society, they compete for followers on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. The grand mufti, the state\u2019s highest religious official, has a regular television show, too. Their embrace of technology runs counter to the history of Wahhabi clerics rejecting nearly everything new as a threat to the religion. Formerly banned items include the telegraph, the radio, the camera, soccer, girls\u2019 education and televisions, whose introduction in the 1960s caused outrage. For Saudis, trying to navigate what is permitted, halal, and what is not, haram, can be challenging. So they turn to clerics for fatwas, or nonbinding religious rulings. While some may get a lot of attention  \u2014   as when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran called for killing the author Salman Rushdie  \u2014   most concern the details of religious practice. Others can reveal the sometimes comical contortions that clerics go through to reconcile modernity with their understanding of religion. There was, for example, the cleric who appeared to call for the death of Mickey Mouse, then tried to backtrack. Another prominent cleric issued a clarification that he had not in fact forbidden     buffets. That same sheikh was recently asked about people taking photos with cats. He responded that the feline presence was irrelevant the photos were the problem. \u201cPhotography is not permitted unless necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cNot with cats, not with dogs, not with wolves, not with anything. \u201d The government has sought to control the flow of religious opinions with official fatwa institutions. But   fatwas have provoked laughter, too, like the fatwa calling spending money on Pokemon products \u201ccooperation in sin and transgression. \u201d While the government seeks to get more women into the work force, the state fatwa organization preaches on the \u201cdanger of women joining men in the workplace,\u201d which it calls \u201cthe reason behind the destruction of societies. \u201d And there are fatwas that arm extremists with religious justification. There is one fatwa, still available in English on a government website and signed by the previous grand mufti, that states, \u201cWhoever refuses to follow the straight path deserves to be killed or enslaved in order to establish justice, maintain security and peace and safeguard lives, honor and property. \u201d It goes on: \u201cSlavery in Islam is like a purifying machine or sauna in which those who are captured enter to wash off their dirt and then they come out clean, pure and safe, from another door. \u201d Once while we were having coffee, Mr. Sheikh answered his cellphone, listened seriously and issued a fatwa on the spot. He got such calls frequently. The query had been about where a pilgrim headed to Mecca had to don the white cloths of ritual purity  \u2014   an easy one. The answer, in this case, was Jidda. Others were harder, and he demurred if he was not sure. Once, a woman asked about fake eyelashes. He told her that he did not know, but thought about it later and decided they were fine, on one condition: \u201cthat there is no cheating involved. \u201d A woman, for example, could put them on before a man came to propose. \u201cAnd then after they get married, they\u2019re gone!\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not permitted. \u201d One Friday, Mr. Sheikh took me to see his uncle, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz  . We entered a vast reception hall near the mufti\u2019s house in Riyadh, with padded benches along the walls where a dozen bearded students sat. In the center, on a raised armchair, sat the mufti, his feet in brown socks and perched on a pillow. The students read religious texts, and the mufti interjected with commentary. He was 75, Mr. Sheikh said, and had been blind since age 14, when a German doctor carried out a failed operation on his eyes. Mr. Sheikh said I could ask him a question, so I asked how he responded to those who compared Wahhabism to the Islamic State. \u201cThat is all lies and slander. Daesh is an aggressive, tyrannous group that has no relation,\u201d he said, using another term for the Islamic State. After a pause, he asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a Muslim?\u201d I responded that I was from a Christian family. \u201cThe religion you follow has no source,\u201d he said, adding that I should accept the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s revelation. \u201cYour religion is not a religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, you will have to face God. \u201d The first time I met Mr. Ghamdi, 51, formerly of the religious police, was this year in a sitting room in his apartment in Jidda, the port city on the Red Sea. The room had been outfitted to look like a Bedouin tent. Burgundy fabric adorned the walls, gold tassels hung from the ceiling, and carpets covered the floor, to which Mr. Ghamdi pressed his forehead in prayer during breaks in our conversation. He spoke of how the world of sheikhs, fatwas and the meticulous application of religion to everything had defined his life. But that world  \u2014   his world  \u2014   had frozen him out. Little in his background suggested that he would become a religious reformer. While at a university, he quit a job at the customs office in the Jidda port because a sheikh told him that collecting duties was haram. After graduation, he studied religion in his spare time and handled international accounts for a government office  \u2014   a job requiring travel to   countries. \u201cThe clerics at that time were releasing fatwas that it was not right to travel to the countries of the infidels unless it was necessary,\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said. So he quit. Then he taught economics at a technical school in Saudi Arabia, but didn\u2019t like that it taught only capitalism and socialism. So he said he had added material on Islamic finance, but the students complained about the extra work, and he left. He finally landed a job that he felt was consistent with his religious convictions, as a member of the Commission in Jidda. Over the next few years, he transferred to Mecca and cycled through different positions. There were occasional prostitution cases, and the force sometimes caught sorcerers  \u2014   who can be beheaded if convicted in court. But he developed reservations about how the force worked. His colleagues\u2019 religious zeal sometimes led them to overreact, breaking into people\u2019s homes or humiliating detainees. \u201cLet\u2019s say someone drank alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not represent an attack on the religion, but they exaggerated in how they treated people. \u201d At one point, Mr. Ghamdi was assigned to review cases and tried to use his position to report abuses and force agents to return items they had wrongfully confiscated, he said. He recalled the case of an older, single man who was reported to receive two young women in his home on the weekends. Since the man did not pray at the mosque, his neighbors suspected he was up to no good, so the Commission raided the house and caught the man    \u2014   visiting with his daughters. \u201cOften, people were humiliated in inhuman ways, and that humiliation could cause hatred of religion,\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said. In 2005, the head of the Commission for the Mecca region died, and Mr. Ghamdi was promoted. It was a big job, with some 90 stations throughout a large, diverse area containing Islam\u2019s holiest sites. He did his best to keep up, while worrying that the Commission\u2019s focus was misguided. In private, he looked to the scriptures and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad for guidance on what was halal and what was haram, and he documented his findings. \u201cI was surprised because we used to hear from the scholars, \u2018Haram, haram, haram,\u2019 but they never talked about the evidence,\u201d he said. Realizing the gravity of such a conclusion for someone in his position, he stayed silent and filed the document away. But his conclusions would, soon, emerge. Around the time he was rethinking his worldview, King Abdullah, then the monarch, announced plans to open a   university, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, or Kaust. What shocked the kingdom\u2019s religious establishment was his decision to not segregate students by gender, nor impose a dress code on women. Kaust followed the precedent of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, which had also been shielded from clerical interference, highlighting one of the great contradictions of Saudi Arabia: Regardless of how much the royal family lauds its Islamic values, when it wants to earn money or innovate, it does not turn to the clerics for advice. It puts up a wall and locks them out. Most clerics kept quiet out of deference to the king. But one member of the top clerical body addressed the issue on a   show, warning of the dangers of mixed universities: sexual harassment men and women flirting and getting distracted from their studies husbands growing jealous of their wives rape. \u201cMixing has many corrupting factors, and its evil is great,\u201d said the cleric, Sheikh Saad   adding that if the king had known this was the plan, he would have stopped it. But mixing was in fact the king\u2019s idea, and he was not amused. He dismissed the sheikh with a royal decree. From his office in Mecca, Mr. Ghamdi watched, frustrated that the clerics were not backing a project he felt was good for the kingdom. So after praying about it, he retrieved his report and boiled it down to two long articles that were published in the newspaper Okaz in 2009. They were the first strikes in a yearslong battle between Mr. Ghamdi and the religious establishment. He followed with other articles, went on TV and faced off against other clerics who insulted him and marshaled their own evidence from the scriptures. His colleagues at the Commission shunned him, so he requested  \u2014   and was swiftly granted  \u2014   early retirement. Once off the force, he questioned other practices: forcing shops to close during prayer times and urging people to go to the mosque, requiring face veils, barring women from driving. Each comment lit a new inferno. A woman once asked him on Twitter if she could not only show her face, but also wear makeup. Sure, Mr. Ghamdi said, setting off new attacks. Then in 2014, he was to appear on a popular talk show, and the producers filmed a segment about him and his wife, who appeared with her face showing and said she supported him. Harsh responses came from the top of the religious establishment. Many attacked his religious credentials, saying he was not really a sheikh  \u2014   a dubious accusation since there is no standard qualification to be one. They targeted his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, too, saying he had no degree in religion and pointing out, correctly, that his doctorate was from Ambassador University Corporation, a diploma mill that gives degrees based on work experience \u201cin the Middle East. \u201d \u201cThere is no doubt that this man is bad,\u201d said Sheikh Saleh   a member of the top clerical body. \u201cIt is necessary for the state to assign someone to summon and torture him. \u201d The grand mufti addressed the issue on his   show, saying that the veil was \u201ca necessary order and an Islamic creation\u201d and calling on the kingdom\u2019s television channels to ban content that \u201ccorrupts the religion and the morals and values of society. \u201d If the clerical attacks on Mr. Ghamdi were loud, the blowback from society was more painful. His tribe issued a statement, disowning him and calling him \u201ctroubled and confused. \u201d His cellphone rang day and night with callers shouting at him. He came home to find graffiti on the wall of his house. And a group of men showed up at his door, demanding to \u201cmix\u201d with the family\u2019s women. His sons  \u2014   he has nine children  \u2014   called the police. Before the   Mr. Ghamdi had also delivered Friday sermons at a mosque in Mecca, earning a government stipend. But the congregation complained after he spoke out, and he was asked to stay home, later losing his pay. Mr. Ghamdi had not broken any laws and never faced legal action. But in Saudi Arabia\u2019s   society, the attacks echoed through his family. The relatives of his eldest son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e called off their wedding, not wanting to associate their family with his. \u201cAre you with your brother or with me?\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said his sister\u2019s husband had asked her. \u201cShe said, \u2018I am with my brother. \u2019\u201d They soon divorced. Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s son Ammar, 15, was taunted at school. Ammar said another boy had once asked him: \u201cHow did your mom go on TV? That\u2019s not right. You have no manners. \u201d So Ammar punched him. One evening in Jidda, a university professor invited me to his home for dinner. His wife, a doctor, joined us at the table, her hair covered with a stylish veil. They had recently been married and he joked that they were meant for each other because she was good at cooking and he was good at eating. His wife chuckled and gave him more soup. I asked about Mr. Ghamdi. \u201cFrom what I read and what I saw, I think he\u2019s right and he stood up for what he believes in,\u201d the professor said. \u201cI admire that. \u201d The problem, he said, is that tolerance for opposing views is not taught in Saudi society. \u201cEither follow what I say or I will classify you, I will hurt you, I will push you out of the discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is  . We have many people thinking in different ways. You can fight, but you have to live under the same roof. \u201d His wife had no problem with mixing or with women working, but did not like that Mr. Ghamdi had caused a scandal by making his views public. The royal family sets the rules, and it was inappropriate for subjects to publicly campaign for changes, she said. \u201cHe has to follow the ruler,\u201d she said. \u201cIf everyone just comes out with his own opinion, we\u2019ll be in chaos. \u201d After dinner, a young cleric who works for the security services dropped by. He, too, agreed with Mr. Ghamdi, but would not talk about it openly. The response, he said, is part of the deep conservatism in the clerical establishment that is impeding development. He often gave lectures to security officers, followed by discussions, he said, and a common question he heard was, \u201cIsn\u2019t the military uniform haram?\u201d Many Wahhabi clerics preach against resembling the infidels, leading to confusion. He believed that wearing uniforms was fine, and worried that such narrow thinking made people susceptible to extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s like in those American movies when they invent a robot and then they lose control and it attacks them and the remote control stops working,\u201d he said. The next day, the professor thanked me for my visit in a text message. \u201cI\u2019d like to remind u that any story that would uncover the source may hurt us. I trust your discretion,\u201d he wrote, followed by three flowers. All that was left, really, was to to speak with the Commission. What did its leaders and rank and file think about all of this? But for a force portrayed as   and all powerful, it proved surprisingly shy. I could not visit Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s former office because   are barred from entering Mecca. So I had multiple contacts ask for interviews with relatives who worked for the Commission, but they all declined to speak. I called the Commission\u2019s spokesman, who told me that he was traveling and then stopped answering my calls. I even dropped by the Commission\u2019s headquarters, a boxy,    building on a Riyadh highway between a gas station and a car dealership. Its website advertised open hours with the director, so I went to his office, through halls filled with bearded men milling about and slick banners proclaiming \u201cA Policy of Excellence\u201d and \u201cTogether Against Corruption. \u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t come today,\u201d the director\u2019s secretary told me. \u201cMaybe next week. \u201d On my way out, two men invited me into an office and served me coffee. \u201cHow do you like working for the Commission?\u201d I asked. \u201cEveryone who chooses this job loves it,\u201d one said. It was the work of \u201cthe entire Islamic nation,\u201d and it felt good \u201cto bring people from the darkness into the light. \u201d The other man had been on the force for 15 years and said he preferred working in the office. \u201cYou rest more in the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cOut there we have problems with people. They call us the religious police. Criminals! Thieves! You never get to rest out in the field. \u201d A scowling man appeared in the doorway and told me that I was not allowed to talk to anyone. The first man soon left. The second offered me more coffee, then tea, then forced me to take a bottle of water when I left. The first irony of Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s situation is that many Saudis, including members of the royal family and even important clerics, agree with him, although mostly in private. And public mixing of the sexes in some places  \u2014   hospitals, conferences and in Mecca during the pilgrimage  \u2014   is common. In some Saudi cities it is not uncommon to see women\u2019s faces, or even their hair. But there is a split in society between the conservatives who want to maintain what they consider the kingdom\u2019s pure Islamic identity and the liberals (in the Saudi context) who want more personal freedoms. Liberals make cases like Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s all the time. But sheikhs don\u2019t, which is why he was branded a traitor. The second irony is that this year, Saudi Arabia instituted some of the reform Mr. Ghamdi had called for. It had been a rough year for the Commission. A video went viral of a girl yelping as she was thrown to the ground outside a Riyadh mall during a confrontation with the Commission, her abaya flying over her head and exposing her legs and torso. For many Saudis, \u201cthe Nakheel Mall girl\u201d symbolized the Commission\u2019s overreach. Then the Commission arrested Ali   a popular talk show host who often criticized religious figures. Photos appeared online of Mr. Oleyani in handcuffs with bottles of liquor. The photos were clearly staged and apparently had been leaked as a form of character assassination. Many people were outraged. In April, the government responded with a surprise decree defanging the religious police. It denied them the power to arrest, question or pursue subjects, forced them to work with the police and advised them to be \u201cgentle and kind\u201d in their interactions with citizens. Mr. Ghamdi applauded the decision, although he remains an outcast, a sheikh whose positions rendered him unemployable in the Islamic kingdom. These days, he keeps a low profile because he still gets insults when he appears in public. He has no job, but publishes regular newspaper columns, mostly abroad. Near the end of our last conversation, his wife, Jawahir, entered the room, dressed in a black abaya, with her face showing. She shook my hand, exuding a cloud of fragrance, and sat next to her husband. The experience had changed her life in unexpected ways, she said. And like her husband, she had no regrets. \u201cWe sent our message, and the goal was not for us to keep appearing and to get famous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was to send a message to society that religion is not customs and traditions. Religion is something else. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563279.8152418}
