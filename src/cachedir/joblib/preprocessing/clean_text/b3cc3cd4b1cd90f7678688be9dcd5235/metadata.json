They\u2019re here. They\u2019re working their behind off. They do a lot of work the blacks and whites don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Barkley told host Stephen Colbert Thursday. Barkley later added that the undocumented family he spoke with while filming the show sees a stronger stance on illegal immigration under President Donald Trump. \u201cI asked them  \u2026    what\u2019s the difference between President Trump and President Obama? And they said, \u2018Well, there\u2019s a big difference.\u2019 Because under President Obama, they only got deported for felonies. With President Trump, they can even get deported for misdemeanors, so clearly that\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d he explained.
