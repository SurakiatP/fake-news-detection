S. gets it! \u201d[Among the threats made so far, should the president honor his election trail promise to quit the UN Paris climate agreement.  The U. S. will lose $6 trillion worth of jobs in \u201cclean\u201d energy. The U. S. will become a \u201crogue country\u201d. The U. S. will be removed from Angela Merkel\u2019s Weihnachtskarte list. The U. S. may become the victim of further weaponized handshakes and other typically Gallic \u201cyour mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries\u201d insults from prepubescent Mummy\u2019s little tough boy President Macron of France. The U. S. presidential administration may become subject to further awkward rifts between those who want a \u201cseat at the table\u201d in Paris  \u2014   Tillerson Jared Kushner Ivanka Gary Cohn Rick Perry  \u2014   and those who want out. The U. S. may add to \u201cglobal warming\u201d by 0. 3 degrees C,  causing the world to boil and melt or, if not that, then at least provoking much bitterness and resentment among all the countries that haven\u2019t yet quit Paris even though they\u2019d all secretly like to. Quite how Trump will respond to these threats is still anyone\u2019s guess. On the one hand, he has reportedly told various allies that he intends to pull out. On the other, he is known for changing his mind at the last minute. What we do know is that the climate gravy train is trundling on regardless. And that as far as the U. S. climate negotiators are concerned, the current president might still just as well be Barack Obama. Yup, that\u2019s the inside gossip from EU news specialist Euractiv: But, according to our sources, the US team are exploiting the vacuum to press ahead with the agreement, which was signed by Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama. They told   officials, \u201cWe are following the Obama procedure. As long as there are no new instructions, the old ones are still valid. \u201d They agreed a limited budget increase to plans in Bonn. Diplomats told their opposite numbers that they should seize the opportunity to get as much agreed before Trump makes up his mind, awestruck sources gossiped. Another source blasted that \u201cclimate should be humanity\u2019s number one concern and this guy hasn\u2019t found the time to sit down with his climate negotiators in more than 120 days in office\u201d. This international determination to keep the U. S. in the Paris Agreement at all costs sits slightly at odds with reports that several other signatory nations are privately desperate to escape. According to Climate Home,  former Eastern Bloc countries Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary are trying to \u201cgut, block or water down\u201d the Paris accord\u2019s   promises because they interfere with their economic growth and commit them to useless, expensive renewable energy. Europe\u2019s steelmakers  \u2014   among them,    Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp and Austria\u2019s Voestalpine  \u2014   have written to EU leaders begging not to be burdened with any of the carbon emissions costs they say would make them uncompetitive against foreign rivals. Meanwhile a report produced by the Commission on Carbon Prices claims that says the carbon dioxide price needs to rise   or twentyfold if it is to meet Paris pledges. This would  \u2014   to coin a phrase  \u2014   cause electricity prices necessarily to skyrocket  \u2026     As Cliff Forrest notes in the Wall Street Journal, the \u2018business case\u2019 for Paris is bunk. The economic merits of the Paris Agreement take on a different air when more fully considered.   advocates\u2019 bizarre premise is that economic gains will come from restricting access to the most abundant, reliable and affordable fuel sources. Never mind that this defies the experience of many European nations that have invested heavily in renewable energy. After \u201cGermany\u2019s aggressive and reckless expansion of wind and solar,\u201d for example, the magazine Der Spiegel declared in 2013 that electricity had become \u201ca luxury good. \u201d Apparently this time will be different. Which is why  \u2014   as I remarked yesterday  \u2014   it is so absurd and wrong and dishonest of the President\u2019s   Economics Adviser Gary \u2018Wormtongue\u2019 Cohn to be pretending otherwise. No one is pretending Trump won\u2019t get a lot of stick from the Climate Industrial Complex, from the Euro weenies, from the globalists, the Bilderbergers, the eco Nazis and Davos Man if he does the right thing and pulls out of Paris. No one is pretending that pulling out of Paris won\u2019t earn him an even stiffer handshake from President Macron and even dirtier looks from Mrs Merkel next time they meet. But increasingly  \u2014   at least from this Englishman\u2019s perspective  \u2014   whether President Trump pulls the U. S. out of Paris boils down to one very simple question: \u201cAre you a man or a mouse, Mister President?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561975.4867713}
