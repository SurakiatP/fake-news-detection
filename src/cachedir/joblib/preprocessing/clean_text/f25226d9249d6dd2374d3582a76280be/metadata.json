[Mr. Sanandaji, a noted economist who has been outspoken about the consequences of unrestricted mass migration, wrote a post on his Facebook page in response to comments made by Swedish journalist \u00c5sa Linderborg who said Sweden could not function without illegal migrants.  \u201cIt is a fantasy that the economy would collapse without a few thousand undocumented migrants in   occupations,\u201d Sanandaji wrote. \u201cSweden worked demonstrably a few years ago when there were few illegal immigrants. \u201d According to the economist, illegal migrants have a very small impact on the overall economy because so few of them are employed. \u201cPaperless migrants are a tiny fraction of the labour force and is in excess in professions that can easily be done by others. Low wages, no social benefit. It reflects the low productivity of the marginal service occupations that are barely required and can be easily replaced. \u201d Hitting out at left wing parties who are often   he noted: \u201cAn illegal sector distorts competition and crowds out the unemployed who are looking for the few simple jobs that remain. It is harmful and unwanted and opposed by the traditional left. \u201d The economist, of   background, did not stop with his criticism of left wing parties calling them an \u201cimmigration cult\u201d. \u201cThey romanticise   \u2026     undeclared work and wage dumping and have now begun to argue that the economy \u2018needs\u2019 a   subclass. \u201d He then accused the left of creating a new class of poor, something that Sweden has attempted to fight through social programmes for decades. \u201cCultural Left\u2019s new slogan can be summarised as \u2018We want what the United States has! \u2019\u201d he said, comparing the mantra to those in the U. S. who claim that without illegal migrants, the economy would collapse. Mass migration and its effect on the economy has been the subject of a book by Sanandaji entitled Mass Challenge. The book became controversial in some circles in Sweden including a library which refused to stock the book claiming it was promoting racism. Economists across Europe have spoken out against the purported economic benefits of mass migration. Economist Johan Javeus claimed that migrants were a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in Sweden which will harm the Swedish economy. In Germany, the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) wrote a report claiming that mass migration would likely harm   economic growth rather than improve it.
