Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.\u201d \\nTo say tipping off the Clinton camp about Department of Justice business \u2014 through a personal, more covert email account, no less \u2014 is an ethically and morally questionable move would be a serious understatement of the nature of the collusion. \\nIt would seem, if Kadzik indeed tipped off Clinton insiders more than once, the announcement of another probe only constitutes empty talk to placate politicians and the public now seething over continued revelations from Podesta\u2019s emails now published on a daily basis by Wikileaks. \\nIn fact, this one email suggests the DOJ held intense bias in favor of Hillary Clinton during its first investigation \u2014 and with Kadzik again heading the second probe, any claims of \u2018impartiality\u2019 can be effectively abandoned. \\nReopening both the FBI and DOJ investigations has sparked serious contention both in and between the two, as well as spawning sharp criticism from former officials concerned protocol has been dismissed in the process. \\nRep. Adam Schiff said FBI Director James Comey\u2019s publicly announcing the reopening its investigation put an \u201cenormous hand on the scale in a political contest,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported . \\nSchiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney, said the FBI has guidelines preventing such public announcements as the information could sway, or be viewed as influencing, a \u2018political contest in its final days.\u2019 \\n\u201cClearly here the [FBI] director did not have the facts,\u201d he railed, as the WSJ reported. \u201cHe had not read the emails. He didn\u2019t know if they were significant or not, and I think we are seeing in all of its graphic character just why these DOJ policies exist.\u201d \\nKadzik, in fact \u2014 as Wikileaks also revealed \u2014 had dinner with Hillary Clinton just one day after she testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October. Further, as the Daily Caller reported , \\n\u201cPodesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta\u2019s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik\u2019s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign.\u201d \\nWith the DOJ at least minimally compromised with Clinton insiders and sympathizers \u2014 and the FBI additionally so, considering Comey\u2019s decades-long relationship with the Clinton family \u2014 it would seem both investigations are doomed to fail, whether or not any of the players actually misbehaved.
