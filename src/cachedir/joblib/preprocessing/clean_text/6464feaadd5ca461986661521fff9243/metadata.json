[Describing MILO\u2019s appearance on the show, the New York Times writes,  \u201cDespite a brief   of controversy that preceded it, a conversation between Milo Yiannopoulos, the incendiary   author and lecturer, and Bill Maher, the comedian and host of HBO\u2019s \u2018Real Time,\u2019 on that program Friday night was a largely docile, chummy affair. There was little conflict or   as both men chided the political left for avoiding or drowning out Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s views rather than engaging with them. \u201d  \u201cIntroducing Mr. Yiannopoulos, 32, an openly gay editor at Breitbart News, Mr. Maher said: \u2018I think you\u2019re colossally wrong on a number of things. But if I banned everyone from my show who I thought was colossally wrong, I would be talking to myself,\u2019\u201d the NYT noted. Quoting MILO, the NYT states: \u201c\u2019All I care about is free speech and free expression,\u2019 Mr. Yiannopoulos explained. \u2018I want people to be able to be, do and say anything.

There are so many other people. \u2019)\u201d Ending the article by discussing MILO\u2019s comments on \u201cOvertime,\u201d Maher\u2019s internet streamed   program, the NYT stated, \u201cTrying to defuse the tension [between the panelists] Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn\u2019t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. \u2018This is the beginning of your career,\u2019 Mr. Maher said. \u2018People are only just starting to hate you. \u2019\u201d Read the full article here.'"}, "time": 1742562103.9642482}
