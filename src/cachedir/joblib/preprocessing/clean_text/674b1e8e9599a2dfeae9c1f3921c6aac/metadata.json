We know it could not have taken place had the Jewish state been established a few years earlier,\u201d the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in 1998, standing amid the ruins of an   crematory. He had just led Mr. Kushner and thousands of other teenagers waving Israeli flags in a procession through the camp\u2019s gates and past the barracks. As part of the commemoration, the group would soon leave Poland and fly to Israel, to complete the journey from slaughter to Zionist rebirth. Back then, Mr. Kushner was a high school basketball player, a Billy Joel fan, a quiz team manager and no one\u2019s guess to become a negotiating partner with Mr. Netanyahu. But unlike other students on the trip, he knew the prime minister, who was friendly with his father, a real estate developer and donor to Israeli causes. Mr. Netanyahu had even stayed at the Kushners\u2019 home in New Jersey, sleeping in Jared\u2019s bedroom. (The teenager moved to the basement that night.) On Wednesday, when the Israeli prime minister visits the White House, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Kushner will reunite on far different terms from before  \u2014   and yet their meeting will be imbued with some of the shared ideas of those old encounters. Mr. Netanyahu is on his second stint as prime minister Mr. Kushner, now 36, is President Trump\u2019s    and a leading adviser on Middle Eastern affairs with a daunting assignment. Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Kushner will try to \u201cdo peace,\u201d which the president has called \u201cthe ultimate deal. \u201d Mr. Kushner, on something of a crash course in diplomacy, has been speaking with Arab leaders in recent weeks. But he is a mystery to most Middle Eastern officials. He has no experience in government or international affairs. His   exposure to the Arab world amounts to little more than trips to a handful of Persian Gulf countries and a   jaunt to Jordan. Though Mr. Kushner has visited Israel since childhood, and more recently to do business, he is little known there. He holds strong views about the state of Israel, but he has not been outspoken about them, save for editorials in The New York Observer, the newspaper he owned. His thinking on matters like settlements is not well understood. \u201cIsrael wasn\u2019t a political discussion for him it was his family, his life, his people,\u201d said Hirschy Zarchi, rabbi at the Chabad House at Harvard, where Mr. Kushner was an undergraduate. Rather than diplomatic experience, Mr. Kushner has ties to Israel that are personal and religious. His visit to Auschwitz was stark, but its themes were not new to him. His grandmother survived the Holocaust by crawling through a homemade tunnel in Poland. His grandfather escaped the massacres by hiding in a hole for years. An Orthodox Jew, Mr. Kushner was instructed to protect Israel, remember the genocide and assure the survival of the Jewish people, those close to him say. He was educated at Jewish schools where second graders were expected to draw maps of Israel from memory and the West Bank was often referred to by its biblical names, Judea and Samaria, a practice that emphasizes Jewish claims to the land. His family used its real estate fortune to donate millions of dollars to American Jewish and Israeli hospitals, schools and other institutions, including a few in settlements, according to public records. In his classes, Palestinians were regarded at a distance, in part as security threats who committed acts of terrorism  \u2014   including one that killed a sister of a classmate of Mr. Kushner\u2019s. When Mr. Trump ran for president, his   \u2019s stances on Israel helped shape the campaign. Mr. Kushner helped script a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and consulted with Netanyahu officials behind the scenes. When he brought the candidate and the prime minister together for a meeting, his father, Charles Kushner, was invited to join them. Thanks in part to the younger Mr. Kushner, Mr. Netanyahu will arrive at a White House that has already adopted many of the prime minister\u2019s perspectives on the region. Now Mr. Kushner is helping Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu craft a strategy to recruit Sunni Muslim countries that oppose Iran to help foster an   peace agreement. The approach is a long shot: Negotiations are dead. The Israeli right is pushing for more settlement in the West Bank as talk among Palestinians turns to a single state in which they have equal rights. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian leader who was involved in peace talks both with Israelis and internally, said Palestinians were skeptical of Mr. Kushner, and Mr. Trump\u2019s team generally, seeing them as close only to the Israeli side. As part of its philanthropy, Mr. Kushner\u2019s family has made donations to the Beit El settlement, which Mr. Barghouti finds particularly worrisome. \u201cWe need somebody who is really impartial,\u201d Mr. Barghouti said, pointing out that it is unclear whether Mr. Kushner has ever visited a Palestinian area (the White House would not say). \u201cThere is no indication he is interested in hearing from the other side. \u201d Through a White House spokeswoman, Mr. Kushner declined to respond or be interviewed. But others said his life had given him cause to believe in the improbable. His grandparents survived against all odds, then came to America and made the kind of money of which most people can only dream. Mr. Kushner plunged into his   \u2019s presidential campaign with no experience and helped him win. \u201cThis is a region that has resisted solutions from people with vast r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\u201d said Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, suggesting that his former boss may do better. \u201cFor   years we\u2019ve been sending the best diplomats in the world, and it\u2019s yielded zero results. \u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s religious upbringing may have been intense, but his high school yearbook message was   with an ode to his   sneakers. He was a \u201c6 ft. 2 inch basketball and hockey player who just loves to be comfortable,\u201d the message said, noting that he also liked to deliver frozen yogurt and Slurpees to his siblings. There was little mention of Jewish identity beyond his Hebrew name, Yoel Chaim. But that was Mr. Kushner, classmates said in recent interviews: easygoing and polite, a decent student but not a standout, not particularly engaged in religious questions or the urgent political matters of the day. He did not participate in the high school club devoted to criticizing coverage of Israel in The New York Times. Many of his peers spent a year after graduation studying religious texts in Israel he did not. But his family was busy building a world to replace the one it had lost: schools, organizations, synagogues, campuses. The Kushners\u2019 Judaism and support of Israel were one and the same, friends said: about ensuring survival. The major Jewish institutions of Mr. Kushner\u2019s life  \u2014   school and synagogue  \u2014   emphasized the connection between religion and Zionism. \u201cIn the modern Orthodox community, the state of Israel has an important place in identity, as a religious ideal, not only a political reality,\u201d said Elie Weinstock, rabbi at Kehilath Jeshurun, the Manhattan synagogue Mr. Kushner joined. At his elementary school, the Hebrew Youth Academy in Livingston, N. J. it was impossible to walk the halls \u201cwithout seeing the flags of Israel and Israeli historical figures and how the kids celebrate Israeli holidays,\u201d said Stephen Flatow, whose daughter Ilana was in Mr. Kushner\u2019s grade. In eighth grade, their class was stunned by the killing of Ilana\u2019s older sister, Alisa, in a bus bombing in the Gaza Strip. The school community \u201ccouldn\u2019t fathom how a young man can load himself up with dynamite and blow himself up in a van and have his parents celebrating his death,\u201d Mr. Flatow said. A few years later, the school was renamed for Jared Kushner\u2019s grandfather, Joseph, and when a new building opened, the family dedicated the flagpole that flies the Israeli flag to Alisa\u2019s memory. During high school at the Frisch School in northern New Jersey, where Mr. Kushner spent long days attending mandatory prayers (morning and afternoon) and studying in English, Hebrew and Aramaic (the language of the Talmud) every year of his education was interwoven with events in Israel. In 1995, when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated, teachers and students mourned together. In 1996, a recent graduate named Sara Duker was killed in another bus bombing, sending shock waves through the school again. In 1997, about the time Mr. Kushner was on a   summer trip to Israel, a double suicide bomb in the main Jerusalem market killed more than a dozen people. But classmates say the environment Mr. Kushner lived in could feel apolitical, because most everyone shared similar views, and Palestinian perspectives were barely considered. Some teachers told students that \u201cPalestinian\u201d was a   identity, a label adopted for political reasons. There was little discussion of what it was like to live under occupation, several classmates of Mr. Kushner\u2019s recalled. Many rabbis and teachers seemed comfortable with settlements, and some students said they never learned that Israel\u2019s borders were a highly contested topic. \u201cThere was such an assumption that Jews deserve to have this place, that it was theirs for thousands of years by biblical fiat,\u201d said Eli Schleifer, who graduated the year before Mr. Kushner. \u201cThere was such a strange blindness to the complexity of the situation. \u201d In 1999, Mr. Kushner left New Jersey for Harvard, where he no longer wore a skullcap to classes, but continued to follow rules of Orthodox Jewish life. Jordan Reid Strauch, a friend of Mr. Kushner\u2019s, could not recall his mentioning Israel. Soon the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, was setting off criticism of Israel on campus and then responses from students who defended the country, but Mr. Kushner kept his head down. Instead he spent time at the Chabad House, where Rabbi Zarchi was struck by how Mr. Kushner \u201cnever felt the need to apologize for his differences, his religious commitments,\u201d he said. Mr. Kushner sometimes expressed his views during long Sabbath meals at the house. \u201cHe certainly believed that a strong and secure Israel was in America and the world\u2019s best interest,\u201d Rabbi Zarchi said. He didn\u2019t believe that Israel needed \u201cthe approval of Europe, the United Nations or even Washington or London,\u201d the rabbi continued. While Mr. Kushner was at Harvard, Mr. Netanyahu once again visited his father, speaking at his office, kicking a soccer ball at one of the schools that carried the family name and sitting down for a tabbouleh lunch with students, including Jared\u2019s younger brother, Joshua. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s visits helped lead to an unexpected outcome: Charles Kushner\u2019s brother, Murray, sued him for misusing the family company\u2019s funds by paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to the Israeli leader, among other   figures. The suit was eventually settled, but it set off investigations and misdeeds by Charles Kushner that eventually led to a   prison sentence for tax evasion,   and making illegal campaign donations. A few years later, Charles Kushner and Mr. Netanyahu still seemed close: When the Israeli media obtained Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s partly handwritten list of wealthy Americans most likely to fund his party\u2019s primary elections, Mr. Kushner was near the top. Last June in Washington, Yousef   the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, received an unexpected request from his friend Thomas Barrack Jr. a   businessman and Trump  : Would he meet with Jared Kushner? \u201cWhat struck me in our first meeting is that he asked a lot of questions and listened,\u201d Mr. Otaiba said. Since then, the two have been in touch, with Mr. Kushner playing the student, asking Mr. Otaiba for his impressions of shifting forces in the Middle East, Syria, Iran, extremism, relationships. Mr. Kushner had become a force in his family\u2019s real estate business, and a member of a synagogue known for a brand of religious Zionism similar to the one he was raised with. He took out loans for the real estate business from Israel\u2019s Bank Hapoalim and almost bought a major Israeli insurance company called Phoenix. Though he had been raised a Democrat, Mr. Kushner endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race, in part because of disappointment with President Barack Obama on Israel. \u201cRather than strengthen the nation\u2019s relationship with Israel as the Arab world imploded, Mr. Obama treated Jerusalem as less a friend than a burden,\u201d the Observer endorsement read, using language similar to what Mr. Trump would eventually say. Now Mr. Kushner has given up his life in New York for a government ID card and a groaning portfolio. Many foreign policy experts wait their entire careers for a White House job, but Mr. Kushner is fielding inquiries from foreign leaders even as he is still learning to navigate the subject. He is far from the first American Jew with strong ties to Israel to wade into Middle Eastern diplomacy  \u2014   Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, is the son of a former Jewish paramilitary fighter  \u2014   but the others were Washington professionals or seasoned negotiators. In his first weeks in the White House, Mr. Kushner has had exchanges with officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and elsewhere, and greeted King Abdullah II of Jordan, whom he met several years ago on a trip to that country that included the actors Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. It is unclear what shape Mr. Kushner\u2019s role will take, especially as figures like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and others in the foreign policy apparatus become engaged in Middle Eastern diplomacy. Some observers see Mr. Kushner as a welcome counter to an unpredictable president and to firebrands like Stephen K. Bannon, the White House strategist, and David M. Friedman, the ambassador designate to Israel. Mr. Kushner \u201ccould be a moderate voice,\u201d said Dan Gillerman, Israel\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, who got to know Mr. Kushner in New York. \u201cThe strange thing is, that    kid may end up being the   in the room. \u201d Many years after his teenage encounters with Mr. Netanyahu, he may also be in a position to help the Israeli leader, who is facing multiple corruption investigations and   challenges from the right. But Mr. Kushner\u2019s task is formidable. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump want to set in motion a chain of events that could block Iran, redefine Israel\u2019s relationship with the Arab world and create   peace  \u2014   \u201cthe deal that can\u2019t be made,\u201d as Mr. Trump has said. \u201cThe prime minister is coming into the meeting with the hope to forge a common policy with the president, and Jared\u2019s role is critical in that,\u201d said Ron Dermer, the ambassador of Israel, with whom Mr. Kushner has been in close contact. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who, in my interactions with him, has really been able to deliver. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561946.201806}
