It puts a human face on the movement, which does not come across so much from a yard sign (although put up one of those too). \\nIt is also more likely to have a contagious effect at the grassroots. Even if onlookers don\u2019t wear Trump gear of their own, at least they\u2019ll be more likely to talk positively about voting to others, assuming they were roughly on our side. \\nThe goal is not to appear confrontational, as though we were about to man the barricades (that would come only if the Establishment tries to steal the election). Everyday people around you are not the immediate enemy. Those who are uncertain about turning out, or are genuinely undecided, are on the wimpy and cucky side \u2014 they just want to be reassured that Trump voters are normal people. \\nI guarantee that no one from the enemy\u2019s side will try to shame or ostracize you in public, in order to send a message to undecided onlookers. Only paid activists bother attempting this, and they only concentrate at Trump rallies or on the internet. Even the strongly committed Hillary voters are too demoralized to confront a stranger. The only responses you will get will be from fellow travelers, especially ones who were uncertain whether they were the only one leaning toward Trump, and are relieved to see someone being the first to break the silence in public. \\nTrump has been taking so much public abuse, slander, and libel on our behalf \u2014 the least we can do is put ourselves out there, too, whether we get a few sideways glances or not. \\nAt this stage, giving our public support matters more than giving financial support. The polls are not so tight because of insufficient advertising. It\u2019s because a handful of people are still uneasy about either turning out, or choosing Trump if they do. Making those people feel more comfortable by seeing real-life support for Trump in public will go farther than hearing an ad on the drive to work. \\nAnd some of them truly have no preference other than joining the in-group. With no visible signs of support from Hillary voters, that only leaves the Trump side for the conformists to join. Who would want to join a group that is weakly held together, when there\u2019s a more emotionally connected group as the alternative? \\nYou don\u2019t have to go all-out all day long, but at least wear a hat or shirt out for an hour or so in normal public places. High-traffic retail spaces are best, like a supermarket. \\nIt\u2019s simple to find places selling Trump hats if you don\u2019t already have one. \\nThere\u2019s no excuse to stay sitting on the sidelines with less than two weeks to go. We need to make our presence known \u2014 not just as a warning to the enemy, but more importantly to motivate anyone who doesn\u2019t like Crooked Hillary to show up and vote Trump with the rest of the crowd. \\nThis election is now 100% about demoralization \u2013 on both sides. \\nWe have to keep our morale up, so that our people will go out and vote on the 8th. Huge portions of Hillary\u2019s people aren\u2019t going to bother, especially with new scandals dropping every minute.'"}, "time": 1742628469.54087}
