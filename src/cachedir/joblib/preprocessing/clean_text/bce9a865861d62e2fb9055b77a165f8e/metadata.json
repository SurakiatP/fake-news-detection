There are 14  \u2014   count \u2019em 14  \u2014   shows opening on Broadway, with more   forms of entertainment cropping up like wild crocuses all over the rest of the city. Audience members can submerge themselves in everything from the brassy manipulations of a little old matchmaker named Dolly (embodied by a little old diva named Bette) to the more recessive mysteries of humanity according to American theater\u2019s patron saint of the inarticulate, Annie Baker. \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d Jerry Herman\u2019s   whinnying war horse from 1964 returns after a   absence from Broadway, in a feverishly awaited production directed by Jerry Zaks and featuring David Hyde Pierce as the curmudgeonly tycoon Horace Vandergelder. The show also includes a staircase made for one really grand entrance, a slew of singing waiters and, in their midst (in the title role) she whom the patrons of louche bathhouses in the 1970s hailed as the Divine Miss M. If you don\u2019t know that\u2019s Bette Midler, don\u2019t bother joining the queue for   cancellations. Tickets: hellodollyonbroadway. com \u201cOslo\u201d You probably already know the   outcome of this intricately wrought drama about the Middle East peace talks of 1993. (Spoiler: they\u2019re still fighting.) But that doesn\u2019t keep J. T. Rogers\u2019s portrait of the backdoor diplomacy that led to the Oslo Accords from being a nail biter, or from inspiring hope. Vividly directed by Bartlett Sher, and starring Jefferson Mays and Jennifer Ehle as a    pair of married diplomats, this   tale moves from downstairs (where it opened last summer at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater) to upstairs (at the more commodious Vivian Beaumont) just in time to become a   for the Tony Awards. Tickets: lct.      \u201cThe Antipodes\u201d Nobody\u2019s saying what this latest offering from Signature Theater is about, exactly. But the fact that it was written by Annie Baker, the hugely influential Pulitzer   author of \u201cThe Flick,\u201d automatically makes it a   for students of contemporary American drama  \u2014   and for those of us who just like to hear Ms. Baker\u2019s fumbling characters talk about nothing and everything. The director, auspiciously, is Lila Neugebauer, whose energizing production of Sarah DeLappe\u2019s \u201cThe Wolves,\u201d a   study of a girls\u2019 soccer team, was a knockout. Tickets: signaturetheatre. org \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d Andy Karl is not playing the   mammal of the title. But his performance in this musical adaptation of the 1993 movie seems guaranteed to confirm his status as an    star. Mr. Karl (who took a lickin\u2019 but kept on tickin\u2019 on Broadway as \u201cRocky\u201d in 2014) portrays a   cynical news reporter, and when I saw the show at the Old Vic in London last year, he was dazzling (and original) enough to make me forget what\u2019   Bill Murray, who created the part on film. Danny Rubin adapted his original screenplay and Tim Minchin, the man who gave us the blissfully naughty score of \u201cMatilda the Musical,\u201d wrote the music. Matthew Warchus, another talented \u201cMatilda\u201d alumnus, directs. Tickets: groundhogdaymusical. com \u201cSix Degrees of Separation\u201d John Guare\u2019s masterwork, about a world in which   is an   passkey, is one of the best plays ever written about New York society and its more liberal denizens. It returns to Broadway 26 years after it didn\u2019t win (but should have) the Tony Award for best play, with a cast that includes Allison Janney (back onstage after many   years of being winningly waspish on television) and John Benjamin Hickey. They portray a sophisticated but    husband and wife Corey Hawkins (\u201c24: Legacy,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d) is the seductive young man who (another spoiler) is probably not Sidney Poitier\u2019s son.
