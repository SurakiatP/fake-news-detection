K. Galbraith\\nLast month, tensions between dark matter simulations and galactic rotation observations reached a new high. Despite all the successes of dark matter on the largest scales \u2014 for the CMB, for large-scale structure, for gravitational lensing and for galaxy clusters, among others \u2014 the simplest dark matter simulations reproduced unrealistic results for how individual galaxies ought to rotate. Moreover, a team of scientists uncovered a surprising relationship: between the normal (baryonic) matter alone and the observed acceleration in galaxies.\\nThe correlation between gravitational acceleration (y-axis) and the normal, baryonic matter (x-axis) visible in an assembly of 153 galaxies. The blue points show each individual galaxy, while the red show binned data.

From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05917v1.pdf.\\nIf dark matter were real, then the simulations needed to reproduce that result as well, which appeared to be a tremendous challenge. Yet in a new paper, two scientists from McMaster University, Ben Keller and James Wadsley, did exactly this. Even more impressively, they didn\u2019t make new simulations, they simply took pre-existing ones and showed that this relation does, in fact, get reproduced among all their galaxies.\\nWhile the web of dark matter (purple) might seem to determine cosmic structure formation on its own, the feedback from normal matter (red) can severely impact galactic scales.
