[\u201cSorry, but if you are overweight, pedicures will be $45 due to service fees for pedicurists. Thank you!\u201d reads a sign on a nondescript wall, seen in a photo the woman posted to Facebook.  \u201cSo rude,\u201d said Deshania Ferguson, who published the image. Ferguson claims that she saw the sign in a local salon called Rose Nails, which charges up to $30 for a pedicure. The image has been shared more than 500 times, with others balking at the alleged price increase. The Daily Mail tried calling the salon, but a person on the other line claimed that they had the wrong number. WREG got in touch with the nail salon\u2019s owner, Son Nguyen, and spoke with him in person. Nguyen denied that the sign existed despite the viral photo. Nguyen did, however, tell the station that he and his wife who run the salon have turned away overweight people because it is \u201cdifficult for technicians to give them pedicures. \u201d He says that two chairs have been broken as a result of his larger clientele, which cost him $2, 500 to repair or replace them. \u201cThey took the sign down and denied ever having it up  \u2026     pictures are worth a thousand words,\u201d Ferguson posted to Facebook Friday.'"}, "time": 1742563051.0742998}
