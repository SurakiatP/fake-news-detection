More fallout from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union: Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a \u201cBrexit\u201d supporter widely seen as the top candidate to take over the Conservative Party and succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, has decided not to run. Michael Gove, the justice secretary who recently said he didn\u2019t have the talent or desire to become prime minister, is officially in the race. He\u2019ll face Theresa May, the home secretary, and several other candidates vying for the position. The vote may threaten London\u2019s days as the world\u2019s financial capital. _____ 2. The Brexit decision by British voters was partly motivated by anxiety about immigration, and in the United States, Donald J. Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. But there is a country where the government can hardly keep up with the demand to welcome refugees: Canada. Citizens are banding together and essentially adopting families, which they\u2019ve been doing by the thousands. _____ 3. The deadly attack on Istanbul\u2019s main airport, above, was carried out by three suicide bombers from Russia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Turkish officials said. The government has blamed Islamic State militants for the attack on Tuesday. If the group is responsible, it would be the first time any   members have attacked a major Western target  \u2014   and would indicate that Turkey is no longer protected from the group\u2019s violence. One of the victims killed was in Turkey to find and save his son from ISIS. _____ 4. Republicans are raising questions about a meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, saying it could compromise the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices. Ms. Lynch said Mr. Clinton walked uninvited from his plane to her government plane on Monday to say hello, but that the two did not discuss any cases. But Republican lawmakers said the meeting was troubling. _____ 5. The driver of a Tesla Model S was killed in what may be the first death involving a   car. Federal regulators, who have opened an investigation, say the car was driving in \u201cautopilot\u201d mode when it crashed into a   at a Florida intersection on May 7. _____ 6. Adnan Syed, whose murder trial was featured on the podcast \u201cSerial,\u201d will get a new trial, a judge in Maryland ruled on Thursday. The inmate\u2019s conviction for the 1999 killing of his   gained widespread attention after his case was featured in the first season of the podcast. Mr. Syed, who was serving a life sentence, had long maintained his innocence. _____ 7. Chris Christie for vice president? The governor of New Jersey, who has become one of Donald J. Trump\u2019s most influential advisers, is being vetted as a possible running mate. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to crack down on trade agreements that hurt American jobs has highlighted the fact that, as a businessman, he had relied on and benefited from the same type of cheap foreign labor that he now scorns. _____ 8. Transgender people can now serve openly in the U. S. armed forces. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, above, lifted the Pentagon\u2019s ban on Thursday, continuing a transformation of the military. An analysis of federal and state data has doubled the number of transgender adults in the U. S. putting the new estimate at about 1. 4 million people. _____ 9. If this weekend brings a lot of lamenting about noisy fireworks, take comfort: Quiet firework displays will maybe, one day, become a thing. In parts of Europe, it already is. The quiet displays can be more colorful, but alas, they are not big enough to entertain a large audience. They\u2019ve not made their way to the U. S. yet, so for the time being, keep covering your ears. _____ 10. Perhaps a bowl of Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes with a little lemon zest dusted on top will be a good value at $7. 50. Perhaps it won\u2019t. As the breakfast food continues to fall out of favor, Kellogg\u2019s is hoping a boutique cafe in Times Square that serves cereal, but with garnishes like green tea powder, will get people to look differently at the flakes and oats. Be prepared to pay Manhattan prices, though. _____ 11. Let\u2019s do some math. If the average American spends 10 hours and 39 minutes a day consuming various types of media on various types of devices, how much time does that leave him or her for other things  \u2014   like work, sleep or maybe sitting for a meal? A Nielsen study, which indicates that Americans really, really love television, doesn\u2019t answer that question. But, whatever, that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d finale was worth it. _____ 12. Leila. Liina. Lily. (Their last name is Luik.) The three sisters from Estonia, who call themselves the Trio for Rio, are believed to be the first triplets to qualify for the Olympics. The marathon contenders didn\u2019t even begin running seriously until six years ago, when they were 24. \u201cWe show that it is never too late to start a professional career,\u201d Liina Luik said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
