[\u201cMembers of Microsoft\u2019s Online Safety Team had \u2018 \u2019 status, former employees Henry Soto and Greg Blauert allege in a lawsuit filed on Dec. 30. They \u2018could literally view any customer\u2019s communications at any time,\u2019\u201d reported the Daily Beast. \u201cSpecifically, they were asked to screen Microsoft users\u2019 communications for child pornography and evidence of other crimes. \u201d  \u201cBut Big Brother didn\u2019t offer a good health care plan, the Microsoft employees allege. After years of being made to watch the \u2018most twisted\u2019 videos on the internet, employees said they suffered severe psychological distress, while the company allegedly refused to provide a specially trained therapist or to pay for therapy,\u201d the report alleges. \u201cThe two former employees and their families are suing for damages from what they describe as permanent psychological injuries, for which they were denied worker\u2019s compensation. \u201d Soto, who was one of the first employees in the department, claims to have been \u201cinvoluntarily transferred\u201d to the position, adding that he was \u201cnot informed prior to the transfer as to the full nature\u201d of the job. Soto was also forced to remain in the position for at least a year and a half before being able to request another transfer \u2014   the usual practice for any position at Microsoft. As part of the job, Soto claimed that he had to watch and filter through \u201chorrible brutality, murder, indescribable sexual assaults, videos of humans dying and, in general, videos and photographs designed to entertain the most twisted and   people in the world. \u201d \u201cMany people simply cannot imagine what Mr. Soto had to view on a daily basis as most people do not understand how horrible and inhumane the worst people in the world can be,\u201d proclaimed the lawsuit, adding, \u201cHe had trouble with sleep disturbance, [and] nightmares. \u201d \u201cHe suffered from an internal video screen in his head and could see disturbing images, he suffered from irritability, increased startle, anticipatory anxiety, and was easily distractible,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Microsoft defended the department and its employees, citing the importance of the job in an email. \u201cMicrosoft applies     technology to help detect and classify illegal images of child abuse and exploitation that are shared by users on Microsoft Services,\u201d responded a Microsoft spokesperson to the Daily Beast. \u201cOnce verified by a specially trained employee, the company removes the image, reports it to the National Center for Missing  Exploited Children, and bans the users who shared the images from our services. We have put in place robust wellness programs to ensure the employees who handle this material have the resources and support they need. \u201d However the \u201cwellness program\u201d allegedly consisted of just an \u201c  counselor,\u201d which resulted in a \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d diagnosis, instead of the   mental health program that was allegedly available for Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit. Greg Blauert, who is also currently suing Microsoft, cited similar concerns about the job, declaring that he had to sift through \u201cthousands of images of child pornography, adult pornography and bestiality that graphically depicted the violence and depravity of the perpetrators. \u201d \u201cHe began experiencing nightmares and intrusive images,\u201d claimed the Daily Beast. \u201cIf he or a   broke down at work, their employers allegedly encouraged them to merely \u2018leave work early\u2019 as part of the department\u2019s \u2018Wellness Plan. \u2019\u201d Both men have been diagnosed with PTSD and are currently on leave from work.
