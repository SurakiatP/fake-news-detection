[Illegals enrolled in the President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d DACA program can \u201crest easy,\u201d Trump said, because \u201cthis is a case of heart. \u201d  Federal enforcement agencies are \u201cnot [going] after the \u2018dreamers,\u2019 we are after the criminals,\u201d he said, using the Democrats\u2019 \u2018dreamer\u2019 euphemism for young illegal immigrants. \u201cThat is our policy,\u201d he added. The Friday comments confirm Trump\u2019s reversal of his 2016 campaign promise to stop the DACA   created by Obama during his 2012 reelection campaign. He created the program in 2012 by telling his immigration enforcement officers to provide young illegals with free work permits instead of repatriation orders. The program has allowed at least 770, 000 illegal immigrants to find jobs in major U. S. cities, even though tens of millions of Americans outside the cities are unemployed or have given up trying to find work. Since his inauguration, Trump\u2019s deputies at the Department of Homeland Security have awarded new work permits to illegals who claim they arrived before age 16, despite Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d slogan. Trump\u2019s support for the DACA program is one of his biggest \u201c\u201d said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cDuring the campaign,   Trump had said he was going to end that on day one because it\u2019s an unconstitutional action by the president,\u201d Krikorian told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday. Krikorian continued: And of course he\u2019s right, it\u2019s illegal. And they\u2019ve done nothing to it. They\u2019ve done absolutely nothing. \u201d Trump\u2019s   turnabout on DACA means that   reformers who want to reduce the impact of   workers in the job market will need to bring a lawsuit arguing that the federal government illegally awarded work permits to illegal immigrants, say advocates. Trump\u2019s refusal to reverse or even stop the DACA program is also a bad sign for future immigration reforms, says Krikorian. That\u2019s because he could stop the program and then use the resulting public outcry to pressure Democrats to establish   immigration policies. Those policies could include a mandatory requirement that employers check that job applicants are legal residents in the United States. In August 2016, Obama\u2019s chief economist said the federal is imposing the economic pain of five simultaneous recessions on   Americans, thereby pushing millions of   men off jobs, out of the workforce, and into poverty. Roughly 10 percent of American \u201cprime age\u201d men, or 7 million men aged 25 to 54, have dropped out of the nation\u2019s workforce of 150 million. They are not trying to get jobs, and are not participating in the nation\u2019s labor force. \u201cThis [dropout] is caused by policies and institutions, not by technology,\u201d admitted Jason Furman, an economist who chaired the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t accept it as inevitable,\u201d he told a Brookings Institute expert, Dave Wessel on  August 10. The primary reason for reduced employment is that \u201cthe amount [of money] that employers would want to hire them for some reason has gone down,\u201d he said. In February, Trump told that the AP that \u201cDACA is a very, very difficult subject for me   \u2026     It\u2019s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562544.137696}
