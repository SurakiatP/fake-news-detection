Trump has already built a wall  \u2014   not on the border with Mexico, but on the border of his exclusive golf course in northeastern Scotland, blocking the sea view of local residents who refused to sell their homes. And then he sent them the bill. David and Moira Milne had already been threatened with legal action by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, who claimed that a corner of their garage belonged to him, when they came home from work one day to find his staff building a fence around their garden. Two rows of grown trees went up next, blocking the view. Their water and electricity lines were temporarily cut. And then a bill for about $3, 500 arrived in the mail, which, Mr. Milne said, went straight into the trash. \u201cYou watch, Mexico won\u2019t pay either,\u201d said Mr. Milne, a health and safety consultant and   novelist, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a \u201cbeautiful, impenetrable wall\u201d along the border and force the Mexicans to pay for it. The Milnes now fly a Mexican flag from their hilltop house, a former coast guard station that overlooks the clubhouse of Trump International Golf Links, whenever Mr. Trump visits. So do Susan and John Munro, who also refused to sell and now face an almost    earthen wall built by Mr. Trump\u2019s people on two sides of their property. Michael Forbes, a quarry worker whose home sits on the opposite side of the Trump property, added a second flag  \u2014   \u201cHillary for President\u201d  \u2014   perhaps because Mr. Trump publicly accused him of living \u201clike a pig\u201d and called him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for not selling his \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cslumlike\u201d home. As many Americans are trying to figure out what kind of president they have just elected, the people of Balmedie, a small village outside the once   city of Aberdeen, say they have a pretty good idea. In the 10 years since Mr. Trump first visited, vowing to build \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d on an environmentally protected site featuring    sand dunes, they have seen him lash out at anyone standing in his way. They say they watched him win public support for his golf course with grand promises, then watched him break them one by one. A promised $1. 25 billion investment has shrunk to what his opponents say is at most $50 million. Six thousand jobs have dwindled to 95. Two golf courses to one. An     luxury hotel never materialized, nor did 950   apartments. Instead, an existing manor house was converted into a   boutique hotel. Trump International Golf Links, which opened in 2012, lost $1. 36 million last year, according to public accounts. \u201cIf America wants to know what is coming, it should study what happened here. It\u2019s predictive,\u201d said Martin Ford, a local government representative. \u201cI have just seen him do in America, on a grander scale, precisely what he did here. He suckered the people and he suckered the politicians until he got what he wanted, and then he went back on pretty much everything he promised. \u201d Alex Salmond, a former first minister of Scotland whose government granted Mr. Trump planning permission in 2008, overruling local officials, now concedes the point, saying, \u201cBalmedie got 10 cents on the dollar. \u201d Sarah Malone, who came to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention after being chosen as the \u201cFace of Aberdeen\u201d for a regional marketing campaign and is now a vice president of Trump International, disputed some of the figures publicly discussed about the project, saying that Mr. Trump invested about $125 million and that the golf course now employed 150 people. \u201cWhile other golf and leisure projects were shelved due to lack of funds,\u201d she said, \u201cMr. Trump continued to forge ahead with his plans and has put the region on the global tourism map, and this resort plays a vital role in the economic prosperity of northeast Scotland. \u201d Mr. Salmond said that Mr. Trump\u2019s impact on business in Scotland might actually be a net negative because his xenophobic comments have appalled the Scottish establishment so much that the Royal  Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, known simply as the RA, is unlikely to award his other Scottish golf course, the   Trump Turnberry, another prestigious golf tournament like the Open anytime soon. \u201cI don\u2019t see the RA going back to Turnberry, which is a tragedy in itself,\u201d Mr. Salmond said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a huge economic blow: Several hundred million pounds lost  \u2014   or, in Trump terms, billions. \u201d Mr. Trump, whose mother emigrated from Scotland to New York in 1930, never showed any great interest in her place of birth. But in 2008, the same year he applied for planning permission in Balmedie, he visited the   cottage on the Isle of Lewis in Western Scotland where she grew up. After emerging from his private jet and handing out copies of his book \u201cHow to Get Rich,\u201d he reportedly told locals how Scottish he felt. \u201cI feel very comfortable here,\u201d Mr. Trump said before spending less than two minutes with his cousins in his mother\u2019s homestead, The Guardian reported at the time. Within about three hours his jet had taken off. The visit clearly did not impress Mr. Ford, then the chairman of the planning committee at Aberdeenshire Council, which refused Mr. Trump permission for his golf course on environmental grounds. The ancient dunes, the committee concluded, were a \u201csite of special scientific interest,\u201d or as Mr. Ford put it, \u201cScotland\u2019s equivalent of the Amazonian rain forest. \u201d In the end, it was Mr. Salmond, a   golf fanatic whose constituency includes Balmedie, who came to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense, granting permission to proceed in the \u201cnational economic interest. \u201d \u201cSix thousand jobs across Scotland, 1, 400 local and permanent jobs in the northeast of Scotland,\u201d Mr. Salmond said at the time. \u201cThat outweighs the environmental concerns. \u201d Eight years later he contends that Mr. Trump took him in: \u201cIf, knowing what I know now, I had the ability to go back, I would rewrite that page,\u201d Mr. Salmond said in an interview. \u201cMost developments balance economic against environmental issues. The problem, and it\u2019s a big problem, is that Donald Trump didn\u2019t do what he promised. \u201d Mr. Trump later fell out badly with Mr. Salmond (whom he now calls \u201cmad Alex\u201d and a \u201c \u201d) first because he refused to evict residents by eminent domain and then over his plans to install offshore wind turbines a couple of miles from Mr. Trump\u2019s golf course. \u201cIf Scotland doesn\u2019t stop insane policy of obsolete,   wind turbines, country will be destroyed,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in 2014. At a parliamentary inquiry about renewable energy in 2012, Mr. Trump warned that Scotland would get into \u201cserious trouble\u201d if it continued to build wind turbines. Asked what evidence he had, he said, \u201cI am the evidence. \u201d He then made a formal complaint about a Green Party politician who had made fun of the statement with a still from the Monty Python film \u201cThe Life of Brian,\u201d accusing him of blasphemy and threatening to take him to court. The wind turbines, whose foundations are expected to be laid next year, still seem to rankle Mr. Trump. In a meeting right after his election victory, Mr. Trump urged Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist U. K. Independence Party  \u2014   which has failed to win a single seat in Scotland  \u2014   to fight offshore wind farms in Scotland on his behalf. \u201cTo actually believe that having a conversation with Nigel Farage and his henchmen about wind energy is going to change Scottish government policy is on the outer limits of possibility,\u201d Mr. Salmond said. As a presidential candidate who was caught on a hot microphone bragging  about sexually assaulting women, Mr. Trump found little sympathy among Scotland\u2019s political leaders, most of whom happen to be women. Nicola Sturgeon, Mr. Salmond\u2019s successor, has called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply abhorrent\u201d and stripped Mr. Trump of his membership in the Global Scot business network. Kezia Dugdale, who runs the Scottish Labour Party, commented after Mr. Trump\u2019s election that a \u201cmisogynist\u201d would move into the White House, while Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, described him as a \u201c  guts, a   fool. \u201d And in Aberdeen, where 10 years ago public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Trump and his golf course, Robert Gordon University annulled Mr. Trump\u2019s honorary degree after his comments about barring Muslims from entering the United States. Some local residents remain fiercely loyal to him. Stewart Spence, owner of the exclusive Marcliffe hotel, has a photo of Mr. Trump and himself on display in the lobby as well as his own honorary membership of the Balmedie golf course. \u201cHow many tourists have the dunes brought in? Zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he has done is build a beautiful golf course and made the northeast of Scotland an amazing destination. \u201d As for the American election campaign, Mr. Spence said, \u201cHe has done a fantastic selling job to the American people. \u201d Until six years ago, the Munros could look out their kitchen window and see 10 miles across open land all the way to the Girdleness lighthouse on the other side of Aberdeen. Now they look out onto the nearly    earthen berm built by Mr. Trump\u2019s people. \u201cHe has a thing about walls, that Mr. Trump,\u201d Ms. Munro said. \u201cI hope America has a better experience than Balmedie. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561931.7640164}
