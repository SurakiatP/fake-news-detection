The real economy more than doubled in size the government now uses a substantial share of that bounty to hand over as much as $5 trillion to help working families, older people, disabled and unemployed people pay for a home, visit a doctor and put their children through school. Yet for half of all Americans, their share of the total economic pie has shrunk significantly, new research has found. This group  \u2014   the approximately 117 million adults stuck on the lower half of the income ladder  \u2014   \u201chas been completely shut off from economic growth since the 1970s,\u201d the team of economists found. \u201cEven after taxes and transfers, there has been close to zero growth for   adults in the bottom 50 percent. \u201d The new findings, by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, provide the most thoroughgoing analysis to date of how the income kitty  \u2014   like paychecks,   fringe benefits and food stamps  \u2014   is divided among the American population. Stagnant wages have sliced the share of income collected by the bottom half of the population to 12. 5 percent in 2014, from 20 percent of the total in 1980. Where did that money go? Essentially, to the top 1 percent, whose share of the nation\u2019s income nearly doubled to more than 20 percent during that same   period. Inequality has been a defining national issue for nearly a decade, thanks in part to groundbreaking research done by Mr. Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Mr. Saez at the University of California, Berkeley. But now a new administration in Washington is promising to reshape the government\u2019s role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind. During his tenure in the White House, President Obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance. Both strategies are now targeted by   Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Like many conservatives, Mr. Ryan argues that aid to the poor is ultimately counterproductive because it undermines the incentive to work. Proposals put forward by Republican leaders, though short on details, make clear that they want to roll back benefits like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which primarily help the poor, and direct the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. About 30 percent of the country\u2019s income is channeled to federal, state and local taxes. Apart from military spending and performing basic public services, much of that is distributed back to individuals through various programs and tax benefits in the form of Social Security checks, Medicare benefits and veterans\u2019 benefits. But until now, no one has truly measured the full impact that tax payments, government spending, noncash benefits and nontaxable income together have on inequality. Abundant documentation of income inequality already exists, but it has been challenged as incomplete. Studies have excluded the impact of taxes and value of public benefits, skeptics complained, or failed to account for the smaller size of households over time. This latest project tries to address those earlier criticisms. What the trio of economists found is that the spectacular growth in incomes at the peak has so outpaced the small increase at the bottom from public programs intended to ameliorate poverty and inequality that the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else has continued to widen. Average incomes, adjusted for inflation, grew by 61 percent from 1980 to 2014. But nearly $7 out of every additional $10 went to those in the top tenth of the income scale. Inequality has soared over that period. In 1980, the researchers found, someone in the top 1 percent earned on average the equivalent of $428, 200 a year in 2014 dollars  \u2014   about 27 times more than the typical person in the bottom half, whose annual income equaled $16, 000. By 2014, the average income of half of American adults had barely budged, remaining around $16, 000, while members of the top 1 percent brought home, on average, $1, 304, 800 or 81 times as much. That ratio, the authors point out, \u201cis similar to the gap between the average income in the United States and the average income in the world\u2019s poorest countries, the   Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Burundi. \u201d The growth of incomes has probably increased a bit since 2014, the latest year for which full data exists, said Mr. Zucman, who, like Mr. Saez, also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. But it is \u201cnot enough to make any significant difference to our   finding, and in particular, to affect the   stagnation of    incomes. \u201d He was to present the findings at a   workshop at the City University of New York on Tuesday. Tax credits and programs like Medicare and disability payments have helped families at the lower half of the income scale. But they have just nipped at the heels of the underlying trend. \u201cIt confirms the surge in income at the top,\u201d said Raj Chetty, an economist at Stanford unaffiliated with the project, who called the work \u201cterrific and very important. And it shows government redistribution doesn\u2019t really change the picture. \u201d Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard who also independently reviewed the research, agreed that the data underscored the inadequacies of programs that try to redress inequities after the fact. \u201cIt suggests that if you don\u2019t do something earlier in the market, before distribution, through better education or greater bargaining power, it\u2019s really tough to offset completely,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cCountries with less inequality do some of both. \u201d Mr. Katz and Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist, have argued that advances in technology, while crucial to improving productivity and generating economic growth, also have exacerbated inequality by driving down wages of   workers. The rewards of education are greater than they have ever been, but advancement nationwide has slowed and the system confers many of its favors on the children of the affluent. If there is a bright spot in the new comprehensive research, it is that after taxes and government spending, the middle class is in better shape than previous studies had shown. That earlier research had missed growth in nontaxable income like employee benefits. \u201cThe real income of the middle class is a bit better than we thought,\u201d Mr. Katz said. As troubling as some may find inequality, it is not necessarily the fault of a rigged system, said N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard who is familiar with the new research. He argues that large disparities in income more often than not accurately reflect widely varying economic contributions. \u201cInequality is a symptom of a variety of things,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. Technological progress may be a cause, but it benefits society over all, whereas the weakness of the educational system is clearly negative. Edward Conard, the author of \u201cThe Upside of Inequality\u201d and a former business partner of Mitt Romney, agreed. \u201cPeople say this is   game, and you\u2019re taking money that would have gone to the other 50 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. \u201d Instead, Mr. Conard said, entrepreneurs in the United States have been willing to take big risks that have helped foster an infrastructure that promotes innovation, not just in Silicon Valley but in many other growing places around the country. \u201cWhen rewards go up, people are more inclined to take risks,\u201d he said. Some of those risks pay off and create wealth for everyone. The new research challenges that contention, at least in part. Mr. Piketty, Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman concluded that the main driver of wealth in recent years has been investment income at the top. That is a switch from the 1980s and 1990s, when gains in income were primarily generated by working. That divergence can slow innovation and further entrench inequities, said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. When labor income provides the primary route to riches, it creates incentives for people to improve their education and work harder, Ms. Boushey explained. But if getting ahead requires already having a stockpile of cash or inheriting a windfall from your parents, then it is much harder to work your way up. \u201cIf you\u2019re closing off entryways, then you are basically shutting off avenues to competitiveness, innovation and growth,\u201d Ms. Boushey said, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t care about fairness. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562404.8556986}
