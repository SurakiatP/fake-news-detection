Trump. She was suspended immediately after her tweet, and her suspension is indefinite, according to someone familiar with the plans at \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d who was not authorized by NBC to comment on personnel matters. That tweet on Friday, during Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony, drew widespread condemnation, and Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the post (which said \u201cBarron will be this country\u2019s first homeschool shooter\u201d) and deactivated her Twitter account. Her name did not appear in the closing credits of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in its broadcast on Saturday. On Monday afternoon, Ms. Rich reactivated her account and posted a message that said: \u201cI sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions  offensive words. It was inexcusable  I\u2019m so sorry. \u201d The suspension of Ms. Rich, who was hired to join \u201cS. N. L. \u201d at the end of 2013, comes at a delicate time for the program, when it has felt emboldened to lampoon Mr. Trump but has faced his swift retaliation on Twitter. Following the show\u2019s broadcast of Jan. 14, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played Mr. Trump in a parody of his news conference from earlier that week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the following day: \u201cNBC News is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!\u201d Mr. Trump made no public comments about Saturday\u2019s show, in which Mr. Baldwin did not appear. NBC said on Monday that Mr. Baldwin will host \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d on Feb. 11 and appear throughout that program.'"}, "time": 1742563938.6870148}
