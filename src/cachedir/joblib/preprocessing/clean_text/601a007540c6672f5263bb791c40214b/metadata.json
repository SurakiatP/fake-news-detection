Dianne Feinstein ( ) is said to be considering retirement. [Several media outlets report that Schwarzenegger, who recently raised his profile with a series of Twitter clashes with President Donald Trump, is thinking of   the political fray after several years\u2019 absence.  Politico\u2019s Carla Marinucci reports: \u201cThe prospect of Schwarzenegger\u2019s return to elected politics in a 2018 U. S. Senate run  \u2014   possibly as an independent  \u2014   is generating increasing buzz in state Republican circles, fueled by the former governor\u2019s seeming ability to get under the skin of President Donald Trump on social media. \u201d Schwarzenegger also opposed Trump in the Republican presidential primary, backing Ohio governor John Kasich instead. If elected, Schwarzenegger could pose a significant opposition threat to the Trump administration on issues such as climate change. California\u2019s controversial    system was introduced under Schwarzenegger\u2019s administration. However, Schwarzenegger will have to confront his own political record along the way. Though he was   to a second term in 2006, Schwarzenegger is mostly remembered for leaving the state in a fiscal mess after abandoning the reform agenda that brought him to office in the first place. The East Bay Times recalls: The Republican governor\u2019s approval ratings fluctuated while he was in office and were as high as 63 percent in March 2007. But five months after he left office, a Field Poll found that three of four California voters surveyed had a negative image of Schwarzenegger in the wake of revelations he had fathered a boy with a former household staff member while married to TV journalist Maria Shriver. Whether he runs as an independent or as a Republican, Schwarzenegger would face stiff competition from a long line of California Democrats who have been waiting, patiently, to angle for Feinstein\u2019s seat.
