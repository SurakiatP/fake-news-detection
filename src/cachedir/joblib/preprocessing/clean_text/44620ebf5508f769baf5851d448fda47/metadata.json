In a statement, the Metropolitan Police Services (MPS) confirmed: \u201cAs part of the   and tested deployment under Operation Temperer the military will be working under the MPS command structure to provide static armed guarding at key locations. This will include Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Embassies and the Palace of Westminster. This will free up armed officers to carry out patrols. \u201d Commander Jane Connors, leading the London policing operation, said: \u201cWe are using every tactical option  \u2014   not just through the use of armed officers but ongoing work by the Counter Terrorism Command working with partner agencies and gathering community intelligence. \u201d He added: \u201cOperations for upcoming events are now under review and there will be additional security arrangements put in place. Specialist officers who are experts in protective security arrangements are advising businesses, event organisers and venues across London. \u201d UPDATE 2210 BST  \u2014    May raises threat level to critical, ready to deploy Army on the streets  \u2014   \u201cOperation Temperer is now in force. \u201d In a televised statement from Downing Street, Prime Minister Theresa May said the U. K.\u2019s terrorism threat level has been raised from severe to critical. ITV notes this level means \u201ca terrorist attack is considered imminent. \u201d \u201cIt is a possibility that we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack,\u201d said May. She said the higher threat level means \u201cthere will be additional support available to the police as they work to keep us safe. \u201d \u201cOperation Temperer is now in force,\u201d May stated. Operation Temperer is a plan formulated after the Paris massacre, once considered secret by the British government, that could put up to 5, 000 soldiers on the streets in the event of a major terrorist attack. May specifically stated that initiating Operation Temperer meant the protection of key sites would be handed over to military personnel instead of the police, freeing up police officers for other duties. \u201cYou might also see military personnel deployed at certain events, such as concerts and sports matches, helping the police to keep the public safe,\u201d the Prime Minister explained. \u201cIn all circumstances, members of the Armed Forces who are deployed in this way will be under the command of police officers. \u201d \u201cI do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cWe have faced a serious terrorist threat in our country for many years. The operational response I have just outlined is a proportionate and sensible response to the threat that our security experts judge we face. I ask everyone to be vigilant and to cooperate with and support the police as they go about their important work. \u201d \u201cThe spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain is far mightier than the sick plots of depraved terrorists,\u201d May declared. \u201cThat is why the terrorists will never win, and we will prevail. \u201d UPDATE 2115 BST  \u2014    Morrissey: \u201cPoliticians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. \u201d Singer Morrissey, who hails from Manchester and was celebrating his birthday in town when news of the bomb attack broke, wrote a furious Facebook post in which he excoriated British politicians for leaving the people at risk while they enjoy security protection. \u201cThe anger is monumental. For what reason will this ever stop?\u201d Morrissey asked, before calling everyone from the mayor of Manchester to the Queen of England on the carpet: Theresa May says such attacks \u201cwill not break us\u201d but her own life is lived in a   bubble, and she evidently does not need to identify any young people today in Manchester morgues. Also, \u201cwill not break us\u201d means that the tragedy will not break her, or her policies on immigration. The young people of Manchester are already broken  \u2014   thanks all the same, Theresa.  Sadiq Khan says \u201cLondon is united with Manchester\u201d but he does not condemn Islamic State  \u2014   who have claimed responsibility for the bomb. The Queen receives absurd praise for her \u2018strong words\u2019 against the attack, yet she does not cancel today\u2019s garden party at Buckingham Palace  \u2014   for which no criticism is allowed in the Britain of free press.  Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says the attack is the work of an \u201cextremist\u201d. An extreme what? An extreme rabbit? In modern Britain, everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private. Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections.

We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one,\u201d said team manager Jose Mourinho.

We accept that this is inevitable however we ask that people allow the police and coroner to release the names once the families are ready and appropriately supported. \u201cAs you would expect the police response to this across Greater Manchester has been significant as we support people to go about their daily business. \u201cPart of this response has seen us arrest a    man in connection with the attack and we have also carried out two warrants, one in Whalley Range and one in Fallowfield that included a controlled explosion to enable safe entry. \u201cWe understand that feelings are very raw right now and people are bound to be looking for answers. However, now, more than ever, it is vital that our diverse communities in Greater Manchester stand together and do not tolerate hate. \u201cWe have been visited by the Prime Minster and Home Secretary and we have taken them through the emergency response so far and what we plan to do in future days. \u201cI can confirm that the man suspected of carrying out last night\u2019s atrocity has been named as    Salman Abedi.

What this claim means for the investigation is unclear. The Islamic State has claimed many terror attacks in Europe in recent years  \u2014   an easy thing to do if the killer is already dead. It may be the case that while the Islamic State didn\u2019t have advance warning of the attack the killer may have been inspired by Islamic State propaganda, and informed by Islamic State documents on bomb making and attacks as has been the case in the past. #ISIS releases   version of claim for #Manchester bombing pic. twitter.   \u2014   SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) May 23, 2017,  UPDATE 1300 BST  \u2014   Associated Press: Islamic State claim responsibility for Manchester Suicide Bombing, The Associated Press agency has reported the Islamic State group has claimed one of their members was responsible for last night\u2019s attack.
