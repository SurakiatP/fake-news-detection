That last fact is no longer a secret to the American Public as this new Wikileaks Bombshell reveals Kadzik sent the Clinton Campaign the following: \\n\u201cHeads up. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.\u201d \\nFrom ZeroHedge : \\nOn Monday we were the first to note that Podesta\u2019s friend Peter Kadzik was the DOJ representative chosen to head up a \u201cthorough\u201d review of the new Huma Abedin emails as revealed by a letter he wrote to Congress. Given Kadzik\u2019s personal relationship with Podesta, it seemed like a \u201cconvenient\u201d choice for the Clinton campaign. \\nIn the letter to Congress, the DOJ writes that it \u201cwill continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,\u201d assistant attorney General Peter J. Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. \\n\u201cIronically\u201d, that is the same Peter Kadzik who has proven his \u201cimpartiality\u201d in multiple WikiLeaks emails including this newly released bombshell in which Kadzik provides a very helpful \u201cheads up\u201d about Hillary\u2019s email server investigation. \\nSure, who needs an independent investigator\u2026this guy will do just fine.'"}, "time": 1742563713.3891985}
