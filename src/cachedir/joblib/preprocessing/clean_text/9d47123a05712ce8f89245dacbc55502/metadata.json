The suspects held the \u201ctraumatized\u201d victim for as many as 48 hours, police said.  \u201cThe fact that this was a vulnerable person that was probably duped into going along with them. It appears it is someone who is mentally disabled, I think makes it even more sickening,\u201d said guest Matt Lewis. \u201cBut at the end of the day, you just try to wrap your head around evil. That\u2019s what this is, it\u2019s evil. It\u2019s brutality. It\u2019s man\u2019s inhumanity to man. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s evil,\u201d Lemon replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s evil. I think these are young people and I think they have bad home training. I say, who is raising these young people? I have no idea who\u2019s raising these young people. Because no one I know on Earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that. It is inhumane. And you wonder, at 18 years old, where is your parent? Where\u2019s your guardian?\u201d During the same discussion, Democrat strategist and former press secretary for Bernie Sanders Symone Sanders said the attack was \u201cnot a hate crime\u201d if the suspects were motivated by \u201chate of Donald Trump. \u201d  : Mediaite'"}, "time": 1742564579.839539}
