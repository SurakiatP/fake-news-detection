(Photo by AFP) \\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed as \u201chysteria\u201d claims by US officials that Moscow is trying to influence the upcoming presidential election in America. \\nSpeaking to foreign policy experts during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi, southern Russia, on Thursday, Putin said Washington was using Russia as a distraction to cover up the fact that this year\u2019s White House contenders had nothing to offer on real issues. \\n\u201cHysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election,\u201d Putin said, adding that so far no clear policies have been offered by the US political elite to tackle issues such as national debt and gun control. \\nAmerican officials and intelligence agencies have openly accused the Kremlin of sponsoring hacking attacks against the US. \\nThis is while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign have gone even further, claiming that Russia was trying to rig the November election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump.

I have nothing to do with Russia.\u201d \\n\u201cPeople are hacking all over the place and nobody knows. They don't know if it's Russia.
