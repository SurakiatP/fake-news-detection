O\u2019Keefe then released a video of Creamer stating that their \u201cDonald Ducks\u201d effort was at the request of the candidate herself. \\n\u201cEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters \u2026 I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising,\u201d Creamer says in the latest video. \\nHe also admits to working directly with Barack Obama, statements that are backed up by his 340 logged visits to the White House \u2014 where he met with Obama 45 times. \\n\u201cI do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the\u2026 the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.\u201d \\nTo gain access and trust, O\u2019Keefe reveals that he had provided a $20,000 donation to the Americans for United for Change super PAC from Belize. \\n\u201cThe more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get,\u201d Project Veritas said in their release .\\nFollowing the release of the first Veritas videos last week, the PAC suddenly returned the donation \u2014 stating that they were concerned it may have been illegal. \\n\u201cIn an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC\u2019s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars,\u201d Project Veritas explained. \u201c He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn\u2019t been a problem for the month that they had the money.\u201d \\nO\u2019Keefe has filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission against both Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee based upon the shocking revelations that his team has uncovered. \\nDuring a rally in Gettysburg on Saturday, Trump promised that he would also be suing the DNC for inciting violence at his rallies, based on what he saw in the Project Veritas videos. \\nThe post Another Project Veritas Bombshell: Pro-Clinton PAC Accepts Foreign Donations appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742561932.87377}
