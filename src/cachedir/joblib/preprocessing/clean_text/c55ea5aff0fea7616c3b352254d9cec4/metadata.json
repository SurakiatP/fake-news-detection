He countered with a 1.6 percent pay raise, below even what it takes to cover the cost of living. \\nThis will be the fourth straight year that Obama\u2019s pay raises for the military doesn\u2019t even keep up with average wage growth in the private sector. @Militarydotcom the 1.6% raise subtract the BAH cuts and healthcare \"reform\" means military members & veterans will loose $ this year \\n\u2014 Doc Bennett (@DocBennett1ID) June 14, 2016 \\nThis is all going on while the Obama Administration is spending untold millions bringing in improperly vetted Syrian refugees. @RMConservative @JBaker31826004 Obama spends $millions on admission of Syrian refugees & just cut the military pay raise from 2.1% to 1.6%. \\n\u2014 CDL (@TXCOL7) September 5, 2016 \\nWhen you add in rising health costs and the reduction in the housing allowance (BAH), it\u2019s a pretty significant cut in pay. \\nThe Independent Journal Review interviewed several veterans who are on disability and asked them how such a meager pay raise affects them: \\nChris receives 70% disability resulting from internal injuries and traumatic brain injury (TBI). His raise at 1.6%? Just $27 per month: \\n\u201cThe small increases [of living expenses] have affected our family of five. Not only do we have a cost increase of daily expenses and from adding a new baby, but living expenses have outpaced the raises dramatically. \\nIn the last year, our mortgage payment has gone up twice, totaling over $200 a month, just to keep up with our escrow. We are both working hard, more than we would like with three small kids, to survive and maintain our standard of living.\u201d \\nZach\u2019s disability rating is 50%: \\n\u201cA 1.6% increase would add $18.18 to my monthly award. So this year I could add less than a meal per month to the table. \\nI try to maintain a humble heart and mind; remembering the fact that the money I receive is a gift from God. So I do what I am able to with the gift given. But my cost of living continues to increase so my \u2018increase\u2019 basically just reduces the actual \u2018decrease\u2019 in salary.\u201d \\nIn addition to these cuts, the military is considering privatizing military commissaries, which most experts predict will result in higher food prices on base. \\nThis is a perfect example of what little regard Barack Obama has for America\u2019s fighting forces.'"}, "time": 1742563619.8985748}
