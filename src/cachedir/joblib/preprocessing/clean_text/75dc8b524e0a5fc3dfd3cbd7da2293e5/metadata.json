In a   statement issued as he resigned on Monday, Zachary Fardon, the United States attorney for Northern Illinois, outlined a plan for taking on crime and the ills of the Chicago Police Department, including a pattern of excessive force that was documented by the Justice Department in January. Most of all, he said, the Chicago police need a major increase in resources and a   consent decree, with a monitor, to make sure change occurs. \u201cFor decades, C. P. D. has been run on the cheap,\u201d Mr. Fardon wrote. \u201cOfficers don\u2019t have the training, the supervision, the equipment or the culture they need and deserve. \u201cIf you leave correcting those deficiencies to the vagaries of city politics, then you likely lose the   fight. \u201d Chicago police officials outlined a plan for improvement on Tuesday that they pledged to follow even if the Justice Department does not pursue a consent decree. Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the police training program would be overhauled, that supervision would be improved by having fewer officers assigned to each sergeant, and that a new    policy would soon be finalized. \u201cWe\u2019re not just saying we\u2019re going to reform  \u2014   we\u2019re showing you that we\u2019re reforming,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIf you go out there right now, C. P. D. is different than it was this time last year. So we don\u2019t need a piece of paper to ensure that we do it. We\u2019re doing it. \u201d Mr. Fardon was one of 46 United States attorneys whom the Trump administration told on Friday to resign immediately. The suddenness was unusual new presidents routinely remove the prosecutors but often keep them on while searching for their replacements. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, refused to step down and was fired. His counterpart in Montana, Michael W. Cotter, resigned but called the administration\u2019s handling of the matter \u201cvery unprofessional. \u201d A few others called it abrupt and unnecessary. Mr. Fardon\u2019s parting message was different, raising no objection to his ouster. Instead, it was a call to address a surge of violence in Chicago that has defied the efforts of police officers who \u201cin their quiet moments struggled with their own sense of frustration and despair. \u201d Mr. Johnson called Mr. Fardon \u201ca great partner\u201d to the Police Department and said he agreed with Mr. Fardon\u2019s call for more prosecutions on federal gun laws. He also addressed Mr. Fardon\u2019s claim that police officers had become hamstrung and too passive on patrol. \u201cListen, there are things within C. P. D. that we did need to fundamentally change, and we\u2019re changing them,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, adding that officers were focusing on arresting gun offenders and other serious criminals. \u201cI think that the    understand that we have a job to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, we swore an oath to protect the citizens of the city, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. \u201d Donovan Price, an   activist who agreed with parts of Mr. Fardon\u2019s statement, said, \u201cI believe he shed some tears when he wrote this. \u201d Consent decrees and federal oversight, favorite tools of the Obama administration and police critics, are opposed by many conservatives, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Fardon criticized budget cuts that have thinned the ranks of federal prosecutors. He called for a significant increase and better cooperation among federal law enforcement agencies. But he also said that criticism of the police, and efforts to restrain them, had undermined morale and contributed to the rise in crime  \u2014   a claim often made by conservatives but rejected by liberal advocates of police reform. Mr. Fardon took particular aim at a 2015 agreement between the police and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois that sharply curtailed the number of people  \u2014   primarily black men  \u2014   the police could stop on Chicago\u2019s streets. He wrote that the settlement had told officers, \u201cIf you go talk to those kids on the corner, you\u2019re going to have to take 40 minutes to fill out a form. \u201d He said that change, along with the firing of a police superintendent and the release of a video showing an officer shooting a    Laquan McDonald, 16 times, had created a morale crisis. As officers made fewer stops, he said, \u201ckids started shooting more. \u201d Karen Sheley, director of police practices for the A. C. L. U. of Illinois, said Mr. Fardon had overstated the burden of the 2015 agreement, adding, \u201cTrying to blame reform for a rise in crime is a mistake. \u201d Many cities had increases in violent crime last year, but Chicago stood out as homicides jumped more than 50 percent, to 762, more than New York and Los Angeles combined. Mr. Fardon wrote that   communities needed a far bigger police presence and more programs to divert young people from gangs. And he called for an aggressive crackdown on social media, where people air grievances that escalate to gunfire. These prescriptions require money, so their prospects are unsure, at best, in a city and state with serious financial challenges and under an administration in Washington that has promised to cut spending. Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a law enforcement research group, praised some of the ideas and was hesitant about others. But he said it was important that Mr. Fardon had aired them. \u201cThere are a lot of people that work in the criminal justice system that feel deeply and personally about these issues, but the public doesn\u2019t hear that very often,\u201d Mr. Bueermann said. \u201cI think more prosecutors and police chiefs should do what he did. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564178.4965503}
