{"duration": 0.4965548515319824, "input_args": {"text": "'TORONTO  \u2014   One frigid day in February, Kerry McLorg drove to an airport hotel here to pick up a family of Syrian refugees. She was cautious by nature, with a job poring over insurance data, but she had never even spoken to the people who were about to move into her basement. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even know we exist,\u201d she said. At the hotel, Abdullah Mohammad\u2019s room phone rang, and an interpreter told him to go downstairs. His children\u2019s only belongings were in pink plastic bags, and the family\u2019s documents lay in a white paper bag printed with a Canadian flag. His sponsors had come, he was told. He had no idea what that meant. Across Canada, ordinary citizens, distressed by news reports of drowning children and the shunning of desperate migrants, are intervening in one of the world\u2019s most pressing problems. Their country allows them a rare power and responsibility: They can band together in small groups and personally resettle  \u2014   essentially adopt  \u2014   a refugee family. In Toronto alone, hockey moms,   friends, book club members, poker buddies and lawyers have formed circles to take in Syrian families. The Canadian government says sponsors officially number in the thousands, but the groups have many more extended members. When Ms. McLorg walked into the hotel lobby to meet Mr. Mohammad and his wife, Eman, she had a letter to explain how sponsorship worked: For one year, Ms. McLorg and her group would provide financial and practical support, from subsidizing food and rent to supplying clothes to helping them learn English and find work. She and her partners had already raised more than 40, 000 Canadian dollars (about $30, 700) selected an apartment, talked to the local school and found a nearby mosque. Ms. McLorg, the mother of two teenagers, made her way through the crowded lobby, a kind of purgatory for newly arrived Syrians. Another member of the group clutched a welcome sign she had written in Arabic but then realized she could not tell if the words faced up or down. When the Mohammads appeared, Ms. McLorg asked their permission to shake hands and took in the people standing before her, no longer just names on a form. Mr. Mohammad looked older than his 35 years. His wife was unreadable, wearing a flowing niqab that obscured her face except for a narrow slot for her eyes. Their four children, all under 10, wore donated parkas with the tags still on. For the Mohammads, who had been in Canada less than 48 hours, the signals were even harder to read. In Syria, Abdullah had worked in his family\u2019s grocery stores and Eman had been a nurse, but after three years of barely hanging on in Jordan, they were not used to being wanted or welcomed. \u201cYou mean we\u2019re leaving the hotel?\u201d Abdullah asked. To himself, he was wondering, \u201cWhat do these people want in return?\u201d Much of the world is reacting to the refugee crisis  \u2014   21 million displaced from their countries, nearly five million of them Syrian  \u2014   with hesitation or hostility. Greece shipped desperate migrants back to Turkey Denmark confiscated their valuables and even Germany, which has accepted more than half a million refugees, is struggling with growing resistance to them. Broader anxiety about immigration and borders helped motivate Britons to take the extraordinary step last week of voting to leave the European Union. In the United States, even before the Orlando massacre spawned new dread about \u201clone wolf\u201d terrorism, a majority of American governors said they wanted to block Syrian refugees because some could be dangerous. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called for temporary bans on all Muslims from entering the country and recently warned that Syrian refugees would cause \u201cbig problems in the future. \u201d The Obama administration promised to take in 10, 000 Syrians by Sept. 30 but has so far admitted about half that many. Just across the border, however, the Canadian government can barely keep up with the demand to welcome them. Many volunteers felt called to action by the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler whose body washed up last fall on a Turkish beach. He had only a slight connection to Canada  \u2014   his aunt lived near Vancouver  \u2014   but his death caused recrimination so strong it helped elect an idealistic,   prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The Toronto Star greeted the first planeload by splashing \u201cWelcome to Canada\u201d in English and Arabic across its front page. Eager sponsors toured local Middle Eastern supermarkets to learn what to buy and cook and used a   hotline for instant Arabic translation. Impatient   sponsors  \u2014   \u201can angry mob of \u201d The Star called them  \u2014   have been seeking more families. The new government committed to taking in 25, 000 Syrian refugees and then raised the total by tens of thousands. \u201cI can\u2019t provide refugees fast enough for all the Canadians who want to sponsor them,\u201d John McCallum, the country\u2019s immigration minister, said in an interview. In the ideal version of private sponsorship, the groups become concierges and surrogate family members who help integrate the outsiders, called \u201cNew Canadians. \u201d The hope is that the Syrians will form bonds with those unlike them, from openly gay sponsors to business owners who will help them find jobs to lifelong residents who will take them skating and canoeing. Ms. McLorg\u2019s group of neighbors and friends includes doctors, economists, a lawyer, an artist, teachers and a bookkeeper. Advocates for sponsorship believe that private citizens can achieve more than the government alone, raising the number of refugees admitted, guiding newcomers more effectively and potentially helping solve the puzzle of how best to resettle Muslims in Western countries. Some advocates even talk about extending the Canadian system across the globe. (Slightly fewer than half of the Syrian refugees who recently arrived in Canada have private sponsors, including some deemed particularly vulnerable who get additional public funds. The rest are resettled by the government.) The fear is that all of this effort could end badly, with the Canadians looking na\u00efve in more ways than one. The Syrians are screened, and many sponsors and refugees take offense at the notion that they could be dangerous, saying they are often victims of terrorism themselves. But American officials point out that it is very difficult to track activity in the chaotic, multifaceted Syrian war. Several Islamic State members involved in the 2015 Paris attacks arrived on Europe\u2019s shores from Syria posing as refugees. Some of the refugees in Canada have   and   backgrounds, including a businessman who started a Canadian version of his medical marketing company within a month after arriving. But many more face steep paths to integration, with no money of their own, uncertain employment prospects and huge cultural gaps. Some had never heard of Canada until shortly before coming here, and a significant number are illiterate in Arabic, which makes learning English  \u2014   or reading a street sign or sending an email in any language  \u2014   a titanic task. No one knows how refugees will navigate the currents of longing, trauma, dependence or resentment they may feel. And volunteers cannot fully anticipate what they may confront  \u2014   clashing expectations of whether Syrian women should work, tensions over how money is spent, families that are still dependent when the year is up, disagreements within sponsor groups. Still, by   only eight weeks after their first encounter with Ms. McLorg, the Mohammads had a downtown apartment with a pristine kitchen, bikes for the children to zip around the courtyard, and a Canadian flag taped to their window. The sponsors knew the children\u2019s shoe sizes Abdullah and Eman still had keys to Ms. McLorg\u2019s house. He studied the neighborhood\u2019s supermarkets, and his wife took a counseling course so she could help others who had experienced dislocation and loss. When the male sponsors visited, she sat at the dining room table with them instead of eating in the kitchen  \u2014   as she would have done back home  \u2014   as long as her husband was around, too. Mr. Mohammad searched for the right words to describe what the sponsors had done for him. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve been on fire, and now I\u2019m safe in the water,\u201d he said. But he and other new arrivals were beginning to confront fresh questions: How were they supposed to work with these enthusiastic strangers? What would it mean to reinvent their lives under their watch? As sponsors sign the paperwork that commits them, no one really explains the potential range of their unofficial duties: showing a newcomer to spit in a dentist\u2019s sink by miming the motions, rushing over late at night to calm a   family terrified by a garage door blown open by the wind, or using Google Translate to tell children who lived through war and exile that they are supposed to wear pink at school for   day. One April morning, Liz Stark, the grandmother in chief of another sponsor group, could not find Mouhamad Ahmed, the father in the family. She tried his phone and waited in vain outside their new apartment. This was a problem: Wissam, his wife, was in labor with their fifth child. The pregnancy had been anxious because the couple had lost even more than their old life in Syria, where Mr. Ahmed used to farm wheat, cotton and cumin. They had spent years in a refugee camp in Lebanon, their three children never attending school because tuition was too expensive. Ms. Ahmed became pregnant there with their fourth child, but labor was troubled and the girl lived only six hours. They named her Amira, which means princess. \u201cI was thinking maybe the same thing will happen to me here as well,\u201d Ms. Ahmed said. As Ms. Stark hunted for Mr. Ahmed, Peggy Karas, another sponsor, stayed at the hospital massaging Ms. Ahmed\u2019s hand during contractions. Like other such pairs, the two women had come together through opaque, bureaucratic machinery. A United Nations agency referred Ms. Ahmed and her family to Canadian officials who interviewed and screened them, then passed their file to a new nonprofit dedicated to matching Syrians with private sponsors, who had 24 hours to say yes or no based on the barest of details. Ms. Stark and many of her   were retired teachers, bossy and doting, and they had become hellbent on bringing this new child into the world safely. They had introduced Ms. Ahmed to the vitamins she would take, the machines that would monitor her, the hospital ward where she would deliver. The older women had repeated the doctors\u2019 reassurances that all would go smoothly this time. They had helped her pick out tiny outfits and baby gear, but she was too superstitious to take them home, so they formed a small mountain in a sponsor\u2019s living room. Ms. Stark had recruited another newly arrived Syrian refugee to serve as an interpreter during labor. When she finally found Mr. Ahmed, who had been playing soccer, unaware of what was happening, she ushered him to the hospital room, where he took over holding his wife\u2019s hand. Suddenly a medical team rushed her away, saying the umbilical cord was in a dangerous position and she needed an emergency cesarean section. Ms. Ahmed, terrified, asked her husband to take care of their children if she did not survive. As Mr. Ahmed collapsed, sobbing, the sponsors asked his permission to pray. When a nurse finally appeared to say the newborn was healthy, whisked off to intensive care for observation, Ms. Ahmed said she would not believe it until she held the baby, but Mr. Ahmed was jubilant. He called his father in Syria and let him choose a name: Julia, the family\u2019s first Canadian citizen. Once the infant was home, she went from being the Ahmed family member the sponsors worried about most to the one they fretted about least. She would grow up hearing English, going to Canadian preschool and beyond. For her siblings  \u2014      twins, a boy and a girl, and an    brother  \u2014   the sponsors found a program for children who had never been to school. Their father, who had gone through only second grade, worked on learning enough English to find a job. Ms. Ahmed worried about her children. \u201cWhat if my kids don\u2019t adjust, don\u2019t settle in school very well?\u201d she asked. Everyone was on a deadline: After one year, the sponsors\u2019 obligation ends, and the families are expected to become  . Toronto rents are high, and the Ahmeds may not be able to stay in the relatively inexpensive apartment the sponsors found for them  \u2014   the monthly rent is 1, 400 Canadian dollars, or about $1, 100  \u2014   even if Mr. Ahmed finds a job. Ms. Stark was optimistic because she had lived through other versions of this story. Almost four decades ago, as a young geography teacher, she joined in the first mass wave of Canadian private sponsorship, in which citizens resettled tens of thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Hmong. She helped sponsor three Vietnamese brothers and a Cambodian family, later attending their weddings, celebrating the births of their children and watching them find their places in Toronto, a city so diverse that half the population is  . Now some former Southeast Asian refugees are completing the cycle by sponsoring Syrians. Like many sponsors, Ms. Stark believes that her country is especially suited to resettling refugees, with its vast size, strong social welfare system, and a government that emphasizes multiculturalism. Canada has not endured acts of terrorism like the Sept. 11 hijackings or the Paris attacks, or even an assault on the scale of the Orlando nightclub killings. And with only one land border, little illegal immigration and a tenth of the population of the United States, Canada is hungry for migrants. Officials around the country have clamored to bring Syrian refugees to their provinces. \u201cWe are an accident of geography and history,\u201d said Ratna Omidvar, who   Lifeline Syria, a group that matches Syrians with sponsors. Opposition to the influx has been relatively muted. The Conservative Party argues that the country is taking in more refugees than it can provide for, but supports accepting Syrians. Some Canadians complain that the country should take care of its own first, and new chapters of the Soldiers of Odin, a European   group, have cropped up in recent months. A few incidents targeting Syrians  \u2014   graffiti reading \u201cSyrians go home and die\u201d at a Calgary school, a pepper spray attack at an event welcoming refugees  \u2014   drew widespread condemnation. One May evening, three weeks after Julia\u2019s birth, Ms. Stark stopped by the Ahmeds\u2019 apartment with a plastic table for the balcony and cradled the baby. She had a new grandchild, but she had spent more time with Julia. The   retirees were planning a party to welcome her the Syrian way, by feasting on a newly slaughtered lamb on her 40th day. Meanwhile, Mr. Ahmed had adopted a new custom: He sometimes brought his wife breakfast in bed and got the children ready. \u201cWhen I came here, I saw men just doing everything that women do in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought, yeah, of course, I will do the same. \u201d That night, Ms. Ahmed handed Ms. Stark a form from the twins\u2019 school, unsure what it was about. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to the Blue Jays game?\u201d she crowed to the boy, Majed, who grinned back under his dark curls. Then she turned to his parents. \u201cThis costs money, but your sponsors will pay for it because this is important. \u201d The Ahmeds were so frugal that their benefactors sometimes worried whether they were buying enough to eat. Ms. Ahmed said they wanted to purchase no more than the family needed. \u201cThe sponsors worked for the money they are giving us, and we\u2019re not just going to throw it in the garbage,\u201d she explained later. Before leaving, Ms. Stark explained the proper Tylenol dosage for the couple\u2019s daughter, Zahiya, who had a fever. She and her twin now spent their school bus rides exchanging language lessons with a pair of Chinese brothers, pointing to objects and naming them. One day when their parents tried to bring them home after a dentist appointment, the Syrian children refused, insisting on returning to school for the time remaining. English words were starting to emerge from the older children\u2019s mouths, but the sponsors and the adult refugees could barely understand one another without help, often relying on mimed gestures or balky translation apps. Even when the groups use interpreters, they often get stuck in roundelays of Canadian and Syrian courtesy, so reluctant to impose that they do not say what they mean. Ms. Ahmed, who had a   education and was not attending English classes because she was home with a newborn, said that not being able to communicate was painful. \u201cSometimes I feel like I am losing my mind,\u201d she said, because she felt so close to the sponsors but could not even tell them little things about the baby. Still, some groups faced greater challenges. Some Syrians have backed out before traveling to Canada, intimidated by the geographic and cultural leap. Sam Nammoura, a refugee advocate in Calgary, said he was tracking dozens of cases in which   sponsored friends and relatives and then left them destitute. Other pairings have turned out to be mismatches of expectations one formerly   Syrian family expressed disappointment that its apartment was a     and lacked a washing machine. Others were shocked to discover that their sponsors were posting Facebook messages and blog entries about them that strangers could read. Even when sponsors and refugees become enmeshed in one another\u2019s lives, they do not fully know one another. Not every family is open about its history, and many sponsors would like to know the worst but do not want to ask. (The Ahmeds and the Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, and were reluctant to publicly share details of their experiences in Syria because they feared reprisals against relatives still there. Most of the refugees in this article left Syria around 2013, during fighting between the Assad regime and rebels.) The sponsors do not share everything about themselves, either. Emma Waverman, the leader of another cluster, was telling her   about the stirring bar mitzvah speech her son had written about the Syrians they were aiding when another woman stopped her. \u201cDo they know we\u2019re Jewish?\u201d she asked. Few issues are as delicate as how hard the sponsors should push and when the refugees can say no. Should the Syrians live close to downtown sponsors or in   neighborhoods with more Middle Easterners  \u2014   and is it right for sponsors to decide without consulting them? The Canadians raise tens of thousands of dollars for each newcomer family who controls how it is spent? Some worry that sponsors are overpowering the refugees with the force of their enthusiasm. Kamal   a journalism professor at Ryerson University who is originally from Yemen, said he had noticed a patronizing tone, as when some sponsors highlighted their volunteering on social media. \u201cThe white savior narrative comes into play,\u201d he said. When Muaz and Sawsan Ballani and their    son arrived here in February, they seemed so disoriented and alone that their sponsors became especially eager to nurture them. Mr. Ballani, 26, had once worked in his father\u2019s clothing store, which was run out of their home. Now he introduced himself to his sponsors by showing them a picture of his oldest brother: not a smiling snapshot, but an image of the young man lying dead back home, blood streaming from his body. (Mr. Ballani believed that his brother had been caught in fighting between the regime and the opposition, but in the chaos of the conflict, he said, he could not learn more.) Sawsan wed Muaz when she was 16 in an arranged marriage, rushed because of bombings and failing electricity a month later, they fled. Now 20, she had not seen her family since. The couple had been languishing in Jordan, sleeping in a house crammed with too many people, not enough beds or blankets, and ants that crawled over their son, named Abdulrahman, after Mr. Ballani\u2019s dead brother, and nicknamed Aboudi. One of Mr. Ballani\u2019s brothers was still stuck in the house in Jordan, he said, and his brother\u2019s widow was living in a park in Syria with her three children, foraging for food. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come here, we would have died,\u201d he said. The family\u2019s sponsors started as mostly strangers to one another  \u2014   a few former colleagues, a friend of a friend. Helga Breier, a market research consultant and one of the organizers, was drawn into sponsorship last summer, when she felt haunted during her Mediterranean vacation by the suffering across the water. The Ballanis became their galvanizing cause. Together they found a bright apartment near their homes and countered the bareness  \u2014   the family had few belongings  \u2014   with cheery posters and tags labeling everything in English: lamp, cupboard, wall, door. The couple spoke almost no English, so to teach Mr. Ballani to get where he needed to go, the sponsors helped him photograph the route. When Aboudi threw tantrums in day care, they sat with him so his mother could stay in language class. The couple cooked elaborate Middle Eastern   meals for the sponsors and mostly welcomed their interventions. Mr. Ballani donned a Toronto Maple Leafs hat that he wore day after day, and his wife gamely hopped on a toboggan. Sometimes the sponsors barely hid their views of how the Ballanis should adjust. At a spring potluck dinner, Ms. Ballani described how she had recently traveled by subway on her own, a trip she could not have imagined taking just a few weeks before. The sponsors around the table, firm feminists, asked what else she might like to do herself. She turned to her husband. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you an honest question,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you let me work here?\u201d As they waited for the answer, the Canadian women held their breath. \u201cYes, but I wouldn\u2019t have let you work back\u201d in Jordan, he said, adding that even women who behaved traditionally there were often harassed and that those who appeared too independent faced worse. Ms. Ballani pressed forward: She wanted to attend university and have a career of her own, she said, a daunting set of goals for a woman with only a   education. The Canadians beamed two   each other. At the same time, the sponsors worried that they were becoming helicopter parents, as Ms. Breier put it. When the Syrians skipped English lessons (Aboudi sometimes kept them awake at night) or missed an appointment for donated dental services (a misunderstanding) the sponsors agonized over what to say, debating on the messaging app Slack. Should they show up every morning at the Ballanis\u2019 apartment to make sure they got to class? Aboudi did not nap regularly and seemed to consume a lot of sugar  \u2014   he drank soda, sometimes for breakfast  \u2014   so should they offer advice? Mr. Nammoura, the refugee advocate in Calgary, said he saw a pattern among the cases. The Canadians, who feel responsible for the refugees\u2019 success, want to give them as much help and direction as possible. But many Syrians, finally safe after years of war and flight, want to exhale before launching into language regimens and job searches, and sometimes feel that sponsors are meddling. When the Ballani sponsors sought advice from an Arab community center caseworker and an older Syrian mother, they were told to be harsher  \u2014   to threaten fines or loss of sponsorship if the couple did not accept their guidance. Instead, the sponsors tried to strike a balance, being insistent on issues like health and education but easing off in other areas. A few weeks before Ramadan, the Ballanis raised the prospect of missing school during the month of long fasts. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard because we have to fast 16 or 18 hours,\u201d Muaz Ballani told the sponsors. Ms. Breier and her partners dismissed the idea, saying they feared that the couple would lose their slots if they missed too many classes. The Ballanis quickly relented. It was not clear how much freedom they felt to express disagreement to outsiders they seemed reluctant to acknowledge anything but gratitude. That morning, Ms. Ballani said she and her husband never had different opinions from the sponsors. \u201cWe\u2019ve never felt like they were telling us what to do,\u201d she added. Another weekend, the extended group gathered for a picnic, the first birthday party anyone had thrown for Mr. Ballani. He was deeply moved by the gesture. \u201cA human life has value here,\u201d he had said in an interview. \u201cYou can feel it everywhere. \u201d But the conversation at the party turned to his relatives in Syria, and he seemed distant as the Canadians presented his cake. Like many of the newcomers, he regularly receives calls and texts from family members, some in harrowing straits, as news reports describe starvation back home and mass drownings in the Mediterranean. \u201cI am really thankful to them I don\u2019t want them to misunderstand,\u201d he said later about the sponsors. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m two people at the same time, one happy and one unhappy,\u201d because of his family\u2019s continued suffering. The sponsors had been working on that, too, helping match Mr. Ballani\u2019s brother in Jordan with another Toronto sponsor group and laboring over the paperwork. By late spring they had news: His relatives could arrive by year\u2019s end. Mr. Ballani, overjoyed, started planning what he would show his relatives in the city that had taken him in. This time, he would be the guide. \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to help,\u201d he said. Three months after the Mohammads\u2019 awkward first meeting with Kerry McLorg and the other sponsors at the airport hotel, they had clicked into a productive rhythm, settling into Canada faster than anyone had expected. They went on a picnic to Niagara Falls and danced around a maypole at a spring festival. The girls won     honors. Bayan, the eldest, who had whipped past the boys she raced on Jordanian streets, was now beating runners from schools across the city. When the sponsors came to give informal language lessons, Ahmad, the    liked to try new phrases in English, such as \u201cGood job!\u201d Still, there was some culture shock. When Abdullah Mohammad took the children to a community pool, he encountered a woman in a string bikini. \u201cI ran away,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before in my life. \u201d Ms. McLorg, measured and methodical, had organized the sponsor group, but the most energetic member was an artist named Susan Stewart, with a seemingly endless list of activities for the family and long email exchanges with the children\u2019s teachers. During her turn to give English lessons, she brought flashcards down to the courtyard, telling the children to alternate between loops on their bicycles and new words. She was sweetly relentless, which was partly why the family had made so much progress, the other sponsors said. When Mr. Mohammad voiced interest in working, Ms. Stewart became consumed with helping him find a job. Of all the tests for the family  \u2014   and, by extension, the sponsors  \u2014   this was perhaps the most crucial. So Ms. Stewart found an   settlement counselor to advise Mr. Mohammad and drove him to a job fair for refugees, where they struck up a conversation with a Syrian supermarket owner. After he invited Mr. Mohammad for an interview, Ms. Stewart fashioned a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from a questionnaire she had helped him fill out. \u201cI am keen to learn all aspects of the trade from stocking and organizing shelves to marketing strategies and Canadian shopping habits,\u201d she wrote. Describing his work experience  \u2014   doing odd jobs during his three years in Jordan  \u2014   she wrote, \u201cAs a refugee I had to be resourceful and find work wherever I could. \u201d Even though the interview would be in Arabic, she drilled him in English phrases like \u201cI can stock shelves. \u201d \u201cTen more times!\u201d she told him as they drove to the interview. When he was offered the   position, the sponsors were thrilled. But a few days later, he called the Canadians to say he would turn it down. He struggled with taking money from the sponsors  \u2014   back home, others had come to his family for help, and it was \u201creally hard to be on the receiving end,\u201d he said. But he wanted to consider options, such as becoming a mechanic. In Syria or Jordan, he had never had freedom to choose his work. \u201cIt\u2019s always what you have to do to earn a living rather than what you really want to do,\u201d he said later. And he did not want to take a job until he improved his English, he said, because he did not want any more favors or charity. At the supermarket, unable to answer basic questions from customers, \u201cI would be a burden to my employer,\u201d he added. He had been annoyed at Ms. Stewart for pressing so hard, he said later, but mostly he was embarrassed to pass on the job after she had done so much. But Ms. McLorg saw a plus side: Mr. Mohammad was starting to navigate his own path in Canada, and the relationship between the sponsors and the family, so lopsided at the start, was beginning to balance out. \u201cOur job was to help them come into Canada and show them the options that are here,\u201d she said. In   at the end of a routine meeting with the sponsors and the Mohammads, she shared news of her own: She had breast cancer. Now that she was facing surgery, she was the one who was vulnerable, and the Syrians were the ones who were checking on her. They brought flowers and chocolates the other sponsors, now practiced in the logistics of caring, offered meal deliveries and other assistance. \u201cI had no intention of building my own support group, but I have one now,\u201d Ms. McLorg said. Bayan and Batoul, the two oldest Mohammad children, made   cards using the same set of watercolors the sponsors had used to make greeting signs that first day at the airport hotel. The morning after Ms. McLorg\u2019s operation, when she made her way down to her living room, the cards were the first things she saw.'"}, "time": 1742562434.5040236}
