The only daughter of Bill Clinton\u2019s druggie brother explained to Radar Online that she will be voting for Donald Trump instead of her \u201cselfish\u201d aunt. \\nMacy Smit, a hairstylist from Tampa, Florida said, \u201cI support Donald Trump \u2014 100 percent! I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now \u2014 somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books \u2014 to be the first woman president for selfish reasons.\u201d \\nMacy\u2019s husband Derrick Smit is a meteorologist with the US Air Force and is currently on active duty in Kuwait, where he assists with air operations into and out of Iraq. \\nMacy\u2019s mother, Martha Spivey, agreed with her daughter about Hillary Clinton\u2019s selfish nature. In an interview with Radar, she said, \u201cThe Clintons are all talk! Hillary says she\u2019s all about family, but she\u2019s got a niece she\u2019s never met and never acknowledged. The Clintons have never helped us out.\u201d \\nMacy explained in the interview that her estranged father, Roger Clinton, makes a lot of promises that he never keeps. Does this sound familiar?
