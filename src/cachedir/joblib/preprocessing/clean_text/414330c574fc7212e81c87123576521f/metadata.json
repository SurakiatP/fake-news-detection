The mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. \\nAll victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. The incidents took place over the past seven years during \u201cquranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at \u2018spreading the quranic culture\u2019 and to participate in quranic competitions.\u201d \\nToosi is highly respected as Iran\u2019s most celebrated reader of the Quran and was previously called an \u201cexemplary model to be followed\u201d by Khamenei, current supreme leader of Iran. He is a permanent guest of Khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during Ramadan. Last May, Toosi was asked to recite verses from the Quran at the opening session of the Shura council, with many of Iran\u2019s top officials in attendance. \\nThe students told Persian VOA they had filed charges with the House of Leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a \u201crepentance letter\u201d from Toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a \u201cchanged man.\u201d \\nWhile Iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. The case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the Islamic Republic. \\nAccording to the reformist Amad News, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. The initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in Toosi now being charged. \\nJudiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, whom the victims\u2019 audio showed conspiring with Khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regime\u2019s handling of the case, London Guardian reported. Larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with \u201chostile media\u201d in the VOA story, \u201cso we know who is [loyal] to the revolution and who is not.\u201d \\nThe case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. Awad News reports members of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution are planning to \u201cassassinate\u201d Toosi to end the scandal and save the regime\u2019s reputation. \\nToosi, who has denied the charges against him \u2013 calling them \u201ctotal lies\u201d meant to discredit Iran\u2019s religious institutions and the ayatollah \u2013 is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of Iran\u2019s top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds.'"}, "time": 1742563127.0396214}
