Tom Booker, an accounts administrator from Maidstone, is rising above the frantic speculation with an annoyingly philosophical approach like he is some sort of mystical guru. Co-worker Nikki Hollis said: \u201cThe office is rife with chat about whether Donald Trump is going to annihilate us all by declaring war on China, or if Hillary Clinton is actually a robot controlled by the Illuminati, but Tom won\u2019t join in. \u201cHe just gives this beatific smile and says something like \u2018guys, it\u2019s out of our hands\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s up to America to make their choice\u2019 and then changes the subject. \u201cHe won\u2019t even join in with our misty-eyed chat about how much we admire Barack Obama and secretly fancy Michelle. \u201cI used to think he was just a laidback guy, but his lack of hysterical overreaction is making me suspect he voted for Brexit.\u201d Booker said: \u201cI just think they need to chill out.
