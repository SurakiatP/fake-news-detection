[Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, arrested the      for allegedly setting fire to a market owned by an immigrant from Bhutan. The arsonist left a note, which began: \u201cOur newly elected president Donald Trump is our nation builder for white America. \u201d  The culprit in the   and fire not only attempted to depict white supporters of the president as violent racists, but as   as well. \u201cYou all know that, we want our country back on the right track,\u201d he informed. \u201cWe need to get rid of Muslims, Indians and all immigrants. Specially, we don\u2019t want business by refugees and immigrant any more. \u201d The staged hate crime mirrors several other faux attacks on religious and ethnic minorities in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s political emergence. In Manhattan in December, a Muslim woman claimed a trio of white drunks assaulted her on a crowded subway train and pulled on her hijab while chanting   slogans and issuing   taunts. Earlier in Mississippi, news reports indicated a hate crime when \u201cVote Trump\u201d appeared   on a   black church. Police later arrested an   parishioner for the crime. Whereas the Muslim college   allegedly made up the story to avoid the wrath of her father after breaking curfew, the culprit in the Charlotte attack appears to have harbored no motive save for embarrassing white Trump supporters. He broke a window and set fire to the establishment. He did not steal anything, save for a sentence\u2019s right to   agreement. \u201cWe are ready to wake up some of our great state including North Carolina and we will take care of the country he typed. \u201cImmigrants and refugee are taking our job, doing business and leaving us standard. So, you are not allowed to do business any more. \u201d After a \u201cGod Bless America\u201d complementary close, the   identified himself as \u201cWhite America. \u201d But the racist surveillance video shows a black American. Throw the book at him \u2014  Strunk and White\u2019s Elements of Style.'"}, "time": 1742564270.1362312}
