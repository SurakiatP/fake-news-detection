At the crime scene, cartel members left a note stating that the murder was due to her reporting. [On Thursday morning, unknown gunmen shot Miroslava Breach, a career journalist who worked as an editor for El Norte and most recently for La Jornada. According to La Jornada, Breach was leaving her home at approximately 7:15 a. m. on Thursday morning in the city of Chihuahua when she was fatally shot. At the crime scene, the gunmen left behind a poster board that read \u201cpor lenguona. Sigue tu Gobernador. El 80\u201d. The message in the sign claims that the reporter was murdered for saying too much and that the state governor was next.   The message was signed by \u201cEl 80\u201d pointing to Carlos Arturo Quintana, a top leader within the Juarez Cartel (Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Cartel). As Breitbart Texas reported this week, Quintana\u2019s gunmen are responsible for a fierce gun battle that killed at least 8 victims and spread terror and despair through the rural communities near Chihuahua. Quintana is wanted by the FBI as part of an ongoing federal case against him on multiple drug trafficking charges tied to the cartel.  Breach\u2019s murder comes just days after Breitbart Texas reported that gunmen murdered Ricardo Monlui Cabrera, a journalist from Veracruz who was murdered as he walked with his wife.  As information about Breach\u2019s murder began to be released, the Network of Journalists of Mexico\u2019s Northeast (RPNM) expressed outrage for the apparent lack response by the Mexican government.  \u201cWe demand an expedited response to punish those responsible in a material and in an intellectual fashion for these attacks on the freedom of expression,\u201d the statement noted.  According to the RPNM, Breach\u2019s most recent work was tied to the raging cartel violence in Chihuahua.   politicians may have played a role in the murder, the journalist\u2019s network revealed in their statement. The actions may have been tied to officeholders and their organized crime masters who are losing power under a new state government administration.
