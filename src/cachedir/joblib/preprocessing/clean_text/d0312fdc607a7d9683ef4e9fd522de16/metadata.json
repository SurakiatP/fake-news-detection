[\u201cI never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting,\u201d Dugger wrote in response to a reader\u2019s question about the semantics.  Dugger said she made the decision following a trip to Africa in the 1990s. \u201cThere\u2019s a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language used widened that chasm,\u201d Dugger said. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said that some 200 million girls \u201calive today\u201d are believed to have suffered the abuse, according to the FAQ portion of its website. \u201cThe term \u2018female genital mutilation\u2019 is used by a wide range of women\u2019s health and human rights organizations,\u201d the UN website states. \u201cIt establishes a clear distinction from male circumcision. Use of the word \u201cmutilation\u201d also emphasizes the gravity of the act and reinforces that the practice is a violation of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 basic human rights. \u201cThis expression gained support in the late 1970s, and since 1994, it has been used in several United Nations conference documents and has served as a policy and advocacy tool. \u201d The website text notes that \u201cfemale genital cutting\u201d was introduced in the late 1990s because of \u201cconcern that communities could find the term \u2018mutilation,\u2019 demeaning, or that it could imply that parents or practitioners perform this procedure maliciously. \u201d In recent days three arrests were made in Detroit where two physicians and one physician\u2019s wife are charged with performing the abuse on minor girls. The three suspects represent the first prosecution in the United States for the practice, which is common primarily in Muslim countries, particularly in Africa.'"}, "time": 1742562632.273911}
