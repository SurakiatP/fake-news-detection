What Trump Promised In His Speech Is Extremely Important In Trump\u2019s speech he discussed \u201crebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure\u201d and making it \u201csecond to none.\u201d The reason this is so important is because Trump has essentially confirmed the recent proposal for the Fed to print trillions of dollars, which will then be given to the U.S. Treasury to spend on rebuilding America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. This will not only juice the American economy and create a great many jobs, but it will also be extremely bullish for the gold market over the long-term\u2026 A GREAT OPPORTUNITY: To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet and is one of the greatest precious metals investment opportunities in the world CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored At one point the price of gold surged over $60 as it became clear that Donal Trump would be the next president of the United States. Although it has now pulled back and the dollar has bounced a bit, this has clearly not been a good result for the gold bears, who were heavily short the metal before the election results were announced. Silver also surged nearly 70 cents, breaking above $19 before pulling back. With regards to the trillions of dollars that will be injected into the U.S. economy, former Soros associate Victor Sperandeo, who oversees more than $3 billion, told KWN: \u201cEric, this is pure printing of money, but the theory is that because people don\u2019t directly get that money, it won\u2019t create hyperinflation. But when this begins, this will be the beginning of when serious inflation will come back. If this does happen you will get a huge amount of government spending that is going to juice the economy. But it will be the prelude to hyperinflation. So that is going to be the coming world event that will be the beginning of the end for the U.S. dollar.\u201d Sperandeo then issued this bone-chilling warning: And as the hyperinflation unfolds, it will send the world into total chaos and people need to be prepared for that.\u201d One thing is clear, a Donald Trump America will look very different than what the U.S. has looked like for the past 8 years. The question is, how much of a difference can a president make with the United States\u2019 fiscal state in such a desperate situation? Regardless, like Brexit, this was definitely not what the elite had planned and it really was the greatest upsets in political history. \\n***KWN has now released the extraordinary audio interview with Egon von Greyerz, where he gives KWN listeners a look what is really happening behind the scenes globally and in the gold market, and you can listen to it by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n***ALSO RELEASED: Multi-Billionaire Hugo Salinas Price \u2013 I Have Serious Doubts About The Survival Of Our Civilization CLICK HERE. \\n\u00a9 2015 by King World News\u00ae.
