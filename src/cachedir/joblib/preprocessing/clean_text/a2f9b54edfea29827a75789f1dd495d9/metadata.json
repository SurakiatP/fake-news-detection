We have to apply more pressure,\" another one added. \\nMeanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro. \\nAs the protests were being held, the president engaged in crisis security talks in reaction to the demonstrators\u2019 demands. In a televised speech after the talks, he called for \"political dialogue and peace in Venezuela.\" \\nMaduro is adamant about Washington\\'s role in his country\u2019s political and economic woes, and has accused the opposition of conspiring with the US against the South American country. \\n\"They are desperate, they have received the order from the north to destroy the Venezuelan revolution,\" he added. \\nOn Tuesday, Maduro accused the opposition of attempting a \u201cparliamentary coup\u201d by voting to launch an impeachment process against him. \\n\u201cThere has never been a parliamentary coup in Venezuela, and we shall not allow anything like this to happen, the right-wing here and there should know this,\u201d Maduro said during a massive rally by his supporters outside the presidential palace. \\nThe opposition-controlled National Assembly agreed to initiate the impeachment process against Maduro earlier on Tuesday in reaction to blocking a bid to recall him last week. \\nThe political standoff in Venezuela has worsened since the October 20 suspension of the opposition push to hold a referendum to try to recall Maduro. Back then, four state courts said the signature-gathering process for the referendum had been \u201cfraudulent,\u201d effectively blocking it. Share This Article...'"}, "time": 1742564221.824823}
