Trump as the next president of the United States. Mr. Trump\u2019s surprising victory has sent shock waves around the world, but the possible consequences are particularly acute here in the Baltics, a region long seen as a potential flash point because of its physical, linguistic and cultural proximity to Russia. \u201cIf World War III starts, we will be the first to know about it,\u201d said one of the students in the   class who, in keeping with school policy, gave only his first name, Nikita. Odd though it may seem, in view of the threat that a newly aggressive Russia may pose, he and many other students in this   town welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory because, they said, the billionaire wanted to cut a deal with Moscow and calm tensions. Jurgen, another student in the class, described Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, as a menace because she \u201cwants war with Russia,\u201d adding: \u201cTrump wants friendship. In a war, we would be just in the way. \u201d Such views, widespread in   communities in the Baltics and beyond, contrast starkly with the alarm, even panic, at Mr. Trump\u2019s triumph among an   political and foreign policy elite in the country\u2019s capital, Tallinn, where Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, is viewed as a threat who must be resisted, not appeased. During the campaign, Mr. Trump raised alarms in Baltic capitals by calling NATO \u201cobsolete\u201d and questioning why the United States should defend alliance members that fail to shoulder their share of the costs. But President Obama has said that Mr. Trump assured him during their Oval Office meeting last week that he remained committed to the security guarantees that have underpinned NATO\u2019s system of collective defense and peace in Europe since 1949. But the Baltic states remain on edge: Mr. Trump demonstrated a mercurial streak during the campaign, and they are the most at risk if he should change his mind again and decide to back away from NATO. Adding to their worries,   politicians just scored gains in elections in Bulgaria and Moldova. Yet the reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in Estonia and neighboring Latvia, which also has a large Russian population, is complex, a reflection of their tangled ethnic, cultural and political situation. Even as political leaders in Tallinn and the Latvian capital, Riga, are in shock, many ethnic Russians see a silver lining, hoping that a Trump presidency can improve relations with Russia. Tanel Mazur, the teacher of the class in Narva, said that around a third of his students were of Russian descent, a third Estonian and a third from mixed families, but that they defied easy labels. All speak Estonian, which is used in classEnglish and Russian, the dominant language in Narva. Not all of his students cheered Mr. Trump, and several, including one with a Russian background, said they worried that he might encourage trouble by trying to appease Mr. Putin. Asked what they wanted from Mr. Trump now that he had been elected leader of the free world, one student said he must \u201ckeep his emotions back. \u201d Another said he \u201cshould make America great again,\u201d while the class joker advised that Mr. Trump \u201cchange his hair\u201d to be taken seriously. Mr. Mazur, who teaches in Estonian and stayed up late on election night to follow the results, said he never liked Mrs. Clinton much but added that she at least \u201chad a much clearer message\u201d and you \u201cknew what to expect, more or less. \u201d Mr. Trump, by contrast, \u201chas said so many different things, nobody knows what he really wants to do. \u201d Adding to the uncertainty and alarm are statements by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, like Newt Gingrich, who described Estonia as \u201cthe suburbs of St. Petersburg\u201d and not worth a confrontation with Russia that could risk nuclear war. Mr. Gingrich is now a   candidate for secretary of state. \u201cThe idea that our country is just a suburb of St. Petersburg is a nightmare for every Estonian,\u201d said   Kross, a member of Estonia\u2019s Parliament and the country\u2019s former intelligence coordinator. Mr. Trump\u2019s election, he added, \u201chas sent a shiver through the whole region\u201d because it reopened security questions that \u201cwere thought to have been closed with the expansion of NATO more than 10 years ago. \u201d Ojars Kalnins, the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the Parliament of neighboring Latvia, said Mr. Gingrich\u2019s comments about Estonia \u201cwere unfortunate, to put it mildly. \u201d \u201cIt is one thing to talk about having a dialogue with Russia, but to question the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country is outrageous,\u201d Mr. Kalnins said. Yet he added that profound worry over Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions has calmed somewhat because the   has pulled back from statements he made on the campaign trail. In an effort to head off any weakening of American support for the Baltic states, Mr. Kalnins and a group of fellow legislators from Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania will travel to Washington early next month to press their case to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and others who might help influence Mr. Trump. \u201cWe abhor unpredictability and confusion,\u201d said Juri Luik, a former Estonian defense minister and foreign minister. \u201cWe are a small country and like a lot of predictability. \u201d Adding conditions to NATO support, as Mr. Trump has proposed doing, \u201cwould mean a total and profound change in the alliance. \u201d He added that he doubted that this would happen, as \u201cit is quite likely that a number of foreign policy proposals will significantly change once he takes office. \u201d The Baltic states, which are among the most outspoken critics of Mr. Putin and are dogged advocates within the European Union of sanctions against Russia, also worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s admiring remarks about the Russian president, and a web of personal connections between members of his camp and Russia, may lead him to cut the Kremlin slack. This risks muddling a previously united front between Europe and the United States in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to make a deal with Mr. Putin, who has long demanded that NATO get out of Russia\u2019s neighborhood, will be crimped not only by strong bipartisan support for the military alliance in Washington but also by the fact that his negotiating hand has been weakened by a string of political developments in Eastern Europe that work to the Kremlin\u2019s advantage. Even in Estonia, a country that has always counted itself as a particularly robust friend of the United States, domestic political quarrels recently led to the collapse  \u2014   just a few hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s election  \u2014   of a solidly   government. This opened the way for negotiations over a new government with the Center Party, a   group popular with   voters. The Center Party had been kept at arm\u2019s length because of its alleged links to Moscow, but has recently sought to recast itself as a mainstream force that supports NATO and recent decisions by the alliance to establish battalions of 800 to 1, 200 troops in each of the three Baltic states and in Poland. The stationing of these NATO troops in their country had been strongly opposed by many   Estonians, who, echoing a view promoted by   Russian news media, see it as a needless provocation of Russia. Vladimir Petrov, the chairman of the Union of Russian Citizens, a group in Narva that lobbies on behalf of Russians living in Estonia, said it was \u201claughable\u201d to think that Moscow had any interest in attacking Estonia, so there was \u201cabsolutely no need\u201d for NATO troops. Moreover, he added, a few hundred British and other NATO soldiers will hardly stop Russia\u2019s military. \u201cIt would all be over in a couple of hours,\u201d he said. Mr. Petrov said he welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory because he wanted to cooperate with, rather than confront, Moscow. But he worries that Mr. Trump may \u201cend up like Kennedy\u201d because, he said, the   complex in the United States does not want a president interested in lowering tensions. Assassination, he added, \u201cmay seem unlikely, but we have seen so many times recently that the unlikely keeps on happening. \u201d While residents of Narva are mostly ethnic Russians or at least Russian speaking, nobody here wants to see a repeat of the events in eastern Ukraine, where   residents, backed by Moscow, seized power and broke away from the rest of Ukraine. Students in Mr. Mazur\u2019s class laughed uproariously when asked whether they would ever want to live in a place like Ivangorod, the decrepit Russian town on the other side of the Narva River. \u201cI am Russian, but I don\u2019t feel safe in Russia,\u201d said Jevgeni Timostsuk, an events manager who frequently travels across the border. He said that, unlike many of his fellow Russians in Estonia, he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory because he \u201cdid not expect such an unserious person ruling a serious country. \u201d Artyom Troitsky, a Russian critic of the Kremlin who lives in   exile in Estonia, said Russian speakers in Narva, while heavily influenced by Russian propaganda, have \u201ca much more objective view of Russia\u201d than Russians in Tallinn \u201cfor the simple reason that they live on the border and go to Russia often, so they know what life is really like over there. \u201d All the same, many have strong emotional ties to Russia and have absorbed a message spread by Russian television that the political establishment in Washington, including Mrs. Clinton, wants to provoke armed conflict. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, said Aleksandr Moissejenko, an ethnic Russian office manager in Narva, \u201cit seemed we were just a step away from World War III\u201d because of all the Russian and American warplanes flying over Syria in support of rival sides. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cnever said Russia is good, just that it is not an enemy. This is a big improvement. \u201d If war did break out, he added, \u201cI would fight for Estonia, not Russia. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628516.8035254}
