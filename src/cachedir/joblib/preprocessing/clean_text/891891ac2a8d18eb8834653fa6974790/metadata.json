[In an interview with the Times, Nazir Afzal warned that British Muslim organisations are \u201cundermining\u201d attempts to counter terrorism in the UK by spreading misinformation to discredit Prevent, the government\u2019s   programme.  Section 26 of the   and Security Act 201 compels teachers and some healthcare workers \u201cto take due regard to preventing people being drawn into terrorism\u201d yet Prevent has been repeatedly slammed by Labour MPs and large parts of the left  \u2014   including major unions  \u2014    for its \u201cdisproportionate\u201d focus on Muslims. But Afzal, a deradicalisation expert and former chief crown prosecutor who has successfully prosecuted Islamists, credits Prevent with having \u201cstopped at least 150 people from going to Syria\u201d. Afzal warned that its \u201cphenomenally good work\u201d was being undermined by what he called an \u201cindustry\u201d of Muslim groups, some of which have Islamist leanings, pushing \u201cmyths\u201d about the programme. He also took aim at \u201c \u201d community leaders whose sole agenda was to present Muslims \u201cas victims and not as those who are potentially becoming radicals,\u201d singling out Britain\u2019s largest Muslim umbrella group  \u2014   the Islamist dominated Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) as an example. The 54 year old, who resigned last week as chief executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said he was shocked that the agenda at the group\u2019s annual general meeting last year contained \u201cnothing about radicalisation and nothing about the threat of people going to Syria\u201d. Among groups Afzal accused of lying about Prevent to discredit the   programme are Islamist support group Cage, which has been described as a \u201cterrorism advocacy group\u201d by veteran journalist Andrew Gilligan, and Prevent Watch, a \u201c  initiative\u201d that supports \u201ccommunities impacted by Prevent\u201d. Cage\u2019s outreach director Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who signed a confession admitting to having been an   recruiter, likened Islamic extremists to the Suffragettes at a 2015 event opposing the Prevent programme. \u201cSadly, there\u2019s an industry which is trying to undermine Prevent. Some of them don\u2019t like anything that\u2019s   and some of them are Islamists\u201d Afzal said. \u201cPrevent is simply safeguarding. When we\u2019re asking people to identify victims of child sexual abuse by looking for signs, it\u2019s the same thing for radicalisation. Look for the signs. If you\u2019re concerned, share those concerns with somebody and then if they come to fruition we can provide some support. It\u2019s not about criminalising. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563859.637452}
