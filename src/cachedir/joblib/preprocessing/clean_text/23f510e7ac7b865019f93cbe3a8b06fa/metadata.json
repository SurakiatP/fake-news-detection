It sat there so beautiful and so empty and was falling into a very, very bad state of condition. \\nIt had the foundation for success. All of the elements were here. Our job was to restore it to its former glory, honor its heritage, but also to imagine a brand new and exciting vision.\u201d \\nEveryone should watch this video: \\nNo yelling, no screaming. Just Donald Trump explaining how to make America great again.'"}, "time": 1742564148.5794148}
