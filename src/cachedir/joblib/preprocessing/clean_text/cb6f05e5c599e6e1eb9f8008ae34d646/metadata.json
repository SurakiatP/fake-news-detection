That case had been brought by the administration of Duterte\u2019s predecessor, President Benigno Aquino, because China had begun to construct artificial islands in those waters. \\nSuch a drastic shift in policy \u2014 and the, admittedly, somewhat puzzling nature of it \u2014 was remarked on by Steve Mollman who, writing for Quartz , reported on the new China-Philippines deal on Thursday: \\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that rewarding China\u2019s dredging sector would be the last thing the Philippines wants to do. After all, in recent years Chinese dredging ships have been an unwelcome presence in parts of the South China Sea near the Philippines, helping to build islands atop reefs that then became Chinese military bases, complete with runways and ports.\u201d \\n\\nSouth China Sea, with Paracel and Spratly Islands. [Public domain] \\nIndeed, for awhile it appeared the navies of China and the United States \u2014 who physically intervened on the side of the Philippines \u2014 would succumb to all-out war in the South China Sea. \\nTensions have since deescalated considerably, however, due in large part to the fact that Duterte, who\u2019s officially announced he intends for his country\u2019s future to unfold within the Chinese sphere of influence, has taken away the one thing the U.S. needed to stick its nose in the affairs of the region \u2014 an excuse. \\n\u201cIn this venue, your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States,\u201d Duterte said while speaking at the Great Hall of the People during a historic trip to Beijing last week. \\nIn that speech, the Filipino president made his reasoning for the pivot quite clear. \u201cAmerica has lost,\u201d he said flatly. He made equally clear he wants to be a part of what he feels is the winning side: \u201cI\u2019ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to talk to (Russian President) Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world \u2014 China, Philippines and Russia. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d \\nSo Duterte is now allowing China to build fake islands in the South China Sea. \\nThat statement, in itself, is enough to raise the eyebrows of people following the developments in that region. And with regard to the South China Sea dispute \u2014 on the Philippines front, at least \u2014 Duterte, in a very real sense, is right. American has lost. Because, after all, it\u2019s awfully hard to convince folks of Chinese aggression when China and the country in question are cooperating voluntarily.'"}, "time": 1742561918.4878016}
