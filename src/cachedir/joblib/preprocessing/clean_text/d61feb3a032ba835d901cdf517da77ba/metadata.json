The police chief, Gen. Zarawar Zahid, was visiting an outpost in the Hisarak district when explosives placed near the outpost detonated, according to Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar. One of General Zahid\u2019s bodyguards was wounded, Mr. Khogyani said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing, according to a statement by the insurgency\u2019s spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid. The attack came a week after twin bombings outside Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Defense killed at least 40 people, including several senior security officials. Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan, has faced mounting security perils over the past couple of years, with new Islamic State affiliates complicating the threat from the Taliban. Zabihullah Zmarai, a member of the provincial council, said the Islamic State posed a danger in five districts, despite repeated operations by the Afghan Army. \u201cOut of the 22 districts, only six are secure,\u201d he said. The Taliban\u2019s presence across nearly a dozen districts varies, Mr. Zmarai said. But the Hisarak district faced a collapse in recent weeks. That drew the attention of General Zahid, who had gone there to supervise a counterattack. Over the past decade, he rose from a bodyguard to a   police chief of several volatile provinces. His postings included two stints as the police chief of southeastern Ghazni Province, and one term each in Zabul and Paktika Provinces. General Zahid was seen as a   commander, often arriving at the front lines unannounced. When a major cultural event drew world leaders to the ancient city of Ghazni, the general was photographed riding around the city on the back of a motorcycle to check on security measures. He had been wounded twice and had lost two brothers during the decades of war in Afghanistan. In June, he took part in clashes with Pakistani forces that erupted on the border. In a Facebook video that he posted, he appeared beside two mortars and shouted to his men, \u201cStrike hard enough to blow up Nawaz Sharif\u2019s home,\u201d referring to the prime minister of Pakistan. Sediq Sediqqi, the spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Interior Affairs, called General Zahid \u201cone of the bravest commanders of Afghan police. \u201d \u201cHe lost his life on the front line of duty in the fight against terrorism,\u201d Mr. Sediqqi said.'"}, "time": 1742563879.8306003}
