November 4, 2016 Joseph Klein \\nTime Magazine\u2019s Joe Klein has just penned an article entitled \u201cWhy Hillary Clinton Is the Only Choice to Keep America Great.\u201d I feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of Primary Colors, the novel based on about Bill Clinton\\'s first presidential campaign in 1992. \\nThe other Joe Klein laments that Hillary has been so \u201cseverely damaged in the course of the 30-year battering she\u2019s received at the hands of extremists and the media.\u201d Sorry, but Hillary\u2019s wounds are self-inflicted. Her lies, greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for State Department business while she was Secretary of State and of the pay-for-play Clinton Foundation. \\n\u201cThere is one part of Trump that is indisputably real: his ego,\u201d the other Joe Klein wrote, as if Hillary were the epitome of humility and grace. \\n\u201cThose who would put Clinton\u2019s failings in the same league as Trump\u2019s depravities are delusional,\u201d declared Klein. I agree with his statement, but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances. Trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain. He did not \u201chand pick\u201d (Hillary\u2019s word) an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security, let alone pick up the phone and contact Ambassador Chris Stevens directly. \"The government was not able to save four lives, to keep four lives safe. How can you keep a country safe?\" asked Stevens\u2019 former fianc\u00e9 in a rhetorical question that Hillary would be unable to answer. Trump did not lie to the families of those slain in Benghazi, as Hillary did. Trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government e-mails in order to evade the Freedom of Information Act, as Hillary did. \\nIn short, anyone who thinks that Hillary\u2019s proven record of recklessness, mendacity, and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than Trump\u2019s \u201cdepravities\u201d is \u201cdelusional.\u201d \\nThe other Joe Klein complains that Trump deals in \u201cstereotypes\u201d - \u201cthe blacks,\u201d \u201cthe Hispanics,\u201d \u201cthe Muslims,\u201d \u201cthe women\u201d and, yes, even \u201cthe veterans.\u201d Yet much of Hillary\u2019s pitch is gender-based. Elect her because she is a woman. And she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets \u2013 \u201cdeplorable,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201chomophobic,\u201d \u201cxenophobic,\u201d \u201cIslamaphobic,\u201d and \u2013 for good measure - \u201cirredeemable.\u201d \\nThe other Joe Klein charges that Trump is \u201cabout all that has gone wrong in our society, and nothing of what has gone right.\u201d To paraphrase Bill Clinton, that would depend on what your definitions of \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cright\u201d are. Is Hillary Clinton really right when she parrots Black Lives Matter\u2019s stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white \u201cprivilege\u201d and \u201csystemic racism\u201d in this country? Is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police \u201cbrutality\u201d aimed against African-Americans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined? I don\u2019t think so. \\nHillary also represents the political correctness and anti-religious bigotry of the secular left elite that many Americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society. At the Women in the World Summit last year, for example, Hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women, \u201cdeep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\u201d Hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of Americans, reminiscent of President Obama\u2019s contemptuous \u2018clinging to religion\u2019 quote back in 2008. \\nHillary\u2019s key supporters and top aides have targeted the Catholic Church in particular for their notion of progressive reform. \u201cThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,\u201d wrote Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, in an e-mail to Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta. In response, Podesta picked up on the \u201cspring\u201d theme. He wrote, \u201cWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.\u201d \\nWhen Time Magazine\u2019s Joe Klein talks about what is right or wrong in American society, he should get out of his Washington D.C. bubble more often and actually speak with the American people about their day-to-day concerns. Even if Hillary Clinton ends up winning the election, the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda.'"}, "time": 1742562375.3767917}
