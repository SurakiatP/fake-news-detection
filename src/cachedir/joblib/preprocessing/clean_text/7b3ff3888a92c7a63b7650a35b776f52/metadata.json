It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way. I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.\u201d \\nMacGilvray was one of the officers in the photos. LOL \\nFox25 WFXT reports that the police union removed the photos because of a flurry of negative Facebook comments from Hillary supporters, such as: \\nJennifer Popkin: \u201cI can\u2019t believe this unprofessional behavior. Police in uniform should not be espousing political beliefs, let alone the kind of irresponsible rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. Absolutely deplorable and also likely illegal under Section 23(b)(2)(ii) of the conflict of interest law.\u201d \\nMike Piehl: \u201cTrump goes on trial for fraud in November and child rape in December but YOU . . . .\u201d \\nJeremy Thorpe: \u201cThis is illegal. I am screen-shotting this comment to demonstrate that you are deleting critical comments.\u201d \\nKatarina Dutton: \u201cAs a citizen of Medford, I am appalled by police making it clear that I, and so many others, are not welcome or safe here.\u201d \\nTamar Amidon: \u201cThis is so shameful for Medford. I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t live there now. I never thought of them being one of the bad apple bins.\u201d \\nThat Popkin, Piehl, Thorpe, Dutton, Amidon, et al. are outraged by the Medford police Halloween prank but not in the least bothered by of Hillary Clinton\u2019s criminal use of an unsecured email server, her utterly corrupt pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, and her abandoning four Americans to die in Benghazi, can only mean one thing: \\n~Eowyn'"}, "time": 1742561694.7542918}
