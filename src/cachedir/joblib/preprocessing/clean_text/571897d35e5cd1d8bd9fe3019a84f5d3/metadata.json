Beyonc\u00e9, the cultural and music powerhouse, dropped the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon with a picture showing her cradling a baby bump: The announcement was yet another example of the Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s penchant for tightly controlling her own narrative. She revealed she was pregnant in 2011 with a knowing belly rub at the MTV Video Music Awards, after a spirited performance of \u201cLove on Top\u201d  \u2014   and a microphone drop. (A quick camera cut to Jay Z, born Shawn Carter, smiling    as Kanye West shook his rapper friend by the shoulders confirmed the message.) Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born on Jan. 7, 2012. While Beyonc\u00e9 is famously averse to interviews and rarely discusses her personal life without setting the terms, she put the spotlight on her marriage with the release last year of the album and HBO film \u201cLemonade. \u201d It told the story of a struggling relationship, including explicit infidelity and, eventually, reconciliation. Many assumed the songs\u2019 lyrics  \u2014   which ranged from heartbroken to defiant to forgiving  \u2014   were autobiographical, though the couple never revealed how much of the story was based in reality. (In her 2013 documentary, \u201cLife Is But a Dream,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 discussed having an earlier miscarriage. \u201cAbout two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cI flew back to New York to get my checkup  \u2014   and no heartbeat. \u201d Jay Z alluded to the experience in his song \u201cGlory. \u201d) \u201cLemonade\u201d is nominated for a leading nine Grammy Awards at the ceremony to be held on Feb. 12. Beyonc\u00e9 is also scheduled to headline the second night of the Coachella festival in the California desert on April 15 and April 22. Things seem to be going well for the couple now  \u2014   Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Instagram post was signed, \u201cThe Carters. \u201d The pair\u2019s fervent and loyal fans responded with typical enthusiasm to the announcement: Twitter said more than half a million tweets were sent about the pregnancy within 45 minutes. Some Coachella ticket holders wondered about the status of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s scheduled performance. A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 are not the only musical duo with baby news. Pharrell Williams and his wife, Helen Lasichanh, recently welcomed triplets, according to reports.'"}, "time": 1742628582.2168448}
