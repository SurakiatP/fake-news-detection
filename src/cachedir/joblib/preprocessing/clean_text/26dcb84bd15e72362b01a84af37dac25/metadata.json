As the PGA Tour moves this week to PGA National Resort and Spa, a   drive from Trump National, it was natural to wonder: How many of Els\u2019s peers on the tour, if extended the same invitation, would say yes? At Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles last week, I asked more than   of the Genesis Open field that question, granting the respondents anonymity so they wouldn\u2019t risk the wrath of their Twitter followers or, in the case of at least one pro, the fury of his wife. The players range in age from the early 20s to late 40s. They represent nine countries and make their homes in 14 American states, including four that voted overwhelmingly Democratic in last year\u2019s presidential election. Of the 56 players polled, 50  \u2014   or 89. 3 percent  \u2014   said they would play golf with Trump if asked. Only three said they would not. The remaining three declined to answer. The results were hardly surprising. The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican, and the sport\u2019s target demographic  \u2014   rich, mostly white men  \u2014   is far different from the women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president\u2019s statements and positions. Long before he was elected the country\u2019s 45th president, Trump participated in tournament   on the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tours and made the game an integral part of his lifestyle and his businesses. His presidency, at least so far, has been no different. But the current political climate is forcing many   people who sometimes enter the White House\u2019s orbit  \u2014   celebrities, N. F. L. players, even college basketball stars  \u2014   to seriously consider the personal and public repercussions of accepting an invitation to engage with the president. \u201cI\u2019m not silly to what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Els, who was born in South Africa. \u201cI know this is probably the most polarizing president of my time. \u201d He added, \u201cWhether you agree or not, I felt it was a duty to play with the president when you get the call. \u201d Els, 47, is married with two teenage children, and lives in West Palm Beach, Fla. He is also a member of Trump\u2019s golf club in Jupiter, which might have made him a logical recipient for an invitation: Els said he received his in a phone call from David Trout, the head professional at Trump National, asking if he would be interested in rounding out a foursome the next day that included the president. Els, who was home because he had pulled out of that week\u2019s PGA Tour event in Pebble Beach, Calif. with a stiff neck, said he was not going to pass up three hours of exclusive access to the leader of the free world. \u201cHe is the president at the moment,\u201d Els said. \u201cIf it was Barack Obama, I would have played. If it was Hillary Clinton, I would have played. \u201d Since the November election, Trump has played with at least one L. P. G. A. player, Lexi Thompson, and three former men\u2019s world No. 1s: Tiger Woods Els and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, who has a home in Palm Beach Gardens and is recovering from a rib injury. McIlroy played 18 holes with the president on Sunday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, in a foursome that also included the former Yankees outfielder Paul O\u2019Neill. Woods, who has played with former Presidents George Bush, Bill Clinton and Obama, described his December round with Trump as \u201cfun\u201d in a blog post on his website, and added, \u201cOur discussion topics were  . \u201d Other players said they would welcome a similar opportunity. Pat Perez, an   golfer of Mexican ancestry, is an unabashed supporter of Trump, whom he described as \u201can incredible businessman who knows what he\u2019s doing. \u201d Perez said he would play with Trump \u201cin a heartbeat,\u201d but would have turned down an invitation from Mrs. Clinton if she had won. (It should be noted that she is not known to golf.) Trump is perhaps the most ardent golfer to occupy the Oval Office since the 34th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had a putting green installed at the White House and carried a club like a walking stick as he made his way through its maze of hallways. Eisenhower, who was a member at Augusta National, occasionally played with Arnold Palmer. Trump enjoys the company of Jim Herman. In 2006, Herman was hired as an assistant pro at Trump\u2019s course in Bedminster, N. J. He played a few rounds with Trump, who was impressed with his game. Trump encouraged Herman to redouble his efforts to earn a place on the PGA Tour and helped bankroll his career at the start. Last year, Herman won his first tour title. Since 2008, his combined earnings on the PGA Tour and Web. com Tour are more than $6 million. Herman, 39, has played hundreds of rounds with Trump over the last decade. During one of their games after the election, Trump invited him to the inauguration. \u201cIt\u2019s still very hard for me to separate \u2018President Donald Trump\u2019 from the guy I\u2019ve played with for the last 10 years,\u201d Herman said, adding, \u201cI think of how generous Mr. Trump and all of those people were in helping me make it to the PGA Tour. So on that day in Washington, the inauguration was almost surreal in seeing him and his children and some members of his clubs I hadn\u2019t seen in many years, all of us back together to share in that unique moment in American history. \u201d The PGA Tour once held a World Golf Championships event, a rung below the four majors in prestige, at Trump National Doral outside Miami, but last year it moved the tournament, starting this year, to Mexico City after the title sponsor, Cadillac, declined to renew its contract. As Cadillac discovered, any brand can end up as collateral damage when it comes in contact with a   missile like Trump. When the tournament\u2019s move was announced last summer, the perception  \u2014   denied by tour officials  \u2014   was that the organization was using the sponsorship vacuum to distance itself from Trump, who had made incendiary comments about Mexicans and women during the presidential campaign. After Mexico City was announced as the event\u2019s new home, McIlroy, alluding to Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to build a wall along the border, joked, \u201cWe\u2019ll just jump over the wall. \u201d That McIlroy chose to play golf with Trump despite having said before last year\u2019s event at Doral that if he were a United States citizen, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would want to vote for any of the candidates,\u201d did not surprise the former player Justin Leonard. Leonard, a reporter for Golf Channel and NBC, said, \u201cI think seeing the president take time out of what we can only imagine being such a busy schedule and placing importance on golf from a business and social level, and for guys like Rory to take the time  \u2014   obviously he\u2019s been battling an injury, but that\u2019s a call that you don\u2019t turn down. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562528.9354553}
