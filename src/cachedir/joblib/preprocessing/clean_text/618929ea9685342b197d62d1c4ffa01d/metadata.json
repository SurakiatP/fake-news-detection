Trump was coming to town, he knew he had to do something. Unwilling to let the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s visit pass quietly, he created an event page on Facebook to organize a protest titled \u201cManda A Donald Trump A La Chingada\u201d  \u2014   Spanish for \u201cSend Donald Trump to Hell. \u201d Two days later, Mr. Gonzales, and more than 100 other protesters who visited his page, arrived at the arena in San Jose where Mr. Trump would be speaking and jeered his supporters through a megaphone. The taunting at Thursday night\u2019s rally turned violent, with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s backers beaten and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats set on fire. \u201cI saw he was coming and thought, \u2018We got to go out and speak against him,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Gonzales, 31, who avoided the violence that ensued. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously not representing what we\u2019re all about here in San Jose. San Jose is very based on immigrants and stuff like that. \u201d While Mr. Trump has blamed paid \u201cdisrupters\u201d and operatives from Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaigns for such protests in the past, the violence at this rally and the protest that inspired it appeared spontaneous and not directed by Democrats or other groups. Instead, it was more the product of independent local efforts that caught fire through social media. Such episodes, like a protest in April in Burlingame near San Francisco and at an abruptly canceled March rally in Chicago, represent some of the most significant unrest during a presidential contest since 1968, when violence erupted in the streets outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago at the height of the Vietnam War. Mr. Gonzales\u2019s group was one of many that arrived on Thursday to express disapproval of Mr. Trump, who has angered many critics with proposals they consider to be  . While protest organizers and attendees said that violence was not their intention, clashes with Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have become increasingly common. The disturbances are the result of a combustible mix: the passion of the   movement and, on the other side, the often fiery oratory of Mr. Trump himself, who at a rally this year in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, went so far as to urge his supporters to \u201cknock the crap\u201d out of protesters at the event. On Friday, Mr. Trump, who has taken some measures to quell violence inside his events, lashed out at those who created the chaos at Thursday\u2019s event. At a rally in Redding, Calif. Mr. Trump said his supporters \u201cgot accosted by a bunch of thugs burning the American flag. \u201d The genesis of Thursday night\u2019s protest through social media suggests that tensions accompanying Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies are likely to continue. Michael Joseph, 27, a community organizer, learned from his Facebook news feed that   protests were planned for Thursday\u2019s rally. A Native American who supports the Democratic campaign of Mr. Sanders and loathes what Mr. Trump has said about both women and immigrants, Mr. Joseph said he was appalled by the violence that he saw against supporters of Mr. Trump and did his best to break up the melee. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification in hurting others whatsoever, regardless of your political stances,\u201d said Mr. Joseph, who attended the protest with three friends. \u201cI\u2019m pretty disgusted with last night\u2019s \u2018Dump Trump\u2019 protests. \u201d Joshua Tucker, a New York University political science professor who studies social media and political participation, said protest movements that develop on their own, rather than ones organized by a single leader, can be more chaotic because people are reacting to what happens on the street and are given little guidance on decorum. According to those who attended, the several hundred people outside Mr. Trump\u2019s rally were a mix of immigrants\u2019 rights groups, union workers, members of nonprofit organizations and individuals who wanted to voice their concerns. The attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters could have some political benefit for the presumptive Republican nominee, whose backers have been accused of being unruly at his events during the campaign. Embracing the role of the victim, Mr. Trump has been able to paint his critics as the ones sullying the democratic discourse. The protests are also problematic for Democrats. Mrs. Clinton, who has accused Mr. Trump of inciting violence in the past, faced the awkward situation of having to denounce the actions of people speaking out against her likely opponent in the general election. \u201cI condemn all violence in our political arena,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people who were engaging it. I condemn it by those who are taking violent protests to physical assault against Donald Trump. \u201d The precise cause for the violence on Thursday night remains unclear. Some protesters claimed that supporters of Mr. Trump instigated it, while others who were there said the violence was escalated by the sudden presence of a few local gang members. \u201cI saw a couple kids that I knew from the neighborhoods that I know run with the local Norte\u00f1os and Sure\u00f1os, and they were just there to fight,\u201d said James Anderson, who lives in San Jose and was attending a protest organized by a Dump Trump Facebook group. \u201cThey weren\u2019t there to protest anything. They were just there to cause havoc and fight. \u201d For Cesar Juarez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who teaches at a high school in San Jose, the protest was a teaching moment that went awry. After one of his students told him about the protest, he decided to take a group from the school so they could experience the political process in person. But once fists were thrown, he had to abruptly end the class trip. \u201cI kind of sensed that this crowd was getting too rowdy,\u201d he said, \u201cSo I told them, \u2018Let\u2019s leave. \u2019\u201d However the protests have come together, they are unlikely to abate any time soon. While Mr. Trump was speaking on Friday in an airplane hangar in Redding, some 88, 000 people were talking about \u201cStop Trump\u201d on Facebook. Officials in Cleveland are bracing for rowdy streets next month during the Republican Party\u2019s convention. And Mr. Trump has little chance of avoiding protesters this month when he embarks on his overseas trip. An opposition group has already created a \u201cStand Up to Trump\u201d Facebook page to organize a frosty welcome for the candidate in Ireland. So far, more than 215 protesters have signed up to attend.'"}, "time": 1742628473.2581284}
