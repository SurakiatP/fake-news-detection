Over the intervening century, the story of his unexpected rise and dramatic death has been retold so many times it is now the stuff of legend. Yusupov, during the hideous and prolonged murder, became convinced that Rasputin was \u201cthe reincarnation of Satan himself\u201d. But a new biography by award-winning historian Douglas Smith examines the man behind the myth. Dark Fairy Tale Douglas Smith \u2013 Rasputin (Macmillan/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Nov. 2016). Source: macmillan.com \\nRasputin remains fixed oxymoronically in the public imagination, Smith observes, as \u201cmad monk\u201d or \u201choly devil\u201d. His life, one of the most remarkable in modern history, \u201creads like a dark fairy tale\u201d: an uneducated peasant from deepest Siberia feels called by God to set off on adventures, bewitches the royal family, saves the prince\u2019s life, gets too powerful, and is murdered by the great men of the realm. \\n\u201cHe lived in legend, he died in legend and his memory is cloaked in legend,\u201d wrote the brilliant satirist Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya, known by her penname Teffi, in a fabulously intimate 1924 essay on Rasputin. The piece is one of many gems in a new book of non-fiction, the first ever in English, by Teffi, famous for her sparkling short stories. \\nThe new collection is published in the UK as Rasputin and Other Ironies and in the US as Tolstoy, Rasputin, Others, and Me. Anne Marie Jackson has collaborated with Robert Chandler and other translators again to produce a glowing volume of Teffi\u2019s prose, and her version of this essay is both funny and forceful. Teffi describes her encounters with Rasputin and his mythological status: \u201cThis man was unique, one of a kind, like a character out of a novel,\u201d she wrote, reveling in Rasputin\u2019s paradoxes: semi-literate peasant and yet counselor to the Tsar? Lustful satyr or saint? \u201cHow could anyone not be curious?\u201d 'The End of Russia' \\nRasputin\u2019s warning to Teffi: \u201cif they kill Rasputin, it will be the end of Russia. They\u2019ll bury us together\u201d proved chillingly prophetic. Recalling dinner parties with Rasputin, Teffi says she sensed an inner discomfort under his obstinate, hypnotic exterior, that \u201chowling inside him was a black beast.\u201d His political power was undeniable: \u201cHe toppled ministers and he shuffled courtiers as if they were a pack of cards.\u201d But after the revolution, she remembered \u201cthat black, bent terrible sorcerer\u201d. And, as Smith puts it, his death plunged the whole country into \u201cunspeakable bloodletting and misery.\u201d Unimpressed by Rasputin: A witty female voice in a male-dominated sphere Years after meeting him, Teffi gave Rasputin\u2019s autograph to one of his earliest biographers, J.W. Bienstock, whose book was reissued last year in the original French, along with other new biographies, including Frances Welch\u2019s Short Life. Smith\u2019s contrastingly capacious tome measures out a chronological account compiled from archives now scattered across the world. Rasputin includes some extraordinary incidents: tales of friendship and betrayal, scandals, mysteries, miracles, and letters written in blood. He devotes a chapter to Teffi\u2019s account, confirming Rasputin\u2019s love of wine, women and dance.\\nAs for his legendary status as \u201cRussia\u2019s greatest love machine\u201d, Smith records that while talk of frenzied orgies and scores of ravaged maidens was fanciful, it is beyond doubt that he had lovers. Even Rasputin\u2019s daughter, Maria, a defender of her father\u2019s legacy conceded that: \u201cSurrounded by women as he was, a man of natural instincts, robust and virile, he may certainly have yielded to many temptations.\u201d The myth continues \\nAt the same time, paradoxically, Rasputin\u2019s myth had a number of religious guises: as a member of the secret khlystian sect, a pilgrim, prophet or religious elder. It is this heady mix of cult rituals, mesmeric powers and sexual perversion that has fuelled Rasputin\u2019s persistent legend. The same myths have generally deterred serious academics, who \u2013 in Smith\u2019s words \u2013 saw Rasputin as \u201ctoo popular, too well-known outside the university to be taken seriously. He had the whiff of the carnival about him, a figure better left to writers of fiction or pop history.\u201d His is perhaps the most recognized name in Russian history, says Smith, citing legions of previous biographies, together with novels, films and songs, like Boney M\u2019s 1978 Euro-disco hit about the \u201clover of the Russian queen.\u201d \\nBoney M - Rasputin. Source: Carrie S. / YouTube \\nThe myth continues to spawn bars and nightclubs, ice dances and brands of vodka, while Rasputin remains \u201cpractically invisible under all the gossip, slander, and innuendo\u201d. Smith has undertaken an \u201cunusually arduous\u201d search for the truth. In extricating the man from his own mythography, Smith found that Rasputin\u2019s story becoming \u201cthe story of Russia itself\u201d. His turbulent biography is a fascinating lens through which to view the \u201ctwilight of tsarist Russia\u201d and the violent history of the early 20th century. \\nTeffi - Rasputin and Other Ironies (trans.
