It stars as its Texan patriarch the very Irish Pierce Brosnan, which does not. Maybe Mr. Brosnan will pull it off. As an actual Texan (now living in New York) I\u2019m rooting for him. But I know that Lone Star TV has a   track record. For every \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d there is a \u201cWalker, Texas Ranger\u201d and several   reality shows. As a result, Texans have learned to approach shows set in our state with clear eyes and managed expectations. Here is a survey of Texas TV, arranged in order from the realistic to the ridiculous. [ Related: In \u2018The Son,\u2019 the Novelist Philipp Meyer Lassoes TV ] It\u2019s hard to describe the weird buzz of football Fridays in Texas towns, as anticipation builds throughout the day to explode that night in garish light, color and sound. Luckily I don\u2019t have to: \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d nailed it, as it did most details. These include the push and pull of hometown relationships that confine and nurture in equal amounts the egalitarian marriage between the Taylors (Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton) and the cinematography captured in and around Austin. When the sunlight turned golden in the Dillon sky, it was enough to make a Texan expat homesick. \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d was an animated show full of clownish characters. But it was also attuned to the rhythms of the Texas exurbs, its families\u2019 schedules defined by school functions and trips to the Mega Lo Mart. The rare sitcom that treated Southern characters with respect rather than mockery, it nevertheless took sly aim at the way Texan grandiosity collides with reality  \u2014   oversize riding mowers tending modest lawns  \u2014   and how outmoded ideas about masculinity endure. Or as Hank Hill once put it: \u201cBobby, if you weren\u2019t my son, I\u2019d hug you. \u201d Larry McMurtry became the bard of Texas partly by deflating its myths, and this 1989   is a prime example. William D. Wittliff adapted the screenplay from Mr. McMurtry\u2019s novel about a cattle drive from Texas to Montana, which depicted the West as a place of raw beauty but also cruelty and sudden, ghastly death. Gus (Robert Duvall) and Call (Tommy Lee Jones) the aging   saddling up for one last adventure, represent the twin poles of classic Texanhood  \u2014   swaggering   and gritty stoicism. More important: Their drawls are tremendous. \u201cDallas\u201d was, for a time, the most popular show on television and Larry Hagman\u2019s J. R. Ewing is one of TV\u2019s most indelible characters. But when it comes to authenticity, the Ewings were all hat and no cattle, even when you set aside the car crashes, the affairs and the infamous dream season. The show was shot mostly in Los Angeles and looks like it, and its glitzy boomtown of   Stetsons and freewheeling oil barons was a fairy tale. TNT\u2019s 2012 \u201cDallas\u201d update was more representative of the city. It was filmed there, and its urban apartments and diverse subplots were truer to a modern metropolis. The melodrama was milder, and a cynic might surmise that that\u2019s why the show lasted only three seasons, compared to the original\u2019s 14. But the competitive pressures of   TV and Mr. Hagman\u2019s death probably had more to do with it. The Dallas installment of the \u201cHousewives\u201d franchise debuted in 2016 and it\u2019s hard to imagine why it took that long. The latest in a string of reality shows (\u201cDallas Divas and Daughters,\u201d \u201cBig Rich Texas\u201d) about the city\u2019s ladies who lunch  \u2014   and bicker and backstab and slurp \u201cJesus Juice,\u201d or wine, in the show\u2019s vernacular  \u2014   the series wallows in tired stereotypes about big hair, big rocks and big plastic surgery bills. The thing is, they\u2019re not (totally) wrong. Spend an afternoon at the Neiman Marcus flagship and soon you\u2019ll be mentally casting your own reality show. But it\u2019s not a representative depiction of the city. Visit the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum in Waco and you\u2019ll find fascinating artifacts and plenty of lore surrounding the mythic, still active law enforcement group. But you won\u2019t see a dojo, which is only one of the reasons the   \u201cWalker, Texas Ranger,\u201d starring Chuck Norris, was so laughable. As patrolled by Walker, Texas was an   ThunderDome, a place where grudges were occasionally hashed out with helicopters and    missiles. Texans love their firearms, sure, but try fitting a rocket launcher in the gun rack of your pickup.'"}, "time": 1742563417.8350725}
