This is not funny. She\u2019s someone\u2019s grandma. Imagine if its yours,\u201d one Instagram user wrote, according to the Wrap. \u201cRihanna is craving attention I suppose. The queen is 91 and deserves respect,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit degrading. Hasn\u2019t she done enough and earned enough respect for us to ask permission first? (For us to portray her in a way she may not like or find belittling of her accomplishments. She is just another human and might find it hurtful),\u201d a different user wrote. \u201cThis is just disrespectful she is our monarch who has ruled for 65 years of her 91 years of life, she has dedicated her whole life to the service of the UK and   territories,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cA job as monarch she probably never wanted and had no choice in the matter and is certainly a job she was never brought up to do. She deserves respect no matter what you think of the monarchy. \u201d On Monday, Rihanna defiantly posted yet another photoshopped image of the Queen, appearing not to let the criticism affect her.  haters will say it\u2019s photoshop.
