More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors. But despite its unremarkable profile, Innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in Washington. The congressional liaison to   Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition team, Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, is the company\u2019s largest shareholder and sits on the board. Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be secretary of health and human services, purchased shares of Innate four times in 2015 and 2016, according to congressional financial disclosures, totaling between $60, 000 and $110, 000. Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook, Mr. Collins\u2019s chief of staff, who is a top shareholder, and Bill Paxon, a Washington lobbyist and former congressman, according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at \u201csophisticated U. S. investors. \u201d They have since quintupled their money, at least on paper. Mr. Price\u2019s investments in health care companies, including Innate, are almost certain to be a focus of questioning during his confirmation hearings next week. Some prominent Democrats are already asking whether he may have crossed ethical lines by investing in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he helped shape. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York and other Democrats have called for investigations into Mr. Price\u2019s trades. On Wednesday, Mr. Price, who as health secretary would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, filed papers with the federal government saying he would divest himself of interests in several health care companies, including Innate. Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the presidential transition, said that Mr. Price took \u201chis obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously,\u201d and that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an \u201cexhaustive\u201d review of his financial holdings. Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a   Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary. \u201cMaybe Chris is just a cheerleader for the company and Tom Price jumped in head over heels,\u201d said Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a consumer group, which has asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to be taken a look at. It\u2019s just so suspicious, someone\u2019s got to ask, \u2018What just happened? \u2019\u201d Mr. Collins and Mr. Price have both been active in shaping health care legislation, and both voted in favor of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and included measures that would allow the F. D. A. to approve drugs more quickly. Mr. Price is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s subcommittee on health, and Mr. Collins serves on the health panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee. A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Innate was one of many companies he had been involved in. \u201cHe is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,\u201d said the spokesman, Michael McAdams. In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his \u201clittle biotech at the wrong end of the world. \u201d Mr. Wilkinson and Michael Quinn, Innate\u2019s chairman, said they had never heard of many of the company\u2019s more prominent investors, and said they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company from an article in The Wall Street Journal, which first reported his investment. They also said they had not heard of Mr. Hook, the   shareholder, or Mr. Paxon and said they had little interest in gaining the ear of powerful Washington players. Their goal, they said, is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company. \u201cIt won\u2019t be up to us to seek approval for the drug,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview, which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in San Francisco, where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference. Like many biotech   Innate has had ups and downs, Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cBut sometimes, things happen,\u201d he added. In his case, he said, \u201cI met Chris. \u201d Mr. Wilkinson said he was on a   trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board. In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innate\u2019s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact. \u201cIf anything, I suspect it\u2019s probably a negative,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bit harder to access  \u2014   he\u2019s just busy. \u201d Mr. Collins remained one of the company\u2019s top cheerleaders, enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business. Today, many of Innate\u2019s biggest shareholders have ties to Mr. Collins. They include two of his adult children, Caitlin and Cameron, who are the company\u2019s   and   shareholders, as well as several Buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns, according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures. Lindy Ruff, the head coach of the Dallas Stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the Buffalo Sabres, is also an investor. Innate\u2019s sole drug in development, MIS416, is in clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis. A midlevel trial is underway, and results are due in the middle of this year. Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities, a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act, which bans insider trading by members of Congress. But, said Donna M. Nagy, a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress, \u201cOne needs facts in order to get answers to those questions, and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult. \u201d Mr. Holman of Public Citizen said Mr. Collins\u2019s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for \u201cinfluence peddling. \u201d For example, Mr. Paxon, who represented Mr. Collins\u2019s congressional district in the 1990s, could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate. \u201cIt\u2019s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians,\u201d Mr. Holman said. Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that, because they are both from the Buffalo area, he might have become aware of Innate through other investors in the region. Mr. Paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment. Last summer, Innate offered a select opportunity to United States investors, one that Mr. Collins\u2019s friends and associates appear to have benefited from. Under what is known as a private placement, Innate sold a limited number of shares at a discount in an effort to raise capital. In company filings, Innate said one offering of the shares would be sold to \u201csophisticated U. S. investors\u201d and would be used, among other things, to finance a clinical trial and to gain permission from the F. D. A. to start a process that could lead to applying for approval of the drug in the United States. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins\u2019s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50, 000 and $100, 000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck. With his discount from the private placements, Mr. Price would have purchased some stock at 25 Australian cents per share in August and some at 34 cents. The stock closed on Friday at $1. 31. Mr. McAdams, Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman, said the private placement was available to qualified American investors and said Mr. Hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009, before Mr. Collins was a congressman. Several other investors were longtime friends of Mr. Collins, Mr. McAdams said, and their investment predates his time in Congress. Mr. Quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company\u2019s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year. The outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives. \u201cRight now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results,\u201d he said. In San Francisco this week, Mr. Wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 \u201chigh grade\u201d pharmaceutical companies. The drug, if approved, would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis. But he was also   noting wryly that Innate was such a \u201cbottom feeder\u201d at the JPMorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event.'"}, "time": 1742628443.968485}
