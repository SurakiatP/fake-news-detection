Chris Menahan | Information Liberation - October 28, 2016 Comments \\nIslamic indoctrination is now mandatory in German schools. \\nFrom The Daily Express : \\nPUPILS at a primary school were forced to chant \u201cAllahu Akhbar\u201d and \u201cthere is no God but Allah\u201d, an appalled father has claimed. \\nThe father of the pupil at the girl\u2019s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. \\nHe claimed she had been \u201cforced\u201d by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. \\nThe handout read: \u201cOh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.\u201d \\nIt had been given to the girl during a lesson in \u201cethics\u201d at the Bavarian school. \\nWhat are they going to teach, the ethics of conquest and slavery? \\nHere\u2019s another story from yesterday in RT : \\nParents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for \u201ctruancy\u201d after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his \u201cindoctrination\u201d by Islamic radicals. \\nThe story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. \\nIn a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen\u2019s father argued that his son would be \u201cindoctrinated\u201d in the mosque. He went on to say that \u201cfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.\u201d \\nA local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of \u20ac300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. \\n\u2014 Alexandra Witt (@AlexiaStellar) October 23, 2016 \\nWhen the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. \\nThe parents\u2019 lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son\u2019s \u201cbodily safety.\u201d \\nDenying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that \u201cnobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.\u201d \\n\u2026School principal Renate Fritzsche \u2026 told NDR that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity. \\n\u201cWe also have Muslim children with us and Muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions,\u201d she said, adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for Muslim children as well. \u201cIt is not the responsibility of the parents to say: \u2018My child will attend such or such class,\u2019\u201d Fritzsche asserted. \\nIntolerance will not be tolerated! \\nNow get back to your damn prayer rugs and start praying to Mecca!
