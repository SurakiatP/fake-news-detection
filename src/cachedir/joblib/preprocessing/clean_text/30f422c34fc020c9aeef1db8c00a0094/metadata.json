[Brig. . (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser, who served as the director general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, told the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the longer a Palestinian security prisoner is jailed, \u201cthe higher the salary.   \u2026     Anyone who has sat in prison for more than 30 years gets NIS 12, 000 ($3, 360) per month. \u201d  \u201cWhen they\u2019re released, they get a grant and are promised a job at the Palestinian Authority. They get a military rank that\u2019s determined according to the number of years they\u2019ve served in jail,\u201d he added, according to the (Hebrew) NRG website. Kuperwasser also said the PA\u2019s claim that the funds are social welfare benefits to needy families is simply a lie. Their own budgets, he said, \u201cclearly state that these are salaries and not welfare payments. \u201d Kuperwasser, today a project director at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs think tank, told the Committee that the funds were channeled indirectly from the PA to recipients \u201cvia a   \u2018payment fund. \u2019\u201d \u201cThere was a willingness to believe the lies that it was social support. In practice, no steps have been taken to change the situation and in the meantime, the Palestinians are trying to depict themselves as supporting peace while they are still paying the families of terrorists,\u201d Kuperwasser said. \u201cAssurance of a cash prize for acts of terror is encouragement to terrorism and is against international law, international conventions, the Oslo accords and other agreements that they have signed on. \u201d The Knesset briefing came days after President Donald Trump visited Israel and met with PA President Mahmoud Abbas for the second time in one month. Trump addressed Abbas on the issue at their joint press conference, saying, \u201cPeace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded or rewarded. \u201d According to Israel\u2019s Channel 2 TV, when Trump and Abbas met behind closed doors just an hour earlier, the U. S. president lashed out at the Palestinian leader for lying to him. \u201cYou tricked me in DC! You talked there about your commitment to peace, but the Israelis showed me your involvement in incitement [against Israel],\u201d Trump fumed. The sudden display of anger shocked the Palestinian representatives into silence for several minutes, the report said, and thereafter the meeting was filled with tension. Palestinian sources swiftly denied the report, saying the meeting went well. The Palestinian Ma\u2019an news agency quoted a PA official on Monday accusing Israel\u2019s media of \u201clying\u201d about the meeting in order to evade peace talks \u201cbecause the Israelis don\u2019t want to achieve peace. \u201d However, a Palestinian official told the Israel Hayom daily on Monday that while the meeting \u201cstarted on a positive note,\u201d it soon \u201cdeteriorated after Trump accused Abbas of supporting incitement and terrorism with the salaries paid to prisoners. \u201d \u201cTrump made it clear to Abbas that he must curb   incitement in the Palestinian education system, saying Abbas cannot turn a blind eye to Palestinian incitement and pay stipends to terrorists\u2019 families while simultaneously setting conditions that hinder any progress in the peace talks,\u201d the report said. Abbas reportedly defended his government\u2019s actions by saying that \u201cin the past, there was a joint   committee that sought to deal with incitement on both sides, but it has not met for years. As for the prisoners\u2019 stipends, those are paid by the PLO\u2019s prisoner authority, not the Palestinian government. \u201d At this point, according to the Israel Hayom report, \u201cTrump lost his patience and interrupted Abbas, banging his fist on the table and admonishing him, saying, \u2018You can talk about how much you want peace, but that\u2019s empty [rhetoric]. \u2019\u201d Following Kuperwasser\u2019s briefing on Monday, the committee\u2019s chairman, Avi Dichter (Likud) said he would review what steps Israel should take in response to what he said was continued Palestinian incitement to terror. \u201cThe State of Israel cannot get involved in a political process aimed at peace when those who are supposed to be our partners incite [to terror]. For years, not only has it [incitement] not decreased, it has increased,\u201d Dichter, a former director of the Shin Bet security service, said. According to PA law, Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails and families of terrorists killed while carrying out attacks against Israelis receive monthly stipends that range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand in accordance with the gravity of their crimes. The U. S. Congress is pushing hard for the Taylor Force Act  \u2014   legislation that would cut U. S. funding to the Palestinian Authority so long as it continues to provide financial support to the families of perpetrators of attacks against Israelis and  . The bill is named after former U. S. Army veteran and Vanderbilt University graduate student Taylor Force, who was killed in a stabbing attack while he toured Tel Aviv with his school in March 2016. On Tuesday, Nitsana   told Breitbart News Daily it was \u201cshocking\u201d that the administration was still implicitly supporting the payment of terrorists\u2019 salaries and it was high time the U. S. cut funding to the PA. This money is inducing others to go and kill, and as you can see not only Israelis are getting killed on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A lot of tourists are getting killed. Israel is a popular country and gets a lot of visits from people all over the world, and Taylor Force was not the first American getting killed in Tel Aviv and unfortunately will not be the last one. The United States knows that part of the money they are giving to the Palestinian Authority is going to pay these prisoners and to pay the families of those who have killed their own civilians, American citizens, and as you say it\u2019s totally ironic, horrible and unbelievable that the administration keeps supporting the Palestinian Authority without demanding right now to bring to a halt right now all these payments to the prisoners and the families of suicide bombers.'"}, "time": 1742628373.1899886}
