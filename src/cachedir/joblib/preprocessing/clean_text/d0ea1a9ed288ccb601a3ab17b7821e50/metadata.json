Trump\u2019s Moronic Supporters in the Militias Armed and Ready if Clinton Wins By Ian Greenhalgh on November 3, 2016 Some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Clinton. [Editor\u2019s note: The 2016 election has been utterly crazy, all kinds of dangerous morons have slithered out of the woodwork to support Trump because they are desperate for real change and not smart enough to realise that Trump does not offer a true alternative to the usual Washington insiders and any change he did bring would be for the worse. One change that is very sorely needed in the USA is a disarmament of the populace, it is simply crazy that there are hundreds of millions of guns in circulation. The 2nd amendment and the right to bear arms dates from a time when the most dangerous weapon you could buy was a flintlock musket; today when you can buy all kinds of military grade firearms that can hold dozens, even hundreds of rounds, can shoot hundreds of metres with accuracy and have no purpose other than to kill people it is a dangerous anachronism that must be changed if the US is to advance and become a truly civilised society. Try telling that to these gun-toting morons in the militia movement though and all you\u2019ll get is a torrent of abuse, insults I have sadly become all too familiar with due to the emails and comments I have had to endure simply for honest reporting on this election where I have rightfully pointed out that Trump is a complete fraud, a creation of Judeo-Zionist organised crime that should be in a jail cell rather than the oval office. There is an even more disturbing and far darker aspect to this however, and that is the close relationship between these right wing militia groups and the FBI. They are both tentacles of a hidden organised crime cabal that is threatening not only to derail this election, but is a clear and present danger to the rule of law and the US constitution. As Gordon and I wrote earlier this week, large parts of the FBI are attempting an insurrection and it is no coincidence that these militia nutjobs are also preparing for some kind of armed uprising should their boy Trump not win the election. Trump has virtually committed treason in recent weeks with his ludicrous statements to his supporters to not accept the election result should Hillary win, thus further provoking the low-IQ snake handling racist bigoted scum that supports him into preparing to commit some kind of attempt at insurrection. This election and all the utter madness it has stirred up would drive a normal person insane, thank god it is nearly over. However, let us all hope that in the coming struggles, be they political or worse, armed conflicts between the state and organised crime supported militia morons, that some semblance of democracy and freedom can be maintained. We will be lucky to come out of this mess without a second civil war erupting and like the first civil war, everybody but the bankers and the crime cabal would be losers. Ian] Worst Case Scenario? Militias Armed and Ready if Clinton Wins \\nDown a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training \u2014 and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to revive the spirit of 1776 and let everybody know that it\u2019s your right, it\u2019s your duty as a citizen in the United States of America willing to defend your person and your property, but also to work with other like-minded people to protect your country, you know, for the security of a free state, you know, a well-armed militia is necessary,\u201d said Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name \u201cBloodagent.\u201d \\nAs the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. \\nThey say they won\u2019t fire the first shot, but they\u2019re not planning to leave their guns at home, either. \\nTrump\u2019s populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul\u2019s promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be \u201crigged,\u201d and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. \\nArmed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer\u2019s 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. \\nTheir numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. \\nIn recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. \\nMany fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. \\nThe Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. \\nAn hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member\u2019s high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. \\nThe group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. \\nAmid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. \\nHe said he doesn\u2019t want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. \\n\u201cWith Hillary on one hand we have to worry about our rights \u2014 everything, you know, guns \u2014 because I got a feeling first thing she\u2019s going to do is start putting more and more restrictions on our firearms. And it\u2019s going to be damn-near impossible for us to be able to bear arms anymore. And Trump, I\u2019m just worried he\u2019s going to stir up the population and cause riots and mayhem,\u201d said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. \\nTrump\u2019s candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, analysts say. \\nOver the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. \\nBack in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. \\n\u201cWorst case scenario? You know, depending on who gets the office, I\u2019m saying, there\u2019s going to be people upset everywhere. But there\u2019s going to be rioting, I don\u2019t know. Once again, you never know until it actually happens,\u201d member Phillip King said.
