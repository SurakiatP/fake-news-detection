These responses include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex-ratios, reduced body size, and migration of species.\u201d \\n\u201cUnderstanding the extent to which these goods and services have been impacted allows humans to plan and adapt to changing ecosystem conditions,\u201d he said. \\nDr. James Watson, associate professor of planning and environmental management at UQ\u2019s School of Geography, added, \u201cWe are simply astonished at the level of change we observed which many of us in the scientific community did not expect to see for decades.\u201d \\nThe changes have manifested in some species shifting to higher or lower ground as the planet heats up, while others are becoming smaller, \u201cas a higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratio makes it easier to stay cool,\u201d the Independent reported . The outlet wrote: \\nFor example, six species of woodland salamander in the Appalachian Mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past 50 years. \\nSlightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans, but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food. \\n\u201cThese multi-level biological impacts of climate change will affect humans. Increasing disease outbreaks, inconsistent crop yields, and reduced fisheries productivity all threaten our food security,\u201d said co-author Dr. Tom Bridge. \\nAverage global temperatures have risen 1\u00b0C since the industrial era. The study states that this has \u201calready had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems, with accumulating consequences for people. Minimizing the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations.\u201d \\nThe study called on governments to follow through on the promises made in the Paris climate agreement , which aims to keep global warming below a 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014although an increasing amount of scientists are sounding the alarm that even those pledges may be too little, too late. \\n\u201cTime is running out for a globally synchronized response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services,\u201d the study continued. \\n\u201cIt is no longer sensible to consider this as a concern for the future\u2014if we don\u2019t act quickly to curb emissions it is likely that every ecosystem across Earth will fundamentally change in our lifetimes,\u201d said Dr. Watson.
