Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nEven though a quick scan of social media suggests the country is so over old white men, Joe Biden, the fifth hottest vice president ever , holds a special place in the hearts of all Americans. Good news, then, for everyone who was sad to see him go: Politico reported Thursday night that Hillary Clinton was considering asking Biden to take over her old gig at the State Department. \"They are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins\" https://t.co/387Su8UptM \\n\u2014 POLITICO (@politico) October 28, 2016 \\nPolitico, citing an unnamed source within Camp Clinton, noted that \u201cneither Clinton, nor her aides have yet told Biden,\u201d so it would be appreciated if everyone could keep this under wraps until she determines the best way to approach him with the offer.

Who couldn\u2019t use a nice distraction, Hillary most of all? @politico bs. won\\'t happen. \\n\u2014 Yaqub Osman (@yaqub_osman) October 28, 2016 @politico That sounds like BS. Why would you go from VP to SOS? I think somebody\\'s running their mouth for nothing. \\n\u2014 Ari Keys (@arionkeys) October 28, 2016 @dcexaminer Total nonsense. The story is nothing more than a scheme to get voters to believe the election is already over. \\n\u2014 Don Fredrick (@Colony14) October 28, 2016 Biden won\\'t be Secretary of State. But throwing his name around will amp up enthusiasm among Hillary supporters to make sure they vote. \\n\u2014 Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) October 28, 2016 @politico how much of this article did @johnpodesta and team write? #wikileaks pic.twitter.com/Qv6X1NB6GX \\n\u2014 The Haberdasher (@thatjer) October 28, 2016 @politico sounds like a \"leak\" to distract \\n\u2014 Kyler Hess (@KylerKHess) October 28, 2016 \\nBut the anonymous source said they were totally considering thinking about asking Biden to consider thinking about it. @politico He would bring the whip out! pic.twitter.com/Vs9Gt0BeFr \\n\u2014 Sasi Patkunan (@SPatkunan) October 28, 2016 @dcexaminer @JoeBiden will take Putin behind the gym and rough him up till he gives back our uranium that @HillaryClinton helped Putin get \\n\u2014 Dustin Bissette (@bissghetti) October 28, 2016 \\nBeware, enemies of freedom worldwide: if Hillary\u2019s elected, Secretary of State Biden\u2019s gonna put y\u2019all back in chains! @politico Uncle Joe will protect us all pic.twitter.com/qDHTfwba65 \\n\u2014 KGB AGENT\u2662DEPLORABLE (@aj_slown) October 28, 2016 @dcexaminer Can\u2019t we get rid of this guy?'"}, "time": 1742562250.4262457}
