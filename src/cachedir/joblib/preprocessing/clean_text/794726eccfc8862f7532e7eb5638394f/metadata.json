Unfortunately the drug had the undesired effect of making him grow to five storeys tall, from which height it is believed that May\u2019s instinct \u2018to treat everything like a giant train set\u2019 kicked in. \\nWhitstable was particularly badly hit when rush hour traffic was swept off the road by May\u2019s huge hands so he could force Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond to race each other in two Robin Reliants made of lego. Eyewitness said he later tried to attach an electricity pylon to Clarkson\u2019s car so he could play scaletrix but grew enraged when the wires tangled in his ample fringe, and threw Clarkson over a hill, before running off in the direction of Ashford. \\nDespite a body count of 3000 and rising, residents of Kent are urged to remain calm, and to talk about cars as much as possible in the hope of creating a familiar and soothing background noise for the confused beast. They are also urged to protect their homes and vehicles by putting up the posters Oz Clarke being airdropped by the RAF across the county. \\nRichard Hammond strenuously denied that this is yet another zany Top Gear stunt, claiming that \u2018a giant James May wandering around causing mayhem really wouldn\u2019t be that entertaining\u2019. Jeremy Clarkson meanwhile hit back at Kent Council\u2019s objection James May destroying the centre of Canterbury and killing thousands; \u2018It\u2019s just another example of the health and safety nanny state gone mad!\u2019 \\nRhysickle'"}, "time": 1742563106.4790812}
