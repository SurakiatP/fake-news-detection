Look out for these 5 mistakes during your first few weeks. \\n\\nMold \\nYou can spot fungi by first being able to identify it. If you see white, hairlike growths on the soil surface, you are probably seeing fungi. Fungus thrives in dirt that is overly wet, usually combined with humid air or poor ventilation around plants. You can avoid this by using cell flats and planting one seed per cell to allow enough space for air to circulate around seedlings. Place a small fan in the area and position it so that it is not blowing directly on the seedlings. This will keep air moving. \\n\\nDamping-Off \\nStems can turn brown and bend at the soil level due to fungi. If you are using a humidity dome, be sure to remove it right after sprouting. Leaving the dome on will create an environment that pathogens and pests love. \\n\\nBugs \\nIf you have houseplants with pest issues, keep your seedling trays far away from them. The most common indoor seed-starting pest is the fungus gnat. It resembles a small but sluggish fruit fly. Gnat larvae can only survive in moist environments, so it is important to cut back on watering once the seeds have sprouted. Allow the top 1/4 inch of soil to dry out between waterings. \\n\\nPlanting Depth \\nWhen seeds are planted too deep and kept too moist and cold, they can rot. Be sure to plant according to the directions on the packet. \\n\\nSeed Quality \\nIf you are doing everything right and your seeds still don\u2019t sprout, they could be too old. Seeds germinate best when they are fresh. Quality seed companies print a \u201cpacked for\u201d date on envelopes. Be sure to do your research. Some seeds like beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers can be stored in a sealed bag in a dry, dark place for several years. \\n\\nHave fun while gardening and learn what techniques work best for you and your crop. Pay attention to detail in order to catch any issues before they spread. \\n\\n\\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.
