Marco Rubio announced Monday he will vote to confirm former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, providing Tillerson with a critical vote to get him through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [\u201cI believe the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet,\u201d Rubio wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI also believe given the uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our foreign policy that a higher degree of scrutiny is justified in evaluating whoever is nominated to serve as secretary of state. \u201d  Rubio said he remained \u201cconcerned\u201d about the U. S. defending democracy and human rights, adding he worried that under Trump, the U. S. \u201cwill pursue a foreign policy that too often sets aside our values and our historic alliances in pursuit of flawed geopolitical deals. \u201d \u201cBut in making my decision on his nomination, I must balance these concerns with his extensive experience and success in international commerce, and my belief that the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy,\u201d Rubio continued. He plans to give Tillerson the critical swing vote to confirm him in committee and will vote for him in the full Senate. \u201cHowever, upcoming appointments to critical posts in the Department of State are not entitled to and will not receive from me the same level of deference I have given this nomination,\u201d he warned. Rubio had grilled Tillerson about doing business with Russia as CEO of Exxon Mobile and whether or not Vladmir Putin is a \u201cwar criminal\u201d during a long and contentious hearing in committee. With Rubio\u2019s vote, Tillerson will likely reach at least 52 votes in the Senate to be confirmed as Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of State.'"}, "time": 1742563810.542683}
