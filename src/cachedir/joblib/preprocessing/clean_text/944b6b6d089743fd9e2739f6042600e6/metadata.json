When police arrived, they engaged in a 45-minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle, killing them both. \\nIn the news release on Monday, following the shooting, police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun. Scott Collins, a spokesman for the Inglewood Police Department said that the couple refused to obey the officers\u2019 commands to exit the vehicle. The officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car \u2014 killing the couple. \\nThe woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting, and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital, according to the LA Times. \\nThe shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day. Mayor James Butts, while responding to questions about the shooting, opened up a huge can of worms \u2014 both the man and the woman were unconscious. \\nFor at least 45 minutes, police attempted \u201cto rouse\u201d them in an effort \u201cto de-escalate the situation,\u201d said Butts. \\nAfter admitting that the couple was asleep, Butts quickly defended the officers, noting, \u201cObviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened.\u201d \\nHowever, that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch, nor did the couple have any reason to be violent. \\nBoth of the victims were parents; Kisha Michael, 31, a single mother of three sons, and Marquintan Sandlin, 32, a single father of four daughters. \\nMichael\u2019s twin sister Trisha stated the obvious when she said that it\u2019s possible that Kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out. \\nFamilies for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off, according to NBC Los Angeles. \\n\u201cThe police ain\u2019t telling us nothing,\u201d said Trisha Michael after being met with tight lips from the department. \\n\u201cHe was a loving father,\u201d said Sandlin\u2019s sister Leandra Faulkner. \u201cAll he cared about was his girls, getting them right.\u201d \\nOf course, as is standard procedure for all those killed by police, their arrest records were released to shame them. Michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year, and 7 years ago, Sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in Los Angeles. \\nAccording to his relatives, Sandlin had a \u2018rough life\u2019 but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver. \\nSadly, these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops, scared of a sleeping couple.

Aaron Beedle \\nThe fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is. I would not want to be a black person living in america today. I wouldn\u2019t live there at all. Nothing will happen to the officers. They should be sentenced for murder, and receive a full sentence. Police officers over there intruding on people\u2019s property and killing pets, killing people just walking down the street or washing their car. I\u2019d i was an american the only reason i\u2019d want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers. Ryan Robbins \\nYou shouldn\u2019t believe everything you are reading online. It\u2019s bad right now, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be. All of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be. When the truth finally comes out on most of these stories, it\u2019s on page 6 and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice. Aaron Beedle \\nit is true everyone has agendas\u2026 im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america.. but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes. I would say that at least 80% of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably. females would be close too. When it is appointed rather than earned, such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease, people tend to not handle it well. I heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves. And they are made to. It teaches people restraint. Christopher Rawson \\nThe police across America are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another.

Sadly that will never happen. The vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties. With the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose, how can anyone prove that it wasn\u2019t predetermined? \\nI just watched a news video of this story. The mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived. \u201cPolice spent 45 minutes trying to rouse them and de-escalate the situation\u201d. How is there a situation to de-escalate if they are passed out? \u5c71\u5d0e \u30b3\u30ed\u30c3\u30b1 \\nRyan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened. All he said was that another source had different information. If another source has clashing info, of course one of them is going to be wrong. No need to bash him. Vanessa White \\nSome groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with Anarchy. I would never call them for anything. They don\u2019t seem to know who or when to shoot. Or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time. pitiful. I will keep the children in prayer. Blue Thugs \\nAll cops are cowards, never seen one that wasn\u2019t a coward and bully. One of the cops got tired of waiting and said \u201cgun\u201d that was all the excuse they needed to open fire. What if that was a white couple with a gun in the car,nearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days. What if they have a permit or concealed carry permit. Do you fucking think the cops would have fired 62 rounds into that car and killed the white couple, well do you?. If one of the thug cops did holler gun, no one can ever say anything to contradict them. Cops know if only one side is left alive, no one can say otherwise. Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6. That is every cops motto, as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans. Linda Brown \\nChickenshit Bullies This B.S. Has to stop.

If you\u2019re that afraid of a Black person on sight, then you don\u2019t need to be a police officer. You need to seek help. Last time I checked, it was Black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around. Yeah, the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of Blacks by police. Not by a longshot.
