Just put the back catalogue on shuffle. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different to when Prince died, when playing classic tracks to mark his passing overwhelmed all my sadness with the inappropriate urge to party, dance and have sex. \\n\u201cWith Len, he\u2019s been writing songs about the beautiful inevitability of departing from this world pretty much from 1967\u2019s Songs of Leonard Cohen, so they\u2019re all right where you need it.\u201d \\nBooker added: \u201cI\u2019ll miss him.
