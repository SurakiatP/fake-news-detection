(this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there\u2019s anything he can give her.\u201d \\n\u201cAlso, I\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s had an \u2018odor\u2019 lately,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes.\u201d \\n\u201cOutside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don\u2019t know what to do about this. \u2014 any suggestions would be appreciated.\u201d \\nWell, apparently, Hillary Clinton is just as gross as we all thought!
