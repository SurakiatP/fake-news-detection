It\\x92s possible because Hillary Clinton, slouching through a paroxysm of manufactured hysteria, is supported by virtually the whole US establishment, a consensual neocon/neoliberalcon War Party/Wall Street/corporate media axis.\\nBut History has a tendency to show us there\\x92s always a straw that breaks the camel\\x92s back.\\nThis could be it \\x96 as revealed by WikiLeaks ; March 2, 2015, the day when John Podesta wrote, \\x93we are going to have to dump all those emails.\\x94\\nThat happened to be the exact same day it was revealed Hillary Clinton had used a personal email server as Secretary of State.\\nYet this reveals only part of the puzzle. There\\x92s got to be a response to Podesta\\x92s email \\x96 which WikiLeaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election. If the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then we\\x92ve got a 100 percent smoking gun: the whole Clinton (cash) machine narrative \\x96 according to which Hillary just deleted \"personal\" emails \\x96 crumbles like the ultimate House of Cards.\\nMoreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged Clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal State Dept. and FBI investigations.\\nAs far as the Clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm. John Podesta also happens to be the founder of the Center for American Progress \\x96 a George Soros operation and prime recruiting ground for Obama administration officials, including US Treasury operatives who decided which elite Too Big To Fail (TBTF) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis. DCLeaks.com , for its part, has connected Soros Open Society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing Clinton Foundation donors.)\\nExceptional bananas, anyone? The perfectly timed slow drip of WikiLeaks revelations, for the Clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of Chinese torture. To alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to \\x93evil\\x94 Russian hacking when the real source for the leaks might have come straight from the belly of the (Washington) beast.\\nAt the Valdai discussion club last week, it took President Putin only a few sentences to debunk the whole Clinton machine narrative with a bang:\\n\\x93Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.\\nI have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people\\x92s choice? America is not some kind of \\x91banana republic\\x92, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.\\x94\\nReality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency.\\nAnthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton-linked US mainstream media acknowledging how Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of \\x93philantro-capitalism\\x94 (actually a money laundering \\x93pay to play\\x94 racket), a practice \\x93by no means confined to the Clintons\\x94.\\nAnd the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary being perfectly aware that prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh.\\nHuma, the Fall Princess Now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations - all three of them.\\nExhibit A is this WikiLeaks bombshell ; Peter Kadzik, who\\x92s now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clinton\\x92s right-hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset.\\nNot only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta \\x96 as also revealed by WikiLeaks - thanked Kadzik for keeping him \\x93out of jail\\x94 ; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secret heads up on the Clinton email investigation.\\nThe Clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business. Huma and her family\\x92s close connections to Saudi Arabia \\x96 and the Muslim Brotherhood \\x96 are legendary (that includes her brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi). Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; that\\x92s part of the Clinton Foundation connection.\\nYet now, with Huma in the spotlight \\x96 still maintaining she didn\\x92t know all those emails were in her and Wiener\\x92s laptop - it\\x92s no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to \\x93one of my aides\\x94 . She used to be Hillary\\x92s ersatz \\x93daughter\\x94 ; now she\\x92s being framed as The Fall Princess.\\nAnd that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillary\\x92s Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBI\\x92s Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wiener\\x92s sexting of minors. The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now. Let\\x92s try to cut a long story short.\\nFollow the evidence Last July, the DOJ \\x96 under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch - decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate. And yet FBI director Comey \\x96 who nonetheless stressed Hillary\\x92s \\x93extreme carelessness\\x94 \\x96 turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI \\x93sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe.\\x94\\nSoon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation. The East District of New York refused it. Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch.\\nEnter an extra layer of legalese. Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements.\\nBut then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener - using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiner\\x92s sexting of a 15-year-old girl. Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts \\x96 from Humaabedin@yahoo.com to the crucial huma@clintonemail.com . This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept. emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the \\x93secret\\x94 clintonemail.com to Huma at yahoo.com.\\nNo one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements.\\nWhat\\x92s established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined. Now picture both teams of FBI investigators \\x96 Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener \\x96 comparing notes. And then they decide Huma\\x92s emails are \\x93relevant\\x94.\\nKey questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed \\x93relevant\\x94 if the investigators could only examine the metadata. What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails \\x96 a potential game-changer. That\\x92s why one of my sources insists his decision to go public came from above.\\nThe other key question now is whether the DOJ \\x96 via Kadzik? - will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation. Senior, serious FBI agents won\\x92t take that \\x96 massive euphemism \\x96 kindly.\\nThe FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year. Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence \\x96 and they won\\x92t quit. Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clinton\\x92s Bonfire of Scandals\\x92 problems.\\nPepe Escobar is an independent geopolitical analyst.
