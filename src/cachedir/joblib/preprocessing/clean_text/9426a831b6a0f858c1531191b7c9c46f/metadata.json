With thousands of people fleeing areas downstream from Lake Oroville amid warnings of catastrophic danger, my editor thought it would be a good idea for me to do the opposite. So early Monday, I drove from my   home to Oroville, about 80 miles north in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Along Route 70, Northern California\u2019s extreme wet winter was evident in every direction. It was reflected in the flooded orchards, the bursting Yuba River and the Sierra\u2019s snowy peaks. Relentless runoff from the mountains had caused Lake Oroville to flow over its emergency spillway for the first time ever on Saturday. A day later, state officials noticed a hole forming in the spillway and prepared for the worst, ordering nearly 190, 000 people to seek safer ground. In Oroville on Monday, just a handful of businesses were open. Among them was Mike\u2019s Grande Burger which gave out free meals to the truck drivers, emergency personnel and others working at the hobbled spillway. Some residents who had stayed behind gathered on a hill above Oroville Dam and watched the scene below. The reservoir, California\u2019s second largest, was perfectly still and surrounded by   hills. In the distance, the   Feather River snaked along the valley floor. Locals recalled flooding events of the past  \u2014   one in 1997, when thousands of people were forced to flee, and another in 2006. Some wondered whether state officials had done enough to shore up the Oroville reservoir before the latest round of trouble. Others talked about untamable nature. With more storms approaching, officials are effectively now in a race against time to lower the level of the lake and reinforce the hobbled spillway. Whether it will be enough is by no means certain.

Department of Interior] There are comic book stores, mystery book stores and even culinary book stores. But until last year, the United States had few, if any, romance novel stores. And this despite the genre\u2019s enormous popularity. To the sisters Leah and Bea Koch, that sounded like an opportunity. They opened their    shop, The Ripped Bodice, in Culver City last March. With Valentine\u2019s Day upon us, it seemed a good moment to check in. We caught up with Leah Koch via telephone.
