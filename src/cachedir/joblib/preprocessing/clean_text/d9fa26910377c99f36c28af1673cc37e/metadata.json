C.  \u2014   Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told the White House Press Corps that while a government shutdown is \u201cnot desirable\u201d it could become a reality come September if the appropriations process is not repaired. [Mulvaney also said a government shutdown could be \u201cgood\u201d if it \u201cfixes Washington, D. C. permanently. \u201d  President Trump tweeted out on Tuesday, \u201ceither elect more Republican Senators in 2010 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good \u201cshutdown\u201d in September to fix mess!\u201d either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good \u201dshutdown\u201d in September to fix mess!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017,  Asked to respond to President Trump\u2019s tweet about how a shutdown is \u201cgood,\u201d Mulvaney said, \u201cIt\u2019s not desirable   \u2026     But you asked me what a good one would look like, and a good one would be something that fixes Washington, D. C. permanently. \u201d Mulvaney said the reason there is a discussion about a shutdown every few months \u201cis because the appropriations process is broken. \u201d He said the \u201cthe way it\u2019s supposed to work, and it used to work\u201d is when the House passes an appropriations bill on a topic, the Senate then passes a bill on the same issue, before it goes to the conference committee, before that bill is placed on the president\u2019s desk. \u201d Mulvaney said that, since he has worked in the government, this process has \u201cnever worked\u201d the way it\u2019s supposed to. He added: I don\u2019t think it has functioned for the last decade. I\u2019ve been here since 2011 and it has never worked. We want to get back to that process. But the reason we can\u2019t get back to that process is because the Senate is requiring 60 votes on every single appropriations bill and that is forcing this discussion on continuing resolutions  \u2014   which is a bad way to run the government  \u2014   and forcing a discussion on shutdowns which is simply not productive. Later in the press conference, Mulvaney said, \u201cThe president wants to see Washington better, get better, get fixed, change the way it does business. \u201d He said the Democrats are saying, \u201cThey won and we lost is not a bipartisan way to approach things. \u201d Drawn back to the topic of Trump\u2019s early morning tweet by a member of the White House Press Corps once again, Mulvaney said, \u201cI think what he\u2019s foreshadowing is, \u2018look, this place has to change.\u2019 The way we run the town has to be fixed. We have to do something. We cannot simply muddle along using models the previous administration has used. \u201d Mulvaney said Trump is a president that will usher in change. \u201cAnd he\u2019s going to change Washington, D. C. And if it takes a shutdown, then that\u2019s what it takes. But again, that\u2019s several months away from that discussion. We have a lot to do between now and then. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742563673.7934387}
