It was retweeted thousands of times, generating a run on the book  \u2014   its ranking soared on Amazon and by day\u2019s end it was no longer available. (Harvard University Press is reprinting the book for the first time since 2010, a spokeswoman for the publisher said.) It\u2019s worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs: Mr. Rorty, an American pragmatist philosopher, died in 2007. Were he still alive, he\u2019d likely be deluged with phone calls from strangers, begging him to pick their stocks. When \u201cAchieving Our Country\u201d came out, it received a mixed critical reception. Writing for this newspaper, the critic Christopher   called the book \u201cphilosophically rigorous\u201d but took umbrage at Mr. Rorty\u2019s warnings about the country\u2019s vulnerability to the charms of a strongman, calling this prophesy \u201ca form of intellectual bullying. \u201d Donald J. Trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman. But the essence of Mr. Rorty\u2019s argument holds up surprisingly well. Where others saw positive trends  \u2014   say, a   dawn chorus praising the nation\u2019s diversity  \u2014   Mr. Rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine. His basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country, for all its flaws, was both perfectible and worth perfecting. Hope was part of its core philosophy. But during the 1960s, shame  \u2014   over Vietnam, over the serial humiliation of    \u2014   transformed a good portion of the left, at least the academic left, into a disaffected gang of spectators, rather than agitators for change. A formalized despair became its philosophy. The system was beyond reform. The best one could do was focus on its victims. The result was disastrous. The alliance between the unions and intellectuals, so vital to passing legislation in the Progressive Era, broke down. In universities, cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice. By 1997, when Mr. Rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d few of his academic colleagues, he insisted, were talking about reducing poverty at all. \u201cNobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies, homeless studies, or   studies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause the unemployed, the homeless, and the residents of trailer parks are not \u2018other\u2019 in the relevant sense. \u201d Does this overlooked category sound familiar? Mr. Rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities. But it just so happened that at the very moment \u201csocially accepted sadism\u201d  \u2014   good phrase, that  \u2014   was diminishing, economic instability and inequality were increasing, thanks to globalization. \u201cThis world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great American capitalists of the year 1900. \u201d Again: Ring any bells? This group included intellectuals, by the way, who, he wrote, are \u201courselves quite well insulated, at least in the short run, from the effects of globalization. \u201d Which left the white   guy and gal up for grabs  \u2014   open to   populists, maybe even strongmen. In Mr. Rorty\u2019s view, no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white   anxiety. This was a problem. \u201cOutside the academy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cAmericans still want to feel patriotic. They still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place. \u201d Sounds an awful lot like Make America Great Again. At the time, Mr. Rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape. But it wasn\u2019t that different, ultimately. Today\u2019s just has more mature trees. In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d he wrote about the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement today, he\u2019d probably have cautioned against the   Partnership. In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d Mr. Rorty railed against the \u201cscurrilous demagogue\u201d Pat Buchanan, who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the Mexican border today Mr. Rorty would have railed against Mr. Trump and his proposed wall. \u201cWhy could not the left,\u201d he asked, \u201cchannel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed?\u201d Is his analysis a bit oversimple? Yes. Even within universities, there have always been optimistic champions of America, those who   believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work   on formulating concrete, actionable policies that would make the country more just. By focusing only on his own environment, academia, Mr. Rorty\u2019s arguments also seem strangely parochial. During the 1960s, the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty, but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it: Robert F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society. Right through the \u201990s and into the 2000s, we had    politicians singing the praises of hope, rather than the hopelessness that Mr. Rorty decries. Bill Clinton explicitly campaigned as the \u201cman from Hope,\u201d and Barack Obama would later campaign on a platform of \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange. \u201d In passing health care reform, Mr. Obama genuinely did something for the immiserated underclass, and both men, in their ways, rejected identity politics. (Remember Mr. Clinton dressing down Sister Souljah? Or Mr. Obama declaring on MTV that \u201cbrothers should pull up their pants\u201d?) But it wasn\u2019t enough, obviously. \u201cUnder Presidents Carter and Clinton,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote, \u201cthe Democratic Party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution. \u201d Mr. Clinton was particularly guilty of this charge, passing Nafta, appointing Robert Rubin as his Treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation. Mr. Obama pushed the   Partnership. And he was one of those fancy elites. Which brings us to Hillary Clinton. She may have had a plan to relieve the misery of the working class, but she didn\u2019t speak about it much. (Bernie Sanders did. And lost.) She was in favor of the Partnership until she was against it. In a paid speech to a Brazilian bank, she spoke of a \u201chemispheric common market\u201d for energy. And though her slogan was \u201cStronger Together,\u201d her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating difference, in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her. Here, Mr. Rorty\u2019s most inflammatory words are most relevant, and also most uncomfortable: \u201cThe cultural Left has a vision of an America in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized groups. \u201d Mrs. Clinton tried this strategy. It didn\u2019t win her the Electoral College. \u201cThis Left wants to preserve otherness rather than ignore it,\u201d he also wrote. That didn\u2019t work either. People are furiously arguing about what played a key role in this election  \u2014   whether it was white   despair, a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change. It seems reasonable to think that all three played a part. What\u2019s so striking about \u201cAchieving Our Country\u201d is that it blends these theories into a common argument: The left, both cultural and political, eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity politics, leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored. \u201cIt is as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote. \u201cAs if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money, or vice versa. \u201d You may quarrel with his argument you may say that he was projecting onto the larger world what was happening within his own cloistered, ivied walls. But Mr. Trump is now our  .'"}, "time": 1742628500.358001}
