[Someone posted the photo of Stewart appearing to give Trump the middle finger at the Frieze Art Fair taking place at Randall\u2019s Island Park in New York City on Twitter, where it went viral before the account responsible for posting the photo was set to private, the Hill reported.  \u201cWas taking a pic of Trump and Snoop Dogg at Frieze [Art Fair] and Martha Stewart walks up like this #america,\u201d user Newlin Tillotson wrote on Twitter, according to E! News. Stewart later posted a more politically correct version of the photo to her Instagram account, where she flashed peace signs towards both men while promoting the VH1 cooking show Martha  Snoop\u2019s Potluck Dinner Party that she stars in alongside Snoop and the 2017 MTV Movie and TV Awards that will air Sunday. E! News reports that an executive at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia took both photos, calling the second photo more \u201cpolitically correct\u201d and \u201cso much less interesting. \u201d Stewart publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton when she ran for president against Trump and had feuded with Trump in the past. The feud was mostly over Stewart\u2019s 2006 spinoff of Trump\u2019s The Apprentice, which got canceled after one season. The cooking show star did, however, appear to make up with Trump in 2014 at a relaunch party for the New York Observer and congratulated Trump and his family on the election win. \u201cI sent my congratulations to the Trump family, and I think they have an opportunity \u2014  let\u2019s see how they do with it. I\u2019m excited,\u201d Stewart told Chicago Inc.'"}, "time": 1742562061.9092152}
