An attack by suicide bombers at Istanbul\u2019s largest airport killed at least 36 people and wounded 140 more, according to the Turkish justice minister, Bekir Bozdag. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, the Turkish prime minister said early indications point to the Islamic State. _____ 2. The final report from the House Select Committee on Benghazi, established to investigate the deadly attacks in 2012 on an American compound in Libya, found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state. But the   report, after an inquiry lasting two years and costing an estimated $7 million, had plenty of criticism for government agencies that, it said, failed to grasp how dangerous the Libyan city was at the time of the attacks. Above, Representative Trey Gowdy, who led the committee. _____ 3. European leaders urged Britain to consummate its vote last week to leave the European Union, with one saying that Britain and Europe could be \u201cmarried, or divorced, but not something between. \u201d But the leaders of the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign seem to have no idea what to do after their victory, our analyst writes. Above, Prime Minister David Cameron, center, who has said he would step down. Here\u2019s our guide to what has happened so far. _____ 4. Pat Summitt, above, who won eight national basketball championships and more games than any other Division I college coach, male or female, died Tuesday at 64. In the course of her enormously successful career, she transformed the face of American women\u2019s sports, drawing national audiences to women\u2019s college basketball for the first time. Summitt was legendarily tough: When she dislocated her shoulder in 2008, she tried for more than an hour to reset it herself before finally calling a doctor. _____ 5. Speaking in Pennsylvania, Donald J. Trump vowed to rip up international trade deals and take a hard line against Chinese monetary policy, returning his focus to the economic grievances that have fueled his campaign. He framed his approach as a sharp contrast to the policies of \u201ca leadership class that worships globalism,\u201d and warned that his presumptive Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, would \u201cbetray\u201d those who support her. _____ 6. On July 4, a NASA spacecraft will finish a nearly 1.   trip to Jupiter, dropping into the gas planet\u2019s gravitational field and assuming orbit. At least that\u2019s the plan. Juno, which has undergone a   journey to learn more about the solar system\u2019s largest planet, will be the first craft to orbit Jupiter in more than a decade. But if anything goes wrong, it\u2019ll be impossible to react in time: Radio signals take 48 minutes to travel from Jupiter to Earth. _____ 7. Senate Democrats blocked a bill that would have provided $1. 1 billion to fight the Zika virus. They said Republicans had sabotaged the bill by adding partisan provisions, like one that included a ban on direct government financing for Planned Parenthood. The legislation\u2019s failure highlighted how partisan gridlock can hurt the government\u2019s ability to respond to a public health emergency. There are 3, 000 species of mosquitoes but in the Americas, only two are known to carry the Zika virus. In the United States, six mosquito species are particularly concerning. _____ 8. \u201cI\u2019m interested less in what qualifies something as black photography, black art, black cinema, as I am in seeing what comes of agency on the part of black artists. I\u2019m interested in seeing what comes out of their heart and mind and soul. \u201d That\u2019s Sarah Lewis, a Harvard professor who guest edited a recent issue of the photography magazine Aperture that was devoted to the black experience. She discussed the project with our Briefing picture editor, Sandra Stevenson. Above, a photo from the project. _____ 9. Amazon has competed directly with print books for some time, but on Tuesday it made a tweak to its Kindle software that borrows from the feature set of a paperback. The new interaction, called Page Flip, mimics the   habit of sticking one\u2019s thumb into a book to mark a page. Amid all the recent talk of print\u2019s resilience, Amazon is taking a page from its competitors\u2019   \u2026     well, you know. _____ 10. 2016 has been filled with film sequels that have arrived at least a decade after the original. Some of the franchises have fared well upon their return: \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d the sequel to \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d (2003) has broken the box office record for a Pixar movie, raking in $286 million. Others have been less welcome. Our critic wrote that \u201cIndependence Day: Resurgence,\u201d released last week, was plagued by \u201clackluster, sometimes abysmal, writing,\u201d and, with an opening of $41 million, the film did not exactly set the box office aflame. _____ 11. We\u2019ve put together a guide on how to respond to attacks by wild animals  \u2014   alligators, bears, sharks and mountain lions. Shark attacks can be countered by pounding them on the nose and scratching at their eyes and gills. But to avoid the encounter altogether, leave your shiny jewelry on your beach towel and avoid swimming at dawn, at dusk or at night. _____ 12. Some animals are not a summertime threat in fact, they\u2019re more likely to be threatened. The sunny season, with its thunderstorms and its fireworks, is a tough time for dogs. Some estimate that at least 40 percent of them experience noise anxiety. Animal behavior specialists differ on what should be done to soothe agitated pets, but a new   drug, Sileo, garnered mostly good reviews from animal owners. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
