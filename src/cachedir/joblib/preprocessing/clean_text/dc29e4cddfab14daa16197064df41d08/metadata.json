I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is, we\u2019re coming home. \u201d  Krauthammer said, \u201c[T]he strike on Syria was not something that is a tweak or a slight deviation from what he ran on.   \u2026     And the reason it is a radical departure is because, in the Inaugural Address he defines national interests very narrowly, and here, what we are back to is the traditional American understanding of national interests as a broad definition, going all the way back to Harry Truman, in which we define our interest as worldwide, otherwise, what is Syria to us?\u201d He added, \u201cI welcome this. I\u2019m not an America Firster. I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is, we\u2019re coming home. It scared the   out of our allies in NATO, when he talked about it being obsolete. It scared  \u2014   in the Middle East, the Gulf Arabs were scared to death. I think this is reassuring that we are returning to the classic American definition, where we include our allies, and, most important, we accept world leadership in a way that had not been accepted by Obama, and seemed to be not accepted by Trump the candidate. \u201d (video via Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564298.598925}
