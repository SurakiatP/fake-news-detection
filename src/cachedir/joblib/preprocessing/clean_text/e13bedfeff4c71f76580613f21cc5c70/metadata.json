Coverage of the riots spread across the world, as people watched on in horror at a university known for its heritage of free speech being taken over by political thugs. In an email to students, UC Berkeley chancellor Nicholas Dirks said that the university \u201ccondemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of individuals who invaded the campus, infiltrated a crowd of peaceful students, and used violent tactics to close down the event. We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence. \u201d However Dirks adds that despite going to \u201cextraordinary lengths to facilitate planning and preparation for this event,\u201d the efforts were undone by \u201c100 armed individuals clad in   uniforms who utilized paramilitary tactics to engage in violent destructive behavior designed to shut the event down. \u201d    anti fascists group have been known to infiltrate MILO events throughout the tour, with a marxist group as the \u201cFreedom Road Socialist Organisation,\u201d  infiltrating protesters at the cancelled event at UC Davis and causing violence. President Donald Trump condemned the riots, threatening to take away the university\u2019s federal funding if the university \u201cdoes not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view. \u201d If U. C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view  \u2014   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017,  We reported yesterday that the university receives over $370 million in federal funding, over half its budget.
