Tillerson signaled on Friday that the Trump administration was prepared to scrap nearly a decade of United States policy toward North Korea in favor of a more aggressive effort to eliminate the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Whether that means   action, which he warned was \u201con the table,\u201d will depend a great deal on how China responds. North Korea relies on Chinese trade and aid to keep its economy afloat, and China has long been unwilling to withdraw that support. Up to 40 percent of the North\u2019s foreign currency  \u2014   essential for buying goods abroad  \u2014   comes from a network of about 600 Chinese companies, according to a recent study by Sayari Analytics, a Washington financial intelligence firm. Mr. Tillerson went to China on Saturday, a day after saying in Seoul, South Korea, that the United States would not negotiate with North Korea on freezing its nuclear and missile programs. His interactions with his hosts in Beijing, and whether he takes a hard line with China over its support for North Korea, will be closely watched  \u2014   as will be China\u2019s response. A sign of the administration\u2019s stance came on Friday as President Trump criticized both North Korea and the Chinese government. \u201cNorth Korea is behaving very badly,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThey have been \u2018playing\u2019 the United States for years. China has done little to help!\u201d The Chinese leadership is likely to bristle at such criticism, but it may be reviewing its options, given the collision course that North Korea and the United States seem to be on. Last month, Beijing showed a new willingness to punish its longtime ally when it suspended imports of North Korean coal, saying it had reached the annual limit allowed under United Nations sanctions. Customs figures later showed that China had in fact imported only about 30 percent of the quota for 2017. Yang Xiyu, a veteran Chinese diplomat involved with North Korea, said Mr. Tillerson may be able to persuade Chinese leaders to do more when he meets with them in Beijing this weekend, particularly against Chinese companies that do business with the North. Mr. Yang cited as a potential model the case that United States officials built last year against a Chinese executive accused of selling North Korea a chemical that can be used in   centrifuges. While Beijing was not happy about the case, it eventually accepted it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but it was the right way to push the issue to a solution,\u201d he said. When the United States filed criminal charges against the businesswoman, Ma Xiaohong, the owner of the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company, other Chinese companies conducting similar transactions were apparently left untouched. But Mr. Yang, who was a top negotiator for China during   talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2009, suggested that those companies may now be vulnerable. If the United States continues to present evidence of illegal activities that contravene China\u2019s responsibilities under United Nations sanctions, \u201cthere is a great deal of room for cooperation,\u201d he said. He noted that China had published five executive orders, totaling more than 900 pages, listing items banned from export to North Korea. \u201cSuch activities violate China\u2019s adherence to those orders,\u201d he said. Mr. Yang added: \u201cThe United States should say, \u2018Let\u2019s extend our cooperation to implementation of the United Nations resolutions on sanctions.\u2019 They should say, \u2018Starting with the Hongxiang case, let\u2019s move forward. \u2019\u201d In Beijing, Mr. Tillerson met with China\u2019s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and the foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Saturday. He will see President Xi Jinping on Sunday. \u201cWe have committed ourselves to do everything we can to prevent a conflict from breaking out,\u201d Mr Tillerson said at a press conference after meeting Mr. Wang. The secretary said China and the United States \u201cwill work together\u201d to see if they could make North Korea take \u201ca course correction and move away from nuclear weapons. \u201d Mr. Tillerson declined to specify the \u201cnumber of steps\u201d that would be taken to achieve that goal. Over the past   the Chinese government has been unwilling to cripple the North Korean economy, fearing a refugee crisis or a destabilizing conflict on its border. North Korea imports virtually all of its oil from China, and cutting off the spigot could severely undermine the North Korean economy. Doing so, however, would almost certainly cause chaos in North Korea, something China fears. Round after round of economic sanctions have failed to persuade North Korea\u2019s leaders to abandon their nuclear ambitions. China has long justified its support for North Korea on humanitarian grounds, and rejected accusations that it has been unwilling to get tough on Pyongyang. But with North Korea closing in on its goal of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States, and the Trump administration deploying a missile defense system to South Korea that China considers a threat to its security, the Chinese leadership\u2019s calculus may be shifting. \u201cIt is not a foregone conclusion that China\u2019s leaders will shelter North Korea,\u201d Anthony Ruggiero, a former United States Treasury official involved in sanctions enforcement against Pyongyang, told a congressional panel last month. Mr. Ruggiero said the United States would be likeliest to achieve Chinese cooperation from a position of strength. In 2013, he noted, when the Treasury blacklisted North Korea\u2019s primary foreign exchange bank for contributing to the proliferation of nuclear materials, the Bank of China, one of China\u2019s major commercial banks, immediately closed its account with the North Korean outfit. Now, no major Chinese banks deal with North Korea for fear of being penalized by the United States, though smaller ones do, along with front companies operating along the North Korean border with few links to the United States financial system, according to American sanctions experts. \u201cThis is a good example of China acting to cut off North Korea\u2019s activities inside China when those actions threaten China\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Mr. Ruggierio said of the Bank of China\u2019s severance of its North Korea connections. A more recent episode that could serve as a model came last week, when the United States Department of Commerce fined ZTE, one of China\u2019s biggest technology companies, $1. 19 billion for breaking sanctions and selling electronics to Iran and North Korea. \u201cThis is what the U. S. should be doing, but finding it out ain\u2019t easy,\u201d said Stephan Haggard, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which is based in Washington. \u201cI think that Commerce pretty much had a gun to ZTE\u2019s head. \u201d Officials in the Trump administration have discussed putting pressure on Chinese banks through \u201csecondary sanctions,\u201d which would make it hard for any bank that did business with the North to also deal in American dollars. That technique worked against Iran, helping to force it to the negotiating table over its own nuclear program. But such measures are likely to have much less impact in North Korea, which is already isolated, than they did in Iran, a major trading nation, sanctions experts said. \u201cNorth Korea has one of the smallest international trade profiles on earth,\u201d said Joseph M. DeThomas, a former American ambassador who served as a State Department adviser on Iran and North Korea sanctions. \u201cNorth Korea often has to   the entire financial system to move money. They do things the   way: sending guys on airplanes with suitcases full of money. \u201d In an opinion article this week in The New York Times, a former United States deputy secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said the Obama administration had quietly pressed countries to eject North Korean workers whose remittances help fund the country\u2019s military. He did not say how successful that effort had been. Tens of thousands of such workers are employed in China\u2019s northeastern cities like Dandong and Hunchun, along the North Korean border. But Marcus Noland, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he believed the organized export of labor earned the North Korean government less than has often been reported  \u2014   hundreds of millions of dollars per year, probably less than half a billion, he said. \u201cThe next time you hear the claim of $2 billion annual earnings from the organized export of labor, remember not to believe everything you hear,\u201d he said. Far more has been contributed in foreign currency by Chinese companies doing trade across the border, said Jessica Knight, director of analysis at Sayari Analytics. \u201cCustoms data indicates more than $8 billion in   trade between China and North Korea since 2013, much of it in commodities like coal and steel,\u201d she said. Whether any sanctions at all will deter the North from its nuclear pursuits is far from clear. The former United States defense secretary William J. Perry, who dealt with the North Korean problem during the Clinton administration, said on Friday in Beijing that he doubted they would. \u201cWe have sanctioned them a hundred times, and it didn\u2019t stop developing nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to be prepared to suffer economic deprivation for the people so they can achieve the preservation of the regime, which they think that nuclear weapons is going to do for them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562051.5228276}
