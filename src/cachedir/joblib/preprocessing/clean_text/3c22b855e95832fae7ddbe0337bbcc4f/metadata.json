Some will publicly surface, most will remain buried sub-strata. \\nThe Deep State is not monolithic or homogeneous but is composed of many seemingly disparate elements or competing factions united by their systemic base criminality under the phony rubric of \u201cnational security.\u201d \\nAdministrations change, but the Deep State endures. \\nI think the overall standard perception of Trump as viewed as an outlier or dangerous loose cannon to the statist old guard elites who see his enormous ego, hubris, and independence of mind as threatening to their rackets is breaking down and being challenged late in the game by some factions. Raison d\u2019\u00e9tat, institutional loyalty and self-interest trumps everything else. \\nThe Clinton ties to epic criminality and predation are thoroughly documented but under-reported by the regime media in thrall to their Deep State suzerains up to this point. She is now being deemed expendable by some elements. And like Huma, she will be thrown under the bus. \\nSome of those factions within the Deep State \u2014 particularly those un-elected powerful bureaucrats deep within the permanent government and Pentagon that determine actual day-to-day policy from one administration to another, will turn on Hillary, out of amoral self-interest and institutional loyalty. \\nJames Comey is perhaps the first and most notable. \\nPrepare for the Night of the Long Knives, version 2016. 3:14 pm on October 30, 2016'"}, "time": 1742628581.2504504}
