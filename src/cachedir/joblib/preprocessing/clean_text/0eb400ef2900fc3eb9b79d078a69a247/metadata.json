A pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? Or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft? By talking on Friday with Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai   Mr. Trump answered that question in stark terms, Chinese analysts said Saturday. Breaking decades of American diplomatic practice, he caught the Chinese government off guard by lunging into the most sensitive of its   core interests, the \u201cOne China\u201d policy agreed to by President Richard M. Nixon more than four decades ago. \u201cThis is a   call for Beijing  \u2014   we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the  . S. relationship,\u201d Wang Dong, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University, said Saturday. \u201cThere was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about Trump. That should stop. \u201d Chinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with Washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump to appear in the   news media. Many of those accounts have depicted the   as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person China might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war. In the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as Mr. Trump begins his administration, Beijing will probably take a    attitude despite his phone call with Ms. Tsai, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. Indeed, China\u2019s first official reaction, from Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was fairly benign  \u2014   though it was firm in reiterating the One China policy, under which the United States formally recognized Beijing as China\u2019s sole government in 1978 and broke ties with Taiwan a year later. No American president or   had spoken to a Taiwanese president since then. Mr. Wang blamed Ms. Tsai\u2019s government for arranging the call. \u201cIt won\u2019t stand a chance to change the One China policy agreed upon by the international community,\u201d he said. A   statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the United States government, was similar in tone. It urged \u201crelevant parties in the U. S. \u201d to \u201cdeal with the Taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner. \u201d China\u2019s leaders disdain Ms. Tsai, of Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party, who was elected president this year after pledging to wean the island off its economic dependence on China, a policy that won enthusiastic support from younger Taiwanese. China favored her original opponent, Hung   of the Kuomintang, which has sought closer ties with mainland China. (Ms. Hung later dropped out of the race.) Before the election, President Xi Jinping of China met with Ms. Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma   also of the Kuomintang, in the first encounter between the leaders of the two governments, a rapprochement that Beijing had long sought. Mr. Trump broke a Chinese taboo merely by using Ms. Tsai\u2019s title. The Chinese state news media refer to the Taiwanese president as the \u201cleader of the Taiwan region,\u201d to indicate that Beijing regards Taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as Chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control. A basic tenet of the Chinese government is that Taiwan, where Chiang  \u2019s forces fled in 1949 after losing China\u2019s civil war, will be brought back into the fold. According to Mr. Xi, Taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his   China Dream, a vision of an economically successful Communist China astride the world. Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call also violated a longstanding principle of American policy: that the president does not speak to the head of Taiwan\u2019s government, despite selling arms to it. \u201cInteresting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter after the stunned reaction to his conversation with Ms. Tsai. Though Beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of   practice. Since the   Washington has signaled to Taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from China. The Obama administration\u2019s last arms sale to Taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest  \u2014   consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1. 8 billion in total  \u2014   but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from Beijing. Douglas H. Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents American interests there, said it would not be surprising if the United States sold arms to Taiwan early in the Trump administration. Beijing\u2019s reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed China of the sale, Mr. Paal said. While it broke diplomatic precedent, Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of Republican presidents\u2019 reaching out to Taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office. George W. Bush, for example, was vocal in his support of Taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the United States would do \u201cwhatever it took\u201d to defend it. His aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the One China policy. By the end of his second term, Mr. Bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between Beijing and Washington through the approval of China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. Though Mr. Trump has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some Chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer China opportunities to show strength. Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the   States relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. He said China, with its growing military and the   economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. \u201cChina is increasingly resilient to the United States,\u201d he said. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, took a contrarian view of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Ms. Tsai: He said it was not a problem because Mr. Trump had yet to take office. \u201cHe is a private citizen,\u201d he said. But if such contacts continue after Inauguration Day, Mr. Shen said, China should end diplomatic relations with the United States. \u201cI would close our embassy in Washington and withdraw our diplomats,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. I don\u2019t know how you are then going to expect China to cooperate on Iran and North Korea and climate change. You are going to ask Taiwan for that?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561974.6466875}
