Worse still, there may be reason to suspect he was fed the question in advance and gave a premeditated, Machiavellian answer. \\nWhile talking to actress and rapper Gina Rodriguez on the Latin-oriented YouTube channel MiTu, Obama was asked, \u201cMany of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, um, citizens \u2014 and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country \u2014 are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?\u201d Here was Obama\u2019s answer (video below): Not true. And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself \u2014 and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. \\nMany Americans, such as Arizona governor Jan Brewer, were taken aback. As Breitbart reports , \u201c\u2018Shocking. Absolutely shocking,\u2019 Brewer said to [Fox] TV host Neil Cavuto. Obama \u2018should have absolutely set [the interviewer] straight that if you\u2019re not a citizen, you don\u2019t get to vote. And just because you\u2019re in our country \u201cundocumented,\u201d you\u2019re not a citizen. The [Democrats] want to blur the lines.\u2019\u201d \\nAnd no one was more shocked than Cavuto himself (video below; relevant portion starts at 34 seconds). As WND.com related : \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I heard what I heard,\u201d Cavuto said on his broadcast. \u201cThe president isn\u2019t even questioning whether the person who is an illegal is voting, outside of reminding people that if you\u2019re a citizen, you vote. But it\u2019s very clear that the question that is being asked was about illegals voting and afraid that they might be reported to Border Security. You\u2019re illegal. You cannot vote.\u201d \u201cThe President of the United States is saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, no one will be spying on you, catching you,'\u201d Cavuto added. \u201cYou\u2019re ignoring the fact that you are being questioned about illegal voting, which you can\u2019t do. Why? Because you\u2019re not a citizen of this country!\u201d \\nSome observers say there\u2019s more to this, pointing out that Fox didn\u2019t play Obama\u2019s follow-up remarks. The president had gone on to say, \u201cIf you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.\u201d Rodriguez then chimed in, \u201cThis has been a huge fear presented especially during this election,\u201d prompting Obama to add: And the reason that fear is promoted is because they don\u2019t want people voting. People are discouraged from voting and part of what is important for Latino citizens is to make your voice heard, because you\u2019re not just speaking for yourself. You\u2019re speaking for family members, friends, classmates of yours in school ... who may not have a voice, who can\u2019t legally vote. But they\u2019re counting on you to make sure that you have the courage to make your voice heard. \\nOne outlet offering a more benign interpretation is Breitbart , which writes, \u201cObama\u2019s reply was clumsily worded, but he appeared to say that if a U.S. citizen with illegal alien family members who continue to stay in the U.S. in defiance of the law votes, immigration authorities will not use that voters\u2019 information to begin deportation proceedings against their illegal alien relatives.\u201d And, truth be known, Obama\u2019s reply was clumsy. \\nOr brilliant. \\nIn a Machiavellian sort of way. \\nWhile Breitbart\u2019s is one interpretation, another is that Obama was cleverly giving a green light for illegal voting while giving himself plausible deniability that he was not doing so. Note that he didn\u2019t take issue with Rodriguez\u2019 absurd notion that the mere fact of being present in the country and \u201ccontributing,\u201d whatever that means (others would say \u201cleeching\u201d), makes one a \u201ccitizen.\u201d Given this, Obama\u2019s statement that \u201cwhen you vote, you are a citizen yourself\u201d could be taken to mean that the mere act of \u201cparticipating\u201d in our civic life makes you a citizen in spirit. \\nNote also that Obama subsequently said that you have even more of a reason to cast a ballot if you have relatives who \u201ccan\u2019t legally vote\u201d (emphasis added). Does this imply that they \u201ccan\u201d\u2014 a word denoting capability , not what one should do ethically \u2014 vote illegally? After all, they certainly can , given that illegals can obtain driver\u2019s licenses in many states, and proof of citizenship may not be a prerequisite for voting . Realize, too, that Obama has been flooding the US with illegals, ordering they not be deported and that the border patrol stand down. It\u2019s logical to assume he\u2019s doing this for a reason. \\nThe obvious answer to Rodriguez\u2019 question was, \u201cOnly citizens may vote, and if you\u2019re a citizen, why would the government be interested in investigating you for not being one?\u201d That Obama didn\u2019t thus respond is suspicious. \\nIt\u2019s also a distinct possibility that Obama had been told of the question in advance and that this was why he could craft a Machiavellian response. WikiLeaks has exposed a shocking amount of collusion between the media and Democrat Party, with a New York Times reporter giving Hillary Clinton veto power over quotations and media figures feeding her debate questions ahead of time. Then there are the even more recent revelations that CNN and the Democratic National Committee colluded in devising questions to be asked of Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, and that a Washington Post journalist asked the DNC for anti-Trump research for an article. \\nAs to possible Rodriguez/Obama collusion, please observe the host\u2019s reaction, at 22-23 seconds in the first video, when Obama replies \u201cwhen you vote, you\u2019re a citizen yourself,\u201d an answer which begins at 18 seconds. She appears as if she may be suppressing a self-satisfied smirk. \\nIf so, there are only a few possible explanations. She might have simply been kvelling at being seated with the president \u2014 yet this doesn\u2019t explain why she registered that reaction at that particular moment. She might have been thoroughly pleased that Obama appeared to affirm her notion that \u201ccontributing\u201d equals citizenship. \\nOr she might have been reveling in helping to orchestrate a well-oiled con, in being a facilitator of clever, agenda-advancing wordplay. \\nOf course, this is conjecture. Readers can review the relevant portion of the video a number of times and draw their own conclusions. \\nWhatever the case \u2014 whether the answer was off-the-cuff or calculated \u2014 it reveals Obama\u2019s heart. He\u2019s a president who has repeatedly trampled the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. In opposing voter ID, the absence of which shocked the UN observers who monitored our 2012 election, Obama has signaled that he wishes to facilitate illegal voting. We also have seen Project Veritas videos in which a Democrat operative boasted that liberals have been committing vote fraud for \u201c50 years.\u201d Moreover, a recently released WikiLeaks e-mail shows that the Clinton campaign believes that in 2008 Obama operatives \u201cflooded the caucuses with ineligible voters.\u201d And the best predictor of future (mis)behavior is past (mis)behavior. \\nIf there is any doubt about Obama\u2019s MiTu answer, he certainly hasn\u2019t earned the benefit of it.  \""}, "time": 1742628458.6574545}
