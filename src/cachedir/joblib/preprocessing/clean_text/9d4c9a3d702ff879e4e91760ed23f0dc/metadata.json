But it is probably safe to say that none of the 28 leaders who are gathering in Malta on Friday expected the crisis that has overtaken the agenda: the United States of America. Like much of the world, the European Union is struggling to decipher a President Trump who seems every day to be picking a new fight with a new nation, whether friend or foe. Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump\u2019s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating, replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement over how to proceed. If many foreign leaders expected a Trump administration to push to renegotiate trade deals, or take a tough line on immigration, few anticipated that he would become an equal opportunity offender. He has insulted or humiliated Mexico, Britain, Germany and Iraq engaged in a war of words with China and Iran and turned a routine phone call with the prime minister of Australia, a staunch ally, into a minor diplomatic crisis. With the possible exception of NATO, where he has softened his tone, Mr. Trump has expressed disdain for other multilateral institutions such as the European Union. His praise has been reserved for populists and strongmen, like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U. K. Independence Party, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and, of course, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump is convinced that the United States has been played for a patsy by the rest of the world and is vowing to set things straight. \u201cWe\u2019re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually,\u201d he said on Thursday at a prayer breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen anymore. \u201d Against this forbidding backdrop, some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge, one that threatens to upend not only the   European project of integration and security, but just about everything they stand for, including liberal democracy itself. A European official, Donald Tusk, created a stir this week when he wrote a letter to 27 leaders of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states suggesting that the Trump administration presented a threat on a par with a newly assertive China, an aggressive Russia and \u201cwars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa. \u201d Intentionally, he left out Britain, because it has voted to leave the bloc and its prime minister, Theresa May, has rushed with what some Europeans consider unseemly rapidity to the side of Mr. Trump, who has derided the European Union and praised Britain\u2019s withdrawal, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters much for the United States. \u201d In his letter, Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is the president of the European Council, made up of the national leaders, wrote of \u201cworrying declarations\u201d from the Trump team, adding: \u201cParticularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation, with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy. \u201d Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador working in Brussels, said that Mr. Tusk \u201cis prone to exaggeration\u201d and that he had a specific Polish fear of Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent coziness with Mr. Putin. But Mr. Tusk \u201chas some justification,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said, because he is also reacting to a complacent Brussels establishment \u201cthat he believes is shrugging off Brexit, Trump and   populism and believes it\u2019s business as usual. \u201d Others say Mr. Tusk is adapting realistically to a series of new dangers posed by the new administration in Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s open protectionism, his contempt for the European Union and his ambivalence toward NATO are serious and damaging, which Mr. Tusk understands, said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTrump is the first American president since the E. U. was created not to be in favor of deeper European integration,\u201d Mr. Leonard said. \u201cNot only that, but he\u2019s against it and sees the destruction of the European Union as in America\u2019s interest. \u201d Worse, he said: \u201cEuropeans see Trump as the biggest threat to global order and the European ideal of how the world should be organized. The U. S. has been a crucial part of the ballast meant to be upholding the global order in the face of these other challenges Tusk mentions, from Russia and China to Islamic radicalism. \u201d \u201cBut rather than acting as a check on these forces, Trump seems to be amplifying them, and that\u2019s pretty terrifying,\u201d Mr. Leonard continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like you suddenly discover that the medicine you\u2019ve been taking is making you sicker than the illness itself. \u201d For his part, Mr. Trump described his confrontational diplomatic style as a necessity. \u201cThe world is in trouble, but we\u2019re going to straighten it out, O. K.?\u201d he said at the prayer breakfast on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do  \u2014   I fix things. \u201d He added: \u201cBelieve me, when you hear about the tough phone calls I\u2019m having, don\u2019t worry about it. Just don\u2019t worry about it. \u201d There have been other moments when Europeans judged American policies as harmful, including the Iraq war and the assaults on multilateralism early in the first term of President George W. Bush. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s attacks are of a different scale and come when there\u2019s a lot of indigenous turmoil anyway,\u201d Mr. Leonard said. \u201cHe seems to be linking up with some of the scariest and darkest forces within European societies,\u201d which all want the European Union to fail, he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s views about Europe and his reluctance to commit to summit meetings with the European Union or even with NATO are deeply troubling for Europeans, said Leslie Vinjamuri, a professor of international relations at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies. \u201cAmerica\u2019s strategy towards Europe has always been highly consequential, but up until now that strategy has been aimed at bolstering Europe,\u201d she said. The United States has provided \u201cthat overarching protection and alliance that underpins the whole thing and makes it work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut dealing with Russia and China is suddenly a whole different calculus if you don\u2019t have America behind you. \u201d Then there is Germany and the euro. Traditionally, Europeans view Germany as the bulwark of the European Union, its largest, richest and most influential country, but uncomfortable with open leadership. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, up for   this autumn, is viewed as practical, pragmatic and devoted to the European project, and Germans see the euro as a political sacrifice they made of the revered deutsche mark to please the French. So they deeply resent Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Ms. Merkel for her refugee policy and his statements that the European Union itself is a \u201cvehicle\u201d for German  . Ms. Merkel was angry over comments by Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, that Germany was manipulating a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to gain trade advantages over other Europeans and the United States. While Germany depends heavily on exports, annoying some of its neighbors, the value of the euro is the same for all that use it, and Ms. Merkel made clear that its value was up to the European Central Bank, not Berlin. But a protectionist America that opposes free trade is certainly unhelpful to Germany. Added to that are the comments by Ted Malloch, who has been advertising himself as Mr. Trump\u2019s top choice to succeed Anthony L. Gardner as ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Malloch, a strong supporter of Britain leaving the bloc, has publicly said that Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t like an organization that is supranational, that is unelected, where the bureaucrats run amok, and is not frankly a proper democracy. \u201d Mr. Malloch has also referred to   Juncker, the European Commission president, as \u201ca very adequate mayor of some city in Luxembourg,\u201d predicted that the euro would collapse and compared the bloc to the Soviet Union. \u201cI had in a previous career a diplomatic post where I helped bring down the Soviet Union,\u201d he said on British television. \u201cSo maybe there\u2019s another union that needs a little taming. \u201d Mr. Malloch may not get nominated, and if he does, the bloc may not accept his posting, Mr. Gardner said. Mr. Trump is \u201cgetting advice that is a caricature of the E. U. as a dysfunctional entity, not delivering and wholly inaccurate, despite all the challenges,\u201d Mr. Gardner said, citing joint   efforts in counterterrorism, trade, sanctions, security, digital privacy and policing. \u201cEven Mrs. May has said Britain sees a cohesive E. U. in British interests. She doesn\u2019t want to see a disintegrating E. U. on its doorstep and nor do we. Hopefully that will be heard by others in the administration. \u201d Mr. Tusk, he said, has a point, trying to dissuade other European Union nations, like Hungary and Poland, from rushing to Washington to try to make separate deals, which would be illegal, with the Trump administration. China and Russia, too, have always tried to ignore the European Union and deal bilaterally with member states, something Mr. Trump seems to be encouraging. The French, who are being tough on a British withdrawal and are deeply disconcerted by Mr. Trump, see him as a bigger threat to European cohesion, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform. \u201cThey see the three great world powers  \u2014   Russia, China and now the U. S.  \u2014   wanting to destroy the E. U.,\u201d he said. One impact of Mr. Trump that Mr. Tusk is clearly hoping for, Mr. Grant said, is \u201cto reinforce a feeling of solidarity among mainstream European politicians. \u201d Another result, said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a senior adviser with the French Foundation for Strategic Research, may be a more serious European effort at forming its own defense capacity, which may not be in the interests of NATO or the United States. The American commitment to NATO and the European Union has been unconditional since their creation, Mr. Heisbourg said. \u201cBut Trump sees alliances as transactional, and once you state that, countries like Poland, Hungary and Japan start to hedge their bets. \u201d But Mr. Heisbourg also notes the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s dark view of the world as a helpless America being taken to the cleaners by its allies. \u201cIn the Trump world there are no sunny uplands, just darkness and hatred,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in a continent that has had its share of hatred, this resonates. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562994.416444}
