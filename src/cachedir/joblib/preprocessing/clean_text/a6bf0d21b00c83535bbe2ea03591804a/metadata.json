Shocked viewers couldn\u2019t believe what was seen in her post, which she didn\u2019t catch until it was way too late. \\nAlthough we\u2019ve seen how good Hillary is at hitting the \u201cdelete\u201d button, she didn\u2019t get to it quick enough after what she mindlessly posted that proved what Americans have suspected. Evidently, she didn\u2019t realize she was making a point against herself when she made the comment with the post that said, \u201cA guide to help you make your choice for president,\u201d which mad the mistake all the worse for her. \\nEither Hillary takes full responsibility for being corrupt by apparently admitting to it, or the person that does her social media is paying a big price today. Without reading what she was sharing, Hillary blindly posted an article from the super liberal news site, Slate, assuming that if it was from them, it was pro-Hillary, when the title of the piece called her out for being one of the \u201cmost corrupt, least popular candidates of all time.\u201d A guide to help you make your choice for president. https://t.co/QzK7XZYmJW \\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 \\nUrging her followers in the comment with the post to use it as a guide for making the best presidential pick, it was the best and most honest advice she\u2019s ever given. It\u2019s for this reason that the post was likely an accident since we all know that Hillary is incapable of being truthful, but karma, in this case, ensured she was. The irony of the situation isn\u2019t lost on conservatives but apparently was on Slate, whose piece was actually meant to promote the Democratic candidate but came across as just the opposite. \\nThe truth has a sneaky way of coming out as it did in this headline, which calls attention to this woman\u2019s lack of character and qualifications for the presidency. For once, there\u2019s finally some common ground conservatives have found within this liberal publication\u2019s pages, and that\u2019s that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and incapable of being a leader.'"}, "time": 1742561913.051748}
