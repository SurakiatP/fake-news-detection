Hawthorne then contacted the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the office overseeing the elections in Texas, and was informed to create emergency paper ballots to be used until the problem could be fixed.\u201d \\nHawthorne claims she discovered the problem Monday morning after she cast her own vote and reviewed the electronic ballot. \\n\u201cMoving temporarily to paper ballots in such a situation is standard protocol,\u201d Hawthorne reportedly told 12NewsNow . \\nOn Wednesday, Hawthorne issued another press release claiming the machines had been fixed. \\n\u201cUsing paper ballots in the interim, as prescribed by the Texas Election Code, allowed our vendor to resolve the issue quickly,\u201d she wrote. \\nElsewhere in Texas , in towns such as Arlington and Amarillo, other voters have reported witnessing their votes flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. \\nElection officials in those places, however, blamed users for the errors. \\nEarlier in the week, Infowars attempted to speak with the Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram about public concerns over possible voter fraud, but he didn\u2019t want to talk to us.
