[Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases  \u2026      \u2026      \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017,   like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don\u2019t let the Schumer clowns out of this web  \u2026      \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017,  massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight  \u2014   be careful!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017,  Trump\u2019s tweeting comes after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted Republicans for planning to repeal and replace the healthcare law. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos rather than affordable care. Because once you repeal and don\u2019t replace it with anything, lots of things happen. Costs go up. All the insurance companies and everybody else in charge are going to charge a lot more because they are not sure what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Schumer stated during an interview with Politico. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose a lot of benefits, unless the Republicans put tens of billions of dollars down on the table.   \u2026     They are like the dog who caught the bus.   \u2026     Because you cannot repeal a plan and put nothing in its place. It doesn\u2019t matter if you say the repeal won\u2019t take place for a year or two years. \u201d Vice   Mike Pence, like Obama, is also heading to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Republican lawmakers to discuss repealing and replacing the law.'"}, "time": 1742562347.205342}
