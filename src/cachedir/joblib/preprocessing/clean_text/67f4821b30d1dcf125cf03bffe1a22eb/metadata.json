[\u201cI don\u2019t think the president owns a bathrobe,\u201d Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One in response to the story. \u201cHe definitely doesn\u2019t wear one. \u201d  The story reported that Trump was struggling being \u201ccloistered\u201d inside the White House, and that his senior aides were having difficulty adjusting to their new roles in the White House  \u2014   and to each other. But Spicer accused the reporters of getting the story horribly wrong, calling it \u201cliterally the epitome of fake news. \u201d \u201cThat story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally blatant factual errors and it\u2019s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or   reporting. \u201d Spicer accused the New York Times reporters of failing their readers by printing unsubstantiated rumors. \u201cFrom top to bottom it made up stories that don\u2019t exist and I think that\u2019s unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564026.0722008}
