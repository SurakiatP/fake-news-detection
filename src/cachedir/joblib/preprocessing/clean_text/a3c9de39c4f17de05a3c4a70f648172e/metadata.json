These days, fans just want to see their team win a game after six consecutive defeats. \\n{snip} \\nAfter leading the 49ers to a promising 14-0 first-quarter lead, Kaepernick and the offense sputtered. He completed just 16 of 34 passes for 134 yards with one touchdown and one interception. \\nKaepernick\u2019s scrambling\u2013he led the team with 84 rushing yards on nine carries\u2013and occasional flashes of accurate downfield passing, weren\u2019t enough, even with the 49ers firmly in the game midway through the fourth quarter. \\n{snip} \\nKaepernick donned a T-shirt Sunday paying tribute to the Black Panther Party, an Oakland activist group that celebrated its 50th anniversary this weekend. The quarterback said the shirt was a gift from his girlfriend, MTV host Nessa Diab. \\nLast week, he wore a shirt with Muhammad Ali\u2019s face before the game at Buffalo. \\nKaepernick\u2019s protest against police shootings of unarmed African Americans has been divisive because some say it is disrespectful to veterans. A recent survey by Yahoo Sports and YouGov found that a decline in NFL ratings partially is attributed to the quarterback\u2019s action. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about ratings and how they are affected,\u201d he said in a postgame interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand why ratings would go down fighting for justice for people, to try to stop oppression, especially in the league that is predominately black.\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562412.333753}
