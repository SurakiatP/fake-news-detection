The traditional garb was meant to make it clear whom they represented: the people of West Papua, site of  \u2019s Grasberg mine  \u2014   one of the world\u2019s largest sources of gold and copper. Their shouted slogans made it equally clear what they wanted. \u201cFreeport must be shut down!\u201d the crowd chanted. It was a refrain that, in recent months, has resonated throughout Indonesia. Less than a week earlier, dozens of students from a different organization  \u2014   dressed in red and white, Indonesia\u2019s national colors  \u2014   gathered outside the same office, calling for the government to take a firm hand with the company. \u201cFreeport hasn\u2019t brought prosperity. It\u2019s just destroyed the natural environment,\u201d said Surya Anta, national coordinator for the Indonesian People\u2019s Front for West Papua. His organization helped organize   protests in 17 cities around the country. Billions of dollars\u2019 worth of metal is produced at the mighty Grasberg mine, which provides jobs in a province with few other prospects. The problem? The mine is  \u2014   to the frustration of Indonesians watching their country\u2019s economic growth begin to sputter as commodity prices sag  \u2014   American owned and operated. To address that, the government has in recent years passed regulations intended to exert greater control over mine operators. Freeport says those requirements violate the company\u2019s 1991 contract, which lasts until 2021 and which it wants to renew. The dispute has put the brakes on production at the mine and slammed Freeport directly into Indonesian politics. The company, which counts as a major investor the billionaire Carl Icahn, a major backer of President Trump, has brought it to the attention of the United States government. \u201cIt is disingenuous and insulting that Indonesia would violate a contract by hiding behind politically motivated laws that were enacted after the contract was signed,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. Jakarta is already in the midst of a tough race for governor that has engulfed the capital in demonstrations against Gov. Basuki Purnama, an ally of President Joko Widodo. Considered   Mr. Joko faces pressure to push back against an unpopular company at a time of declining exports, relatively slow economic growth and high political tension. The contract fight exemplifies Indonesia\u2019s often fraught transition from a country exploited by colonial powers to one with the political clout to control its own resources, which are worth billions of dollars. For many Indonesians, Freeport, the biggest mining operation here, puts a face on that struggle. \u201cWe are hoping that if Freeport is nationalized, the revenue from Freeport will be distributed to ordinary people, to subsidize basic needs and education,\u201d said Ahmad Hedar, a student activist. Freeport has operated Grasberg since the early 1970s, the crown jewel in what a former chief executive called its global \u201ctrove of treasures. \u201d Indonesia, however, sees the mine as a national resource whose riches are being spirited away to foreign owners. \u201cFreeport pays only 8 trillion rupiah in taxes,\u201d but complains about unfair treatment, Ignasius Jonan, the minister of energy and natural resources, told the youth wing of a prominent Muslim organization in February. That figure, about $600 million, compares with about $3. 1 billion worth of gold and copper mined in 2015. But the company says that from 1992 to 2015, about 60 percent of its profit was returned to Indonesia in taxes, royalties, fees and stock dividends. Both sides have threatened to take the contract disagreement to international arbitration. Until the dispute is resolved, the Grasberg mine will run at about 40 percent capacity without a licensing deal, the Indonesian government will not allow Freeport to export unprocessed minerals. The price of copper has been stable since a sharp rise in November, but the company\u2019s shares have dropped nearly 20 percent in the last two months. \u201cIt is in the best interests of all stakeholders to receive a resolution in these matters,\u201d Richard Adkerson, the chief executive of Freeport, said in a written statement to The New York Times. The Indonesian government faces extraordinary pressure from its citizens and national media to be firm with Freeport. This is driven by a perception that the company has consistently taken advantage of the Indonesian government since it entered the country in 1967 as one of its first big foreign investors. That year, Indonesia\u2019s strongman leader, Suharto, granted Freeport a   tax holiday, as well as a reprieve from paying royalties, though Indonesia\u2019s terms improved over the decades as the country\u2019s economy developed. Some Indonesian media reports have called Freeport a \u201cmonument\u201d to the Suharto era. \u201cIndonesians have always been educated that they have   resources that are the envy of the entire world, but that over the years Western colonial powers have hatched schemes to take over Indonesia to exploit those resources,\u201d said Matthew Busch, a research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy. Indonesia\u2019s largest Muslim civic organizations have aggressively opposed foreign control over the country\u2019s resources, including calling for a \u201cconstitutional jihad\u201d to challenge Indonesian laws that allow foreign companies to control domestic resources. The resulting friction has made Indonesia one of the world\u2019s least attractive mining investment environments, according to the Fraser Institute, a Canadian research organization, which ranked it the 99th most difficult out of 104 nations, states and regions in 2016. Eve Warburton, a researcher at Australian National University who studies Indonesian resource nationalism, said that over the last decade Indonesian politicians had consistently been more assertive toward foreign mining companies. \u201cNow it seems many people in government believe that Indonesia can afford to stay the nationalist path in the resources sectors,\u201d she said. The conditions may be scaring off business. Last year Newmont, an American miner, sold its stake in Indonesia\u2019s Batu Hijau copper mine after struggling to adjust to Indonesian regulations. Rio Tinto, the   company, has a deal to develop Grasberg with Freeport, but its chief executive suggested in February that the company might back out over the new rules. International analysts say Freeport\u2019s contract might not be as   as many Indonesian government officials make it out to be. And despite the uncompromising statements from both sides, they say, a deal remains in reach. \u201cI see this as smoke and mirrors,\u201d said Bill Sullivan, a lawyer and mining analyst in Jakarta. \u201cThe government has no incentive whatsoever to make things so difficult for metal mineral producers that they won\u2019t reach an agreement. Because of the government\u2019s need for deep political cover, however, it has to relax the export ban in a way that does not make it look as though the government is caving in to metal mineral producers. \u201d Papua Province, where the Grasberg mine is, is Indonesia\u2019s most restive and least developed, with a small independence movement that clashes with the military. Freeport pays about $20 million annually to the Indonesian government for security, including payments to Indonesia\u2019s military, which has been linked to human rights abuses in the province. The payments have periodically drawn the scrutiny of human rights organizations as well as pension funds that invest in the company. But with Vice President Mike Pence scheduled to visit Indonesia in April, politicians here are unconcerned about effects on international relations. \u201cI\u2019m someone who is very happy with Donald Trump\u2019s brilliant ideas and was glad to see him elected president,\u201d said Mukhtar Tompo, an Indonesian legislator who has called for Freeport to be expelled from Indonesia. \u201cAs long as Donald Trump looks at things from every perspective, he will agree with our side. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628303.7400496}
