With the presidential election looming, such discussions have reached a fever pitch, but what about our political experts? Surely they\u2019re not thinking of fleeing north, too? \\nEW sat down with Rachel Maddow a few weeks ago to pick her brain about the election and her broadcasting career, from hosting The Rachel Maddow Show (weekdays at 9 p.m. on MSNBC) to co-anchoring MSNBC\u2019s primetime political coverage with Brian Williams. We asked her the same question that\u2019s on a lot of liberals\u2019 minds: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, will she pack up and move to Canada? Not a chance. \\n\u201cFirst of all, my mother would kill me,\u201d Maddow says, laughing. \u201cMy mother escaped Newfoundland in order to come here. Seriously, there\u2019s nothing to make you appreciate the United States more than having an immigrant parent .\u201d \\nCanadian connections aside, Maddow says she\u2019s definitely staying, even if a Trump presidency could have radical effects on her chosen profession . \\n\u201cTrump says that once he\u2019s president, \u2018 Media\u2019s not going to get away with the stuff they get away with now. We\u2019re going to change those libel laws! \u2019\u201d Maddow says. \u201cHe blacklisted the freaking Washington Post from covering him. So who knows what it\u2019s going to be like with Trump as president? Who knows how he\u2019ll use his power to try and destroy the press? \u201d \\nStill, Maddow says she\u2019s not going anywhere. \\n\u201cIf he does what he\u2019s promising to do, I don\u2019t know if any of our jobs will exist any more,\u201d Maddow says. \u201cBut as long as someone will have me, I\u2019ll do this job.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562158.3906934}
