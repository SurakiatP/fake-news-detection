In the addition to the protests, the union is filing 33 legal complaints against Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s franchisees. The Labor Department, as Breitbart News has written, writes the workplace rules and regulations for most Americans. Under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, the Department of Labor effectively became the Department of Organized Labor. The Obama labor department was openly hostile to advocates of small government. In 2011  U. S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis insulted members of the Tea Party, referring to the activists as \u201cteabaggers,\u201d as Breitbart News reported. The SIEU\u2019s The Fight for 15 website has slammed Andy Puzder and President Trump by claiming: Trump wants to put Puzder in charge of enforcing these very laws that he broke as CEO. He opposes the minimum wage. He thinks workers are overprotected. He is against unions. He even said he wants to fire workers and replace them with machines that can\u2019t take vacations or sue their employers when they break the law. In fact, as a   CEO, he regularly broke the laws he\u2019d be responsible for enforcing if he gets the job. Puzder is the wrong choice for labor secretary. He is simply unfit to be put in charge protecting our nation\u2019s workers and we\u2019re calling on Members of the Senate to reject the nomination of Andy Puzder to lead the Department of Labor. Puzder\u2019s spokespeople have hit back, reports  Nation\u2019s Restaurant News: \u201cThis is more fake outrage from the unions and special interests which will stop at nothing in order to push their own   agenda,\u201d a Puzder spokesman said in an email. \u201cFact is, Andy is a job creator and has provided opportunity for advancement for thousands of employees. His record of creating jobs is exactly what this country needs. \u201d A CKE spokesperson emailed a response Thursday on behalf of the company. \u201cWhile we do not comment on pending litigation, we\u2019d like to offer a reminder that CKE Restaurants is nearly 95 percent franchised,\u201d the company said. \u201cEach of these 2, 769 franchise stores are run independently and solely responsible for their employees, management and adherence to regulations and labor practices. \u201d Joe Kefauver, managing partner of the Align Public Strategies   firm, told Nation\u2019s Restaurant News that the union\u2019s actions would \u201clikely make little difference in the outcome,\u201d and added: \u201cI doubt they expect to scuttle Puzder\u2019s confirmation, they are simply using the process to continue driving their message,\u201d Kefauver said in an email to Nation\u2019s Restaurant News. \u201cRepublican leadership in the Senate is wholly committed to confirming the president\u2019s nominees, and I think this nomination is no different. Barring something unforeseen, he will likely be confirmed. \u201d The SIEU will be slashing its budget by 30 percent this year as a result of having to \u201cdramatically  \u201d its strategy in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s landslide victory.   news site Raw Story has reported that the workers who were working for the SEIU\u2019s Fight for 15 campaign weren\u2019t making $15 per hour and weren\u2019t unionized. The hearing on Puzzler\u2019s nomination is now scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 7.
