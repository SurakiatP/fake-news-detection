He does not know how to post Facebook updates or messages on Twitter. He does not, he said, even use email. Yet Calipari, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at Kentucky includes four Final Fours, a national championship and a No. 2 seed in this year\u2019s N. C. A. A.   tournament, is the driving force behind several powerful media platforms  \u2014   including a Twitter account with more than a million followers, a website and a popular weekly podcast. Collectively, these serve as a permanent branding campaign, a public record of his thoughts and actions, and a   mechanism for one of the sports world\u2019s most   and polarizing personalities. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give out our message,\u201d Calipari said this month, \u201cbut they\u2019re also going to be able to see who I am, who my friends are, what I do, what I read  \u2014   and it\u2019s not filtered through anybody. \u201d Calipari has long sought to connect directly with fans and showcase his boisterous personality, said David R. Scott, the   of Calipari\u2019s 2009 book, \u201cBounce Back,\u201d and the founding editor of Calipari\u2019s website, CoachCal. com. In an earlier era, Scott said, those connections were forged in   interactions he recalled that Calipari, while coaching at the University of Massachusetts, delivered pizza to students waiting in line before games. New technology has allowed Calipari to do the same type of thing, only on a much grander scale. \u201cHis major was marketing,\u201d said Scott, now a senior director in communications at ESPN, \u201cand he\u2019s used it every day of his life. \u201d The internet and social media have eliminated the costs of printing and distribution, making anyone a potential publisher. From political campaigns to corporations to celebrities, organizations or individuals that in the past depended on traditional media outlets for their messaging now communicate directly with voters, consumers and fans. This autonomy is especially crucial for Calipari, who stands atop perhaps the most   college sports program this side of Alabama football who seeks a prominent public profile, at least partly to aid the   endeavor of recruiting and who in the past, he acknowledges, has been fitted with the \u201cblack hat. \u201d Notoriety and negative coverage have long trailed Calipari, a Hall of Fame coach known for his brash personality and disruptive methods, along with his teams\u2019 consistent success. The N. C. A. A. vacated his Final Four runs with two previous teams, UMass and Memphis, and it takes only a few keystrokes to find someone criticizing his embrace of the   \u201c  \u201d strategy  \u2014   recruiting talented prospects who expressly aspire to enter the N. B. A. after a single season in college. While in the past, Calipari said, he could not effectively combat reports or columns that cast him or his team in a bad light, that is no longer true. \u201cIn the old days, you had to wait,\u201d said Calipari, describing how he would respond to slights or what he viewed as misinformation earlier in his career. \u201cYou can get on a day later on the radio, but it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s already singed in their mind. \u201d Today  \u2014   with the aid of   staff members in Kentucky\u2019s sports information and image operations, who transcribe and publish the thoughts and musings of the   coach  \u2014   things are different. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI can respond in 30 seconds. \u201d Calipari does not eschew traditional media availabilities, and even cooperated on a forthcoming ESPN documentary about his career. But his own megaphone is a big one. Calipari\u2019s Twitter account has three times as many followers as the main one for Kentucky\u2019s basketball program. More than 500, 000 people follow his Facebook feed, and a   track his posts on Instagram. Then there is CoachCal. com. It is not  \u2014   like some other coach websites  \u2014   a sleepy venue for occasional videos and links to articles posted elsewhere. Instead, it is an     source for news, with its own de facto beat writer, Metz Camfield, and a certain, if limited, amount of exclusive access. (While the site is branded with Calipari\u2019s image, it is owned by JMI Sports, Kentucky\u2019s multimedia rights holder.) The site also has a personal blog with Calipari\u2019s reflections on his team\u2019s progress, celebrations of mentors and, of course, rebuttals to criticism. The newest addition to Calipari Inc. is Cal Cast  \u2014   Calipari\u2019s podcast, a breakout by a major active coach. After only three months and 15 episodes, it has more than a million listens. Calipari has hosted fellow coaches, businessmen, basketball commentators and his good friend Drake. (His dream guest is another clamorous, technologically challenged   media machine according to Calipari, President Trump told a journalist whom Calipari declined to identify that he was open to appearing on the program.) All of these endeavors push a daily dose of the gospel according to Calipari. Wondering whether he truly cares about his players? A recent Instagram photograph showed the stat sheet that Calipari said he receives daily, detailing how his alumni are faring in the N. B. A. Want to know his philosophy? A \u201cRecruiting Manifesto\u201d emphasized Calipari\u2019s \u201c \u201d approach (foreshadowing \u201cPlayers First,\u201d one of two books Calipari has written with the writer Michael Sokolove in the last three years). Skeptical that he is following N. C. A. A. rules? A     rundown last year reminded readers that Calipari\u2019s squads have among the highest graduation success rates of top teams. A case study in how Calipari can bypass the traditional news media came amid the firestorm that erupted after a 2014 Yahoo report that Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski had used his perch as U. S. A. Basketball\u2019s head coach to recruit high school prospects. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, then a Team U. S. A. assistant, said in response that Calipari had complained about the arrangement and added that Calipari\u2019s protests seemed disingenuous since he had coached the Dominican Republic\u2019s team  \u2014   a job that might have helped secure the commitment of the star prospect   Towns. One day after Boeheim\u2019s comments ran on Syracuse. com, Calipari, after appearing to respond via a snarky Twitter post, took to CoachCal. com to tell the world that he had called Boeheim (\u201cWe are friends\u201d) to praise Krzyzewski\u2019s stewardship of U. S. A. Basketball and to say he did not \u201cbegrudge\u201d any potential recruiting advantage. Years later, Krzyzewski appeared as the guest on Cal Cast\u2019s second episode. Calipari gushed about Krzyzewski\u2019s triumphs with the national team, and the coaches bonded over their   boyhoods and their affinity for legendary coaches. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be stunned,\u201d Calipari said, \u201cthat we just talked for 30 minutes. \u201d Was it benign sincerity? Did Calipari have ulterior motives for staying on the good sides of U. S. A. Basketball and Krzyzewski? Either or both might be true  \u2014   this month, U. S. A. Basketball announced that Calipari would coach the    national team. But Calipari\u2019s public stance was probably delivered more cleanly and persuasively than it would have been even through a   with a friendly reporter. \u201cIt enables him to put his version of the story out exactly the way he wants to, as sanitized or unfiltered as he cares to,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia Journalism School professor. Calipari\u2019s credibility is buttressed by all the things he publishes that have no obvious utility, whether it is a tribute to his family\u2019s late German shepherd or CoachCal. com\u2019s stream of updates on the team, written mostly by Camfield, a former Kentucky journalism major. Even the sponsor announcements Calipari reads during Cal Cast are disarmingly genuine, most of all the Blue Apron spots in which Calipari\u2019s wife, Ellen, describes some delicious meal she has just cooked for her husband. Jerry Tipton, the longtime Lexington   basketball beat reporter, said that Calipari\u2019s platforms had an unavoidable bias. \u201cCal talks about \u2018no filters,\u2019 which is fine,\u201d Tipton said, \u201cexcept it has the biggest filter of all: Coach Cal. \u201d But Calipari disputed this characterization. \u201cIt isn\u2019t filter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s transparent. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not perfect, I\u2019m a sinner  \u2014   that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got my ash on my head,\u201d Calipari said. But, he continued, \u201cthere were so many coaches in the old days that were painted with black hats, and there were guys painted with white hats that should have had black hats on. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not trying to write my legacy  \u2014   someone else will write my legacy,\u201d he added. \u201cBut what I am is, I\u2019m transparent, and you are not writing my legacy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564303.045781}
