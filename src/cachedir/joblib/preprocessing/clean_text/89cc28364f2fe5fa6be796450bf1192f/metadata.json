Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded \u2013 and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. \\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. \\nHowever, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it\u2019s not only her presidential campaign that\u2019s in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she\u2019s convicted of \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d \u2013 a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves \\nAs of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase \u201cobstruction of justice,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean the idea isn\u2019t floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: \\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \\nWe already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and \u201cbleachbit\u201d her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn\u2019t have the emails they were looking for. \\nOf course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn \u2013 and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary\u2019s case. Things aren\u2019t looking so good for Hillary Clinton \\nWhy did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple \u2013 redemption. \\nAccording to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: \\n\u201cSome people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\u201d said the source. \u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.\u201d \\nFurther speculation pertaining to Comey\u2019s reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. \\nThe fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey\u2019s dismissal of Hillary\u2019s charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars \u2013 a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.'"}, "time": 1742561698.4867966}
