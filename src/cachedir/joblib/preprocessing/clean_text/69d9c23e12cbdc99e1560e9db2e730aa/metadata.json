They will bring their message to the south steps of the Capitol building. [Governor Greg Abbott and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, the state\u2019s top school choice proponents, will speak at today\u2019s rally. The event begins at 10 a. m. with a march on south lawn at the Capitol followed by the annual rally with more than 20 other Texas elected officials.  Abbott proclaimed January 22 through January 28, school choice week in Texas, reaffirming his commitment to \u201csupport families\u2019 ability to choose the educational environment that best suits their children\u2019s needs. \u201d In 2015, he underscored the relevance of a parent\u2019s role in a child\u2019s education. Last year, he signed a school choice week proclamation highlighting the importance \u201cfor parents in Texas to explore and identify the best education options available to their sons and daughters, as research demonstrates that providing children with multiple education options improves academic performance. \u201d Organizer Randan Steinhauser called this year\u2019s rally a \u201creminder to our legislators that parents in Texas want more education freedom. \u201d She said: \u201cThe demand for more school choice is widespread and it\u2019s time for Texas to join the growing number of states that allow parents the opportunity to choose their child\u2019s education. \u201d While Texas already offers school choice options like magnet and public charter schools, plus private and home schools, lawmakers hope to expand access for the state\u2019s   children through legislation that would create an education savings account (ESA) program. In 2016, the Lt. Governor made the case for ESA\u2019s in a series of Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute (TCCRI) policy summits on education choice held around the state. It featured  panels of state legislators who support this kind of school choice plus Steinhauser and others who promoted ESA\u2019s allow parents to have more choice in their children\u2019s education, particularly for children stuck in a failing public school. Roughly 5. 3 million children attend   through grade 12 in one of the state\u2019s   public schools. The   Public Education Grant (PEG) program listed 1, 379 struggling campuses, inching down from the even higher 1, 532 failing schools on the   PEG list. According to the Texas Charter Schools Association, 129, 589 students were on charter school wait lists in 2014. Proponents say school choice affords children access to educational settings that best fit them while empowering their parents to become more involved in the education process. U. S. Senator Ted Cruz called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issue of the 21st Century\u201d in 2014. He supports universal ESA\u2019s. In September, Daniel Garza, president of the nonprofit Libre Initiative, spoke at a   TCCRI summit in support of ESA\u2019s and other similar tax credit scholarships and savings grant programs. He said they provided more educational opportunities to Texas\u2019 Hispanic families. Garza cited the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) a Washington, D. C.   private school student voucher program for   children, which he maintained had a 91 percent graduation rate, 30 percent higher than their public school peers. At press time, ESA legislation was not filed yet but the issue already stirred up strong opposition from the state\u2019s teacher unions and associations. They assert school choice undermines traditional public schools by diverting public taxpayer dollars away from their coffers, are not held to the same accountability standards, and are not unionized. Lobbyist organizations like the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB) vow to stop vouchers. The Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA) stand against school choice programs.   also balked at the state\u2019s new public school   accountability ratings system. Advocacy groups like Texas Kids Can\u2019t Wait only support public schools Raise Your Hand Texas also opposes school choice. Some homeschool parents also have expressed wariness of ESA\u2019s fearing that privately funded school choice will have \u201cstrings attached\u201d and bring government intervention and regulation that will impact the state\u2019s   for homeschooling liberties. As one parent told Breitbart Texas, \u201cI love the idea of ESA\u2019s, I just want to make sure we don\u2019t lose freedoms we now enjoy (because of them). \u201d Event organizers include Texas for Education Opportunity, LIBRE Initiative, the Texas Private Schools Association, Texas Homeschool Coalition, Texas Charter Schools Association, Texas Public Policy Foundation, Texas Catholic Conference, ResponsiveEd, Families Empowered, Public School Options, Aspire Texas, EdChoice, Texans for Education Opportunity, Americans for Prosperity  \u2014   Texas, The Justice Foundation, Agudath Israel, Texas Business Leadership Council, Texas Association of Business, Connections Academy, Institute for Justice, and the Texas Conservative Coalition.
