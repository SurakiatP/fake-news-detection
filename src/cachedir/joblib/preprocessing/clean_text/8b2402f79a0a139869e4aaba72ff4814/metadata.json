Whether a child is crying over the death of a pet or the popping of a balloon, our instinct is to make it better, fast. That\u2019s where too many parents get it wrong, says the psychologist Susan David, author of the book \u201cEmotional Agility. \u201d Helping a child feel happy again may offer immediate relief for parent and child, but it doesn\u2019t help a child in the long term. \u201cHow children navigate their emotional world is critical to lifelong success,\u201d she said. Research shows that when teachers help preschoolers learn to manage their feelings in the classroom, those children become better problem solvers when faced with an emotional situation, and are better able to engage in learning tasks. In teenagers, \u201cemotional intelligence,\u201d or the ability to recognize and manage emotions, is associated with an increased ability to cope with stressful situations and greater  . Some research suggests that a lack of emotional intelligence can be used to predict symptoms of depression and anxiety. Emotional skills, said Dr. David, are the bedrock of qualities like grit and resilience. But instead of allowing a child to fully experience a negative emotion, parents often respond with what Dr. David describes as emotional helicoptering. \u201cWe step into the child\u2019s emotional space,\u201d she said, with our platitudes, advice and ideas. Many common parental strategies, like minimizing either the emotion or the underlying problem or rushing to the rescue, fail to help a child learn how to help herself. Dr. David offers four practical steps for helping a child go through, rather than around, a negative emotion and emerge ready to keep going  \u2014   feel it, show it, label it, watch it go. Feel It. While it may seem obvious to feel emotions, many families focus on pushing away negative emotions. \u201cWhen we\u2019re saying \u2018don\u2019t be sad, don\u2019t be angry, don\u2019t be jealous, don\u2019t be selfish,\u2019 we\u2019re not coming to the child in the reality of her emotion,\u201d she said. \u201cValidate and see your child as a sentient person who has her own emotional world. \u201d  Show It. Similarly, many families have what Dr. David calls \u201cdisplay rules\u201d around emotions  \u2014   there are those it is acceptable to show, and those that must be hidden. \u201cWe see expressions like \u2018boys don\u2019t cry\u2019 and \u2018we don\u2019t do anger here,\u2019 or \u2018brush it off,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe do it with very good intentions, but we are teaching that emotions are to be feared. \u201d Label It. Labeling emotions, Dr. David said, is a critical skill set for children. \u201cWe need to learn to recognize stress versus anger or disappointment,\u201d she said. Even very young children can consider whether they\u2019re mad or sad, or angry or anxious or scared. \u201cLabeling emotions is also at the core of our ability to empathize. Ask \u2018How do you think    is feeling? What does their face tell you? \u2019\u201d As children get older, she adds, we can talk more about emotional complexities. \u201cWe can be simultaneously excited and anxious and frustrated, and we also need to learn to recognize that in other people,\u201d she said. Watch It Go.  Even the hardest emotions don\u2019t last forever. Dr. David suggests helping your child to notice that. \u201cSadness, anger, frustration  \u2014   these things have value, but they also pass. They\u2019re transient, and we are bigger than they are. Say, \u2018This is what sadness feels like. This is what it feels like after it passes. This is what I did that helped it pass. \u2019\u201d We can also help children to remember that we don\u2019t necessarily feel the same emotion every time we have a similar experience. The high dive is scariest the first time. We might feel a lot of anxiety at one party, or in one science class, but have a different experience the next time. \u201cWe\u2019re very good, as humans, at creating these stories around emotions,\u201d Dr. David said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not good at making friends. I can\u2019t do math.\u2019 Those are feelings and fears, not fixed states. People and things change. \u201d Finally, she said, help your child plan for experiencing the emotion again. \u201cAsk, \u2018Who do you want to be in this situation? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to you about this?\u201d Children feel stronger as they begin to learn that it\u2019s not how they feel, but how they respond to the feeling, that counts.'"}, "time": 1742563635.1504471}
