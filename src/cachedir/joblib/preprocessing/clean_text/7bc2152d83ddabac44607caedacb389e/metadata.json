Former Miss Finland accuses Trump of sexual assault, bringing number of accusers to 12 By 0 58 \\nMiss Finland 2006 has become the 12th woman to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen claims the presidential candidate groped her while they took a picture together before an appearance on \u2018The Late Show with David Letterman\u2019 10 years ago. \\nLaaksonen, now 30, told Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat on Thursday that Trump groped her in New York in July 2006. A translation provided by the Daily Beast explains that the incident occurred when she and three other Miss Universe contestants were taking photos outside the Late Show studio. \\n\u201c Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt, \u201d she said. \u201c I don\u2019t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, \u2018What is happening?\u2019 \u201d \\nThe beauty queen also attended parties at Trump\u2019s residence with Melania, whom he had married one year prior to the incident. \\n\u201c Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger ,\u201d she told The Telegraph. \\nTrump has vowed to sue all of his accusers, calling them \u201c horrible, horrible liars .\u201d However, he may have a difficult time taking Laaksonen to court, as she currently lives in Finland where she runs Ninnin Lifestyle and Living, a beauty and cosmetic company. \\nVia RT .
