Today I have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged. \\nPeople in the FBI think Hillary Clinton is the Anti-Christ . They are close. She is the Whore of Babylon. \\nHillary was born in 1948, supposedly. I looked for this information on a hunch, after noticing several clues. And sure enough, back in 2008, someone on David Icke\u2019s forum speculated that Hillary may have been the \u201cMoonchild\u201d that, according to artist Marjorie Cameron , was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist, occultist, and Crowley associate Jack Parsons during a ritual called the \u201c Babalon Working .\u201d The purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what Crowley called \u201c Babalon ,\u201d the Scarlet Whore with the cup of blood foretold in St. John\u2019s Revelation that rides the Beast. \\nCameron actually claimed that this fetus, after being taken from her womb, was delivered to people involved in the military\u2019s nuclear weapons progranm, who were apparently in cahoots with Parsons, and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested. But the fetus \u201csurvived,\u201d she said, because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose. For the 1945 \u201cTrinity\u201d bomb test they made a special canister called \u201cJumbo\u201d that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off. They reportedly didn\u2019t end up using it for that, but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the Moonchild. Presumably, it grew up to be somebody. \\nCrowley named one of his female consorts (who he always called his \u201cScarlet Women\u201d) \u201cHilarion.\u201d Her name was Jeanne Foster. Crowley\u2019s attempt to conceive an heir as a \u201cmagical child\u201d with Hilarion resulted, supposedly, in the child\u2019s spirit being attached to his protege Charles Stanfield Jones back in 1909. The \u201cattachment\u201d allegedly occurred when Jones went through the ritual for \u201cCrossing the Abyss\u201d in the 11th degree of the O.T.O., which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group. \\nJack Parsons, another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual, channeled The Book of the Antichrist in 1949, where he foretold: \\nAnd within seven years of this time, BABALON, THE SCARLET WOMAN HILARION will manifest among ye, and bring this my work to its fruition. \\nI also believe that Hillary, with her notorious cracking voice, and possibly her rival Trump, were foretold in another document channeled by Parsons, the Book of Babalon : \\nHer voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong, Though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long The gates shall fall and the irons break in the Birth of BABALON. \\nIn Rome the Hilaria was a festival to the goddess Cybele (worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone) to celebrate the \u201cresurrection\u201d of her son, who, as the legend states, she had been having sex with. She then became jealous of his love of others, castrated him, and let him die of bleeding (the reason why all of her priests, the Galli, were castrated, and actually considered women). She later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life, then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously, as commemorated in this festival. Consider this next time you notice Hillary Clinton laughing \u201cinappropriately.\u201d \\nAlso note that Hillary Clinton has made several self-depricating jokes about herself being \u201c not even human \u201d and \u201cshort-circuiting\u201d when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies. Specifically, in October 2015, when her interviewer at Buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating, even though it was a hot day (odd, because Hillary has notoriously bad B.O.), she asked Hillary what kind of deodorant she used. Clinton\u2019s reply was astounding. \\nYou guys are the first to realize that I\u2019m really not even a human being. I was constructed in a garage in Palo Alto a very long time ago\u2026 I mean, a man whose name shall remain nameless created me in his garage. \\nPalo Alto is the location of Stanford University, Jack Parsons\u2019 Alma Mater.'"}, "time": 1742628382.1037953}
