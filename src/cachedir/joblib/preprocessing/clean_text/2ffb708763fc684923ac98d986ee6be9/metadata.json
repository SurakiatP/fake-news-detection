In the 1960s, though, scientists and engineers at the University of California, Davis, developed an oblong tomato that lent itself to being   and an efficient mechanical harvester to do the job in one pass through a field. The battle to save jobs was on. How could a publicly funded university invest in research that cut farmworker jobs only to help   growers? That was the question raised in a lawsuit filed by a farmworker advocacy group against U. C. Davis in 1979. C\u00e9sar Chavez\u2019s United Farm Workers union made stopping mechanization its No. 1 legislative priority. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s agriculture secretary, Robert Bergland, declared that the federal government would no longer finance research that could lead to the \u201creplacing of an adequate and willing work force with machines. \u201d These days, the battle to save American jobs has a different flavor. It echoes in Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise \u201cto win the global competition for manufacturing jobs and production. \u201d It lives in Donald Trump\u2019s call to break Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against Chinese imports, and in Bernie Sanders\u2019s rallying cry against trade agreements. Its outcome, however, will probably be similar. The freeze on research may have slowed the mechanization of California\u2019s harvests, but by the year 2000, only 5, 000 harvest workers were employed in California to pick and sort what was by then a    crop of tomatoes. In America\u2019s factories, jobs are inevitably disappearing, too. But despite the political rhetoric, the problem is not mainly globalization. Manufacturing jobs are on the decline in factories around the world. \u201cThe observation is uncontroversial,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, the   economist at Columbia University. \u201cGlobal employment in manufacturing is going down because productivity increases are exceeding increases in demand for manufactured products by a significant amount. \u201d The consequences of this dynamic are often misunderstood, not least by politicians offering slogans to fix them. No matter how high the tariffs Mr. Trump wants to raise to encircle the American economy, he will not be able to produce a manufacturing renaissance at home. Neither would changing tax rules to limit corporate flight from the United States, as Mrs. Clinton proposes. \u201cThe likelihood that we will get a manufacturing recovery is close to nil,\u201d Professor Stiglitz said. \u201cWe are more likely to have a smaller share of a shrinking pie. \u201d Look at it this way: Over the course of the 20th century, farm employment in the United States dropped to 2 percent of the work force from 41 percent, even as output soared. Since 1950, manufacturing\u2019s share has shrunk to 8. 5 percent of nonfarm jobs, from 24 percent. It still has a ways to go. The shrinking of manufacturing employment is global. In other words, strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country will amount to destroying them in another, in a worldwide   game. The loss of such jobs has created plenty of problems in the United States. For the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world, though, it adds up to a potential disaster. Japan\u2019s long stagnation can be read as a consequence of a   development strategy that left the nation overly dependent on manufacturing. \u201cThey are focused on a   business,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, an expert on investment strategy at Columbia Business School. \u201cThey are not eliminating hours of work in manufacturing fast enough to keep pace with the reduction in work needed. \u201d The richest countries today started deindustrializing when they were already well off and benefited from fairly skilled and productive work forces that could make the transition into   service jobs, as increasingly affluent consumers devoted less of their incomes to physical goods and more to leisure, advanced health care and other services. Poorer countries have more limited options. If the demise of manufacturing jobs in the United States forced many workers into   retail jobs and the like, imagine the challenge in a country like India, where factory employment has already topped out, yet income per person is only one   of what it was in the United States at its peak. \u201cDeveloping countries are suffering premature deindustrialization,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, a leading expert on the international economy who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. \u201cBoth employment and output deindustrialization is setting in at much lower levels of income. \u201d This is even happening in a manufacturing behemoth like China  \u2014   which appears to have maxed out the industrial export strategy at a much lower income level than its successful Asian predecessors, like Japan and Taiwan. For poorer countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the decline of manufacturing as a bountiful source of jobs puts an end to the prime path to riches that the modern world has followed. Manufacturing, Professor Rodrik points out, has unique advantages. For one thing, it can quickly employ lots of unskilled workers. \u201cSetting up a factory to make toys puts you on a productivity escalator in a way that traditional agriculture and services didn\u2019t do,\u201d he said. Moreover, production isn\u2019t constrained by a small domestic market: Exports of goods can easily flow around the world, allowing industry room to grow and giving developing countries time to ride up the ladder of income, skills and sophistication. The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries don\u2019t have these features. They employ few workers and offer little added value. They do not encourage acquiring skills, and they expose countries to violent swings in commodity prices.   services such as finance and programming do pay well. But these aren\u2019t the service sectors most poor countries build. A majority of service jobs in most poor countries are generally limited to housework, mom and pop retail and the like. Since these sectors offer little productivity growth and are generally isolated from foreign competition, they cannot pull a nation out of poverty. The first large transition from agriculture to industry in the early 20th century  \u2014   well lubricated by public spending on world wars  \u2014   liberated workers from their chains far more effectively than Karl Marx\u2019s revolution ever did. The current transition, from manufacturing to services, is more problematic. In poor countries, Mr. Rodrik says, workers may have to pare back their aspirations of development. Who knows \u201chow will political systems manage?\u201d he asks. In the United States, the political challenge is no less daunting. Low pay married to high profits in much of the service economy are contributing to a widening income chasm that is rending society in all sorts of ways. Used to the prosperity once delivered by manufacturing, American workers are rebelling against the changing tide. Note to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump: A grab at the world\u2019s manufacturing jobs is the wrong answer. Walls will damage prosperity, not enhance it. Promises to recapture   greatness ring hollow. The United States, though, does have options: health care, education and clean energy, just to name a few. They present big economic and political challenges, of course  \u2014   not least the enormous inefficiency of private American medicine and Republicans\u2019 blanket opposition to more public spending. Yet just as the federal government once provided a critical push to move the economy from its agricultural past into its industrial future, so, too, could it help build a postindustrial tomorrow.'"}, "time": 1742564319.856463}
