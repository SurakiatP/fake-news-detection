So when Geisinger requested a rate increase of 40 percent for 2017, consumer advocates were amazed. And Kurt J. Wrobel, Geisinger\u2019s chief actuary, found himself, along with other members of his profession, in the middle of the health care wars still raging in this political year. Actuaries normally toil far from the limelight, anonymous technicians stereotyped as dull and boring. But as they crunch the numbers for their Affordable Care Act business, their calculations are feeding a roaring national debate over insurance premiums, widely used to gauge the success of President Obama\u2019s health care law. Health plans around the country have just filed proposed rates for 2017. State insurance commissioners are still reviewing them. But questions about the proposed increases are reverberating through the health care system and into the political campaign. \u201cHistorical experience is the lifeblood of what we do,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said, in an interview at Geisinger\u2019s headquarters here. \u201cWe take that experience, adjust it for the underlying growth of health costs and project it into the future so we can estimate the expected costs for a particular insurance policy. \u201d Such niceties may be lost in this scorching campaign season. \u201cThere is panic and anger as health care costs explode!\u201d Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote in a recent Twitter post, seizing on increases of nearly 60 percent sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. Obama administration officials are more sanguine. Consumers, they say, should not worry. Proposed rate increases are often reduced by state officials. Federal subsidies will generally rise along with premiums, offsetting much of the additional costs, and consumers can, in any event, switch to cheaper health plans next year. But as they prepare for the fourth year of coverage under the Affordable Care Act, many insurers are struggling to find the best ways of providing care to their new customers. The giant UnitedHealth Group, having lost money on individual policies under the federal health law, is pulling out of many insurance exchanges next year. A number of health insurance cooperatives created under the law have shut down. Geisinger is different. During debate on the 2010 health care law, Mr. Obama and members of Congress repeatedly hailed it as a model providing \u201c  care at costs well below average,\u201d in the president\u2019s words. Geisinger serves residents of rural central and northeast Pennsylvania, and its roots in the community are as deep as the coal mines that once flourished here. Dr. David T. Feinberg, the president and chief executive of the Geisinger Health System, said its health plan was losing $30 million a year on coverage sold on the federal exchange in Pennsylvania. But leaving the market here would be unthinkable. \u201cFor its shareholders, United made the right decision,\u201d Dr. Feinberg said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t answer to shareholders. We answer to the nice people of Danville, Shamokin and Bloomsburg. \u201d It would be difficult to find a health plan more aligned with the goals of the federal law. The Obama administration recruited a former chief executive of the Geisinger Health Plan, Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, to be the first director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, created by the health law to test ways to improve care and cut costs. Geisinger has been a pioneer in the use of electronic health records and genomic medicine, recruiting 100, 000 patients for DNA sequencing studies in the last two years. It has embraced \u201cpay for performance,\u201d offering a warranty for major surgical procedures and promising not to charge extra if complications occur. But innovation has been no match for the actuarial surprises dealt out by the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Wrobel said Geisinger had simply underestimated how much care its new customers would need. \u201cOur rates for Medicare, Medicaid and   insurance have been relatively stable, but those products have to bear the cost of our losses on exchange business,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said. Last October the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, headed by a former Obama administration official, approved a 20 percent increase in Geisinger\u2019s rates, about half of what the company had requested. \u201cBut based on experience,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said, \u201cthe 2016 premium rate is too low, so we want to correct it in 2017. \u201d Julia T. Philips, an   actuary who worked 19 years for the state of Minnesota, said insurance regulators generally do not let a company make up for past losses with future rate increases. \u201cBut regulators often allow companies to catch up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you assumed that claims would average $400 per member per month in 2015 and the actual cost was $440, you can use the higher number as a starting point in predicting claims costs for 2017. \u201d Obama administration officials suggest that insurance companies seeking big rate increases have been slow to adapt to the new law. But Geisinger executives welcome innovation, and they have celebrated the reduction in the number of uninsured under the Affordable Care Act. Geisinger is not alone. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department says insurers have proposed premium increases averaging 23. 6 percent for individual coverage for 2017. \u201cPeople with   conditions are now getting treatment,\u201d said Antoinette Kraus, the director of a statewide consumer group, the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, \u201cand it\u2019s more expensive because they were shut out of the market for many years. \u201d But, she added, \u201cwe expect that they\u2019ll eventually become healthier, so we won\u2019t see these huge rate increases every year. \u201d Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, acknowledged that \u201c  demand for health care is greater than people expected and is lasting longer than expected. \u201d In April, before most insurers had filed their rate requests for 2017, the Obama administration began a campaign to play down their significance. \u201cProposed rates aren\u2019t what consumers pay,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said. \u201cMost people receive tax credits and can buy a plan for less than $75 per month. \u201d Moreover, the administration says that the health law created a competitive market in which consumers can shop for the best deal. As evidence that this market is working, the administration boasts that more than 40 percent of returning consumers switched to different plans for 2016. However, Mr. Wrobel said, such turnover is making it more difficult for insurers to predict costs. \u201cThe whole point of what we do, the foundation of good health insurance,\u201d he said, \u201cis to develop   relationships with our members and to make   investments in their health. It\u2019s not like buying a book on Amazon. \u201d Besides, he said, substantial numbers of consumers do not receive subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 12 million people will receive subsidies, in the form of tax credits, next year. But it says that an equal number  \u2014   three million on the exchanges and nine million buying insurance outside the exchanges  \u2014   will have to pay the full unsubsidized price. \u201cWhen we developed rates for 2014,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said, \u201cwe had no historical data. It was basically an educated guess. \u201d Mr. Wrobel said rates were still being affected by a federal policy, adopted in late 2013, that allowed some people to keep and renew insurance that did not meet standards in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHealthier people chose to keep their plans,\u201d he said, \u201cso the collective cost of care for people buying insurance on the exchange was higher than expected. \u201d Many insurers hope to profit from the Affordable Care Act, but for Geisinger, the calculus is a little different. \u201cGeisinger has been here for 100 years, and we expect to be here another hundred,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said. \u201cWe are going to be taking care of the people in this community one way or another. So it\u2019s really important for this program to be financially stable and sustainable. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564437.7697055}
