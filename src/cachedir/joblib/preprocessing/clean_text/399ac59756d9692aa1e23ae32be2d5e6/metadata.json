[Describing the question of whether Poland should be forced to accept a quota of migrants from the third world as \u201cof vital importance\u201d for its future security, Andrzej Duda said the referendum could be held during parliamentary elections in 2019.  \u201cThat would allow the new government to hear the clear voice of the nation on the issue,\u201d said the president. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government\u2019s position on the quota system is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d Duda said. He said maintaining the party \u201cdoes not agree with the [plan] and asserted that \u201cPoland does not consent to the forced relocation of refugees on our territory\u201d. Holding a referendum will also enable the public\u2019s voice to be heard over the voices of international organisations, Duda asserted. \u201cIf Brussels continues to raise [the issue of migration] attempting to exert pressure and force on the Polish authorities, then public opinion will be extremely important,\u201d Duda promised. Poland\u2019s latest display of opposition to the redistribution plan comes as the Czech Republic announced its withdrawal from the scheme, which has been fiercely contested in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary and Slovakia challenging the plans in court. In an interview with Czech tabloid Blesk published Tuesday, EU president   Juncker demanded all nations in Europe shoulder \u201csolidarity and responsibility\u201d when it comes to migration. Brussels was left humiliated last year when Hungarians were asked what they thought of EU plans to force on their nation migrants from the third world, as 95 per cent said they rejected the scheme. Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported that senior Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki announced the \u201conly proven method\u201d to avoid Islamist terror attacks is not to import Muslim migrants. \u201cWhen it comes to reducing the chances of Poland being hit by [Islamist] terror attacks, the only proven method is to not allow in Muslim migrants,\u201d the MEP told local radio after the London Bridge terror attack, which killed eight and injured at least 48 others.'"}, "time": 1742561628.027347}
