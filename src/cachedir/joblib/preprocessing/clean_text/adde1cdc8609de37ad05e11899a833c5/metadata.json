Their identities have not yet been revealed by authorities.  Khan, who became London\u2019s first Muslim mayor last year and has become known for making bizarre remarks about terrorism, told Londoners that there was nothing to be alarmed about as the city ramps up its police presence in the wake of the attack. \u201cLondoners should be aware that there will be additional armed and unarmed police officers on our streets from tonight in order to keep Londoners, and all those visiting out city safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to reassure all Londoners, and all our visitors, not to be alarmed. Our city remains one of the safest in the world,\u201d he said. President Trump, who said earlier Sunday on Twitter that \u201cwe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people,\u201d attacked Khan for telling people not to be alarmed in the wake a major terror attack on the city, the third attack in the UK in just a few months. We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don\u2019t get smart it will only get worse,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017,  At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u201dno reason to be alarmed!\u201d  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017,  Khan also reportedly said that London is \u201cone of the safest global cities in the world if not the safest global cities in the world\u201d just hours after the attack. Khan has become   in America for his politically correct statements about terrorism. In September, Khan said terrorism is \u201cpart and parcel of living in a big city\u201d and in May last year called Trump\u2019s views on Muslims \u201cignorant. \u201d Trump\u2019s ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe. It risks alienating mainstream Muslims. London has proved him wrong,  \u2014   Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) May 10, 2016,  \u201cLondon has proved him wrong,\u201d he said.
