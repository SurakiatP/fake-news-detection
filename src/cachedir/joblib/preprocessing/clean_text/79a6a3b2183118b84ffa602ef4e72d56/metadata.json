Y.  \u2014   It was 6:30 a. m. at the United States Military Academy, the sun was rising over the Hudson River, and Paula Broadwell was in athletic gear. With a   women, she rotated between sprints and burpees. Sweating onto the pavement, the group was perched atop an overlook called Trophy Point, in the shadow of a   battle monument memorializing those killed in the Civil War. There is a female statue in bronze at the top, arms outstretched regally, who is said to represent \u201cfame. \u201d Ms. Broadwell was here in April for a 40th anniversary celebration for the academy\u2019s first class of women, who enrolled two decades before she would graduate near the top of her class, with multiple varsity letters. It was also the first time she had been back to campus since 2012, when she achieved her own kind of unwanted fame. Yes, this is that Paula Broadwell, the    of David H. Petraeus the West Point graduate and military intelligence officer who was revealed, through a   F. B. I. investigation, to have had a romantic relationship with Mr. Petraeus, a former C. I. A. director and the   general from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is also the Paula Broadwell who would be publicly portrayed as a \u201chomewrecker,\u201d a \u201cstalker,\u201d a \u201ctemptress,\u201d the woman who \u201cbrought down the director of the C. I. A. \u201d And, perhaps with the most frequency, as the \u201cmistress,\u201d a word for which there is no male equivalent. As far as infidelity scandals go, this one had everything. He, with a Ph. D. from Princeton, was the revered \u201cthinking man\u2019s general\u201d: honorable, visionary, charismatic, credited with turning around the failing war effort in Iraq and doing more     than anyone his colleagues knew. \u201cThere was talk,\u201d The Washington Post put it, \u201cthat, one day, King David would be president. \u201d (Through his lawyer, David Kendall, Mr. Petraeus declined to comment for this article.) She was the younger, equally ambitious overachiever:   triathlete two master\u2019s degrees deputy director of the center on counterterrorism at Tufts University a research associate at Harvard, where she had first met the general six years before. \u201cShe was a standout,\u201d said Sue Fulton, a former military captain and member of the first class of women at West Point, who later became a friend. There was hubris: the man tasked with guarding the nation\u2019s secrets revealing them a woman who had achieved incredible journalistic access committing the ultimate journalistic sin. Another friend of the general\u2019s, Jill Kelley, also became tangled up in the coverage after she reported to the F. B. I. that she was getting harassing emails. Investigators later learned they were sent by Ms. Broadwell under a pseudonym. (Ms. Broadwell, now 43, declined to comment on the emails, other than to say that she regretted sending them Ms. Kelley said the two have never spoken directly.) The downfall was swift: Mr. Petraeus, now 63, resigned, apologized to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material related to eight personal notebooks he\u2019d shared with Ms. Broadwell. For two months, he remained home in isolation  \u2014   reading, communicating with friends and pedaling on his exercise bike. \u201cOne foot in front of the other, one day at a time,\u201d Peter Mansoor, a military historian who was Mr. Petraeus\u2019s   man in Iraq, recalled Mr. Petraeus as saying. He was sentenced last April to two years\u2019 probation and a $100, 000 fine. Ms. Broadwell was never charged. Nearly four years later, Mr. Petraeus is now a partner in a New York private equity firm, and has advised the White House on the war against the Islamic State. He publishes   articles, speaks publicly and has affiliations with three universities, including Harvard. He was recently listed among five former military leaders suggested by a Washington Post columnist whom Republicans might have considered drafting for president. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprised to see him in some senior role in the next administration, Democratic or Republican,\u201d said Vernon Loeb, the managing editor at The Houston Chronicle, with whom Ms. Broadwell wrote her biography of Mr. Petraeus. Ms. Broadwell has struggled to find her footing. For weeks, reporters camped outside her home in Charlotte, N. C. where she was trying to restore her marriage. Friends sent over groceries and hot meals for her family  \u2014   her husband, Scott, and sons, 8 and 10  \u2014   and staged interference so Ms. Broadwell could cut across her neighbors\u2019 lawns, climbing over fences, to escape for a morning run. She lost her military security clearance her promotion from major to lieutenant colonel was revoked when the news broke. The F. B. I. still has her computers  \u2014   including her dissertation research  \u2014   and she withdrew from her Ph. D. program. She said she was told in more than one job interview that, while she was qualified, hiring her would be a   nightmare. Four years on, her name still pops up in the news with regularity. She tracks these references with precision. Every time there is a new development  \u2014   a legal update, Mr. Petraeus\u2019s sentencing, the recently   memoir by the woman on the receiving end of her emails  \u2014   she said she is reminded: that for him, the affair is a footnote to an otherwise celebrated career. But for her  \u2014   not as decorated, not as public, but still accomplished in her own right  \u2014   it has become a lasting stain. \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit I screwed up,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. \u201cReally badly, I know that. But how long does a person pay for their mistake?\u201d That seems to be the question of the moment, in an age when one mistake can permanently cement your reputation. But the shame of the mistress is a particular category. Donna Rice, Monica Lewinsky, Rielle Hunter   \u2026     the names have come to represent a kind of archetype. \u201cThat may be, in part, an unfair standard between men and women caught in an affair,\u201d said David Bradley, the chairman of Atlantic Media, who knew Mr. Petraeus and Ms. Broadwell and once sat down with Ms. Broadwell to offer professional advice. In the aftermath, he reached out to both by email to offer sympathy and support. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s equally the danger  \u2014   the   danger  \u2014   for the private citizen caught in an affair with a public figure. \u201d Ms. Broadwell was not exactly an entirely private figure before, of course it was just that what she was known for publicly was him. And so her fall seemed to elicit a particular brand of female schadenfreude: She seemed a little too eager, a little too ambitious, a little too   enjoying the attention just a little too much. Yes, she would challenge Jon Stewart to a   competition  \u2014   to raise money for wounded veterans  \u2014   and win. She could also run a   mile. \u201cMy immediate reaction was, \u2018Oh no, they\u2019re going to destroy her,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Fulton, who did not know Ms. Broadwell at the time but reached out after the affair became public to offer her support. To journalists, she was the woman who  \u2014   without any journalistic experience  \u2014   had persuaded the highest commander in the land to give her unusual access and then abused it. (When the book came out, and she appeared on \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d Mr. Stewart joked that \u201cthe real controversy here is, is he awesome or incredibly awesome? \u201d) To military colleagues, she was guilty of \u201cHollywooding\u201d: commanding the attention to herself in a culture that is all about the team. And then there was the infidelity, a crime for active duty officers for a reason. \u201cService members are required to deploy for months and months at a time  \u2014   so you have to be able to trust your spouse,\u201d Ms. Fulton said. It happens, of course, so often that there\u2019s a name for it (\u201ca zipper malfunction\u201d). And yet \u201cto violate that trust is viewed as particularly egregious. \u201d And so the public inquisition into the \u201cmistress\u201d began, with everything from her fitness acumen  \u2014   could she really run a   mile?  \u2014   to her body fat (13 percent) to her \u201cusually tight shirts and pants\u201d scrutinized. She was called, by a senior military source, \u201ca shameless   prom queen\u201d who \u201cgot her claws\u201d into him. She was \u201ccurvaceous,\u201d with \u201cexpressive green eyes. \u201d One general described her as \u201cseemingly immune to the notion of modesty,\u201d referring to the attire she was said to have worn in Afghanistan. Mr. Petraeus, meanwhile, was described by former aides as \u201cthe consummate gentleman and family man. \u201d He had \u201clet his guard down,\u201d The Washington Post said in a headline. Supporters said he\u2019d done the \u201chonorable\u201d thing by quitting. When he resigned, the president offered his prayers for the general and his wife the Petraeus family, friends lamented in the news media, would get through this. And then there was the  \u2014   in hindsight  \u2014   unfortunate title of Ms. Broadwell\u2019s book, \u201cAll In: The Education of General David Petraeus. \u201d There were porn parodies, and a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit in which a   book event is actually a live reading of a steamy sex scene. There were rape and death threats, one sent in a handwritten letter to her home. Her Facebook page still vacillates between, \u201cYou ruined America!\u201d and \u201cWill you go out on a date with me?\u201d \u201cI think the worst feeling is when you don\u2019t have control over your life,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. She was sitting on the couch in her living room in Charlotte while her children were at school. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this felt like. \u201d The first year was hell, she said. She and her husband, a radiologist with whom she is still together, went into counseling. She went into therapy. They explained to the children that \u201cMommy made a really big mistake. \u201d She had panic attacks, lost weight and retreated from public view, hiring a team to manage the legal threat against her. Would she be tried for conspiracy to commit espionage? For cyberstalking? For something else? She was often reading about her legal status in the news. Mr. Petraeus had many defenders  \u2014   and a   career of service to stand on. Ms. Broadwell did not. She said she never heard from her best friend  \u2014   a crime agent with the F. B. I. She asked another friend, a woman she had mentored, if she\u2019d be willing to speak up on her behalf, but this woman was applying for a job with the C. I. A. \u201cIt was too controversial to even touch certainly if you were active duty you would pay a price,\u201d Ms. Fulton said. There was the emotional toll of the abrupt severing of an intensely personal relationship. But there was also the professional one: her career tangled up with this man with whom she was once in love, her advocates, his allies. Mr. Petraeus had been helping her with her Ph. D. at King\u2019s College London, on military and organizational innovation. (His unit was one of the case studies.) They were working on another book together, this one focused on his leadership style, called \u201cRelentless. \u201d Before the fallout, the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina had sat her down in Mr. Burr\u2019s office to discuss a future congressional run, she said. Suddenly, overnight, she became  \u2014   in her word  \u2014   \u201cradioactive. \u201d (A spokeswoman for Senator Burr\u2019s office confirmed that the meeting took place, but said that he could not recall the precise nature of it.) \u201cShe has such confidence, such presence in the way she carries herself, and she commands this attention,\u201d said Rose Keravuori, a longtime friend and former West Point classmate. \u201cI think people expected her to go into politics, or do something different. And then this happened, and just, nobody helped her up. It was hard to reconcile so many people being sort of gleeful in it. \u201d In March, Ms. Kelley, the Florida woman caught up in the Petraeus soap opera,   a book in which she printed dozens of her email exchanges with the general, as well as emails sent by Ms. Broadwell. It is called \u201cCollateral Damage,\u201d and in it she describes her own struggle to restore a damaged reputation, which led her and her husband to sue the government for invading their privacy (the suit was dropped in March). The book landed Ms. Kelley on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d as well as a flurry of media attention, while Ms. Broadwell was on a camping trip with her family in the mountains. She had spotty cellphone service but drove back down to call her lawyers. A few days later, she was still nervously checking the Google alerts on her phone. \u201cYou know, Petraeus, when we were working together, he would never read anything about himself,\u201d she said, seated in the lobby of a Charlotte hotel. \u201cSometimes I wonder, am I doing myself mental harm by reading all of it. \u201d These days, her coping mechanism is to stay busy. She is on the board of multiple local leadership organizations, and she\u2019s a member of an opera club. She volunteers for a group that provides safe houses for human trafficking victims, another that helps veterans rehabilitate. She drops off her sons at the bus stop each day, then goes for a morning run. She continues to push for women in combat, and is active in a group called West Point Women, which planned the event at her alma mater. She is emotional when she speaks about the Charlotte community that embraced her family. But she\u2019s torn: Should she try to reclaim her past  \u2014   her dream of becoming a national security adviser  \u2014   or should she pursue something entirely different? Should she fight to restore her military status, or simply move on? \u201cThe truth is, the military is not a place where you can rehabilitate,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Zero Defects\u2019 policy  \u2014   that\u2019s military code. So the whole redemption thing? It\u2019s not common. \u201cMy husband says I just need to walk away,\u201d she continued. \u201cSue Fulton says I needs to fight back. My lawyers  \u2014   I literally ask them, \u2018What would you tell me to do if I were your daughter?\u2019 Some days I think, if I could just move on and it was never again in the news, I probably would. But I can\u2019t. My fabric is to fight back. \u201d With a friend, Kyleanne Hunter  \u2014   a former Marine attack helicopter pilot  \u2014   she has founded a nonprofit, Think Broader, focused on combating gender bias in the news media. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the sliver of bias that bothers her the most is \u201cmistress. \u201d She recently presented on the topic to a roomful of editors at The Huffington Post, as well as to a team at Yahoo and the United Nations. She is working with a professor at Harvard to try to come up with a system for tracking biased language, she said  \u2014   from unnecessary words (\u201cfemale fighter pilot\u201d) to journalists primarily relying on male sources to the subtle ways language can affect the way an article is framed. She has also, quietly, reached out to female journalists she thought would be sympathetic, asking them to stop using the word \u201cmistress\u201d: Christiane Amanpour at CNN Norah O\u2019Donnell at CBS Susan Glasser at Politico, who advised her staff to refrain from using the word. \u201cYou know that character on \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 Tyrion?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe says at one point, something to the effect of, \u2018You\u2019ve got to own your weakness, and then nobody can use it against you.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do that. \u201d Ms. Broadwell was pleased to discover last month, after conversations with The Associated Press, that it had addressed \u201cmistress\u201d in an updated style guide, advising \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201ccompanion\u201d or \u201clover\u201d in its place, or language that \u201creflects that it takes two to tango,\u201d said The A. P.\u2019s standards editor, Thomas Kent. After an article in The New York Times, about Mr. Petraeus\u2019s plea deal, used the word to refer to her last year, Ms. Broadwell was in touch with the public editor at the time, who wrote a column about it, advising that The Times \u201chasten the departure\u201d of the word. (It has appeared just several times in 2016.) Her hometown newspaper, The Charlotte Observer, said it would work to retire the term, opting instead to call Ms. Broadwell and Mr. Petraeus \u201clovers. \u201d \u201cIt takes two to have an affair,\u201d said the newspaper\u2019s editor, Rick Thames. The campaign can feel a little like putting out brush fires, Ms. Broadwell said, but for now, it\u2019s given her some sense of purpose. \u201cOn the one hand, I don\u2019t want to define myself by this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019ve been defined by this. So if I can change things for the better because of it, then why not?\u201d Of course, she added, \u201cMaybe some day I just need to take off the Google alerts and live in oblivion. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628496.343918}
