[\u201cThe Democrats have lost touch with reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just fake news. It\u2019s very fake news. The whole Russia story is a   the Democrats cannot cope with, and their facilitators in the mainstream media, simply, psychologically, cannot cope with the reality that the American people didn\u2019t choose Hillary Clinton. \u201d   Gorka said they were using this \u201c  of ties to Russia\u201d as a \u201ccoping mechanism. \u201d \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s the last administration that had the most disturbing ties to Russia  \u2014   that\u2019s what the newspapers should be reporting,\u201d he said. SiriusXM host Alex Marlow noted that Gorka produced an extensive body of work for Breitbart News that was very far from \u201c . \u201d He worried that fake news stories about Russia controlling the Trump administration could interfere with the war against global jihadism, in which Russia is clearly a significant player, no matter what one thinks of the Putin regime. \u201cI think that there are probably people, constituencies, forces that would like that to happen, but I can assure you, it will never happen,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cI have to go back to the man who is the   . There was, if you recall, I think it was his last press conference from Trump Tower when he turned the ground floor into a giant press conference facility. In the QA, they asked him bluntly, one of the reporters said, \u2018So what about your links to Vladimir Putin? What about relations in the future with Moscow?\u2019 And the president was unequivocal. He said, \u2018Look, I\u2019d like to be able to have good relations with Putin and the Kremlin. It doesn\u2019t really look very likely, and if that\u2019s the case, so be it. \u2019\u201d  \u201cWe are pragmatists. We\u2019re not ideologues,\u201d he declared. \u201cMy friend Monica Crowley said something very, very important: Our president must be understood as not an ideological candidate, our future president is an attitudinal one. That\u2019s the important thing to understand. That attitude is about making America great again. That\u2019s all we care about: national security and returning America to a place of leadership. The fake news will not be allowed to distort our understanding of the U. S. national interest and how we\u2019re going to realize that for all Americans, whatever newspapers they read, Alex. \u201d Marlow asked which top priorities the White House feels are not receiving the coverage they deserve because the media is so busy with fake news attacks. \u201cI think that the biggest ones remain the two versions of the Caliphate,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cI love to quote the line that Bibi Netanyahu used in front of Congress where he said, \u2018If you want to understand the Middle East, the chaos in the world today, it\u2019s basically a Game of Thrones for who\u2019s going to control and have the crown of the Caliphate. \u2019\u201d \u201cWe focus on ISIS. We will obliterate ISIS, as the president said in his joint address. But there\u2019s another version of the Caliphate, and that\u2019s the Iranian version that they\u2019ve been exporting, their theocratic version of the Caliphate that they\u2019ve been exporting since 1979. That\u2019s a very, very serious threat  \u2014   especially if you look at how the last administration empowered Iran through billions of dollars, through the JCPOA, the Iran deal, and the threat of a nuclear Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s a subtler one, and that\u2019s what has happened to the armed forces of America under the last eight years  \u2014   the underfunding, the being thinly stretched, the operational tempo especially of our Tier 1 units,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are going to rebuild the military because if you don\u2019t have strength, you can\u2019t have peace. \u201d Marlow asked about reports that Iran is preparing for a weapons \u201cshopping spree\u201d after existing U. N. resolutions expires. \u201cThis is just another example of the ticking deadlines expiring on certain limits to what Iran can do,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cHere we have not quite a sanction, but it is a moratorium that will expire and allow the mullahs to access the technologies that they haven\u2019t been able to do before. If you compare this to how they responded to the lifting of U. S. sanctions recently, or sanction measures  \u2014   unfortunately, these things are all done in the expectation that there will be better behavior afterwards from Tehran, and in every single case, we\u2019ve seen exactly the opposite. \u201d  \u201cWe release the billions. We pay the ransoms. The pallets of cash are shipped over to Iran. What happens? Our naval vessels are harassed. There\u2019s a ballistic missile test. Our friends are fired upon,\u201d he said.  \u201cSo again, the most important thing to understand here is not the idealistic attitudes of the multilateral institutions it\u2019s that there are nations out there  \u2014   Iran included  \u2014   that are fundamentally    powers, who do not share the same interests of America and her allies, who need to start toeing the line, and that\u2019s why they were put on notice. We need to see better behavior out of Tehran before any similar measures are implemented, either multilaterally or unilaterally,\u201d he declared. Marlow cited another recent report that suggested the Obama administration moved data from the investigation of alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russian government to a lower level of classification, to facilitate \u201ceasier sharing. \u201d He called this revelation \u201ctroubling and strange. \u201d \u201cWell, it looks quite transparent,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cJust a matter of days before the Trump administration took control, there was a decision made inside the White House that certain special types of intelligence, certain types of signals intelligence, certain types of intelligence related to Russia could be promulgated, could be shared across the whole intelligence community in ways that had never been possible before. The reasoning for that is very, very hard to determine, unless there was some kind of political motivation. \u201d \u201cWhy, days before we come into office, after dozens and dozens of fake news reports about potential connections to Russia, would we wish to downgrade this information and make it more shareable across the intelligence community  \u2014   unless you\u2019re hoping that somehow it will leak and be used for political purposes?\u201d he asked.  \u201cIf you want to have an investigation on Russia, don\u2019t look at AG Sessions look at the Obama administration\u2019s decisions to do things like this,\u201d he suggested, \u201cbecause it smacks of a very, very dangerous thing: the politicization of intelligence. \u201d Marlow applauded the Trump White House\u2019s firm stand with the United Nations, most recently with a   demand for the Human Rights Council to end its \u201cobsession with Israel. \u201d \u201cWe try to keep our promises,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll agree that the last six weeks have produced what in other administrations would have taken six months. \u201d He counted \u201cdealing with the attitude of multilateral organizations like the U. N. \u201d as one of those rapid accomplishments. \u201cWe want to cooperate if it\u2019s in the interests of the United States, but the constant bashing and the ideologically driven actions of individual states and states coming together in various committees of organizations like the United Nations to hammer again and again and again our closest ally in the Middle East is just unacceptable. It\u2019s simply unacceptable,\u201d Gorka stressed. \u201cWe have, as the president has said, an unbreakable bond with Israel, and the idea that they are in the crosshairs of the U. N. repeatedly, when around them you see true human rights abuses happening on a massive scale that the U. N. somehow forgets or doesn\u2019t see  \u2014   if you wish to see American leadership in the world again, assisting the United Nations to do the good that it was originally meant to do, then these kinds of, again, politically motivated attacks must decrease and hopefully stop,\u201d he insisted.
