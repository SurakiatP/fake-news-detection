Students\u2019 overwhelming belief that slavery began in the United States and was almost exclusively an American phenomenon, he said. \\n\u201cMost of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of America,\u201d Pesta told The College Fix . \u201cThey are convinced that slavery was an American problem that more or less ended with the Civil War, and they are very fuzzy about the history of slavery prior to the Colonial era. Their entire education about slavery was confined to America.\u201d \\nPesta , currently an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, has taught the gamut of Western literature\u2013from the Classics to the modern\u2013at seven different universities, ranging from large research institutions to small liberal arts colleges to branch campuses. He said he has given the quizzes to students at Purdue University, University of Tennessee Martin, Ursinus College, Oklahoma State University, and University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. \\n{snip} \\nBefore even distributing the syllabus for his courses, Pesta administered his short quizzes with basic questions about American history, economics and Western culture. For instance, the questions asked students to circle which of three historical figures was a president of the United States, or to name three slave-holding countries over the last 2,000 years, or define \u201ccapitalism\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d in one sentence each. \\nOften, more students connected Thomas Jefferson to slavery than could identify him as president, according to Pesta. On one quiz, 29 out of 32 students responding knew that Jefferson owned slaves, but only three out of the 32 correctly identified him as president. Interestingly, more students\u2013six of 32\u2013actually believed Ben Franklin had been president. \\n{snip} \\nWhat\u2019s more, he began to observe a shift in his students\u2019 quiz responses in the early 2000s. Before that time, Pesta described his students as \u201coften historically ignorant, but not politicized.\u201d Since the early 2000s, Pesta has found that \u201cmany students come to college preprogrammed in certain ways.\u201d \\n\u201cThey cannot tell you many historical facts or relate anything meaningful about historical biographies, but they are, however, stridently vocal about the corrupt nature of the Republic, about the wickedness of the founding fathers, and about the evils of free markets,\u201d Pesta said. \u201cMost alarmingly, they know nothing about the fraught history of Marxist ideology and communist governments over the last century, but often reductively define socialism as \u2018fairness.\u2019\u201d \\nPesta also noted that, early on, his students\u2019 \u201cblissful ignorance was accompanied by a basic humility about what they did not know.\u201d But over time he said he increasingly saw \u201ca sense of moral superiority in not knowing anything about our \u2018racist and sexist\u2019 history and our \u2018biased\u2019 institutions.\u201d \\n\u201cAs we now see on campus,\u201d Pesta said, \u201csocial justice warriors are arguing that even reading the great books of Western culture is at best a micro-aggression, and at worst an insidious form of cultural imperialism and indoctrination.\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742563727.5901473}
