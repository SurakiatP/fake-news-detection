National Cat Day, National Feral Cat Day, National Hairball Awareness Day, Happy Mew Year  \u2014   even the dog days of August are filled with feline jubilees. A celebration on Tuesday stands out from the pride, however, because it promises to deliver our cats what they most deserve, which is not a Meowjito. It\u2019s Respect Your Cat Day, an opportunity to pay homage to that mysterious silken life form beside you, which can hear the height of sounds and has beaten the evolutionary odds to occupy your lap. Sadly, as cat lovers we don\u2019t always fully grasp the formidable feline qualities we should be honoring. Respect Your Cat Day\u2019s literature (mostly a news release put out by the folks at a website called National Today, who claim the source of the holiday dates back to an 1384 edict by Richard II of England forbidding the consumption of cats) highlights some impressive statistics about our \u201cfeline besties,\u201d including the revelation from a survey that \u201c64 percent of Americans\u201d allegedly prefer their cat\u2019s company to their significant other\u2019s. (No comment, dear.) But when it comes to how, exactly, people go about respecting their cats, the survey\u2019s findings seem a little misguided, if not downright disrespectful: Give your cat verbal compliments? Please. Cats emphatically do not understand English and studiously disregard their owner\u2019s calls. With their supersensitive hearing, some may dislike the volume of the human voice, especially in confined quarters. When speaking in the feline presence, you might even consider consulting a decibel meter to ensure your   does not irritate their ears. If you flatter your cat, do so in a reverent whisper. Snuggle or hug your cat? Actually, cats may abhor the smell of our favorite perfumes and   soaps, and some are allergic to human dandruff. Furthermore, while most pet cats appreciate caresses, their territoriality means they sometimes prefer solitude to squeezes, and a few even have a condition called \u201cpetting intolerance\u201d  \u2014   a prime cause of    violence. Constantly invading a cat\u2019s personal space can also inflict something like psychological trauma, leading to chronic litter box accidents. Feed your cat treats? Thanks to precisely this sort of \u201crespect,\u201d veterinarians have devised feline obesity charts going all the way up to 70 percent body fat. Our cats\u2019 jiggling physiques insult their   status. Real respect requires something much more than babying it requires overhauling our whole perspective on cat kind. It\u2019s time to open our eyes  \u2014   like really, really wide, the way my sister\u2019s cat does when it spies the vacuum cleaner  \u2014   and see this animal for what it really is: not a helpless furball to be patronized and mollycoddled, but an entity both fearsome and sublime, commanding respect in the manner of a mafia don, or the ocean. For in truth, the humble house cat is one of the most stunning organisms on the planet. No creature is more exquisitely sensitive, and yet none is hardier. None beguiles us more but needs us less. There are more than 600 million domestic cats on the planet today, and we are   to explain why. Humans apparently never tried to cultivate them (their abilities as ratters are overhyped). Rather, cats took the reins in our relationship, undergoing a novel process of   tweaking their brain structures to better withstand the terrible stresses of human company and thereafter radiating out from the Middle East in determined furry battalions. In an era when lions, tigers and other types of felines flirt with extinction, house cats are themselves an intensifying menace to endangered species. Our living rooms are among their final conquests, as   cats are a phenomenon of mostly the last 70 years or so. It hasn\u2019t been an easy takeover. In fact, chaotic human homes, with their noises, stenches and overbearing occupants, may be the most radical and challenging environment that these little hunters, which flourish on deserted   islands and the slopes of active volcanoes, have yet faced. So on Tuesday  \u2014   and I know, it\u2019s hard  \u2014   resist the urge to simply cuddle your cat with reckless abandon. Instead, consider this creature at arm\u2019s length, study it. Skip the kitty   and wake up to your cat\u2019s magnificent natural history. Respect the fact that no animal has come further under its own power to meet us where we are. Meanwhile, there are also a few simple tributes that your cat might actually appreciate. For starters, as Ohio State University\u2019s Indoor Pet Initiative suggests, figure out your cat\u2019s personal \u201cprey preference\u201d and buy anatomically appropriate toys. Create a   household zone called a \u201crefuge,\u201d which is a bit like a panic room with   blankets. Avoid crowding too many cats into too few square feet (solitary by nature, cats don\u2019t always relish one another\u2019s companionship). And it never hurts to add an extra litter box, or three. Some feline preferences are harder to honor: Cats loathe thunderstorms, for instance, house guests and disruptive human holidays not dedicated to them. Fully respecting cats\u2019 aversion to human strangers could make it hard to, say, date or marry. But then again, why would you bother, since you\u2019ll just end up pining for your cat?'"}, "time": 1742628428.6213253}
