Without much credence or proof behind the claims, I initially dismissed them. The rumors only persisted and grew and now Steve Pieczenik has now come forward with stunning claims that add fuel to this fire. \\nPieczenik served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger is well-versed in foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare. He also served under presidential administrations as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush\u2019s White House. In other words Steve Pieczenik \u2014 with his proven history of experience \u2014 is the real deal. Pieczenik claims that the Clintons and their close associates have successfully pulled off a coup via corruption. \\nHe explains that total corruption and co-option were the two strategies behind this coup. Pieczenik says Bill and Hillary Clinton co-opted many central facets of our government \u2014 the White House, the judiciary, the CIA, the FBI. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this idea is well beyond some lunatic conspiracy theory but increasingly likely. \\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch is obviously in the pocket of the Clintons, intervening and obstructing FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private home server and e-mails at every turn. James Comey, who was on the board of directors at HSBC bank, a bank that gave $81 million to the Clinton Foundation, is also the current head of the FBI. Pieczenik goes further to explain that the U.S. Intelligence community has started a counter-coup against the Clintons, providing information to Julian Assange and Wikileaks. \\nWe can finally stop blaming Russians. Pieczenik states clearly that US intelligence offered data to Julian Assange. This counter-coup is working against Hillary Clinton and her campaign and seeks to indict major players in her alleged corrupt scheme. Steve Pieczenik ends the video and tells us \u201cthe second American revolution\u201d is happening. \\nPieczenik claims both Clintons are frequent travelers on the Lolita Express \u2014 billionaire Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private plane. The Lolita Express flies to Epstein\u2019s private island where the elite duo can \u2018have sex with minors\u2019 says Pieczenik. He claims the NYPD has a record of the Clintons and close associates that could potentially implicate them in pedophilia. \\nPieczenik tells that officials will charge Hillary Clinton with multiple crimes including obstruction of justice and other charges. He says that Bill Clinton may also suffer criminal charges. He explains the US Intelligence is aware of Clinton\u2019s shady and illicit misdeeds and that these trips on the Lolita Express were supposedly frequent. The following two tabs change content below.
