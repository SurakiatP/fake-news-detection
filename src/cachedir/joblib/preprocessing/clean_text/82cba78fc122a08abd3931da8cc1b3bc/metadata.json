But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material. \\nIn fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive e-mails that she may hold the secrets to E-mailgate \u2014 if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used. \\nClinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Santos. She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security. \\nClinton would first receive highly sensitive e-mails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home. \\nAmong other things, Clinton requested Santos print out drafts of her speeches, confidential memos and \u201ccall sheets\u201d \u2014 background information and talking points prepared for the secretary of state in advance of a phone call with a foreign head of state. \\n\u201cPls ask Marina to print for me in am,\u201d Clinton e-mailed top aide Huma Abedin regarding a redacted 2011 message marked sensitive but unclassified. \\nIn a classified 2012 e-mail dealing with the new president of Malawi, another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley, advised Clinton, \u201cWe can ask Marina to print this.\u201d \\n\u201cRevisions to the Iran points\u201d was the subject line of a classified April 2012 e-mail to Clinton from Hanley. In it, the text reads, \u201cMarina is trying to print for you.\u201d \\nBoth classified e-mails were marked \u201cconfidential,\u201d the tier below \u201csecret\u201d or \u201ctop secret.\u201d \\nSantos also had access to a highly secure room called an SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) that diplomatic security agents set up at Whitehaven, according to FBI notes from an interview with Abedin. \\nFrom within the SCIF, Santos \u2014 who had no clearance \u2014 \u201ccollected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton,\u201d the FBI notes revealed. \\nJust how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief \u2014 a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies \u2014 via the secure fax. \\nA 2012 \u201csensitive\u201d but unclassified e-mail from Hanley to Clinton refers to a fax the staff wanted Clinton \u201cto see before your Netanyahu mtg. Marina will grab for you.\u201d \\nYet it appears Clinton was never asked by the FBI in its yearlong investigation to turn over the iMac Santos used to receive the e-mails, or the printer she used to print out the documents, or the printouts themselves \\nAs The Post first reported, copies of Clinton\u2019s 33,000 allegedly destroyed e-mails still exist in other locations and could be recovered if investigators were turned loose to seize them. Higher-ups at the Justice Department reportedly have blocked them from obtaining search warrants to obtain the evidence. \\nIt also appears the FBI did not formally interview Santos as a key witness in its investigation. \\nThis is a major oversight: Santos may know the whereabouts of a missing Apple MacBook laptop and USB flash drive that contain all of Clinton\u2019s e-mails archived over her four years in office. \\nIn 2013, Hanley downloaded Clinton\u2019s e-mails from her private server to the MacBook and flash drive. \\n\u201cThe two copies of the Clinton e-mail archive (one on the archive laptop and one on the thumb drive) were intended to be stored in Clinton\u2019s Chappaqua and Whitehaven residences,\u201d the FBI said in its case summary. \\nBut Hanley says the devices were \u201clost,\u201d and the FBI says it \u201cdoes not have either item in its possession.\u201d \\nIn addition to Abedin, Santos worked closely with Hanley at Whitehaven and could shed light on the mystery \u2014 if only she were asked about it. \\nMy god. \\nAt this point, WHO hasn\u2019t seen our classified information? \\nPerhaps that would be a shorter, more manageable list.
