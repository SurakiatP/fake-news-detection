I\u2019m good. Really good. Ask anybody. I\u2019m as good as anyone can be. Just so good. \\nFirst of all, I need to inform you of a change in my address. You can deliver everything to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA, I\u2019ll pick everything up there in February, okay? \\nNow, for what I want\u2026 look, I\u2019m doing pretty okay at the minute, but there\u2019s a few things you could maybe get for my Dad? \\nHe needs the materials to build a wall that he kinda promised, but has no way of ever delivering. Concrete, rebar, that kind of thing. Enough to run about 1,000 miles, to about 40ft high or so. If you can send over some elves to help build it, that\u2019s cool too. \\nI\u2019ve heard my Dad say that he\u2019d also like a waterboard. I\u2019m not sure what it is. Some sort of surfboard thing? Anyways, he\u2019s big into bringing waterboarding back. So throw in one of those. \\nCould you also fix it for my half-sister Ivanka to not be related to our family anymore? I think Dad would really like that. \\nAlso, kill all Muslims. And a surprise. \\nSincerely,'"}, "time": 1742628526.1612768}
