As the top golfers on the L. P. G. A. Tour compete in their first major tournament of the year, they will be   to ignore the storm clouds gathering in advance of their third, the United States Women\u2019s Open, to be held in July at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Before Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, he was the Daddy Warbucks of women\u2019s golf, hosting the top players every year at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. during the L. P. G. A.\u2019s   ADT Championship at Trump International Golf Club. In 2006, the tournament\u2019s   prize was $1 million, a milestone that the men had reached seven years earlier. In his prepolitics life as a real estate mogul, Trump dispensed business advice to the L. P. G. A. players and invited them to his courses for informal rounds of golf. The women generally accepted his invitations for the same reason they play   events every year with dozens of other golfers, including those who harbor different political and personal beliefs: These people, usually men, sustain the Tour with their support. \u201cHaving played in the ADT Championship when it was held at his course in West Palm Beach, I have experienced nothing but good things from him and his golf course,\u201d said Karen Stupples, a reporter for the Golf Channel and NBC who competed in the event in 2004 and 2008. \u201cAnd I think the L. P. G. A. in general feels that same way, that he was very respectful to the L. P. G. A. to the tournament. \u201d The picture that L. P. G. A. golfers paint of Trump as a respectful supporter of women stands in stark contrast to the leering,   man caught conversing with Billy Bush during a taping of a 2005 segment for \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d in a video that surfaced shortly before the election. Since Trump became the putative leader of the free world, he has often been seen on the golf course, and for some of those outings, he has reached out to some of the best players in the game to accompany him. The top men and women have accepted invitations to play with him with their eyes wide open. They know that what they see as a social outing will be spun as a political statement  \u2014   and they seem largely not to care. In an anonymous survey I conducted in February of 56 players on the PGA Tour, 50 (or 89 percent) said they would play with Trump if extended an invitation. Three said they would not, and three declined to answer. How would the best women, whose ranks cut across more cultures than the men\u2019s, respond? At the Founders Cup in   the first L. P. G. A. event of the year held in the United States, I conducted an anonymous survey of 40 players.   (or 60 percent) said they would play with Trump, nine said they would not and seven declined to comment. A   joked, \u201cI want to stay in the country so I\u2019ll say yes. \u201d The women, who ranged in age from under 20 to over 50, represented 12 countries and make their homes in 11 states, including four that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in last year\u2019s presidential election. One player, Natalie Gulbis, spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Another, the Floridian Lexi Thompson, has played golf with Trump since the election. Ko, the women\u2019s No. 1 from New Zealand, has not played a round with Trump  \u2014   but only because she hasn\u2019t received an invitation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of one of the biggest countries in the whole entire world,\u201d Ko said, \u201cand it would be an honor if I got that call. \u201d Ryann O\u2019Toole, an American who was raised in California, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him and I\u2019ll still play with him. \u201d Ko is 19. Thompson is 22. O\u2019Toole is 30. Stupples is 43 and the mother of a    son. It is unfair, Stupples said, to expect a consensus on any political issue from a tour membership that includes women under 20 and over 40 and Americans and foreigners. \u201cLydia and Lexi have both led a very sheltered life,\u201d Stupples said. \u201cThey\u2019ve played golf and that\u2019s it. They probably haven\u2019t seen much of what goes on outside of the golf course and a hotel. \u201d She added: \u201cWould I play golf with him? Probably not. But then that\u2019s me. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve been around the block a few times and seen a few other things. But it\u2019s only because of my life experience that I feel like I can make a good judgment on what I want to do personally. \u201d The United States Golf Association awarded its flagship women\u2019s event to Trump\u2019s Bedminster course in 2012, when his reputation as an opportunistic outsider came from supporting golf when the economy was cratering and other benefactors were bailing. \u201cHe was such a huge fan of the L. P. G. A. and of golf in general,\u201d said Gulbis, who has known Trump since she qualified for her first ADT Championship in 2005. Throughout the years, she said, he has counseled her to fight for the same pay as PGA Tour members for public appearances or sponsorships. \u201cThese were constant conversations that I saw him have not just with me, but with lots of people in our organization,\u201d Gulbis said. The United States Women\u2019s Open will not be the first golf major played at a Trump course. The Women\u2019s British Open in 2015 was held at Turnberry, a Scottish resort that Trump bought in 2014, after the tournament had been awarded. In the past few years, some other top golf events have been given to   courses. This year\u2019s Senior P. G. A. Championship will be at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, and the 2022 P. G. A. Championship will be hosted by his Bedminster club. Shaunna Thomas, the   of UltraViolet, a national group assembled to fight sexism and expand women\u2019s rights, said her organization failed to see the upside of any professional women\u2019s sports league aligning itself with Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing golf all my life, I\u2019m very familiar with how deeply ingrained sexism is in the game,\u201d Thomas said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting. People who aren\u2019t fans think it\u2019s such an easy decision for the U. S. G. A. and the L. P. G. A. to make to avoid controversy. \u201d She added: \u201cThe question really is, do the U. S. G. A. and L. P. G. A. want to be on the right side of history? If the U. S. G. A. wants to stay relevant to a younger generation of golfers, they\u2019re going to have to take a look at their decision. This is an opportunity to send a clear signal to women, people of color and people with disabilities that they stand on the side of inclusiveness. \u201d UltraViolet staged a protest on the third day of the Founders Cup, calling for the Women\u2019s Open to be moved from Bedminster or, barring that, for the players to boycott the event. Roughly a dozen people gathered outside the public entrance to Wildfire Golf Club, the tournament site on a Marriott property in Phoenix, and handed out items including \u201cDump Trump\u201d golf balls before being escorted away by hotel security. The organization also commissioned a plane to fly over the tournament grounds with a banner that read: \u201cLPGA: Take a Mulligan. Dump Sexist Trump. \u201d On the eve of the protest, the L. P. G. A. one of the world\u2019s oldest women\u2019s professional sports organizations, released a statement that described its mission as creating opportunities \u201cfor the best female golfers in the world to showcase their talent\u201d and said, \u201cAs a global tour and membership, we try not to let politics get in the way\u201d of such opportunities. The organization added that the U. S. G. A. owns and operates the United States Women\u2019s Open and \u201cwe respect and support the decisions made by the U. S. G. A. on this matter. \u201d The statement did not sit well with Thomas, who grew up in Los Angeles and played golf with her father at Rolling Hills Country Club and Riviera Country Club. Many of the courses she frequented were about as integrated as Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has a smaller percentage of women and minorities than the first cabinets of his four immediate predecessors. \u201cThe ladies that play golf shouldn\u2019t be forced to build up the Trump brand in any way,\u201d she said. Judy Rankin, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, is discomfited by the notion that the players should allow politics to play through in the most prestigious women\u2019s tournament in the United States. \u201cBack in the dark ages, I did not agree with everything Gerald Ford did,\u201d said Rankin, whose most successful season, 1976, coincided with Ford\u2019s last full year as president. She won six tournaments that year and became the first L. P. G. A. player to surpass $100, 000 in yearly earnings. \u201cI found him to be the most wonderful man, and I certainly played golf with him,\u201d Rankin added. \u201cBecause you play golf with them does not necessarily mean you support every single thing they do. But they hold the highest office in the land. And I\u2019m not sure that an invitation to play golf should be answered with a political statement. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561706.0432243}
