She riffs about such subjects as how she came to grips with realizing her own beauty despite being called \u201cvery fat\u201d by Hollywood honchos, and how \u201cgun nuts\u201d constantly fight against stricter firearms laws. A week after its release, however, The Leather Special is a critical flop. As The Federalist noted, of the   member reviews of the special currently posted on Netflix. com, more than 700 users gave it just one star. Some have even given the special zero stars. \u201cAbsolutely horrible. Amy is 1 special away from being broke and homeless. Female comics are the best! Amy is not,\u201d one Netflix user wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve had migraines that were way funnier than this   performance. Very poor show,\u201d another wrote. Schumer\u2019s comedy special isn\u2019t faring much better on The Internet Movie Database (IMDB). There, The Leather Special is currently holding a 5. 5 out of 10 rating. \u201cI enjoyed her shows before, but Schumer was neither funny nor insightful in this special,\u201d one IMDB user wrote.  \u201cA huge swing and a miss. With the exception of the gun riff, she relied on old material focused mainly on her smelly body parts. Maybe that is why none of the big premier pay channels picked up this special. \u201d \u201cNetflix will have to do better in the future choosing streaming material,\u201d the user added. This was Schumer\u2019s first special since 2015\u2019s Live at the Apollo, which was nominated for two Emmy Awards.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742562344.981028}
