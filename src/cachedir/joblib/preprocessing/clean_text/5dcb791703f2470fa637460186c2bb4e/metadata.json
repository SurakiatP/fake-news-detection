The body of Mikhail Yuriyevich Lesin, a well-known Russian media mogul, was found in the luxury Dupont Circle Hotel on November 5, 2015. According to reports, his body bore considerable injuries on his torso and limbs. Some unconfirmed updates suggested that Lesin had died from several \u201cblunt force injuries to the head\u201d. But United States authorities refused to speculate on the cause of Lesin\u2019s death and opened an official investigation into the matter. \\nLesin became famous in Russia soon after the collapse of the communist system, when he founded Video International, an advertising and public-relations agency that was hired by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1995 to run his reelection campaign. Yeltsin\u2019s electoral success was partly attributed to the well-tailored media message projected by Lesin\u2019s company. The media magnate was rewarded by Yeltsin, who offered him influential government posts, including that of director of Russia\u2019s state-owned news agency Novosti. Meanwhile, Lesin became a media personality and frequently gave interviews espousing a free-enterprise model for the Russian media industry. But soon after Vladimir Putin\u2019s ascendance to the presidency, Lesin saw the writing on the wall and began advocating for increased government regulation of media and telecommunications conglomerates. In 1999, Putin made him Minister of Press, Broadcasting and Mass Communications, a post he held for nearly six years, until 2004. In 2006, Lesin was awarded the Order for Merit to the Fatherland, one of the most prestigious civilian decorations in Russia. \\nBut in late 2009, Putin abruptly fired Lesin from his post in the Kremlin\u2019s Media Advisory Commission, allegedly because the media mogul had developed close contacts with Russian organized crime. Lesin\u2019s ties with Putin\u2019s inner circle were further strained in 2014, when he resigned from his position as head of Gazprom Media, after he clashed with pro-Putin executives on the board. Last November, when Lesin\u2019s body was found in his hotel room by a member of the staff, some suggested that he may have been killed by the Kremlin. But On Friday, the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, DC, in cooperation with the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, said that Lesin\u2019s death had been the result of injuries \u201cinduced by falls\u201d, which came after \u201cdays of excessive consumption of alcohol\u201d. The two agencies said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had assisted in the investigation into Lesin\u2019s death, concurred with the results. Consequently, the investigation is now closed, they said. The Kremlin, the Russian embassy in Washington, and the FBI, have not commented on the case.
