Ms. Reynolds, 84, had suffered from several health problems in recent years, and doctors said any number of factors could have contributed to her death, possibly from a stroke. But by all accounts, she and her daughter were very close in recent years, and death from a broken heart is a   occurrence, both in medical literature and throughout the folklore of the earliest human communities. One form of the phenomenon is called Takotsubo syndrome, after the Japanese term for \u201coctopus trap,\u201d because the heart looks as if it is caught from below, its upper chambers ballooning as if trying to escape. The sudden loss of a child or spouse, perhaps foremost among life\u2019s cruelties, sets off \u201can overflow of stress hormones, and the heart can\u2019t take it,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women\u2019s heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. \u201cIt appears to be a massive heart attack,\u201d but, she said, \u201cthe heart is literally stunned. \u201d The octopus trap can grab any heart, healthy or not, young or old, and most people survive, doctors say. The sudden flood of stress hormones causes a temporary weakening of the heart muscle itself, unlike a classic heart attack, in which a clot blocks blood flow. \u201cI\u2019ve seen estimates that about 1 percent of perceived heart attacks\u201d are because of   syndrome, said Dr. Anne Curtis, chair of medicine at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, \u201cand that seems about right. I think every cardiologist has seen cases. We tell people that many will return to normal or   heart function. \u201d Ms. Reynolds\u2019s did not, though the timing of her death may have just coincided with her daughter\u2019s. In her 2013 memoir, Ms. Reynolds wrote about suffering a   and partial kidney failure. In 2015, she was awarded an honorary Oscar but was too sick to attend the ceremony. In interviews, Ms. Fisher had talked about how frail her mother was. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of times terrifying, but watching my mother, who\u2019s incredibly resilient, coping with certain health issues that she\u2019s had,\u201d she told National Public Radio this fall. In an interview with People magazine in May, she said her mother had had a \u201cspinal issue\u201d but had \u201crecovered amazingly. \u201d Ms. Fisher, 60, died on Tuesday after suffering a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles a few days earlier. On Wednesday, Ms. Reynolds was rushed to an emergency room amid reports that she had possibly had a stroke. Yet  \u2014   if indeed a stroke was the primary cause of death, as her son, Todd Fisher, has said  \u2014   a heart squeezed by the sudden loss of a beloved daughter could have contributed. The stunned organ, especially in a person who might have had any of the underlying cardiovascular infirmities of aging, could increase the likelihood of a clot forming and moving to the brain. In a 2005 paper in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reviewed cases of 18 women and one man who landed in coronary care units in Baltimore, between 1999 and 2003, with chest pains and no signs of classic heart attack on exam. Most were older, but one was 27 and another 32. The doctors, led by Dr. Ilan Wittstein, nicknamed the condition   syndrome and noted that it occurred not only after grief but after any sudden stress. All of the patients survived. \u201cWe had people who\u2019d been held up at gunpoint, who\u2019d been up in front of a group to speak, who were severely claustrophobic and in an M. R. I. scanner, who were angry and in heated arguments,\u201d Dr. Wittstein said in an interview. Dr. Wittstein said that at the time the paper appeared virtually the only mentions of the syndrome were in Japanese medical literature. Now, he said, thousands of cases have been reported, and about 90 percent of them are women in middle age or older. One possible reason, he said, is that estrogen protects the heart\u2019s smaller vessels  \u2014   those most affected by stress hormones  \u2014   and estrogen levels drop with age. There have been cases of   couples dying in close succession. The country stars Johnny and June Cash died within months of each other, after a long marriage. The former football star Doug Flutie\u2019s parents died on the same day, both of heart attacks. To some medical experts, what Ms. Reynolds experienced is one of the greatest traumas of all. \u201cNo one wants to change the order of nature, that is the first thing I thought when I heard,\u201d said Dr. Victor Fornari, a psychiatrist at Northwell Health on Long Island. \u201cA parent outliving a child  \u2014   it\u2019s one of the most unspeakable things there is. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563673.9525695}
