[Duterte, who has called the observance of human rights norms in the context of a war on terror \u201cbullshit,\u201d has launched a new initiative against Abu Sayyaf, a radical jihadist group primarily concentrated in Duterte\u2019s native southern Mindanao island. Abu Sayyaf has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.  Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Eduardo A\u00f1o announced Tuesday that the military had six months to eradicate the terrorist group completely. \u201cAs pronounced by our president, we have a very tall order to do. And we have six months to totally decimate the Abu Sayyaf group and the other terror groups here in Western Mindanao,\u201d A\u00f1o told reporters. Duterte himself said on Saturday that Abu Sayyaf terrorists should not assume that their lives will be spared if they use hostages as human shields. \u201cThey say, \u2018What about the hostage?\u2019 Sorry, collateral damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThen if they are blasted everyday [sic] that [kidnappings] would stop   \u2026     so, better not get yourselves kidnapped. \u201d Duterte had previously vowed to \u201ceat\u201d Abu Sayyaf terrorists \u201cin front of people.   \u2026     I will eat you alive, raw. \u201d He has also admitted that he has \u201ccousins\u201d who fight for the Islamic State, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and other terrorist groups in the area. The Philippine military issued a report in October estimating that Abu Sayyaf had generated $7. 3 million in kidnapping ransoms between January and June of 2016. While the Philippines has an official policy of not paying ransom to Abu Sayyaf, foreigners have paid to free their relatives, primarily Indonesian nationals. Duterte announced his plan to ramp up the campaign against Abu Sayyaf after visiting the wake of a Philippine soldier killed in a Special Forces operation against the terrorist group, leaving behind a    daughter. The soldier was the nation\u2019s first military loss of 2017. While announcing the new initiative to eradicate Abu Sayyaf, a spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) clarified that Duterte had not given any orders to disregard loss of hostage lives in operations against the terror group. The presidential office also clarified that Duterte\u2019s repeated mentions of martial law did not mean he intended to impose it. \u201cThe president has categorically said no to martial law. He even made a pronouncement saying that martial law did not improve the lives of the Filipinos,\u201d Duterte\u2019s spokesman Martin Andanar said this week, calling it \u201cmisreporting\u201d and \u201cthe height of journalistic irresponsibility\u201d to claim this. \u201cIf I have to declare martial law, I will declare it  \u2014   not about invasion, insurrection, not about danger. I will declare martial law to preserve my nation  \u2014    period,\u201d Duterte had said on Friday night. \u201cI will declare martial law if I wanted to. No one will be able to stop me. \u201d Multiple Philippine senators have implored Duterte to leave martial law off the table in the case of Abu Sayyaf. \u201cPresident Duterte should just shut up on these martial law threats and just govern our country the way any responsible leader should,\u201d Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV said on Monday, according to the Philippine Star. \u201cThere is no basis to declare martial law,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto. \u201cNo foreign army is steaming toward our shores to invade us. And as the President himself likes to brag, crime is down and the people are safe in their homes and communities. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564155.0220385}
