Over half, or 57 percent, of Americans aged 65 and older, said the media is \u201cunfriendly to people like you\u201d or \u201cenemies to people like you,\u201d as did 35 percent of respondents between 18 and 29.

A Media Research Center (MRC) study released in early March found 88 percent of Trump administration coverage from ABC, CBS, and NBC was negative, with \u201canchors and reporters often [injecting] their own   editorial tone into the coverage. \u201d A study released by by the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center in May found 93 percent of CNN and NBC\u2019s coverage of the   president was negative, as well as 52 percent of Fox News\u2019 coverage and 70 percent of the Wall Street Journal\u2018s: \u201cTrump has received unsparing coverage for most weeks of his presidency, without a single major topic where Trump\u2019s coverage, on balance, was more positive than negative, setting a new standard for unfavorable press coverage of a president. \u201d As Breitbart Senior   Large Joel Pollak reports: \u201cThe media, furious that Trump defied them by winning the election, denied him any semblance of a \u2018honeymoon\u2019 in office  \u2026     Trump has never been given the same chance \u2014  or any chance \u2014  to carry out his agenda. And for months, Trump voters have watched the media fawning over the hysterical opposition, praising the \u2018pussyhat\u2019 protesters and downplaying the extremists in their ranks. \u201d Trump has frequently bashed the \u201cfake news media\u201d for attacking him and allegedly fabricating sources to damage his agenda on Twitter. I win an election easily, a great \u201dmovement\u201d is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017,  Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017,  Don\u2019t believe the main stream (fake news) media. The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017,  Whenever you see the words \u2019sources say\u2019 in the fake news media, and they don\u2019t mention names  \u2026    .  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017,    \u2026    . it is very possible that those sources don\u2019t exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017,  It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017,  The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging  demeaning my use of social media because they don\u2019t want America to hear the real story!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2017,  Pollsters questioned 1, 000 U. S. citizens from May 26 to May 27.
