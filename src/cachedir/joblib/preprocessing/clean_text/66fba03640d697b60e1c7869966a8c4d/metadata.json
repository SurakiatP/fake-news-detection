It\u2019s 2001 and Mrs. Clinton is headed to the Senate. The women assembled around the table, all of whom know their husbands are unfaithful, are simultaneously disgusted by Mrs. Clinton and in awe of her. \u201cI can\u2019t stand that woman,\u201d says Angie Bonpensiero. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Rosalie Aprile. \u201cMaybe we could all take a page from her book. \u201d It\u2019s left to the boss\u2019s wife, Carmela Soprano to sort through her own messy emotions. She veers from instinctive revulsion (\u201cto be humiliated in public then walk around smiling all the time\u201d) to grudging admiration for how a woman not unlike herself, overshadowed by a cheating spouse, has emerged as powerful, independent figure in her own right. \u201cShe\u2019s a role model for all of us,\u201d Mrs. Soprano says on second thought, as the wives nod in agreement. In the latest episode of The   we examine a potent electoral force we rarely talk about when we talk about the campaign: pop culture. Both Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump are   stars in their own right, who have spawned  \u2014   and inspired  \u2014   television characters and shows from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d (Mr. Trump) to the \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d (Mrs. Clinton). We talk to the chief television critic at The New York Times, James Poniewozik, about how television and film characters past and present inform our views of both candidates  \u2014   or have been created in the candidates\u2019 images. \u201cThey are both characters in pop culture, characters in mass media, whose stories we have literally been hearing for decades,\u201d Mr. Poniewozik says of the candidates. \u201cUsually in an election, there\u2019s some narrative of some new character you haven\u2019t encountered before: Barack Obama in 2008, George W. Bush in 2000. Here, it\u2019s two   American television serials having a crossover episode. \u201d So if this   campaign is a crossover television event, how would Mr. Poniewozik, as a TV critic, review the show? \u201cI think the writers have really taken it over the top. It\u2019s like watching \u2018Scandal\u2019 in its eighth season where you just feel that they have exhausted every possible trick and they\u2019re emptying their notebooks at you. \u201d Would you commit to another season? \u201cI think I\u2019d like to see it recast. \u201d And we chat with Susan Dominus, of The Times Magazine, about the surprising ways that gender is playing out in pop cultural depictions of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in this campaign, a topic she is studying closely this year. \u201cIf we are going to extend gender stereotypes all the way to their worst place, it\u2019s celebrity, lightweight  \u2014   that reads as in some ways feminine and inconsequential or not perceived as a real threat,\u201d Ms. Dominus says. And in that sense, Mr. Trump, in some ways, is the more feminized figure. \u201cFor all of his bluster, when was the last time that people were this obsessed with a candidate\u2019s hair?\u201d Ms. Dominus asks. \u201cIt was Hillary in 2008!\u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
