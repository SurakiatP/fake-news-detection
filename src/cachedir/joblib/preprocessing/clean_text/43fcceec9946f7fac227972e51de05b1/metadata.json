And no other moment has revealed more starkly how hard it is for Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to become that candidate. Never have two presidential nominees been as unpopular as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and they are not fully trusted by their own parties nor showing significant crossover appeal in the polls. Mr. Trump, the   champion of law and order, is also the political figure many people blame for sowing division and hatred with his attacks on illegal immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans and others. Rather than defuse tension, he electrifies crowds and vanquishes rivals through provocations that he delights in calling politically incorrect. Of the two, Mrs. Clinton would seem more able, and driven, to try to bring the country together. She has a large following among black voters and speaks ardently about the need for \u201crespect\u201d and \u201clove and kindness. \u201d After Dallas, she called on \u201cwhite people to understand how   feel every day. \u201d Yet many on the right and some on the left dislike her intensely, and even her admirers say she lacks the public emotion, oratorical skills and reputation for honesty to persuade large numbers of Americans to see things her way. The need for a reassuring and healing voice has come at a particularly bad time for the two presumptive presidential nominees. For many Americans, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s credibility was further damaged last week as the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, sharply criticized her for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d about her use of private email as secretary of state. At the same time, Mr. Trump alienated many voters with his mixed comments about Saddam Hussein and his defensiveness over a Twitter post that many people regarded as  . \u201cTrump is 100 percent saying the right things about police and respecting authority, but then he says these other comments that are too weird for voters to ignore,\u201d said Fred L. DeLuca, a Trump supporter and former police officer who owns a graphic supply store in Youngstown, Ohio. \u201cAnd Hillary  \u2014   I don\u2019t trust what she says about law enforcement, not at all. \u201d Traumatic events have at times become opportunities for presidential candidates to step up and grow in the eyes of the American public, such as when Bill Clinton went to Los Angeles in 1992 in the aftermath of the riots there, or when Barack Obama pushed for aggressive, bipartisan action from the federal government to stem the banking crisis and protect taxpayers. Mr. Clinton\u2019s   image and empathic personality appealed across party lines, as did Mr. Obama\u2019s historic candidacy. And in moments of national crisis, presidents have shown ability to unify the country, if fleetingly, like George W. Bush did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. These candidates did not have to sell themselves to voters against such an intense combination of terrorism, mass shootings, police and gun violence, social unease and   fear. Still, the current run of crises has, in the view of many Democrats and Republicans, served only to spotlight the shortcomings of both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThe sense of alienation and estrangement is so great today that it\u2019s hard to unite people, and these candidates haven\u2019t done it,\u201d said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Clinton backer. The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared the current political climate to the Civil War era and recalled Lincoln\u2019s \u201cHouse Divided\u201d speech, during his 1858 Senate campaign, in which he analyzed the deep divisions between the North and the South and predicted that the country would become more united  \u2014   but first slavery had to be eliminated or made the law of the land. She said Lincoln proved to be a president who would go to war to unify the country, and credited President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with mobilizing forces around the country and in Congress in the 1960s to pass civil rights legislation that  \u2014   while highly divisive  \u2014   also brought greater equality for Americans. \u201cIf Trump was a more disciplined, focused candidate, this could be his moment to win over Americans because the desire for a strong leader is great in moments of turbulence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look at his record. After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 he talked about the weak currency helping his golf course. After the Orlando shootings, it was, \u2018I told you so.\u2019 After the F. B. I. report on Hillary, he couldn\u2019t focus on that. Voters want candidates to show we can trust them, and both candidates have this problem. \u201d In several recent polls, roughly   of Americans said that Mrs. Clinton was not honest and trustworthy Mr. Trump drew similar numbers on the question. These polls were conducted before the F. B. I. director rebuked Mrs. Clinton over her private email and handling of classified material. Mr. Trump, whose poll ratings grew after his forceful responses to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. tried to sound similarly resolute on Friday evening, saying in a video that law enforcement was \u201cthe force between civilization and total chaos. \u201d And, he said, \u201cNow is the time for prayers, love, unity and leadership. \u201d These remarks were relatively restrained for him, and his advisers hope that he can build on his image as a powerful,   executive and attempt to unify voters. He is the choice of most voters who say they are particularly interested in electing a strong leader  \u2014   a little over   of the electorate, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics survey. A Gallup poll conducted in May showed that six in 10 Americans consider him a strong and decisive leader. Vernita Blocker, a retired social work administrator from Lindenwold, N. J. supports Mrs. Clinton but said she worried that Mr. Trump might be better suited to capitalize on Americans\u2019 concerns about fraying social order. \u201cThe more people are afraid, the more it plays into Trump\u2019s hands because they will want a   president,\u201d Ms. Blocker said. \u201cHillary has to find more ways to persuade people that she could really unite the country despite all the people who don\u2019t like her. \u201d Yet Mr. Trump is still having trouble uniting his own party, while Mrs. Clinton appears further along with Democrats. The conventions this month will be huge opportunities for the nominees to galvanize the faithful, but also a chance to reach out to the other side with traditionally positive speeches about their hopes for the country. On policy, Mrs. Clinton is also eager to find common ground on gun control and criminal justice reform  \u2014   issues that resonate with many voters at a time of seemingly endless violence. While new gun laws are opposed by many on the right, she wants Americans to at least talk about finding solutions  \u2014   if not uniting behind them. \u201cI think \u2018unity\u2019 is the wrong goal, and what we need can\u2019t be achieved by lofty oratory alone,\u201d said Wendy L. Wall, an associate professor of history at Binghamton University. \u201cOften in our past, unity has meant burying disagreements rather than solving common problems. What we need now is someone who can work across differences, not erase them. \u201d \u201cI think there is no way Trump could do this,\u201d she added. \u201cI think the jury is still out on Clinton. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564476.2298381}
