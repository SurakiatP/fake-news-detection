They say their children are heartbroken also. Their 10 children are remaining in Texas State custody, even though there are no abuse or neglect findings, and even though the children are suffering and want to come home. The children remain in public school and State custody, despite Judge Hart\u2019s previous ruling to allow the children to be homeschooled. See previous story: Texas Judge Allows Mother to Homeschool Her Own Children \u2013 Denies Request to Vaccinate Children While in State Custody \\nJudge Hart ruled on September 20th that the Rembis children should continue to homeschool while in State custody \u201cfor purposes of consistency \u2013 to keep the children in the same school setting they were in before entering state custody \u2013 since they will continue to be homeschooled once they go home,\u201d and added that the children would be going home \u201cquickly,\u201d according to Claire. \\nWhen CPS defied Judge Hart\u2019s ruling to allow the Rembis children to continue to homeschool, the Rembis\u2019 were certain that Judge Hart would have no option but to send the children home on October 5th, and punish the social workers who defied his ruling. See previous story: Texas CPS Defies Judge\u2019s Order to Homeschool, Keeps Rembis Children in Public School \\nBut when they went to court on October 5th, the Rembis said it was like Judge Hart was a \u201ccompletely different person\u201d than he had been during the Adversary hearing in September, and rather than dealing with CPS\u2019 refusal to homeschool the children, the hearing focused only on presenting a lengthy list of \u201cservices\u201d the Rembis\u2019 must complete before they can get their children home and out of public school and State custody. William Rembis with some of his children during a CPS supervised visit. \\nClaire and William maintain that their children should never have been taken into State custody in the first place, and that the list of \u201cCPS services\u201d they must now complete are a not only a waste of tax-payer money, but also a waste of time, since there never was any abuse or neglect, and CPS allegedly never even substantiated any of their allegations. \\nAlthough there were some \u201csupervision concerns\u201d since their 2-year old \u201cescape artist\u201d got into the front yard momentarily without their knowledge, the Rembis say that their daughter getting into the yard alone was an accident (and could happen to any family), and once they learned of it, locks were immediately added to the garage doors to prevent any further \u201cescapes.\u201d \\nThe Rembis\u2019 are outraged that their family\u2019s lives have been turned upside down, their children abused and traumatized in state custody, their reputation slandered in the media, and the main \u201ceye-witness\u201d who called CPS and started this entire ordeal is not even a credible witness, according to Claire: \\nThe caller that called CPS to begin with, ended up changing her story several times under oath & was discovered to be a meth manufacturer who sells it, is a felon with a 12-yr long criminal record that may have been on drugs when she made that CPS report that started this nightmare. Rembis Children Remain in Custody as Retaliation? \\nClaire recalled that at the close of the Adversary hearing on September 20th, Judge Hart declared that he saw \u201cnothing to necessitate Terminating Parental Rights,\u201d and that his only concerns were some \u201csupervision issues that could be easily fixed.\u201d \\nYet, even though there was no substantiated \u201cabuse or neglect,\u201d Judge Hart ruled that the children had to remain in custody, saying \u201c his hands were tied \u201d because the Rembis family left Lubbock in August, before bringing the children in for CPS interviews, even though there was no court order preventing the family form leaving the state, and they allegedly did nothing illegal by doing so. \\nThe Rembis\u2019 explain that they left Texas to protect their children from the overzealous CPS worker Kris Stecklein who was harassing them at home and traumatizing the children. The Rembis\u2019 also contend \u2013 and they have spoken with attorneys who agree \u2013 that the children were illegally extradited from Colorado back to Texas. According to the Rembis\u2019, CPS has defied judges\u2019 orders, broken laws, and committed perjury over and over, yet they suffer no consequences. The Rembis family, who claim their only wrongdoing was \u201cmaking a mistake\u201d and not noticing when their 2-year-old followed William Rembis outside, continue to suffer at the hands of a corrupt system. \\nAre the Rembis\u2019 being \u201cmade an example of\u201d because they left Texas and exposed corruption within Lubbock CPS? The Rembis family believes that Judge Hart\u2019s ruling to keep the children in State care is retaliation because the they continue to expose the corruption of CPS and the Family Court system. \\nStudies have shown that children are worse off in foster homes than if they remained in a \u201ctroubled home,\u201d and many argue that foster care itself is a form of \u201cchild abuse,\u201d causing long-term emotional trauma for children. \\nIn despair for her children, Claire cries: \\nI didn\u2019t think my body could make this many tears. Their joy is gone. Their happy faces are sad now. Oh Lord, Heavenly Father, please Lord PLEASE don\u2019t let anything happen to them! \\nAre they living with genuinely abused kids that are acting out towards them? \\nMy husband & I are supposed to just sit back, hands tied & NOT HELP THEM? We\u2019re to hang tight knowing that abused kids & possibly sicko adults are living amongst them in the heavily populated group home? \\nFor more information on grim foster care statistics, see: The U.S. Foster Care System: Modern Day Slavery and Child Trafficking No Consequence for CPS Defying Homeschool Ruling? \\nIt was shocking to the Rembis\u2019 that CPS could get away with \u201cdefying\u201d the Judges\u2019 previous ruling about homeschooling their children. According to Claire: \\nCPS said that they tried to find a homeschool curriculum but were unsuccessful. They mentioned something about a schooling option to do at the foster homes but that each kid had to have a laptop in order to do it so it was not an option they say. They also said that they spoke to Texas Homeschooling Coalition & that they didn\u2019t offer anything that would allow CPS to take the kids to for their schooling. They said that they couldn\u2019t find a foster family willing to homeschool the children. \\nThey said that the kids are doing really well in school. They said that they aren\u2019t having any behavioral issues. They said that the schools have reported that the kids, \u201cbrighten up the school\u201d& that they enjoy having them as students. They said that the kids are enjoying school, except for Sebastian. \\nClaire was heartbroken that Judge Hart would not even let her discuss any of the options she had written down to present in court as to how to make homeschooling work, and she was even more heartbroken that her children were remaining in State custody: \\nMy heart hurts too bad. I feel like I\u2019m slipping away. I don\u2019t even know how to describe this. It feels like I\u2019ve been thrown into a room with a crowd of people with dementia & Alzheimer\u2019s. Then the room is locked from the outside so I can\u2019t get out. Then I\u2019m listening to these people discuss what to do to the kids, how to do it, when to do it, etc\u2026 \\nAnd then they point at me & talk about me as though I\u2019m a strange, non-human, defected being that they must bind up & put into a strait jacket with duct tape on my mouth. All the while I can still see & they force me to watch our kids being hurt & crying out in pain, suffering & miserable. Their arms reaching out to me, them crying out to me but I can\u2019t do anything but sit in a chair, unable to move & unable to talk. Can CPS Lie in Court without Consequence? \\nClaire says she was appalled at how CPS workers could lie in court on October 5th, without any repercussion: \\nJudge asks for case plan. He asks why we haven\u2019t started it since CPS says we received it on 9/23. \\nI told him that we hadn\u2019t received it & that we were told that it would be emailed to us on 9/27. CPS argued that I wasn\u2019t told this. I told the judge that the meeting in which we were told this was recorded. \\nI also told him that the attorneys (my husbands & the standby one for me) hadn\u2019t received it until the morning of the hearing. He didn\u2019t have a response to this. \\nI pointed out that the CPS attorney & CPS workers lied about the case plan. I said to him, \u2018I need to point out to you that these (pointed to the CPS, \u201cteam\u201d) CPS workers just told you that we received the case plan on September 23rd.\u2019 Then I said to him, \u2018This case plan states on the front page that it was created on October 3rd.\u201d \\nThe CPS team were visibly annoyed, one tapping her foot, the other rolling her eyes. There was silence as he looked at the papers. He didn\u2019t acknowledge what I had just said, just moved on & started asking someone else questions. Claire Claims Judge Hart Insulted Her in Court \u2013 Asking if She Knew How to Read and Write Meme supplied by Rembis family. \\nClaire was disheartened at the treatment she received from Judge Hart on October 5th: \\nAfter we had a recess of 15 minutes to look over the case plan, I told the judge that I needed more time to look at the case plan; he told me that I needed to put my concerns in written format to submit for another hearing \u2013 A hearing simply to go over the case plan. \\nThen he asked me if I could read & write! \\nI asked him to repeat it. He said the same thing, & I said, \u2018Are you serious?!\u2019 & sorta chuckled. He said that he was because he wanted to make sure that if I needed any, \u2018special accommodations\u2019 he wanted to provide me with them. \\nIn hindsight, maybe he was being sarcastic. He is the judge that we had to file a complaint on for violating Williams\u2019 disability rights. He laughed at Willie when he told him that he needed to get closer to the stand in order to hear the judge. Then the judge called him a liar when William explained that he was legally deaf. New Attorney Says Case Should Never Have Gotten This Far \\nClaire was reluctant to accept the court-appointed standby attorney Bill de Haas, but after talking to him, she and William are hopeful that de Haas will actually fight for them, and not just be a Family Court puppet-attorney. Claire reports that the attorney has told them that this case should have ended at the first hearing, and the children should never have been taken into custody. \\nWilliam fired his other court-appointed attorney, and he and Claire have now accepted de Haas as their legal counsel. They say that de Haas has been very helpful, explaining that it was illegal for Texas to extradite the children from Colorado, and he has been advising them about how they can get the case moved to Colorado, where William has been offered a good-paying job. Alex\u2019s Outcry for Help \\nAt their October 17th visit, Claire\u2019s 15-year-old son made an \u201coutcry for help,\u201d through a poem he wrote describing his group home, which he gave to his parents. \u201cDearest String,\u201d a poem by Alex Rembis, given to Claire at a visit. Concerns Over Son Alex Escalate \u2013 Suffering in Group Home \\nThe parents are very concerned about their son Alex: \\nAlex is at the end of his rope. He is in the darkest frame of mind that we have ever seen him in. We have asked Andrew to tell us what is happening. The last time I asked him he told me that he couldn\u2019t say \u2013 he was staring at a CPS worker when he said this. \\nWe have the impression that the kids are too afraid to say anything because all of our visitations are monitored by CPS workers. They listen to EVERYTHING we all say. About 5 visitations ago, Aurora was weeping the entire time. She kept stopping to whisper to us that she didn\u2019t want to tell us why because the CPS workers were listening to her. Before we had to leave that day, she just curled up in a ball & screamed, while crying, \u201cI want to go home!!!\u201d \\nSo, their ability to report & escape abuse is very much hindered. I\u2019m also very concerned about them being manipulated & threatened into keeping quiet about the abuse. \u201cMeet Alex Rembis in happier times. Alex was illegally kidnapped for Texas CPS on 8/24/16. He was taken from a Christian, homeschooling family on false allegations of neglect.\u201d \u2013 Claire Rembis \\nOn October 18th, Claire learned that Alex had a seizure at school: \\nAlex was in the hospital. He had a seizure at school this morning. The CPS worker was there but not us. They didn\u2019t take care of him the way that his neurologist told us to if he had another seizure. Jennifer tried to say the seizure was mild and no big deal, but from what she described to me on the phone, it did not sound like a mild seizure. Tragically, the lack of adequate response by CPS/fostercare/school workers could\u2019ve had devastating consequences on his health. \\nOn October 26th, Alex had a follow-up neurology appointment, where she says she learned that the reason for Alex\u2019s seizure the previous week was because the \u201cgroup home\u201d failed to give him his daily medication. \\nClaire says that during the appointment, she was informing Alex of his rights to talk to the Judge or his attorney, and wrote down some information for him on a note. Claire reports that Garlett wouldn\u2019t let Alex have the note, and when he tried to record his mother\u2019s advice \u201cfor his record,\u201d Garlett allegedly put her hand over the recorder and called for security.

Boys Depressed and Abused \u2013 Want to Come Home \\nClaire says that the children have told her that \u201cfor some reason the people at the home are being really mean to the boys and that the boys are being abused.\u201d \\nClaire and William are very worried for their children\u2019s safety, saying that two of the boys, who live in a group home, confided in her at the October 24th visit that they are depressed and want to come home: \\nHolding back tears, Alex shared that he\u2019s depressed because he can\u2019t come home. His brother (14), in the same cottage as him, confided in me that he feels the same way & that he cried himself to sleep because he couldn\u2019t go home. \\nThis isn\u2019t our son. Alex is a very sweet, joyful, intelligent young man who loves to make people laugh. I told Alex that everyone is praying for him. \u2013 I reminded Alex that Jesus\u2019 price paid for healing also includes the healing of the mind. I encouraged him to pray for healing from the depression. I reminded him to seek Jesus who is w/him 24/7 & that Jesus will comfort him. \\nI told him how everyone loved his poem & that we ARE listening. Please pray for Alex & his siblings to be returned to their loving home where they belong, before Christmas. The children write and draw on a board during visits. Alex wrote on the board at the 10/24/16 visitation, \u201cI wanna go back to my real home! \u2013 Alex\u201d (Photo provided by family) Children Continue to Suffer in Foster Care \\nClaire continued to report to Health Impact News about how her children are suffering in state care: \\nThe kids have been so sick ever since they were taken. The CPS worker says that she is their advocate & the one looking out for their healthcare needs. However, not only is she not getting them the medical care that they need, she is LYING TO US about their health. \\nWe are POWERLESS over this. We have to sit back, hands tied, mouths shut, forced to watch them suffer but not being able to alleviate it. They need help! That is why God chose our family for them; He\u2019s equipped us to care for them. THEY NEED US NOW. \\nAt one visit, Aurora had a severe stomach ache and was crying. At the next visit, Aurora was so sick, she couldn\u2019t talk during the visit. Claire writes: \\nWhen the CPS worker Jennifer was answering my questions, Aurora was writing down the answers & correcting her. \\nAfter I asked her why Aurora couldn\u2019t talk, Jennifer said that Aurora wasn\u2019t sick. She then said that Aurora wasn\u2019t on any medication. To that Aurora wrote the response below.[I\u2019m taking meds to make me better] \\nWhen I questioned Jennifer about Aurora not seeing a doctor after complaining about intense abdominal pain the week before at visitation, Aurora wrote down that she had thrown up a few days prior to the visitation. \\nDuring one visit, when Claire changed her toddler\u2019s diaper, she was distressed when she discovered a rash on her daughter\u2019s body from her chest to her feet. Even more troubling, was the fact that the social workers allegedly tried to dissuade Claire from even changing her child\u2019s diaper, saying they would do it later. (Many families have reported that CPS would label parents with \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d had the child been in the family\u2019s care, and wonder, \u201cwhy is not abuse and neglect when it happens in State care?\u201d ) Editorial: What is R eally Going On with Texas CPS and Foster Care? \\nUnfortunately, there are still many readers who read stories like this one incredulously, thinking, \u201cthere must be more to the story,\u201d and \u201cCPS would not take children away from good parents without just cause.\u201d While it\u2019s nice to believe that CPS only rescues truly abused and severely neglected children from awful parents, sadly, this just isn\u2019t the case. \\nOver 75% of CPS cases nationwide are \u201cneglect cases\u201d due to poverty, simply based on the biased opinion of the caller or social worker that some \u201cbasic necessities are being denied.\u201d Once children are moved into foster care, the State\u2019s CPS system can start receiving federal funds for foster care, social workers, judges, medical doctors, attorneys, psychiatrists, therapist, counselors, etc. \u2013 for all those who derive a living from this industry. Are we punishing poverty at the expense of future generations, using children as a commodity to create job security for CPS and Family Courts? \\nSee: Child Kidnapping and Trafficking: A Lucrative U.S. Business Funded by Taxpayers Called \u201cFoster Care\u201d \\nHave we allowed the State the dictate the standards for material possessions each member of a family must possess for \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d? \\nThe Rembis\u2019 and their supporters agree that the removal of their children is not only a violation of their Civil and Constitutional Rights , but has caused unjustifiable trauma and abuse to their children and unnecessary stress and hardship to their family. \\nThis is the type of CPS\u2019 abuse that many families across the country who contact us face every day. Until CPS is exposed for what it truly is \u2013 a federally-funded multi-billion-dollar child-trafficking and adoption business \u2013 and until families across the world demand that those they elect defund CPS, no family is safe from the tyranny which CPS agents can unleash on them should their family ever come into CPS\u2019 sights. \\nClaire shares: \\nSo many things are uncertain right now. So much fear, so much scary & crazy stuff. We can\u2019t understand how something so terrible can happen. We don\u2019t understand how it can happen to so many families and continue without massive outcry. But what we DO know, is that God is a solid rock. We know that we can trust Him. We know that our time here on earth will be spent allowing Him to work through us. Our eternity will be in paradise, with our Savior, safe & tucked away for His glory. So, as always, we must obey God, rather than man. \\nThe abuses in Texas CPS and Foster Care have been exposed repeatedly, even in the mainstream media in Texas.
