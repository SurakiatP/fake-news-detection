President Trump\u2019s aggressive moves on security and immigration drew strong responses both domestically and internationally. Tensions with Mexico are particularly high. Its president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, above, canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump, and the two feuded  \u2014   largely over Twitter  \u2014   as reports emerged that Mr. Trump could consider a 20 percent tax on imports to pay for a border wall. Mexico said its 50 consulates in the United States would work to protect the rights of Mexican immigrants, while America\u2019s   sanctuary cities, including New York, Boston and Los Angeles, vowed to resist   immigration enforcement. _____ 2. Mr. Trump told Republican leaders at a policy retreat in Philadelphia that this Congress would be the busiest \u201cin decades, maybe ever. \u201d His adviser Steve Bannon deepened tensions with the news media, saying it had been humiliated by election missteps and should \u201ckeep its mouth shut. \u201d He added: \u201cI want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. \u201d This may not come as a surprise: Sales of dystopian novels, most notably George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d are spiking. Our literary critic offers a reappraisal. The Times is tracking Mr. Trump\u2019s full agenda, and covering many more aspects of his administration.

Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts, not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women\u2019s marches last weekend. And health clinics across the developing world are bracing for cuts because of Mr. Trump\u2019s revival of a policy prohibiting foreign aid to groups that discuss abortion, a rule that often curtails broader health services.

The Doomsday Clock has moved nearer to midnight than it\u2019s been in more than 60 years. Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, it\u2019s meant to convey \u201chow close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making. \u201d It debuted in 1947. Two of the group\u2019s scientists cited alarm over Mr. Trump\u2019s positions on nuclear weapons and climate change. _____ 5. In China, hundreds of millions of people are traveling from industrial regions to their hometowns to celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Saturday. Some cities have restricted the use of fireworks over pollution concerns. _____ 6. For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos. The advance brings scientists closer to developing human organs in animals for later transplant. Since the organ would be made of a patient\u2019s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. _____ 7. Tributes to Mary Tyler Moore, the iconic actress who died on Wednesday at 80, continue to pour in. The TV journalist Jane Pauley, above, said the character of the single,   news producer Mary Richards was a role model and more. She even mimicked her fashion and home d\u00e9cor choices. The show \u201cmade a woman in the newsroom seem normal,\u201d wrote Ms. Pauley, the anchor of \u201cSunday Morning\u201d on CBS. _____ 8. Serena and a resurgent Venus Williams will face each other in the final of the Australian Open on Saturday. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019re playing against each other in a Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 2009, above. If Serena wins, she would set an   record with a 23rd Grand Slam singles title. And a surprisingly strong Roger Federer defeated Stan Wawrinka to advance to the men\u2019s final. He\u2019ll seek his first major title since Wimbledon in 2012 on Sunday. _____ 9.   years after the movie \u201cTrainspotting\u201d gave the world a glimpse into the   underbelly of Edinburgh, the characters are back. \u201cT2 Trainspotting\u201d  \u2014   with the same director and several of the same stars, including Ewan McGregor, above center  \u2014   checks in with the unmoored but compelling characters as they face middle age. It\u2019s being released this week in Britain and reaches the U. S. in March. We rounded up the early reviews. _____ 10. Finally, whatever your politics, your fears, or your troubles, a gift: the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017. Over the past two days, American zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile.
