He was 62. His death was confirmed by his agent Ryan Goldhar, who said the cause had not been confirmed but appeared to be a heart attack. Mr. Rosato, an energetic actor and madcap impressionist, got his start with the Toronto company of the Second City improvisational troupe. In 1977 he became a performer and writer for \u201cSCTV\u201d (originally titled \u201cSecond City Television\u201d) whose cast over the years would also feature Martin Short, John Candy, Catherine O\u2019Hara and Rick Moranis. Mr. Rosato\u2019s signature \u201cSCTV\u201d character was Marcello, a clumsy and frequently soused   host. In 1981, Mr. Rosato and his \u201cSCTV\u201d colleague Robin Duke moved to \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d joining a cast headed by Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. He did not make much of an impression and left \u201cS. N. L. \u201d after only one season. He later played recurring roles on the Canadian police drama \u201cNight Heat\u201d and did   work on cartoon shows. He worked steadily until the  . But then he began to unravel. In 2005 Mr. Rosato\u2019s wife, Leah, left him and took their young daughter, citing his increasingly erratic behavior. He contacted the police that spring, claiming that his daughter had been abused and, later, that his family had been replaced by  . On May 5 he went to a police station to file a missing persons report about his family and was arrested and charged with criminal harassment. Mr. Rosato, who refused to acknowledge his mental illness, did not plead guilty and spent the next two years in a   facility awaiting trial. News media reports attributed the gap between Mr. Rosato\u2019s arrest and trial to a combination of his intractability and the punitive approach of the Canadian authorities. \u201cTony Rosato will have spent more time in custody on a harassment charge than any other convicted prisoner in Canada has ever spent on the same charges,\u201d his lawyer, Daniel Brodsky, told The Toronto Star before his trial finally began in 2007. A judge found Mr. Rosato guilty of criminal harassment that September. He was remanded to a psychiatric hospital, where he was found to have Capgras syndrome, a rare mental illness characterized by the delusion that loved ones have been replaced by impostors. At the hospital, he was required for the first time to take antipsychotic medication, and his delusions eventually abated. Mr. Rosato was released in 2009 and soon returned to work. He told The Toronto Star that he was thrilled to be free but that recovering from his ordeal would take time. \u201cFour years being inside is very hard on the spirit,\u201d he said. Antonio Rosato was born on Dec. 26, 1954, in Naples, Italy. He moved to Canada with his family when he was a boy and became a naturalized citizen in 1966. After graduating from Oakwood Collegiate Institute in Toronto, he began studying chiropractic medicine at the University of Toronto but dropped out to become a performer. Mr. Rosato\u2019s marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughter, Giulietta Rosato.'"}, "time": 1742562715.958548}
