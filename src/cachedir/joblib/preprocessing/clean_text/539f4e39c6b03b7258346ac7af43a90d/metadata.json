But to me, it is extremely obvious,\u201d proclaimed MILO. \u201cThe Democrats have gone from being the party of the common man, to the party of the cuckold. \u201d \u201cOnce upon a time, this was the voter the Democrat party supported,\u201d he continued, displaying a picture of a working miner. \u201cThis man worked hard in a dirty and dangerous environment, often shortening his life from disease and injury, for the American   to give his family a better life. This type of man built the backbone of this country, and they exist today in factories and yes even in coal mines. Coal mines the left will proudly tell you they want to put out of business. \u201d \u201cBut this type of guy is no longer welcome by the leftists. They have a new favored voter,\u201d MILO explained, displaying a picture of a   SJW. \u201cHere he is! The current year democrat. The social justice warrior. He doesn\u2019t work, or if he does it is the service industry, because he is too busy complaining about things. He probably joined the Women\u2019s March on Washington trying to hook up with some women after white knighting them. \u201d MILO continued to claim that \u201cWhat this profound change represents is a massive shift completely into the extreme fringe of leftist politics, which we call Identity Politics. \u201d \u201cWhat matters is your minority group, and how aggrieved you are,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe white working class is incompatible with those that have taken over the left. Nannying schoolmarms. Haughty college professors and worse yet, their brainwashed students shouting slogans. Race hustlers that define them as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d just because they are white. I frankly don\u2019t blame for running away from the left, do you?\u201d Written from prepared remarks. MILO wears glasses by Givenchy, $350. Distressed blue jeans by True Religion, $329. Brown leather belt with gold buckle by Louis Vuitton, $450. Light pink dress shirt by Brooks Brothers, $92. Sparkly purple suit jacket by Angelino, $225. Burgundy crushed velvet slippers by Crockett  Jones, $370. Socks by Ralph Lauren, 3 pairs for $21. 98. Jewellery and pearls, too much money to count.
