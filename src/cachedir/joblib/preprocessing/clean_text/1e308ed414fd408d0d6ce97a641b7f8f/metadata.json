[In a feisty campaign speech in northwest Turkey, Erdogan said the EU could \u201cforget about\u201d the deal, in which Ankara agreed to readmit migrants that had reached Greece illegally via Turkey  \u2014   a key transit country for tens of thousands trying to flee fighting and poverty and enter Europe. In return, the EU was to grant Turkish citizens the right to travel to many European countries  .  The comments were the latest in Turkey\u2019s bitter diplomatic spat with Germany and the Netherlands, which last week prevented two Turkish ministers from addressing Turkish citizens in Rotterdam in the   to a referendum on constitutional reforms that would increase Erdogan\u2019s powers. One minister was escorted out to the country, while the other was denied permission to land. Some German authorities have also blocked appearances by Turkish ministers trying to attend similar rallies. On Thursday, Erdogan reiterated angry criticism of the ban. He also accused the EU of not sticking to a promise to grant Turkish nationals the right to travel   in Europe. \u201cNow they\u2019re talking about the readmission agreement. What readmission? Forget about it,\u201d he said, referring to the migrant deal. The agreement, which was initially reached in 2013, was revived last year, when Turkey agreed to help keep migrants from crossing into the EU in return for funds to help it deal with some 3 million refugees. \u201cYou bar my minister from entering the Netherlands   \u2026     and then you expect us to grant access (to migrants)? There can be no such thing,\u201d he added. In Greece, officials did not immediately react to Erdogan\u2019s comments. But responding to a similar threat by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier, Greece\u2019s deputy defense minister said it was unclear whether Turkey was really proposing to end the deal. \u201cThe refugee issue is a matter of international law, international solidarity and a humanitarian concern,\u201d Dimitris Vitsas told the private Alpha radio Thursday. \u201cWhen it is used at a level of rhetoric, and much more at a practical level, as a negotiating weapon, then we are no longer talking about the refugee issue. \u201d \u201cBut I must point out that many things are being said right now ahead of the forthcoming referendum in Turkey,\u201d he added. Erdogan also sharply criticized a European court ruling in favor of curbs on wearing Islamic headscarves, renewed accusations of \u201c \u201d against the Netherlands, and remarked that the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had lost Turkey\u2019s friendship despite winning elections there. \u201cWhat happened to your freedom to faith and religion,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cThey have started a ( ) war. There can be no other explanation. I say this very openly, Europe is heading toward its   War II days. \u201d Erdogan ruled out any possibility of reconciliation with a new Dutch government to be headed by Rutte. \u201cOh Rutte, you may have come out (of the elections) as the first party, but you should know that you have lost a friend like Turkey,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s office said the German leader discussed the tensions between EU nations and Turkey with French President Francois Hollande in a phone call Thursday. The two reiterated that Erdogan\u2019s insulting comments about Germany and other European countries  \u2014   including \u201cNazi\u201d comparisons  \u2014   were unacceptable. Hollande stressed France\u2019s solidarity with Germany and other EU partners that Turkey has assailed, a German government statement said. The two leaders agreed that appearances by Turkish politicians in Germany and France can be approved  \u2014   but only if they are \u201cregistered in good time and transparently, and adhere strictly to German or French law. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561940.4460442}
