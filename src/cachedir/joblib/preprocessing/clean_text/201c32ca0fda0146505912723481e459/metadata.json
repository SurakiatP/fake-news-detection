The   nominees are often unsung   highlights, too easily overlooked except for   balloting purposes. This is a shame, since in about the time it would take to watch \u201cArrival\u201d three times or \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d twice, you could take a remarkably   tour of world cinema. Even in a generally strong year like this one, the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack. The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions, and dark, adult themes as well as   charm and whimsy. The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful   material with compassion, courage and imagination (though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality). All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms (though several can be found on various sites now). Here is a brief critical guide. Before it was a mighty fief within Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom, Pixar was a plucky and resourceful   and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings. This year\u2019s, \u201cPiper\u201d (directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer) is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent. (The story is a bit like \u201cMoana\u201d in reverse.) The   relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme, figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou  \u2019s \u201cBorrowed Time,\u201d about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son, and Patrick Osborne\u2019s \u201cPearl\u201d (now on YouTube) about a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll dad and his rock \u2019n\u2019 roll daughter. All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue, and offer a respite from the usual    cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes. \u201cBlind Vaysha,\u201d a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric, Eastern European overtones, is a bit talkier, with a narrator\u2019s voice accompanying eerie,   images. \u201cPear Cider and Cigarettes,\u201d the longest, richest and saddest of the films, also uses   narration to tell a painful personal story about the life and death of Techno Stypes, a   childhood friend of Robert Valley, who directed the film. (It\u2019s available on Vimeo for a fee.) If I were voting, I\u2019d go for Techno, but if I had to make a prediction, I\u2019d never bet against Pixar. The predicament of migrants and refugees in Europe figures in two of the nominees, \u201cEnnemis Int\u00e9rieurs\u201d (\u201cInternal Enemies\u201d) from France, and \u201cSilent Nights,\u201d from Denmark. The first, directed by S\u00e9lim Azzazi, consists mainly of a tense interview between two men, both of Arab descent, who have lived in France all their lives. The older man is a former convict applying for citizenship, the younger one a government official. Their conversation, which takes place in 1998, touches on terrorism, religion and the integrity of \u201cLa Republique,\u201d issues that could hardly be more relevant as France approaches a possibly fateful presidential election. \u201cSilent Nights\u201d confronts similar questions as it traces the relationship between a young Danish woman and a Ghanaian immigrant, whose mutual empathy (and romantic attraction) is tested by the drastically different circumstances they face. The humanism of this film, directed by Aske Bang and Kim Magnusson, is shadowed by an inescapable pessimism, an intimation that kindness, while essential, may not be enough when survival is at stake. There is nothing overtly topical or political in the other three nominees, which are also from Europe. \u201cLa Femme et le TGV\u201d (\u201cThe Woman and the TGV,\u201d available for a fee from iTunes) from Switzerland, is almost rescued from mawkish triviality by the affecting performance of the great Jane Birkin as the title character, and nearly ruined by a cloying, aggressive score. The Spanish film \u201cTimecode,\u201d about the clandestine activities of parking garage security guards, might seem equally slight, but it reveals itself to be a sly fable of creative resistance in the face of deadening routine. And Kristof Deak and Anna Udvardy\u2019s \u201cSing,\u201d my favorite in this batch, might be mistaken for a sweet story of the friendship between two Hungarian schoolgirls until the last scene, when it becomes a parable of defiance against unjust and corrupt authority. (Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!) Like the nominees in the   best documentary category, the five films in this group demonstrate a commitment to both relevance and experimentation. Only one of them, \u201cJoe\u2019s Violin\u201d (now on YouTube) follows the conventional,   template, alternating interviews, archival footage and   events as it tells the touching story of a Holocaust survivor who donated his violin to a public school in the Bronx. The film, directed by Kahane Cooperman, proceeds though familiar beats, but its emotions are genuine and its characters are well worth knowing. Their lives are not easy, but \u201cJoe\u2019s Violin\u201d feels downright soothing alongside its competition, which includes some of the most wrenching, unsparing images I have seen on film in the past year. The aptly named \u201cExtremis,\u201d by Dan Krauss (on Netflix now) plunges the viewer into the midst of gravely ill patients and the doctors who must help their families decide whether to continue life support. The reality of death is something we often avoid, and even for half an hour, this film is difficult to watch. But it is also gripping, suspenseful and moving  \u2014   a hard look at a hard subject. Those words also describe the three short documentaries about the Syrian war and the European refugee crisis. Daphne Matziaraki\u2019s \u201c4. 1 Miles\u201d (produced by The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section and available on nytimes. com) plies the waters off the Greek island of Lesbos as coast guard officers try to rescue migrants crowded onto inflatable rafts. \u201cThe White Helmets,\u201d by Orlando von Einsiedel and Joanna Natasegara (now on Netflix) and \u201cWatani: My Homeland,\u201d by Marcel Mettelsiefen and Stephen Ellis, both take place in Aleppo, and provide a glimpse of the horror that city has endured in recent years. Too rigorous to offer false hope, they nonetheless affirm the necessity of witness and an antidote to despair. I can\u2019t choose between them, but I hope one of them wins.'"}, "time": 1742562182.4489887}
