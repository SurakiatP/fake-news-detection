Well, they\u2019re something the antipodean folks down under like to call the slots. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you\u2019re ever in Australia and you wander into a watering hole somewhere in the Outback or in a city, you\u2019ll chance upon a pokie, and that\u2019s when the fun starts. You feed your money into that machine whilst you\u2019re plastered out of your skull on Aussie nectar, and you wake up the next day, not only with a raging headache, but a bucket full of cash, or if you\u2019re an unlucky bugger, nothing. \\nBut you don\u2019t have to be in the land of Oz to play the pokies, you can be anywhere when you play them online. \\nSo what sort of games can you encounter playing the pokies? \\nDifferent types, all sorts, and the good ol\u2019 classics. \\nClassic \u2013 Classic slots are great if you can still find \u2019em. They only have one payline, although the classic games you find these days may not be limited to only one line. \\nMultiple Payline \u2013 Multiple payline games are all over the place and you can find games from 3 to 50 paylines. By activating more paylines with more coins you bet the more opportunities you will have for creating a winning combination and hitting the payload. \\nFeature \u2013 Features pokies come with special symbols that increase your chances. Features include wild symbols, scatter symbols, multipliers and jackpot symbols. Racking up a load of symbols in certain combinations can get you some serious wonga. \\nBonus \u2013 Bonus slots are a real find, because it\u2019s like a game within a game. You may be chugging along, and hit a bonus, then you win more cash, and you continue the game and win even more cash. What\u2019s not to like in a Bonus pokie? \\nProgressive \u2013 Progressive slots, no we\u2019re not talking about socialists, they are in fact a popular category of online casino games. As the name suggests the more you progress into the game the more your jackpot grows. The progression index can be activated by any number of factors, but getting a payout from these machines is a real bonus as your jackpot can be huge, monstrous, enormous! \\nUnique \u2013 You have a favourite film character, film or theme? There\u2019s probably a pokie for that. These pokies are branded to specific films or brands, and all have unique features to their game play. Best way to find out what they do is play them. \\nRules of the Game \\nFirst things first, there are no specific rules, play for free online, but most of all play for fun.
