Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That\u2019s false \u2013 we can say that the Russian government is not the source,\u201d Assange said in a recent interview. \u201cHillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick \u2013 for example faint \u2013 as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.\u201d \\n\u201cHey, @HillaryClinton, you have until Monday to drop out, or we will destroy you completely,\u201d the cryptic tweet says. \\nIt is unknown what information WikiLeaks has that has not already been released. Is it proof that Bill molested children when he was with his friend Epstein? Is it something, dare I say, worse? \\nPart of me hopes that she stays in the race so we can find out what it is. The rest of me just wants her gone. \\nJoin The Resistance And Share This Article Now! 187 '"}, "time": 1742564244.5939698}
