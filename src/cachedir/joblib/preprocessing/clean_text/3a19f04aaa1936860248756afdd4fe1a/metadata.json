It\u2019s more likely he has his eye on an ambassadorship. Maybe he covets being posted in a fun country, preferably a \u201cresort country,\u201d a country with a temperate climate and friendly people, a country where they speak English and don\u2019t get all carried with civil unrest. The Honorable Michael Francis Moore, U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. You have to admit, it has a nice ring to it.\\nDon\u2019t laugh. How do you think people get these ambassadorships? It\u2019s never been about anything having to do with \u201cqualifications.\u201d Ambassadorships are handed out in return for loyal service, in return for an important political favor, in return for keeping a potential troublemaker quiet, and in return for helping to raise a shit-pot of campaign donations. It\u2019s \u201cquid pro quo\u201d writ large.\\nOf course, when it comes to countries that might actually require a modicum of diplomatic ability, the administration has to be careful. You can\u2019t just take someone off the street and make them ambassador to a place like Russia or China or Brazil, not if the U.S. wishes to maintain its credibility. But still, there are plenty of places in the world where you can pretty much dump anybody.\\nTake President Clinton\u2019s administration, for example. In 1994, Bill Clinton rewarded congresswoman Maxine Waters for her long-time support, along with her role in securing African-American votes, by appointing her husband, Sidney Williams, to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. Prior to becoming an ambassador, Williams played football in the NFL, and ran a Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. Life in Nassau was good.\\nAgain: \u201cMichael Francis Moore: U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas\u201d has a nice ring to it. If not the Bahamas, then how about Barbados? There\u2019s whole array of places to pick from. Granted, picturing Moore in a silk top hat and coattails instead of his usual baseball cap and sweatshirt is a bit of a stretch, but with a little coaching, there\u2019s no doubt he can pull it off. After all, isn\u2019t that why people in these positions have \u201cpersonal assistants\u201d?\\nSo best of luck to you, Michael. Let\u2019s hope that when you or your \u201cpeople\u201d casually mention to Hillary that being an ambassador would be a cool job, she gets the hint. On the other hand, don\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch (to coin a phrase). Because this is big-time politics, there will be a long list of people seeking the same job. Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile immediately come to mind.\\n David Macaray is a playwright and author.
