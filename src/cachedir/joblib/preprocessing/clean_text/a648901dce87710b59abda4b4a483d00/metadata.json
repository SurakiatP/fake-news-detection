Written with Bruce Feirstein, \u201cOld School\u201d is meant to set forth the code of decency, honor and determination that made O\u2019Reilly what he is today. The lack of these virtues, the book argues, has created whiners, tweeters, helicopter parents, employees who don\u2019t use briefcases and worse. All these miscreants are labeled \u201csnowflakes,\u201d though that\u2019s getting rusty. A new epithet would have been nice. The trouble is that old   distinctions are not that clear. Sometimes old school is just old. And if you\u2019re old school  \u2014   \u201cyou still bend over to pick up a penny,\u201d \u201cyou put everything away in the kitchen before you go to bed at night\u201d  \u2014   doesn\u2019t being old school also require you to write your own book about your principles? O\u2019Reilly has written half a book. He relies heavily on the \u201cOver to you, Feirstein\u201d   segue for the rest. More trouble: Did these two ever decide what snowflake was supposed to mean? It\u2019s an   knock that they use for spinelessness, stupidity, political correctness and  \u2019Reillyian political leanings. They\u2019ve left it so vague that one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s definitions might get him into trouble with one of his most outspoken friends. \u201cWe all know Snowflakes,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe people who blame everyone else for their failures, who look to others to solve their problems, who are sooooo sensitive to every slight. \u201d That puts a snowflake in chief in the Oval Office. This is an especially inopportune moment for O\u2019Reilly to be lecturing anybody about morals. \u201cOld School\u201d hits the top of the New York Times nonfiction   list just as his popular TV show, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d is hemorrhaging sponsors because women at Fox, angered by what they deemed O\u2019Reilly\u2019s predatory behavior, took his advice. (\u201cNever let anyone treat you badly. That\u2019s Old School. \u201d) O\u2019Reilly\u2019s recent series of steroidal history books written with Martin Dugard, starting with \u201cKilling Lincoln\u201d in 2011, is popular for much better reasons. Those books are compressed, not padded in the way \u201cOld School\u201d is. They boil big stories down to the good parts, treating accuracy as no obstacle. And they don\u2019t play off the toxic atmosphere that has prevailed since the start of the 2016 election cycle. It\u2019s astounding that \u201cOld School,\u201d a book built on divisive   can complain about   TV comics\u2019 alienating half of the viewing population by being politically slanted. O\u2019Reilly tells a few stories from his childhood that are meant to explain where his own   values come from. He grew up in Levittown, on Long Island, in a household where the kids were taught to be decent and to work hard if they wanted money. These stories can be strange, like the one when a young Bill used his father\u2019s new mower on a neighbor\u2019s lawn. Bill got angry when the neighbor complained that Bill hadn\u2019t cut the grass under the shrubbery. It couldn\u2019t have been done without damaging the lawn mower, so the neighbor handed Bill a pair of shears. Bill cut the grass angrily, took his pay and went home. He told his father the story. His father called the guy an imbecile. The lesson of Work Hard No Matter What somehow morphed into a connection between earning money and calling people imbeciles  \u2014   or pinheads, the O\u2019Reilly term of art. O\u2019Reilly and Feirstein are old friends who met at Boston University in 1974. Their   story is one of the best anecdotes here. Feirstein was writing a column for the college paper, using it to lampoon the school\u2019s rich kids and their   antics. (He would later move on to Spy and Vanity Fair.) One day, he found a big guy looming over him \u201cwith something between a scowl and a smile on his face,\u201d shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking out for the folks,\u201d O\u2019Reilly scolded, telling Feirstein to give more serious focus to   graduate and commuting students than to the   \u201c  types\u201d O\u2019Reilly already scorned. O\u2019Reilly makes a visible effort to be fair when it comes time to create an honor roll of   individuals. Most controversially for his readership, he comes very, very close to putting Barack Obama on the  . He writes admiringly of Obama\u2019s character, values and behavior as a parent. His grievance is that Obama failed to stage a rock concert that O\u2019Reilly had put together to benefit My Brother\u2019s Keeper, an initiative to help mentor   kids. O\u2019Reilly thinks the former president torpedoed it for political reasons. \u201cBy the way, when was the last time you heard anything about My Brother\u2019s Keeper?\u201d he asks. He could easily have looked that up. A month after the election, Obama spoke about continuing to support it. The biggest and easiest target for \u201cOld School\u201d is school itself. Colleges and universities have provided abundant fodder for a book like this to roll out stories that will shock some portions of the general population. Those who haven\u2019t kept up on the state of pronouns and gender politics have surprises in store. Anyone who remembers when the main issue surrounding college cafeteria food was edibility may be surprised at how much controversy cultural appropriation (e. g. the making of inauthentic ethnic foods) can generate. In a satirical letter from \u201cSnowflake U (formerly known as Thomas Jefferson University),\u201d somebody (probably Feirstein) crams    real examples of the extreme cosseting and cultural warfare that goes on in academia, where high tuition empowers students in ways the real world may not after graduation. Heavily footnoted (the examples check out) the letter presents a hellish vision of this warfare gone amok. And it\u2019s worth anyone\u2019s taking seriously, because O\u2019Reilly\u2019s core readership will take it as gospel. One more note about the degree of effort that went into \u201cOld School\u201d: O\u2019Reilly has let himself become the one billionth person to write the line, \u201cAs Dylan sang, the times they were  . \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563009.2684815}
