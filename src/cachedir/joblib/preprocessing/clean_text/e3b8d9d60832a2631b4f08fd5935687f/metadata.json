Whether Hollywood histories chronicle the exploits of brave gladiators, courageous soldiers or noble civilians, they almost always exalt the past in a similar cinematic register, with soaring speeches, swelling strings, sweeping montages, thrilling fights and breathless romances. When the filmmaker Jeff Nichols (\u201cTake Shelter,\u201d \u201cMidnight Special\u201d) was writing the spare, understated script for his new drama, \u201cLoving,\u201d he knew that his quiet approach was unusual, particularly for a film about a historical subject so well suited to the fall\u2019s noisy film awards circuit. In 1958, Mildred Jeter and Richard Loving, an interracial couple, were married in Washington, D. C. A short time later, back home in Virginia, the pregnant Mrs. Loving and her new husband, a bricklayer, were yanked out of their bed by police enforcing the state\u2019s Racial Integrity Act, which prohibited interracial marriage. They were arrested and ordered by a judge to dissolve their union or leave the state for 25 years. For nearly a decade, the Lovings persevered, until the 1967 Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia, struck down   laws. The Lovings\u2019 case remade American history, yet Mr. Nichols described the emotional peak of the film as, \u201ca man coming home and crying on the edge of the bed because he can\u2019t take care of his wife. \u201d He spoke in his Arkansas drawl over lunch at a downtown Manhattan restaurant: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m giving people as a climax? But it\u2019s so true and that\u2019s what\u2019s so crushing. That guy was good at one thing: going out and building a brick wall. That should have been enough. \u201d The film, starring Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga as the couple, has received some of the year\u2019s best reviews for its deliberate restraint. \u201cThere are few movies that speak to the American moment as movingly  \u2014   and with as much idealism,\u201d The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis wrote, adding that the \u201cinsistent, quotidian quiet of \u2018Loving\u2019 can feel so startling. \u201d In part, that quietness emerged after Mr. Nichols watched Nancy Buirski\u2019s intimate documentary \u201cThe Loving Story\u201d and hours of archival footage of the couple. He was struck by Mildred\u2019s polite dignity and Richard\u2019s taciturn silence. When he learned that the Lovings opted not to attend the Supreme Court on the day of the ruling but instead receive the news by phone, he said his   approach came into focus. \u201cImmediately I saw that end scene, which may or may not represent reality: Richard playing with his kids on the lawn and not saying anything,\u201d Mr. Nichols said. He was aware enough of the danger of such a contrarian choice that he called his producers at Big Beach to warn them, or at least temper their expectations. \u201cI remember saying, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to be \u2018The Help,\u2019 though \u2018The Help\u2019 made a lot of money and got nominated for a lot of Oscars,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I must have known we were taking a risk in its execution but I never thought there was another way. \u201d However, when Mr. Nichols was looking for financing, he met one investor who was not so confident. \u201cHe\u2019d shown the script to his bigwig boss who said, \u2018I just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s like a courtroom drama without the courtroom,\u2019\u201d he said. When this financier asked Mr. Nichols if he could \u201cpunch it up,\u201d Mr. Nichols said he launched into the sort of rebellious speech that is absent in his film. \u201cWhat you need to worry about right now is not whether I\u2019m going to punch up this script so you can be involved,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cWhat you need to be worried about is how I will ever come back to work with you guys ever again because that is the most simplistic, stupid response I\u2019ve heard. \u201d Peter Saraf, a Big Beach producer on the film, said that the production company knew what it was getting into. \u201cJeff\u2019s idea was to tell the story from Richard and Mildred\u2019s point of view and stick to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t commit to that and then say oh, but we need the big courtroom moment with the gavel falling. \u201d Showtime\u2019s 1996 movie \u201cMr. and Mrs. Loving,\u201d produced with Hallmark Entertainment and starring Timothy Hutton and Lela Rochon, hit more predictable beats and portrayed Richard as more charming and garrulous. But Mr. Edgerton said in a telephone interview that he was drawn to Mr. Nichols\u2019s version of the character, who was, \u201cjust shut down and emasculated and weathered by this situation,\u201d he said, and more in keeping with the man in the documentary footage. \u201cEvery year in Hollywood, true stories get made and we feel the need to renovate them, and suit them up,\u201d Mr. Edgerton said, then continued: \u201cThat\u2019s legitimate sometimes. But to make Richard more articulate or defiant or to place him in that courtroom would have negated the idea of trying to tell a true story truthfully. \u201d Or as Ms. Negga put it, when discussing her character on the phone, \u201cIt would have been really unfaithful and quite grotesque to have made her any different. \u201d Though the two stars have been nominated for Gotham Independent Film Awards, one of the many ceremonies that make up Academy Award season, they will not have the explosive reels of other, often more famous, contenders. In today\u2019s market, quiet adult dramas don\u2019t sell themselves, and reviews only go so far. So Mr. Nichols, who notes that he is \u201cnot a filmmaker who wants to operate in obscurity,\u201d and his cast have been busy selling the film in a way that might have mortified the Lovings. \u201cIf Mildred were alive now, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d want to do any junkets, any of this nonsense, any of this hoopla,\u201d said Ms. Negga, on a day in which she joked that she had done 782 interviews. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not much that would have terrified Richard more. \u201d Mr. Nichols initially objected when the film\u2019s domestic distributor, Focus Features, wanted to use the movie\u2019s few memorable lines in the trailer, including, \u201cWe may lose the small battles but win the big war. \u201d (As Mr. Edgerton said, \u201cMildred didn\u2019t talk much but when she did it was kind of worth quoting. \u201d) Then he relented. \u201cThis film doesn\u2019t speak with the histrionics of other potential award contenders, but it does fit into the frame of the award season and that\u2019s still how they\u2019re going to cut the trailer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe    is just to get people into the theater. I get it. My hope is that people will go see the movie maybe expecting one thing but maybe pleased it\u2019s something else. \u201d Mr. Nichols, polishing off his steak and fries along with his fifth of the day\u2019s seven interviews, said that in the thundering horse race of the Oscar season: \u201c\u2018Loving\u2019 is not even a horse. We are a whole other animal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562836.5041976}
