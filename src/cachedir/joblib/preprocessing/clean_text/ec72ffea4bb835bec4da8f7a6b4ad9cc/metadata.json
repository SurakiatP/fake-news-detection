Mr. Diamond was expected to marry a Jewish woman one day and raise Jewish children, a view his mother later reinforced, he said, by asking the religion of every girl he dated. Then, in November 2012, Mr. Diamond, a psychotherapist, met Ashley Mask, a doctoral student researching art museum education. At that time, Ms. Mask had started to reconnect with her Presbyterian upbringing. But after falling in love with Mr. Diamond, she agreed, should they marry, to raise their future children as Jewish. \u201cI had this na\u00efve sense that since we had the same creation story, it wouldn\u2019t be hard,\u201d said Ms. Mask, 38. But it was. As the relationship progressed, she feared abandoning important holiday traditions. At synagogue services, she said, she felt lost. She worried she would always be an outsider. Interfaith couples represent a swiftly rising demographic. Before 1960, only 19 percent of American married couples were of two different religions, according to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center. Today, it\u2019s nearly 40 percent. As a result, there are a number of new programs providing support to these couples. Given that a 2013 Pew study reported that since 2000, 72 percent of   Jews have married outside their faith, it is not surprising that many of the resources are sponsored by Jewish organizations. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep fear in the Jewish community about losing Jews, about assimilation,\u201d Mr. Diamond said. He and Ms. Mask chose to work through some of their issues by signing on with Honeymoon Israel, an organization in Buffalo that offers interfaith partners, including gay and lesbian couples, subsidized   trips to Israel. The trips cost $1, 800 a couple  \u2014   or about 20 percent of the total cost  \u2014   with the remainder picked up by a Jewish family foundation in Boston (which prefers to be unnamed) as well as by Jewish organizations in the cities where Honeymoon Israel operates. Once in Israel, the couples, who are organized into groups of 20, are encouraged to explore Jewish culture and religion. They stay in upscale hotels, lounge by the Mediterranean and visit Jewish, Christian and Muslim historic sites. They also bond with their fellow travelers, other committed couples also struggling to figure out what role religion should play in their marriages, their homes and in the lives of their future children. \u201cThe train has left the station,\u201d said Avi Rubel, a founder of Honeymoon Israel, which expects to send 360 couples this year. Mr. Rubel said the program has no political or religious agenda. \u201cWe don\u2019t care what you believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou married into our family, so you\u2019re in our family. We want couples to explore the issues on their own terms. We\u2019re not trying to dictate how anybody feels about being Jewish or about Israel. \u201d Ms. Mask and Mr. Diamond went to Israel in February, three months after their wedding, with the first group organized out of New York City. Ms. Mask was especially relieved to meet so many other Christians in her situation. \u201cIt helped address this fear that I will lose part of my identity,\u201d she said. For Mr. Diamond, the trip \u201cwas all about an   to the idea that there are many kinds of Jewish families,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019ve been exposed to most of my life: a celebration instead of a grudging acceptance. \u201d Seth Preminger, 31, and Tracy Lyons, 30, each assumed they would marry within their own faiths. Dr. Preminger, a child and adolescent psychologist in Chicago who was raised Jewish, and Dr. Lyons, a pediatrician in Chicago who was raised Catholic, met in July 2011. \u201cAs a little girl, the only thing I\u2019d ever planned for my wedding was what church I\u2019d get married in and what church music I\u2019d have,\u201d Dr. Lyons said. Neither realized how stressful planning an interfaith wedding would be. The Catholic clergyman who agreed to be an officiant wanted to marry them in a church, but that made Dr. Preminger uncomfortable. It was difficult to find a rabbi willing to be part of a joint ceremony. After much searching with Google, they found the Interfaith Family School in Chicago, run by Catholics and Jews. The school, which offers a     curriculum for children whose families consider themselves \u201cboth,\u201d and which also has a couple\u2019s counseling group, invited Dr. Lyons and Dr. Preminger to attend a student presentation. \u201cIt was really exciting for us to hear these kids talk about growing up in an environment that supports both faiths, especially as we were planning our wedding,\u201d Dr. Lyons said. \u201cThey help you explain the different traditions to extended family. \u201d Dr. Preminger said their wedding in May 2015 at the Kenmare Loft, a former factory in Chicago, raised a few eyebrows, but everyone eventually came around. Another organization, InterfaithFamily, which is overseen by rabbis, demonstrates the ripple effect of this new attitude. The nonprofit started as a website, interfaithfamily. com, to help couples plan interfaith weddings and find rabbis willing to jointly officiate ceremonies. Within the last five years, the organization has opened offices in eight cities, where the group hosts couples discussion groups, religious services and social events. \u201cCouples need safe spaces to be with others just like them,\u201d said Rabbi Ari Moffic, who heads the Chicago branch. \u201cIf you Google \u2018interfaith marriage,\u2019 you\u2019ll still find negative headlines. \u201d \u201cThe American Jewish community sees this as a public concern for Jews at large,\u201d said Helen Kim, an associate professor of sociology at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. \u201cThey want to mobilize the larger community. \u201d Dr. Kim is a     who was raised without religion and adopted Judaism after marrying Noah Leavitt, an associate dean at Whitman. The couple recently wrote a book, \u201cJewAsian: Race, Religion, and Identity for America\u2019s Newest Jews. \u201d There are no hard statistics, but Dr. Kim, who said she has noticed a rise in   marriages, has also found that Asians in the United States, who are mostly Christian, aren\u2019t concerned about \u201cdilution of the population\u201d the way Jews are. On balance, there are fewer resources for couples seeking a more equitable arrangement. Many organizations \u201csay they\u2019re friends of interfaith, but they have a tiny asterisk that says, \u2018We want you to have a Jewish home,\u2019\u201d said Eileen O\u2019Farrell Smith, the founder and director of the Interfaith Union, which holds workshops for   and   couples in Chicago. In New York, a group called Interfaith Community runs couples workshops, private counseling sessions and an elementary school curriculum that teaches the fundamentals of Judaism and Christianity for interfaith families. \u201cIn this multicultural, global, diverse world, where people are bringing many differences into a family, the old   War II paradigm, where you married the boy next door and everyone went to the same church, has completely changed,\u201d said Sheila Gordon, the group\u2019s president. Some 100 children are enrolled in Interfaith Community\u2019s educational programs, Dr. Gordon said, but the number of couples in the premarital workshops has declined, even as the percentage of interfaith marriages has increased. At least for younger couples, \u201cthe millennial ethos of fairness and respect means they don\u2019t feel threatened by entering into this kind of partnership,\u201d she said. So these couples do not think workshops are necessary. And yet, such programs can be vital for some couples, who do face challenges in joining different faiths. \u201cIt helps to know other people in the same boat,\u201d said Kamran Khan, a Muslim who joined Ms. O\u2019Farrell Smith\u2019s group with his Christian fianc\u00e9e, Corinne Atty. Their wedding, planned for September in Chicago, has caused a rift, with Mr. Khan\u2019s parents disapproving of his relationship and refusing to talk about it or to attend the wedding. But Mr. Khan wants to discuss the difficult questions with Ms. Atty now, \u201cinstead of seven years from now,\u201d he said. Being a part of the   group at Interfaith Union, he added, has given him a sense of pride about creating a different kind of family. \u201cWe can blaze a trail for others,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the forefront of something. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562671.3387752}
