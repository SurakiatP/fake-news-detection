Excessive lying is a symptom of several mental disorders.\u201d \\nClinton\u2019s mendaciousness has proven itself time and again, whether during testimony concerning her use of a personal server for business during and after her tenure as secretary of state, to claiming she had no memory of sardonically joking about assassinating Wikileaks founder Julian Assange with a drone hit. \\nBut beginning on October 28, as can be seen in the Wikipedia edit history , someone decided they\u2019d had enough with the corporate presstitutes\u2019 continued excuses made for the benefit of Clinton\u2019s continued campaign, and changed the pathological lying entry to reflect as much. \\n\u201cAdded the only person who has a proven track record for being a Pathlogical [sic] liar. References can be easily looked up on wikileaks, most media sites, and thru congressional hearings,\u201d the bold editor noted of their new addition. \\nIt would seem someone alert enough caught the edit and reverted the entry \u2014 but then another editor decided to try again the following day. \\n\u201cI added a picture of a Pathological Liar,\u201d the second editor noted. \\nAt one point, as the Huffington Post reported , someone deleted the entire page introduction and replaced it with, simply, \u201cHillary Clinton.\u201d \\nNone of these edits went over too well with the Wikipedia moderators, and despite repeated attempts by the pranksters turned truth-tellers, the entry was eventually locked from any further edits until November 3rd due to \u201cvandalism.\u201d \\nAs the Washington Times noted , these rogue editors assumed public familiarity with Clinton\u2019s less-than-honest record \u2014 none cited specific examples of actual lies. \\nHad they done so, there would have been a plethora from which to choose \u2014 perhaps most notoriously the subject of a reopened investigation by the FBI. \\nClinton, in fact, lied under oath in Congressional testimony concerning her private server when she claimed \u201cthere was nothing marked classified\u201d in emails, either \u201csent or received.\u201d \\nNot only were classified documents both sent and received over the unsecured server, but a handful were determined later to be \u201csecret.\u201d \\nWhile examples of Clinton\u2019s lies, corruption, and collusion could easily fill entire volumes of work, nonetheless, she continues to be shown in a favorable light by the very corporate media outlets found to have worked in concert with her campaign behind the scenes. \\nAlthough Wikipedia\u2019s Pathological Lying entry can\u2019t be touched for at least a few more days, the epic prank certainly made the point \u2014 Hillary Clinton might indeed be a pathological liar.
