He said his studies have suffered since the trial started, and he\u2019s not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict. The judge withheld jurors\u2019 names during the jury selection process and trial, instead referring to each by number. \\nThe jury closely followed U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown\u2019s instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the five-week trial, he said. \\nThe jury returned unanimous verdicts of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants. Each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management from carrying out their official work through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation. \\nJuror 4 noted the panel couldn\u2019t simply rely on the defendants\u2019\u201cdefining actions\u201d to convict. \\n\u201cAll 12 agreed that impeding existed, even if as an effect of the occupation,\u201d he wrote. \\n\u201cBut we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings, rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind,\u201d the Marylhurst student wrote. \u201cIt seemed this basic, high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout.\u201d \\nProsecutors had argued that the case, at its core, was about the illegal taking of another\u2019s property. The heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the 41-day takeover, in and of itself, was \u201cintimidating,\u201d and prevented officers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management from carrying out their work, they said. \\nThey argued that the alleged conspiracy began Nov. 5, when Ammon Bundy and ally Ryan Payne met with Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didn\u2019t step in and block Harney County ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond. The Hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on Jan. 4 and serve out a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for arson on federal land. \\nDefense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mix-up the \u201ceffect\u201d of the occupation \u2013 which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs \u2013 from the \u201cintent\u201d of the occupiers. \\nFive of the seven defendants, including Ammon Bundy, testified. Many said that they were there to protest in support of the Hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change. \\nThe defense lawyers\u2019 arguments, coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence, resonated with jurors, Juror 4 noted. \\n\u201cInference, while possibly compelling, proved to be insulting or inadequate to 12 diversely situated people as a means to convict,\u201d the juror wrote. \u201cThe air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us, nor was it warranted given their burden of proof.\u201d \\nJuror 4 plainly stated that fellow Juror 11, during the initial round of deliberations, \u201chad zero business being on this jury in the first place.\u201d \\nJuror 11 had worked for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management as a ranch tech and firefighter \u201cmore than 20 years ago,\u201d he had said during jury selection. Asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts, he said, \u201cNot really.\u201d \\nJuror 4 explained why he didn\u2019t alert the court immediately after he had heard Juror 11, on day one of deliberations reportedly say, \u201cI am very biased.\u201d \\nIt wasn\u2019t until the fourth day into deliberations that Juror 4 sent a note to the court, asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was \u201cvery biased\u201d could be an impartial judge. The court, flummoxed by the development, a day later dismissed Juror 11 for \u201cgood cause,\u201d after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal. At the time, parties to the case weren\u2019t sure which way Juror 11\u2019s alleged bias fell. \\nJuror 4 said he \u201cresisted the impulse\u201d to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself. \\nIn his email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Juror 4, for the first time, also contended that Juror 11 \u201cviolated\u201d the judge\u2019s explicit orders \u201cby hearkening to \u2018evidence\u2019 that was never admitted in this case, refused to consider the defendant\u2019s state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions.'\u201d \\nJuror 4 said, though, he wishes that he \u201chad sent the letter on day one, since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us.\u201d \\nThe Maryville business student said he is \u201cbaffled\u201d by what he described as observers\u2019\u201cflippant sentiments\u201d in the wake of the jury\u2019s acquittals. \\n\u201cDon\u2019t they know that \u2018not guilty\u2019 does not mean innocent?\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was not lost on us that our verdict(s) might inspire future actions that are regrettable, but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us.\u201d \\nThe jury, he said, met with Judge Brown after the verdicts were announced and after the U.S. Marshals\u2019 physical confrontation and arrest of Bundy lawyer Marcus Mumford. \\nHe said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the \u201cconspiracy charge.\u201d He said he learned that a potential alternate charge, such as criminal trespass, wouldn\u2019t have brought as significant a penalty. \\nThe charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation, threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison. \\n\u201cWe all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this \u2018conspiracy\u2019 charge seemed the best possible option,\u201d Juror 4 said. \\n\u2014 Maxine Bernstein\""}, "time": 1742564300.1928735}
