According to multiple sources in the independent media \u2014 now the only remaining \u201cfree press\u201d in America \u2014 FBI director James Comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server by \u201clivid\u201d FBI agents who threatened to go public if Comey didn\u2019t act. \\nJames Comey, long since suspected to be a Clinton operative who deliberately allowed Hillary Clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations, now finds himself with his back against the wall. If he releases the evidence against Hillary Clinton already possessed by the FBI, he will face the wrath of Obama, the Clintons, the corrupt Loretta Lynch (DOJ) and the entire leftist media. If he once again gives Hillary Clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes, he then faces a mutiny inside the FBI which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media. FBI agents under Comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames \\nAgents inside the FBI, in other words, refuse to allow James Comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the \u201cClinton crime family.\u201d Via the Daily Mail UK : \\nJames Comey\u2019s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \\nThis dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the Oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through James Comey\u2019s reputation, as he is the FBI official who reportedly ordered the execution of Robert \u201cLaVoy\u201d Finicum, whose suspected execution by FBI agents was caught on tape . \\nBecause the Oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury, it means FBI head James Comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man . \\nUnder Comey \u2014 and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the FBI \u2014 Comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent Americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free. For many FBI agents who have spent their entire careers serving the FBI as honest, dedicated federal agents, the thought of allowing James Comey to single-handedly commit political arson and burn down the FBI\u2019s hard-won reputation is just too much to bear. \\nResignations are beginning to pile up on Comey\u2019s desk as livid FBI agents head for the exits\u2026 \\nVia the Daily Mail: \\n\u201cThe atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\u201d said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades\u2026 [Comey] told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. \\n\u201cAnd while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the short-term, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence. As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post,\u201d adds Zero Hedge . \u201cAt a bare minimum, in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation, we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillary\u2019s email server isn\u2019t warranted.\u201d James Comey is an arsonist, and he\u2019s going to burn the FBI to the ground unless his agents mutiny \\nThe upshot of all this is that James Comey is an arsonist. If his own agents don\u2019t force him to apply the law to the Clinton investigations, Comey will burn the agency to the ground, leaving its reputation in ashes. And that, sadly, will make the world a very dangerous place for all the FBI agents in the field, because everyday Americans would begin to see them all as corrupt, lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in Washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kind. \\nThe truth is that most FBI agents are hard working, professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists, financial fraudsters, kidnappers, murderers and other dangerous criminals. Yet if James Comey doesn\u2019t defend the FBI\u2019s reputation by indicting Hillary Clinton , he will likely be placing FBI field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in D.C. \\nComey, in other words, is more dangerous to the entire FBI than any other single person in Washington right now. If he doesn\u2019t find his moral compass and guide the FBI through this crisis with law and order intact, he\u2019s going to go down in history (and in flames) as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the FBI and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populace. \\nNo doubt, he\u2019ll get an extra bonus from Loretta Lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in America and announce that Hillary won\u2019t be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else. Remember: If Comey gives Hillary Clinton a free pass, he demonstrates to all Americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in Washington . And if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes, then practically speaking, why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all? James Comey: If you want to salvage the FBI\u2019s reputation, announce a recommendation for the indictment of both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch \\nIf there\u2019s one thing abundantly clear in all this, it\u2019s that both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch should be behind bars . Clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss. Lynch is a third-rate attorney who was tossed into the DOJ solely because of her gender and skin color, not her credentials. And neither one respects the laws of America, of course. Both are deeply corrupt. \\nIf the FBI hopes to have any reputation remaining after the Hillary Clinton campaign implodes either before or on November 8th, Comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows Hillary Clinton had CLEAR INTENT to violate national security laws , among other serious crimes. \\nAll Comey would have to say is something like, \u201cIn the view of the FBI, Hillary Clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as Commander in Chief, and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security\u2026\u201d and so on. With a single sentence, Comey could reinvigorate the FBI and position himself as an historic American hero. \\nRight now, I\u2019d imagine the Clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to James Comey\u2019s home address, along with notes that say something like, \u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d Let\u2019s watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be intimidated.
