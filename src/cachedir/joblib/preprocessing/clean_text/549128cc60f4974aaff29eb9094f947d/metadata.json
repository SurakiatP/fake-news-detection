[SiriusXM host Alex Marlow contended that the mainstream media\u2019s irresponsible use of terms like \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d for speakers who are not of the Left has laid the groundwork for violence against them.  \u201cIt is the rise of a genuinely violent fascist movement,\u201d Coulter said of these   gangs. \u201cIt would be as if the Nazis went around complaining about how the Jews were attacking them and oppressing them. That\u2019s basically what we have going on now. \u201d She recalled how violent protesters shut down a Trump rally in Chicago during the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cIt was amazing to me how many families with kids, and wives, and daughters, they continued to go out to see Trump. It is like my college speeches, something I\u2019ve been doing for a long time. You know, you\u2019ll have 20 speeches that are fine, and then suddenly, BAM! the violent mobs show up. You never know when it\u2019s going to happen, so you have to be prepared all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Americans still did come out. I think that was intended to reduce Trump\u2019s crowds, and make it look like he was the one creating the violence. All of this, just for someone who says, \u2018We have to take care of Americans first.\u2019 That\u2019s what they\u2019re so upset about, Alex,\u201d Coulter declared, returning to an earlier point about how the U. S. Congress is attempting to cut back on the cost of major programs for Americans, such as Social Security and Medicare, at the same time   advocates insist on importing even more dependents. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford that. We can\u2019t afford this. We have to raise the retirement age. No, stop! We gave at the office!\u201d she exclaimed. Coulter agreed wholeheartedly with President Trump\u2019s threat to \u201cwithdraw all federal funding from Berkeley\u201d if the college administration refuses to deal with violence. \u201cThis is a genuine threat to democracy when people can\u2019t engage in the first of the Bill of Rights, the very first one that\u2019s mentioned: freedom of speech,\u201d she warned. \u201cThis has been a burgeoning movement, particularly on our college campuses, for a long time. \u201d  \u201cIn a calm, reflective moment, I think he should do the same thing with any colleges that have speech codes or need special \u2018free speech zones\u2019 where students   professors are disciplined for engaging in First Amendment speech,\u201d she advised.  \u201cThis has absolutely been done before,\u201d she noted. \u201cThe IRS has been used to say, \u2018Sorry. If you\u2019re collecting student aid, you can\u2019t attend these colleges. We\u2019re not sending any student aid to these colleges who don\u2019t abide by  \u2026    \u2019  \u2014   and those were often kind of silly \u2018principles\u2019 being enforced, like Bob Jones University, that\u2019s sort of a very hardcore fundamentalist Christian college. I\u2019m a Christian. It has some beliefs  \u2014   or it used to I don\u2019t know if they still do  \u2014   but one was from the Tower of Babel. They wouldn\u2019t allow interracial dating. \u201d  \u201cThey had blacks, they had whites, and it was mostly a    country back then  \u2014   in fact, scholarships for black students  \u2014   but whites couldn\u2019t date black students. Blacks couldn\u2019t date white students,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I ought to add, because I looked this up at the time, there was very little dating of any sort. If you went on a date at Bob Jones, you had to have a chaperone with you. Anyway, there was no racial animus to this it hit both races equally. \u201d  \u201cBut for that, the IRS came down like a ton of bricks on Bob Jones University. No federal aid through student scholarships, as I recall. A student who had student aid could not attend that college. And now, we have a genuine fascist, violent fascist, movement rising up, and there\u2019s not only no punishment, but taxpayers are paying for this? Oh, no, no, no. Second to immigration, the next biggest problem in this country is the universities and public schools,\u201d she said. Coulter said this climate of hatred and violent repression of dissent comes from the university administrations.  \u201cThese are not spontaneous movements,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cI described in my book Demonic on groupthink and mob behavior, that these are particularly lickspittle students that want to please the professor. And they know damned well their professors are opposed to everything Ann Coulter says and everything Milo says. It\u2019s just like presenting a polished apple to the teacher. \u2018Oh, teacher, here: I brought you a gift today! I went and protested Ann Coulter! \u2019\u201d \u201cAt the risk of being snobbish, but telling you what the truth is, it doesn\u2019t tend to happen at the Ivy League schools,\u201d she observed. \u201cBerkeley is weird.   \u2026     The worst ones are the Jesuit colleges and the community colleges. I mean, at Harvard and Yale  \u2014   and I\u2019ve spoken at both places many times  \u2014   Wellesley, Smith, my own alma mater Cornell, the kids are too  \u2014   they want to challenge you intellectually. They\u2019d be embarrassed to throw something. \u201d  \u201cThough I do think there is a new movement kind of sweeping through here,\u201d she added, \u201cat some of these schools, we\u2019d be organized. We\u2019d be ready to go. I\u2019d give the speech. They could stand up at the mics. I\u2019d take questions until they had collapsed from exhaustion. And usually at the tougher schools to get into, that\u2019s how they want to be. They want to ask you a question and outsmart you. It\u2019s when it is a    who doesn\u2019t have the power of speech or logic, and just throws food  \u2014   so it would tend to be the lesser colleges. \u201d  \u201cThe other thing is, when we would be prepared and have college Republicans and large men prepared to throw out any hecklers, sometimes the members of the administration would stop people  \u2014   our people, who had rented the room had paid for me to come speak. Someone comes to disrupt and start heckling, they try to remove the heckler, and an administrator  \u2014   this happened at Syracuse University  \u2014   some dean of students stepped forward and said, \u2018You can\u2019t remove the heckler because you\u2019re interfering with his free speech rights! \u2019\u201d Coulter said with astonishment.
