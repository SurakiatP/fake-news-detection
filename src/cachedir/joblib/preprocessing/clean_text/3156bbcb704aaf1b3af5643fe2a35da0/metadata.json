Like, forever?\u201d says the headline of Cillizza\u2019s piece.   Weiner pled guilty Friday to a charge of sending obscene material to a minor. The    girl alleged that he sent her nude photos, discussed his \u201crape fantasies,\u201d and encouraged her to engage in sexually explicit conduct. Weiner will have to register as a sex offender and could face jail time. On the same day, his wife and top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin reportedly filed for divorce.  The plea appears to mark the end of the saga commonly known as \u201cWeinergate,\u201d which began in 2011 when the late Andrew Breitbart reported that Weiner  \u2014   then a New York congressman  \u2014   had been sending explicit pictures of himself to women online. Breitbart was mocked and derided by mainstream media commentators, some of whom initially called on outlets to ignore his reporting. Weiner\u2019s \u201csexting\u201d led to his resignation from Congress and later torpedoed a 2013 New York mayoral comeback run when similar messages emerged. In 2016 yet more images emerged, as well as the allegation he had sent messages to the minor. The FBI opened a probe into Weiner\u2019s behavior and in the course of that investigation discovered emails on his laptop sent to Weiner by Abedin that originated from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. This, in turn, led   Director James Comey to announce in a letter that the agency was revisiting the probe into Clinton\u2019s homebrew server on Oct. 28, throwing her presidential campaign into turmoil.  Clinton has dubiously blamed that letter, along with alleged Russian interference, for her election defeat. If one believes Clinton\u2019s assertion, it makes the   \u201cWeinergate\u201d one of the most important political scandals in modern history. Yet, Cillizza says, on the same day Weiner pled guilty, that it is time for everyone to move on and never talk about the disgraced Democrat again. Cillizza\u2019s argument centers on the claim that Weiner has ultimately always sought attention. Here\u2019s the thing: We know that Weiner craves attention  \u2014   even the negative kind. What else would explain his decision to allow documentary cameras into his   trainwreck mayoral campaign?  Cillizza says it\u2019s time to refuse him that attention. Now that Weiner is \u201cirrelevant politically,\u201d it\u2019s time to stop. Let\u2019s not get back on that ride. No matter what he says or how much remorse he expresses, it\u2019s clear that attention fuels Weiner. It\u2019s his lifeblood. So let\u2019s not give it to him. The legal proceedings are now closed. Weiner is totally irrelevant politically. His wife, who remains a major player in Hillary Clinton\u2019s orbit, has filed for divorce, according to CNN\u2019s Dan Merica. There\u2019s literally no reason to write or talk about Anthony Weiner anymore. It isn\u2019t the first time Cillizza has sought to end discussion on a difficult political subject for Democrats. Writing for The Washington Post in 2016, Cillizza wrote a piece, \u201cCan we just stop talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health now?\u201d which complained about \u201cwacky theories that emerge out of the fever swamps on the very fringe of the conservative movement. \u201d Less than a week later, at a Sept. 11 memorial, Clinton collapsed and was pictured being dragged into a van by aides. The same day, Cillizza wrote a new hot take: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign. \u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
