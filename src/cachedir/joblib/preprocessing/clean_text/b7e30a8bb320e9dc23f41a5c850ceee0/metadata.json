Pirro said Comey is \u201caddicted to drama and center stage,\u201d adding that his downfall was his \u201chubris. \u201d \u201c[O]ne thing never leaked [was] that Donald Trump was never under investigation,\u201d Pirro stated. \u201cWhy refuse to say the president is not under investigation? You say because maybe one day he will be? That\u2019s your response? Maybe one day Martians will take a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Could it be, Jim that being a team player is not in your DNA, that only center stage will do for you? And you\u2019re pretty damn wily when asked if an FBI agent has a duty to report a crime. \u201d She went on to say, \u201cJim, you are a political operative, you always have been. One that\u2019s addicted to drama and center stage. But, like the main character in all Greek tragedies, your downfall is a consequence of a tragic fall, a major weakness your hubris. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742564520.7812467}
