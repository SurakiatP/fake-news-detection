C.  \u2014   At a community college turned hurricane shelter, Frednesa Pope, 37, wondered on Wednesday if the floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew, which are expected to crest here on Friday, would force her and her family out of an apartment they could barely afford. This week, Gregory   58, who lives on a fixed income and was taking shelter from the flooding in Fair Bluff, N. C. to the southwest, knew that the truck he had just bought was flooded. And over the weekend, Ethel and Austin Chavis of Lumberton, N. C. ripped the carpets out of their flooded home and wondered how much it would cost to make things right again and where they would find the money. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find some assistance,\u201d Ms. Chavis, 66, said as she looked at the floorboards buckling around her, \u201cbecause we definitely need it. \u201d Hurricane Matthew spawned ferocious wind and rain across North Carolina, dumping more than a foot of water in parts of the state and touching off a creeping disaster that had killed 22 people in the state by Thursday. Day after day, in town after town, swollen rivers have transformed thoroughfares into canals and homes into sodden islands, in some cases with only the roof or the windows peeking above the water. And the water has risen in some of the state\u2019s poorest areas, upending the lives of many already living on the financial edge. \u201cThe poorest of the poor in North Carolina are the ones who are being hurt the most by these floods,\u201d Gov. Pat McCrory said at an otherwise upbeat news conference on Thursday. \u201cThese people have nothing,\u201d he added, urging people to donate to a state disaster fund. By Thursday, $2. 6 million in aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been disbursed and 14, 000 people had applied for aid. Individual assistance from FEMA, which has averaged about $2, 000 a family in recent years, is designed to help with immediate needs  \u2014   like temporary rental housing, repairs not covered by insurance, and the replacement of critical personal items  \u2014   but those grants are somewhat limited. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to make survivors whole again,\u201d said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a life vest, rather than a lifeboat. \u201d Mr. McCrory\u2019s administration said that disaster unemployment assistance, which can cover wages lost because of a storm, would be available in 20 counties. But even when state and federal officials work to disburse flood aid, experts said, it is often harder for families living on the margins to bounce back. The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina estimated that 356, 000 people in the 21 counties it was monitoring for storm and flood effects did not have access to enough healthy food, even before the floods. Floodwaters have left downtown Lumberton, a city where a third of residents live in poverty, underwater. They crested at more than a foot above the record on Tuesday in Goldsboro, N. C. where the poverty rate is 25 percent. And in Kinston, residents waited in shelters for the Neuse River to crest on Friday. \u201cSometimes, you just have to think that God is piling on with these storms,\u201d said Gene Nichol, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who researches poverty. Poverty in the region, he said, goes back to the time of slavery, but he added that the state\u2019s   Legislature had further eroded the social safety net by winnowing unemployment benefits, cutting the state\u2019s   tax credit and largely refusing to expand Medicaid. \u201cThere are challenging legacies,\u201d Professor Nichol said. \u201cThe want of investment and opportunity in eastern North Carolina is made only more difficult by tragedies like this. \u201d Some natural disasters, like tornadoes, seem genuinely indiscriminate, as likely to damage wealthy neighborhoods as to damage poor ones. But in Kinston, the pain from the floods  \u2014   which were preceded by days of warning  \u2014   seem to a certain extent linked to economics. Those with cars have been able to take their valuables, or even their furniture, and leave town for hotel rooms or to stay with family. Those who earn more are more likely to have paid time off, and to have savings to cushion the financial blow from a storm. And floods often play out in   areas where the residents are disproportionately poor. The shelter here at Lenoir Community College, which by Thursday had become a temporary home for about 200 people, was full of residents with no money to spare  \u2014   even among those working full time  \u2014   and a sense of dread as the water rose. Ms. Pope, a cabinet sprayer in a local plant, evacuated her home in Kinston this week when fire officials told her it was almost certain to flood when the river crested. \u201cI put my clothes up as high as I could,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a car I wasn\u2019t able to get a   like everyone else in the neighborhood. I live from paycheck to paycheck. \u201d Ms. Pope\u2019s apartment had flooded during the devastation from Hurricane Floyd in 1999, and her landlord had told her it was unlikely to withstand a second event that forecasters said could be even worse. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start all the way back over,\u201d said Ms. Pope, who already pays her $400 rent in two installments so she can pay the bills in the middle of the month. \u201cEverything in there, it\u2019s paid for. If it floods, I\u2019m through. \u201d Wesley Turner, 71, a Vietnam veteran who retired from a rubber stopper plant in town, said his home seemed close to flooding even before the river\u2019s crest. \u201cI worked for years and years to make money for a   which I thought would be home for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford another trailer. I can\u2019t afford a pup tent. \u201d Inside the shelter, LaVonda Hamilton, 42, was wondering whether she would need to take on a     loan to make ends meet. She had been unable to get to her job as an account specialist at an outsourcing firm near the coast for a week. \u201cI have two kids, you know, in high school,\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. \u201cIt sets you back. \u201d And in Lumberton, where floodwaters were just beginning to recede, Billie Thompson, 36, returned to her home to take stock of what she had lost  \u2014   \u201cIt\u2019s in a shamble right now,\u201d she said  \u2014   and scrambled to get to her job at the Butterball factory for the first time since last week. A single mother, Ms. Thompson tried to figure out how to replace ruined items, like school clothes that she bought in August for her daughter. \u201cMy daughter has started planning a birthday party next month I might have to cancel that,\u201d Ms. Thompson said, adding, \u201cShe needs clothes more than she needs the party. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564443.612982}
