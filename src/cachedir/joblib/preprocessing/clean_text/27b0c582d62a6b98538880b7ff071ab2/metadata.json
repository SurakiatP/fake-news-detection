Bush\u2019s speech on September 11, 2002, the New York Times reported at the time, White House officials confirmed the Bush administration had already been \u201c [planning its Iraq strategy] long before President Bush\u2019s vacation in Texas \u201d in August of that same year. \\nThe strategy was to persuade the public and Congress that the United States and its allies should confront the \u201cthreat from Saddam Hussein .\u201d \\nThe now infamous 9/11 anniversary speech \u2014 and the speech before the United Nations following the anniversary remarks \u2014 both stressed the importance of \u201c [ridding] the world of terror. \u201d But before speaking to the United Nations, Bush made the clearest case for war. \\nClaiming \u201c our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions ,\u201d Bush presented his case against Iraq, claiming Hussein had only \u201c contempt for the United Nations \u2026 [claiming] it had no biological weapons. \u201d \\nMaking the case that Iraq had a clandestine \u201c weapons program \u2026 producing tens of thousands of litres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with Scud warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks ,\u201d Bush and his administration sold the invasion of Iraq with lies . How the Bush Administration and the Media Sold the Iraq War \\nIn 2003, Bush\u2019s secretary of state, Colin Powell, laid out Bush\u2019s rationale for war in Iraq, saying Iraq had been given several chances to \u201ccomply\u201d with U.N. resolutions regarding the country\u2019s possession of weapons of mass destruction. \\nHe added that America had \u201cproof\u201d the Hussein regime had \u201cevacuated\u201d \u2014 not destroyed \u2014 its weapons, adding that the U.S. government had \u201c satellite photos that indicate[d] that banned materials [had] recently been moved from a number of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities. \u201d But what the media then failed to dig into was how the evidence presented by Powell had been introduced in a way that helped the administration make the case for war, even as Powell himself knew \u2014 or at least seemed to know \u2014 that there was a possibility they were putting \u201c half a million troops in Iraq and march[ing] from one end of the country to the other [to] find nothing .\u201d \\nOn the day Powell delivered his speech, then-CIA operations officer Valerie Plame Wilson noticed his claims \u201c simply did not match the intelligence which she had worked on daily for months .\u201d Sign up for the free Anti-Media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive \\nMaking use of claims made by a discredited Iraqi defector code-named \u201cCurveball,\u201d Powell ignored the fact the CIA had deemed the source a \u201cfabricator\u201d and used the source\u2019s shaky evidence to convince the media, as well as other global powers, they should all go along with the U.S. plan. \\nAt the time, the New York Times , which had previously openly reported that the Bush administration had been planning on \u201cselling\u201d the Iraq war using the best marketing strategies at hand, published a number of opinion pieces reinforcing the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. After reports proved Bush\u2019s rationale for war had been debunked, the prestigious publication had to retract . \\nThe late Michael Ratner, an attorney who served as the president emeritus of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, once accused the \u201cliberal media,\u201d along with the government, of selling the Iraq war not by simply claiming Hussein had WMDs, but also \u201c by claiming that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein, who led Iraq at the time, and al-Qaeda .\u201d \\nBy referring to al-Qaeda repeatedly during his U.N. speech , Powell spoke to people\u2019s fears. That was a logical strategy considering the country had been healing from the 9/11 terror attacks. But the media failed to question this link, which had been established via a source who had been tortured . \\nIbn al-Sheikh al-Libi was a high-value CIA detainee who \u201c provided bogus information \u201d as he was waterboarded. As Ratner pointed out , anyone \u201c would have said anything to stop being waterboarded .\u201d \\nThen-Vice President Dick Cheney and other members of the Bush administration had pressured the CIA to find a way to connect Iraq and al-Qaeda, an effort that ultimately helped boost the case for war before the international community. \\nWhat the White House wanted finally materialized when officials tortured al-Libi. \\nThe man who was waterboarded into providing phony info on the al-Qaeda link to Iraq later died in a Libyan prison of an apparent suicide. Like Iraq, the Media Now Sells the Political Class\u2019 Lies on Russia, Syria \\nWhen Bush was trying to sell the Iraq war to Congress, Hillary Clinton, then a New York senator, voted in favor of authorizing his administration to go into Iraq, basing her decision \u201c as much on advice from her husband\u2019s advisers as from Bush administration officials .\u201d \\nWhile she now claims her vote was a mistake, she proved herself to be consistently pro-intervention as secretary of state under President Barack Obama and as a presidential candidate, having gone so far as to suggest that going against Russia in Syria by enacting a no-fly zone could \u201c save lives and hasten the end of the conflict .\u201d Privately, however, she gave a speech to Goldman Sachs in which she acknowledged establishing a no-fly zone is Syria would kill \u201ca lot\u201d of Syrian civilians. \\nEver since the Arab Spring, the Obama administration has beat the war drums against Russia by pushing for more U.S. presence in Syria via official and unofficial means . Now, his choice for president is pushing the story that Russia \u2014 a.k.a. Syria\u2019s partner in its war against Islamist rebels and ISIS terrorists \u2014 is illegally attempting to exert influence over the U.S. election \u2014 and the media embraces the move, publishing story after story claiming officials know the Kremlin was behind the cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and the election systems in Arizona and Illinois. Without evidence, however, these reports are toothless but still influential enough to make many Americans believe Russia is, indeed, a threat . \\nWhile Russia\u2019s role in Syria isn\u2019t as humanitarian as its officials would like us to believe, its proximity to Syria plays an important role in its own affairs, making its involvement in the conflict more logical than America\u2019s. \\nLike al-Qaeda, ISIS fighters have repeatedly used U.S. intervention in the Middle East to recruit more fighters . And like what happened prior to the Iraq war, the U.S. government \u2014 and the Fourth Estate \u2014 are working tirelessly to sell the public on yet another unjustified war. \\nLuckily, Americans aren\u2019t as gullible in 2016 as they were in 2003, as many now keep up with the news by seeking more independent channels. \\nBut will the next administration bother to ask us our opinion before launching into another war? \\nThis article ( Remember When the Media Sold Us the Iraq WMD Lies?
