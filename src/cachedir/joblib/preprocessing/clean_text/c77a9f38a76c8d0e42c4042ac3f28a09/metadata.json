[\u201cThe arrogance, the violence of language, the disrespect and the inhuman contempt for Benedict XVI are diabolical and cover the Church with a mantle of sadness and shame,\u201d Cardinal Sarah said.  \u201cThese people demolish the Church and its profound nature,\u201d he added. Critics of Benedict XVI have complained that the former Pontiff meddled in Church affairs by contributing the afterword to the German edition of the book, in which Benedict praises Cardinal Sarah and thanks Pope Francis for appointing the African prelate to his current post as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship. In his afterword to Cardinal Sarah\u2019s book, The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise, Benedict XVI wrote that the liturgy is in \u201cgood hands\u201d with the Guinean cardinal, while also praising Sarah for his prayer life. Sarah, Benedict writes, speaks \u201cout of the depths of silence with the Lord, out of his interior union with him, and thus really has something to say to each one of us. \u201d \u201cWe should be grateful to Pope Francis for appointing such a spiritual teacher as head of the congregation that is responsible for the celebration of the liturgy in the Church,\u201d Benedict writes. The last line of the afterword reads, \u201cWith Cardinal Sarah, a master of silence and of interior prayer, the liturgy is in good hands. \u201d Critics were quick to accuse the former pope of interfering in Church politics and trying to undermine Pope Francis. One, the Italian liturgist Andrea Grillo, a longtime detractor of Pope Benedict, claims that the former pope has behaved in a \u201cscandalous way\u201d by writing the afterword in praise of Cardinal Sarah and his book, accusing him of \u201cclericalism\u201d and \u201chypocrisy. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s as if Ratzinger suddenly renounced his renunciation and wishes to influence the decisions of his successor,\u201d Grillo declared. Throughout his diatribe, Grillo refuses to call Benedict by his correct title, but insists on referring to him simply as \u201cRatzinger\u201d or \u201cemeritus bishop. \u201d Cardinal Sarah\u2019s sharp reaction to Benedict\u2019s critics echoes prior statements from the prelate, who never minces words. At a Washington prayer breakfast in May, 2016, the Vatican cardinal denounced   marriage, transgender bathroom laws, and attacks on the family as \u201cdemonic. \u201d In his powerful address, Sarah said that these are \u201cportentous times\u201d for the Church and for the world, while slamming gender theory as \u201cideological colonization\u201d and decrying the \u201cinsidious\u201d dismantling of religious freedom in the United States. Regarding   marriage, Sarah said that what is at stake is not an ideological war about \u201cabstract ideas\u201d but rather the protection of \u201courselves, children, and future generations from a demonic ideology that says children do not need mothers and fathers. \u201d This earned the Guinean cardinal the enduring hostility of gay activists, one of whom has referred to him as \u201cone of the shrillest voices against \u2018gender ideology,\u2019   marriage, abortion, contraception and other   attacks on the family. \u201d The African prelate, who has been dubbed \u201ca standard bearer for Catholic orthodoxy,\u201d was the world\u2019s youngest bishop in 1979, when Pope John Paul II summoned him to don the miter at only 34 years of age. He is now one of the most important cardinals in the Church, as the prefect of the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship, and his name often comes up on the short list of \u201cpapabili\u201d \u2014  or papal candidates to eventually succeed Pope Francis.
