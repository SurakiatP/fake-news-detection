He disparaged journalists and invited angry chants from the crowd, grinning broadly at calls of \u201clock her up\u201d and \u201cbuild the wall. \u201d He ridiculed the government\u2019s leaders as stupid and dishonest failures. In his first major address since winning the presidency three weeks ago, Donald J. Trump soaked up the adulation of thousands of his supporters at a   rally here, unabashedly gloating about the \u201cgreat\u201d victory he had secured. If there were any question about whether his evolution to    would temper his presentation or moderate his tone, the rally offered a forceful answer: Not a chance. Kicking off what was billed as a \u201cthank you\u201d tour, Mr. Trump was incendiary and prideful, hopeful and indicting, vengeful and determined. His staff said the rally was the first of several he will hold before his inauguration next month. His tour is an unusual move for a   most of whom do not return so quickly to the campaign trail, especially while key cabinet positions remain unfilled. Mr. Trump, who has been mostly cloistered in Trump Tower as he tries to assemble a government, was said to be eager to reconnect with voters. Connect he did, whipping the partially filled arena into a frenzy by reprising the   rhetoric from his    campaign. He repeated pledges to suspend immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, repeal the Affordable Care Act, lower taxes, end unfair trade and \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of corruption. But while he at times stuck to the script on his teleprompter, Mr. Trump came alive when he veered from it to talk about himself and demean those who had opposed him. \u201cWe had a lot of fun fighting Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said, smiling knowingly as the crowd chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d but offering no indication that he intended to do so. In the middle of a scripted part of the speech about lower taxes for businesses, he shifted abruptly to note the magnitude of his wins. \u201cHow about North Carolina  \u2014   how well did we do in North Carolina? Remember when they said he cannot win North Carolina?\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding a moment later: \u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t break the blue wall, right? We didn\u2019t break it, we shattered that sucker. We shattered it, man. That poor wall is busted up. \u201d And he reserved special bile for the \u201cextremely dishonest press,\u201d provoking boos as he lashed out  \u2014   without naming her  \u2014   at a network anchor who he said had cried on television on election night when she realized he was going to win the presidency. \u201cYou know what she doesn\u2019t understand, things are going to be much better now,\u201d he said. \u201cI love this stuff,\u201d he said after a nearly   discussion of his electoral prowess and his critique of the news media. \u201cShould I go on with this for just a little bit longer? I love it. \u201d He did go on, shifting back and forth between his prepared remarks and his extemporaneous walk down the memory lane of victory. During the prepared parts of the speech, Mr. Trump seemed eager to reach out to the people who had opposed his candidacy. He said the new government would \u201cseek a truly inclusive society,\u201d and he proclaimed that \u201cwe condemn bigotry and hatred in all of its forms. \u201d On the economy, he vowed to \u201creverse the stagnation and usher in a period of prosperity and growth,\u201d even as he promised to overcome the partisan gridlock that has led to stalemate in Congress during much of the past eight years. \u201cWe\u2019ll compete in the world, we want to compete in the world, but we\u2019re going to compete in the world where it\u2019s a   road, not a   road,\u201d Mr. Trump vowed. \u201cThe advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven\u2019t for many, many years. \u201d Speaking in Ohio just days after a Somali refugee wounded several people with a knife at Ohio State University, Mr. Trump essentially attributed the attack to programs to admit refugees \u201cstupidly created by our very stupid politicians. \u201d \u201cWe will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed,\u201d he said, echoing some of his most effective campaign rhetoric. But he sometimes veered from his prepared remarks in the middle of a sentence. A discussion of what his administration would do if a company wanted to move jobs overseas reminded him again of his victories. And that discussion of winning several states led directly into a diatribe against reporters, who he said had never seen his victories coming. Then, when he mentioned Utah, he railed against a   candidate who before Election Day had seemed poised to do well. \u201cRemember when they said Donald Trump is going to lose to some guy I\u2019ve never even heard of?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThe people of Utah were amazing, and we trounced them. Hillary came in second, and that guy came in third. What the hell was he trying to prove?\u201d Mr. Trump offered both an olive branch and a warning to Democrats in Washington, saying he believed that \u201cthey want to get together\u201d but reminded them that they had lost \u201cbecause the people are angry. \u201d He delivered his promise through the prism of a   federal government. \u201cOur victory was so great, we have the House, we have the Senate,\u201d Mr. Trump said, his last words drowned out with cheers. He smiled and paused, before offering some tepid reassurance that \u201cwe want to get them on board. \u201d Mr. Trump opened his rally with a familiar trope: gawking at the crowd and lamenting the difficulty that supporters were having traveling to the arena. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t know what came with this position, and I didn\u2019t know that they closed down the roads around the stadium for an hour and a half,\u201d he said, thanking the crowd \u201cfor being so patient. \u201d Before he spoke, a familiar scene developed at the arena, with hundreds of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters lined up, some clad in red shirts handing out \u201c \u201d signs. The prerally soundtrack, heavy on Elton John and the Rolling Stones, rotated through the songs heard during the campaign. The main difference this time: the lectern at center stage, which now had a big, bold \u201cUSA\u201d where the name \u201cTRUMP\u201d used to be. As   Mr. Trump has at times seemed frustrated by criticism of his business conflicts and his loss by more than two million ballots in the popular vote. But at the rally, Mr. Trump was once again in good spirits, feeding off the fervor in the crowd. He had just come from Indianapolis, where he celebrated his involvement in Carrier\u2019s decision to keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in Indiana. Mr. Trump seemed to relish toying with the news media, at one point announcing that he had chosen James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, to be his secretary of defense  \u2014   even though his spokesman had said four hours earlier that no decision had been made. \u201cI gave up a little secret,\u201d Mr. Trump said, urging the crowd not to \u201clet it out of this room. \u201d But nothing seemed to fire up the   as much as recalling his victories in the campaign, each made so much sweeter, he repeatedly said, because the media and his opponents had never seen them coming. \u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe bottom line is, we won. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564110.9857998}
