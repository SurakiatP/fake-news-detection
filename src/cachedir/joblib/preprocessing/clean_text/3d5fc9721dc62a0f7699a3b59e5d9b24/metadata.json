November 4, 2016 Robert Spencer \\nThe mainstream media in Western Europe and North America isn\u2019t even pretending to be an objective news source anymore; instead, \u201cjournalists\u201d are working openly to quell what looks increasingly, on both sides of the Atlantic, like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the self-appointed political and media aristocracy that seems hell-bent on driving Western civilization over the cliff. And so it\u2019s time for another round of their Two-Minutes Hate against Dutch politician and freedom fighter Geert Wilders. \\nWilders has yet again gone on trial in the Netherlands for \u201chate speech,\u201d and this time the case against him is especially flimsy: as Europe is roiled by the criminal activity of Muslim migrants, he is being accused of \u201chate speech\u201d for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from Morocco (from which most of the Muslim migrants in the Netherlands come) has to be stopped. \\nThis trial could very easily backfire on the Dutch inquisitors, and make Wilders more popular than ever with the people of the Netherlands and Europe in general, as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites\u2019 forcing them to accept a massive influx of Muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife, bloodshed, and Sharia oppression. \\nConsequently, those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position. Wilders chanted \u201cNo more Moroccans\u201d at a rally. The horror! To any sane person, this means \u201cStop the influx of Moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls.\u201d To the media, which at this point is quite insane, insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality, this means \u201cGenocide!\u201d \\nAnd so, in this Deutsche Welle (DW) piece by freelance \u201cjournalist\u201d Teri Schultz, we\u2019re told that European Parliament lawmaker Cecile Kyenge, who was born in Congo, had \u201cnumerous racial slurs - not to mention, bananas, literally - thrown at her, along with suggestions she go back to \u2018her country.\u2019\u201d Does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for Wilders\u2019 position? Of course not, but Wilders, Schultz tells us, is (of course) \u201cfar-right,\u201d that all-purpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to right-thinking Deutsche Welle readers that Wilders is, as far as the media elites are concerned, unsavory, and must be opposed and shunned, his positions left unexamined. \\nSchultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece, being sure to tell her hapless readers that I am \u201cknown for extreme anti-Islam views,\u201d to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me, they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right. The term \u201cextreme\u201d also, since the Western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as \u201cextremists,\u201d also implies that I am a terrorist. \\nAfter the article came out, I challenged Schultz on this; she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think even you would consider your views \u2018mainstream\u2019, do you?\u201d I responded: \u201cAbsolutely yes. My views were the broad mainstream in the Western world from 632 AD until the 1960s. What changed? Not Islamic teaching.\u201d To that she said: \u201cOkay. You\u2019d have to argue it with another expert, which I am not. But thanks again for contributing.\u201d Indeed, she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold. \\nIn any case, Schultz\u2019s article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the self-appointed opinion-shapers. They can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of Europe and North America \u201cfar-right\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d every day (and they do), but the public can see with their eyes what is happening. Wilders\u2019 popularity isn\u2019t growing because he is a charming fellow (which is, of course, not to say that he isn\u2019t). It\u2019s growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure. \\nAnd it\u2019s only going to get worse for them: the Brexit vote and the Trump candidacy (whether he wins or loses) shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged. Those challenges will continue, and grow. They will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated.'"}, "time": 1742628407.0445225}
