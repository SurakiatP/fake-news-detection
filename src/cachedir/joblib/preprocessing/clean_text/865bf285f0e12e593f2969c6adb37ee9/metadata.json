The album, a long-standing ambition for the singer, contains a number of reworked children\u2019s standards including \u2018This Old Man, He Played One\u2019 and \u2018The Wheels on the Bus\u2019 along with a selection of self-penned numbers including \u2018Algebra is a Frightful Bore\u2019 and \u2018It is Inadvisable to Commence Your Sentences With a Gerund\u2019. \u2018It was my intention to offer today\u2019s younger folk entertainment of an improving nature\u2019 remarked the singer \u2018as an alternative to the abominations that are the likes of Hannah Montana and Chuggington. It appears that the entertainment industry has pulled together along with the British Brainwashing Corporation to prevent such an endeavour from ever succeeding.\u2019 Another organisation no longer supporting the singer is The Early Learning Centre who had planned a promotional tie-in with the album\u2019s release. They withdrew support upon hearing the lead single \u2018I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly\u2019: \u2018I know an old woman, who swallowed a fly, And because of this careless old lady, This innocent fly will die Fly will die (x5) \u2018I know an old woman, who swallowed a fly, Oh ignorant greedy old woman, I hope that you suddenly die, Hurry up and die (x7)\u2019 Morrissey is keen to stress that despite quitting music, he will not be shunning the limelight. \u2018I am already in negotiations with the producers of QI about joining their fragrant and estimable team. Meanwhile, I am ready to unleash my first book for the teenage market. I consider it a necessary counterbalance to the inanities of Eugenia Lavender and Budgie the Helicopter.\u2019 The book: \u2018Eats, Shoots and Dates: How the Poor Grammar and Punctuation of Others Has Long Ruined my Chances of Finding Lasting Love\u2019 is published by McMillan in March.
