They are a public nuisance. \u201d Both Uber and Lyft claim that releasing such information to the city could risk company secrets, and empower competition. \u201cWe\u2019re more than happy to work with the city to address congestion, but it should be a comprehensive solution including construction, the city\u2019s population increase, and the rise of online delivery services,\u201d said Uber spokesman Eva Behrend. \u201cIn San Francisco, nearly 30 percent of rides take place in underserved neighborhoods and 20 percent of Lyft rides begin or end at a public transit station,\u201d said spokeswoman Chelsea Harrison in a statement, addressing concerns about access to transportation. \u201cWe also have a track record of working collaboratively with policymakers who regulate us, including the (PUC) here in California, to ensure that our service complements existing transportation options. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
