[McCullough, a scientist who works for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and who competed as Miss District of Columbia, was asked if she believes health care should be a right or a privilege for American citizens.  \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to say it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d the    pageant winner said, adding that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be forced to subsidize someone else\u2019s health care. \u201cAs a government employee, I\u2019m granted healthcare. And I see firsthand that for one, to have healthcare, you need to have jobs, so therefore we need to continue to cultivate this environment so that we\u2019re given the opportunities to have healthcare as well as jobs for all Americans worldwide,\u201d McCullough said. \u201dI\u2019m definitely going to say it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d Listen to your new #MissUSA talk about healthcare in the USA. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Miss USA (@MissUSA) May 15, 2017,  The answer sent social media users into a frenzy, as many user chided McCullough for her answer. #MissUSA Miss DC just lost me with that answer  \u2026    .

Women, we are just as equal as men, especially in the workplace,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve come a long way and there is more work to be done. I think domestically we are making progress and I do believe that we will become equal one day,\u201d she added. McCullough beat out first   Miss New Jersey Chhavi Verg, a student at Rutgers University. McCullough will compete next in the Miss Universe contest. \u201cI\u2019m extremely thankful for this opportunity,\u201d she said after the event. \u201c\u201cI just want to encourage so many women nationwide to find their passion in any subject possible and understand that nothing is difficult if you really, truly put the work in for it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564315.9240744}
