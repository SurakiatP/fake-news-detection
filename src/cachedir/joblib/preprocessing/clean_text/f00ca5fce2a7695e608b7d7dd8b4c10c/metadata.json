She is in charge of research services for a museum. The latest product of her sleuthing was playing on a computer on the desk behind her  \u2014   a   performance of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d starring Shirley Booth, Hal Holbrook and Barbara Loden that was broadcast 50 years ago. As far as anyone knew, the master videotape was lost. Ms. Klain, who works for the Paley Center for Media, formerly the Museum of Broadcasting and the Museum of Television and Radio, is always on the lookout for lost programs that are sought by scholars and biographers. Late last year, she noticed a   listing that led to four forgotten reels of videotape at the University of Southern California  \u2014   the raw footage from which the original master tape of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d was assembled. She turned to video restoration specialists, who created what amounted to a new master tape. It will be shown on Thursday on Turner Classic Movies, 50 years to the day after the original telecast. \u201cShe is one of the heroes of archiving and finding these lost treasures,\u201d said Dan Wingate, who does video reconstructions and put together the new final version of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie. \u201d \u201cIt takes someone with real dedication and diligence and being willing to be said \u2018no\u2019 to over and over and keep going, and that\u2019s what she has. \u201d Charles Tabesh, senior vice president for programming and production for TCM and the   site FilmStruck, described her as \u201cknowledgeable, passionate and eager to talk about anything that\u2019s exciting that she has stumbled across or discovered. \u201d In 22 years with the museum, she has discovered dozens of video treasures, not all from the very earliest days of television. She mentions tracking down a broadcast of the musical \u201cJunior Miss\u201d that starred Don Ameche, Carol Lynley and Jill St. John in 1957, and a kinescope of a rehearsal of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s \u201cCinderella,\u201d also from 1957. She kept after archivists at the University of Wisconsin until they checked an    closet and found what she was looking for, a videotape of Edward Albee\u2019s play \u201cThe American Dream,\u201d recorded in 1963, but never broadcast. She had seen it on a listing of the places in which the producer David Susskind\u2019s programs were housed. \u201cThe Glass Menagerie,\u201d also produced by Mr. Susskind, had long been on her wish list, in part because the play is perennially popular and the 1966 telecast stuck in viewers\u2019 minds. \u201cEvery time a production of \u2018The Glass Menagerie\u2019 bubbles up, people contact me: \u2018What about the Shirley Booth one? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe answer has always been, \u2018No, it doesn\u2019t exist. \u2019\u201d The disappearance of the tape was puzzling. The program was praised by Jack Gould, then the television critic for The New York Times. He called it \u201can evening of superb theater\u201d and described Miss Booth as \u201cfluttery\u201d and \u201cappropriately intrusive as the perennial Mrs. \u201d although he noted that at times, \u201cher belle seemed a shade mechanized and not intuitively Southern. \u201d Ms. Klain located the raw footage from another list of Mr. Susskind\u2019s programs. \u201cI looked through it casually,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt said, \u2018Glass Menagerie, U. S. C.\u2019 I said, \u2018What? \u2019\u201d She called her counterparts in the university\u2019s cinematic arts library, who found the reels. It turned out that they contained six hours, take after take. \u201cNowhere did it say they added up to the production,\u201d Ms. Klain said. She arranged to have the tapes restored and digitized at DC Video in Burbank, Calif. Then she turned to Mr. Wingate. Along the way, she made another discovery, of an audio recording of the broadcast, apparently made on a home tape recorder. By comparing sound patterns from the tape recording with the audio from the takes, he could figure out exactly what had gone into the broadcast. \u201cIt was daunting,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they would use a part of this take and then they would use a part of that take. You would find a piece of it, and then it would go out of sync and you\u2019d realize you were hearing something from another take. \u201d Ms. Klain wanted the result seen and approached Mr. Tabesh of TCM. \u201cWhen she calls and says \u2018There\u2019s this amazing program that only aired once and a lot of people are eager to see,\u2019 I take that seriously,\u201d he said, and he scheduled it without screening it himself: \u201cI trust Jane\u2019s judgment enough to feel comfortable putting it on. \u201d Ms. Klain has not found her   program, a 1967 production of \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d starring Ethel Merman. Some years ago, she found the box that the master tape had apparently once been in. The box  \u2014   in a storage vault leased by NBC, which had broadcast the program  \u2014   was empty. On the label, \u201c\u2018Annie Get Your Gun\u2019 with Ethel Merman\u201d had been crossed out. As for \u201cThe Glass Menagerie,\u201d Ms. Klain remembers watching the original broadcast in 1966, when she was a teenager. She disliked Miss Booth\u2019s performance so much that she threw something at the TV  \u2014   an apple. Her assessment has not changed. Her reaction has. \u201cI\u2019m a \u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t throw things anymore. Also, my sofa is further away from the TV than we were then. I\u2019d really miss with an apple. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563655.8669114}
