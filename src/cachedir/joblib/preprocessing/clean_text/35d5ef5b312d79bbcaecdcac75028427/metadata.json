Speaking to reporters outside of the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, PA, Wyatt first quoted Huey P. Newton, the founder of the Black Panther Party. \u201cIn the words of Huey P. Newton, power is the ability to define phenomenon, making it act in a designed manner,\u201d he said. After that, he offered Allred and attorneys \u201cwho conspired\u201d advice. \u201cFor all those attorneys, who conspired like Gloria Allred, tell them to go back to law school and take another class,\u201d Wyatt added.
