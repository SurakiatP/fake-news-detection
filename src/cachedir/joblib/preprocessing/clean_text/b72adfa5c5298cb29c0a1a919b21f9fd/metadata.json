Rand Paul ( ) said \u201cevidence\u201d of wrongdoing before following through with a call for a special prosecutor.  Paul said, \u201cLaw enforcement ought to look into whether it happened. I wouldn\u2019t  really want a special investigator if all we\u2019re hearing is gossip in the media and nobody\u2019s presented any proof that there have been connections or that any law has been broken for that matter. \u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been arguing that we shouldn\u2019t politicize this thing, Republican or Democrat. We don\u2019t need a political discussion of this. We need a law enforcement look and if there is any kind of problem law enforcement should pursue it obviously no matter which party\u2019s involved. But I would say is People are very, very confused on this. \u201d He added, \u201cSo I think before people jump to sort of the hysteria of a special prosecutor, why don\u2019t we have somebody present evidence of some sort of wrongdoing before we go forward?\u201d (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562115.4269037}
