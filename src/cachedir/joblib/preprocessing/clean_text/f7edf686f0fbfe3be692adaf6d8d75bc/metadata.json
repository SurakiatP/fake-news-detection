Biden Jr. on Thursday by bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom on him, calling Mr. Biden \u201cmy brother\u201d in a tearful goodbye in the East Room of the White House. Having called Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, to the White House for a private farewell, the president instead brought him into a room filled with his friends, family and colleagues to present him with the honor, the nation\u2019s highest. For the first time, Mr. Obama awarded the medal with distinction, an added level of veneration that previous presidents had reserved for recipients like Pope John Paul II and Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state. \u201cTo know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without   and to live life fully,\u201d Mr. Obama said during the televised ceremony, as Mr. Biden wiped tears from his eyes and dabbed at his nose with a handkerchief. Moments later, as the president called up a military aide to read the proclamation, Mr. Biden appeared to break down, turning his back to the audience to compose himself. After Mr. Obama hung the medal around his neck, the vice president cried openly. \u201cRicchetti, you\u2019re fired,\u201d Mr. Biden joked to his chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti. \u201cI had no inkling. \u201d Addressing Mr. Obama, who stood to his side, Mr. Biden said that he had never met anyone who had \u201cthe integrity and the decency and the sense of other people\u2019s needs like you do. \u201d The ceremony was an emotional conclusion to an improbable partnership that began in 2008 when Mr. Obama asked his former presidential rival to be his running mate. The two men became close during eight years in the White House. \u201cMr. President, you got right the part about my leaning on Jill,\u201d Mr. Biden said, referring to the president\u2019s remarks about the couple\u2019s love. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also leaned on you and a lot of people in this room. \u201d It was not always clear that the   pairing would work, either politically or personally. Mr. Obama brought a cool and disciplined approach to politics, while his vice president was the hotheaded, passionate one. Gaffes by Mr. Biden during the early part of the Obama administration annoyed the president and his aides. And the relationship between the two men was strained when Mr. Biden endorsed   marriage in 2012, forcing the president\u2019s hand on the issue. But their bond strengthened through the difficult   campaign and a second term in which they confronted several mass killings. And Mr. Biden\u2019s personal tragedy  \u2014   the loss of his son Beau to cancer  \u2014   brought them even closer together. Last year, Mr. Biden seriously considered another run for president. But he concluded that his son\u2019s death had left him emotionally unable to mount an effective campaign. The citation with the medal noted Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201ccharm, candor, unabashed optimism and deep and abiding patriotism,\u201d as well as his \u201cstrength and grace to overcome great personal adversity. \u201d It called him one of the most \u201cconsequential vice presidents in American history. \u201d Mr. Obama spoke emotionally about the relationship between his own family and the extended Biden clan, many of whom had gathered for the ceremony. \u201cMy family is so proud to call ourselves honorary Bidens,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden sought to return the compliment. He noted that the Constitution did not grant the vice president any inherent powers  \u2014   \u201cfor good reason,\u201d he said. But he said that Mr. Obama had made good on a pledge to make sure that Mr. Biden had a job that mattered. \u201cYou have more than kept your commitment to me by saying you wanted me to help govern,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding that he hoped the history books would record that he was an asterisk in Mr. Obama\u2019s historic presidency. \u201cI can say I was part of a journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country,\u201d Mr. Biden said.'"}, "time": 1742628495.8241577}
