[During his speech, Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n clarified his recently reported comments on the importance of preserving Hungary\u2019s \u201cethnic homogeneity\u201d by saying, \u201cOf course, we Hungarians are heterogeneous   \u2026     even if you read the names [in this room] you\u2019d have everything from Bunjevci to Swabian [a reference to ethnic groups in the region]\u201d.  \u201c[T]his is a colourfulness within certain limits, [but] we are all from one civilisation   \u2026     Of course, as we learned from St. Stephen, we welcome everyone. \u201d By mischaracterising this as a call for a monoracial society along National Socialist lines, says Kov\u00e1cs, the \u201cliberal media\u201d provide \u201ca perfect example of quoting out of context to deliberately twist the meaning and swindle the reader\u201d. He added that \u201cmany of the journalists who ran with that distorted version of events never heard or read the speech\u201d. Kov\u00e1cs asserts that \u201cthe loud,   press simply don\u2019t have ears to hear the real meaning of a statement and refuse to report the full picture. Instead, these journalists with an agenda quote out of context and crop the photo\u201d  \u2014   a reference to a previous incident of media distortion from 2015. \u201cSet aside the manipulative editing on the part of the journalist and you know that PM Orb\u00e1n called for the preservation of ethnic homogeneity according to our \u2018colourful\u2019 European tradition and history  \u2026     That\u2019s a big difference. Too bad the rigged media is so blinded by their own bias that they can\u2019t see the difference or don\u2019t want to. \u201d The Oxford Dictionary defines \u201cethnicity\u201d as \u201cthe fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition\u201d  \u2014   an umbrella which could easily encompass a   society, if not a   one. Given the context provided by Kov\u00e1cs, the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s comments may be understood to reflect similar views on \u201cHyphenated Americanism\u201d expressed by U. S. President Theodore Roosevelt, whose likeness adorns Mount Rushmore today. \u201cThere is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalised Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalised Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all,\u201d he said in 1915. \u201cThe one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities an intricate knot of           or   each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality, than with the other citizens of the American Republic. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564075.7604074}
