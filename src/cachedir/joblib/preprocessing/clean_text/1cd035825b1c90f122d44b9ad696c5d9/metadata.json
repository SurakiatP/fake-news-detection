The minister, Moshe Yaalon, is a senior leader in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party, and quit amid the prime minister\u2019s political maneuvering to broaden his governing coalition, which has only a   majority in Parliament. The   negotiations exploded into public view this week, with Mr. Netanyahu apparently having offered Mr. Yaalon\u2019s job to the ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, though on Friday the prime minister said he was leaving the door open to make a deal with the   Zionist Union. There had been speculation that if Mr. Lieberman joined the government, Mr. Yaalon, who has been a stalwart member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s team for years, would be offered the post of foreign minister as a sort of consolation prize. His announcement on Friday, on Facebook and  Twitter, put an end to that possibility. \u201cThis morning I informed the prime minister that following his management in the latest developments, and in light of my lack of faith in him, I am resigning from the government and the Knesset and taking time out from political life,\u201d Mr. Yaalon wrote, using the Hebrew term for Parliament. In a news conference later, he said: \u201cI viewed all my positions, both when I was in uniform and as a minister, as a mission, and I was unwilling to sacrifice national needs and the security of Israel\u2019s citizens for the sake of political considerations or personal interest. \u201d Mr. Netanyahu seemed to confirm the speculation in a statement released on Friday in which he expressed regret over Mr. Yaalon\u2019s departure. Mr. Yaalon \u201cshould have continued being a full partner in leadership of this country, as foreign minister,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThe reshuffle of portfolios did not stem from a lack of confidence between us but rather from the need to broaden the government. \u201d Mr. Netanyahu added, \u201cI assume that if Yaalon had not been asked to leave the defense ministry,\u201d the resignation would not have occurred. \u201cThere are political opportunities, particularly due to certain regional developments, which I personally strive towards continuously,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cTherefore I took great efforts to have the Zionist Union join the government. Thus I am leaving the door open in the most serious manner for them to join. Such a move would do only good for the State of Israel. \u201d The addition of Mr. Lieberman to the government  \u2014   which has been widely reported in the Israeli news media but not officially announced  \u2014   would further cement the rightist nature of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. Mr. Yaalon, 65, is at the   of the political spectrum, but has served as a bulwark against the most extreme populist sentiments criticizing the military and the Likud coalition, by Mr. Lieberman and others. He said he planned to return someday to political life, including a run for state leadership. \u201cI fought with all my might against phenomena of extremism, violence and racism in Israeli society that threaten its fortitude,\u201d he said, adding that these forces \u201c are trickling into\u201d the military. The contrast in military credentials between Mr. Yaalon and Mr. Lieberman could hardly be more pronounced. Mr. Yaalon, a former chief of staff and career general, led commando units and took part in daring operations. Mr. Lieberman left the military at the rank of corporal. He is known for   positions like demanding the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of terrorism and the toppling of Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza. Mr. Yaalon came under fire for quickly condemning the actions of an Israeli soldier who shot and killed a wounded Palestinian assailant in the West Bank city of Hebron. Many Israelis viewed Mr. Yaalon\u2019s immediate statement that the soldier should be brought to justice because he had violated military code as prejudging the case and troops at a time when they face violent attacks by Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu at first took a similar stand, but he later called the soldier\u2019s father, a move that was seen as offering support. \u201cWith great sorrow, senior politicians in the country have chosen incitement and divisiveness of the Israeli society instead of unifying and connecting,\u201d Mr. Yaalon said. \u201cIt is unacceptable to me that we be divided because of cynicism or craving for control, and I expressed more than once my opinion on the matter  \u2014   from a position of sincere worry for the future of Israeli society and future generations. \u201d Israeli Radio said the minister of immigration and absorption, Zeev Elkin, a member of Likud, had called on Mr. Yaalon to reconsider his resignation. Mr. Elkin said that Mr. Yaalon\u2019s place was in Likud and that the prime minster\u2019s moves should not be considered insulting to him. He added that political considerations had forced Mr. Netanyahu to make changes in the coalition government, and that Mr. Yaalon could have remained in another capacity. The minister for social equality, Gila Gamliel, also a Likud member, also expressed regret about Mr. Yaalon\u2019s decision, calling his resignation a huge loss for the party. The resignation caps weeks of confusing negotiations by Mr. Netanyahu, and some analysts noted that Mr. Yaalon has had   tensions with the prime minister and could be biding his time to start a new party. \u201cCertainly the other possibility is that he\u2019s had it  \u2014   with the intrigues, the backstabbing, the manipulations of politics,\u201d said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a professor of political communications at the Interdisciplinary Center, a private college north of Tel Aviv, who is a frequent critic of Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cIn Israel, we play hardball politics,\u201d Mr. Wolfsfeld said. \u201cOn the other hand, even on the scale of hardball, cynical politics, this was a shocker. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628415.4086835}
