A native of the delta region, Mr. Wong in 1982 swam for two hours from nearby Zhuhai, on China\u2019s mainland, to what was then the Portuguese colony of Macau to escape China\u2019s strict Communist government. Once there he set up an early incarnation of Yi Hap Shipyard, a builder of wooden junks, which symbolize the delta and the maritime culture that drove China\u2019s early growth. \u201cNot many people are   wooden junks anymore,\u201d Mr. Wong said. \u201cI wish more people would. \u201d Within the next few months, the junk, the Dai Cheung Po  \u2014   also known as the Aqua Luna II  \u2014   will unfurl its   sails above its high stern and low bow and join its smaller sister, the Cheung Po Tsai, or the Aqua Luna I, already in Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong, to offer parties and dinners. It is one of a few of these traditional ships with sails being made by one of the last remaining junk builders in China. \u201cThe building tradition is more or less moribund,\u201d said Stephen Davies, a former director of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. Yet the style remains traditional, \u201cinsofar as they are still doing what Grandpa did, and before him,\u201d he said. The new junk is made of Southeast Asian ironwood and teak and cost about $1. 3 million to build. It was commissioned by a restaurant group in Hong Kong, which lies about 50 miles east of Shenwan on the edge of the delta where the river\u2019s silty water turns ocean blue. Also in Hong Kong is the Dukling, a classic,   junk that dates from 1955. It sank once and was recently refurbished. Since June, its owners have offered tours of Hong Kong\u2019s waters, reflecting how junks today are used mostly for tourism and private parties. They are three of only a handful of junks that remain in the delta, replaced long ago by stouter wooden fishing vessels without sails, speedboats and huge container ships. The   pirate Cheung Po Tsai, or Cheung Po \u201cthe Kid,\u201d who crisscrossed the delta pillaging and later joined the Qing dynasty imperial navy, sailed a ship that looked similar to his namesakes, though its sails may have been a yellow woven bamboo, not red. The red color is largely a flourish, Mr. Davies said. The life of the delta is partly interlaced because of junks, which were once numerous with their fanlike silhouettes, trading down into Southeast Asia and up the coast of China. The junk  \u2014   the word\u2019s origins are murky, with Chinese, Malay and Portuguese cited as influences  \u2014   may have assumed its iconic, curved hull and sails about 1, 000 years ago, during the Song dynasty, though written records are scarce. Captivated by the junk\u2019s beauty, David Yeo, the founder and owner of Aqua Restaurant Group, commissioned a Hong Kong master boat builder, Au Wai, to conceptualize and direct the construction of the Aqua Lunas and to work with Mr. Wong in Shenwan. The first was launched in 2006, and unlike junks of the past, both are   and their sails are decorative. \u201cHe has made more commercial junk boats than anyone else in Hong Kong. He is a master of a true art form,\u201d Mr. Yeo said in an email. \u201cAn art form that is sadly dying out in Hong Kong today. \u201d Mr. Au\u2019s life reflects the sweep of delta geography. He is unsure where he was born but knows his father was from Guangdong Province in China, through which the Pearl River runs. Known as Ah Sin  \u2014   the honorific and name translate as Dear Magician, for his talent  \u2014   Mr. Au, 85, grew up poor in Hong Kong. In his boatyard on Hong Kong Island, in the eastern district of Shau Kei Wan, he points to photographs of wooden ships of all kinds that he has built since being apprenticed to an uncle at the age of 13: simple \u201c \u201d motorboats and corporate junks that carry some design elements of the traditional junk but without sails. Beyond the wood shavings, the harbor glitters in the sun. Fishing boats draw up outside to deliver their catch to the   Shau Kei Wan wholesale fish market. \u201cI was very naughty as a boy, and no one could control me,\u201d Mr. Au said in Cantonese, the local language. Barely a teenager, he sold fish on the streets. \u201cI did what I wanted. So my family said, \u2018You should look for a special skill,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAn uncle was the owner of a shipyard and also a member of the ship association. \u201d His son, Au Sai Kit, works with him, but because his son has no children, the family tradition will probably end there. Hardly anyone in Hong Kong is willing to do manual labor, the elder Mr. Au said, so he has to look to places like Shenwan, where he and his son travel regularly to confer with Mr. Wong and his team of workers. Building a luxury junk is a labor of love, Mr. Au said. \u201cWe take the wood piece by piece, fit them together in a curve, measure each piece and cut it,\u201d he said. Copper nails are used to hammer the hull together. No other metal or artificial materials are used. It takes about a year to build a traditional junk, Mr. Wong said. Once junks were made from camphor wood and pine from   Fujian Province, said Mr. Davies, the former museum director. \u201cThey were simple to build. That was the genius of the hull design,\u201d he said. But they had flaws. \u201cThe hull is only joined together by nails, so you can\u2019t have one high sail. You need   rigging,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had to keep adding sails to make the junk sail in a straight line. \u201d The idea of a Chinese junk has been romanticized, Mr. Davies said. \u201cJunks were brutally hard work. The grunt work  \u2014   it took 14 members of crew to work the sails. It was pure sweat,\u201d he said. But Mr. Davies concedes that the traditional Chinese junk remains iconic. \u201cThat sweep down to the bow, the fan in profile, with the masts that create this beautiful arc along the top. The fully battened, standing rigging. There is just a beautiful harmony in looking at it,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562886.530783}
