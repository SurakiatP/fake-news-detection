[Louise Fris\u00e9n, child psychiatrist at the Astrid Lindgren Children\u2019s Hospital, told Aftonbladet that in 2016, the gender investigation team saw 197 children who were interested in \u2018transitioning\u2019 to becoming the opposite sex.  \u201cThere\u2019s a 100 per cent increase in numbers each year, and the people we\u2019re seeing are younger and younger and more and more children are coming at very young ages,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthe increase is identical on the adult side of things, too,\u201d she said. Chief of Karolinska University Hospital\u2019s gender identity team, Cecilia Dhejne, said the rise in children unhappy with having been born male or female reflects \u201cgreater openness\u201d in Swedish society, but warned that resources are overstretched. \u201cThe problem in Sweden is that there\u2019s a long wait for young people, both for initiating an investigation into their gender identity and then also for the different parts of treatment across the country after that. \u201d \u201cIt is worrying\u201d said the   sexologist, cautioning that \u201chaving to wait in a queue can worsen the mental health of transgender people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s sad on an individual level when people feel bad about themselves, and on a wider level it\u2019s much better that young people are able to get started with their lives so they can contribute to society,\u201d said Ms. Dhejne. Sweden\u2019s Public Health Minister Gabriel Wikstr\u00f6m said: \u201cIt is totally unacceptable that there are deficiencies in care for transgender people at every stage of treatment. \u201d He told Aftonbladet the government had appointed a commission to investigate waiting times and gaps in care across the country, the results of which will be ready by October. \u201cI believe [municipalities in Sweden] do the best they can with the resources they have, but unfortunately I think society has failed to do enough to listen to transgender people. As a result, we were not aware of the problems now being faced by that group. \u201d In recent years, left wing activists along with global media enterprises like National Geographic have worked hard to promote the concept of \u2018transgender children\u2019 but there is increasing evidence that gender ideology puts minors\u2019 mental health at risk. There is also mounting evidence that children are too young to choose their gender. In June, the American College of Pediatricians released an open letter asserting that   trans children are psychologically confused. \u201cConditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse,\u201d it read.'"}, "time": 1742563179.3218224}
