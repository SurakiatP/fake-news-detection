Trump was a serial fabulist whose   boasts about everything he touched routinely crumbled under the slightest scrutiny. As a candidate, Mr. Trump was a magical realist who made fantastical claims punctuated by his favorite verbal tic: \u201cBelieve me. \u201d Yet even jaded connoisseurs of Oval Office dissembling were astonished over the last week by the torrent of bogus claims that gushed from President Trump during his first days in office. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything this bizarre in our lifetimes, where up is down and down is up and everything is in question and nothing is real,\u201d said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity and the author of \u201c935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America\u2019s Moral Integrity,\u201d a book about presidential deception. It was not just Mr. Trump\u2019s debunked claim about how many people attended his inauguration, or his insistence (contradicted by his own Twitter posts) that he had not feuded with the intelligence community, or his audacious and   claim that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote only because millions of people voted for her illegally. All week long, news organizations chased down one Trump tall tale after another. PolitiFact, a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials, published 12 \u201cof the most misleading claims\u201d Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview. The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address. (There were no shootings, police records showed.) The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he said the city\u2019s murder rate was \u201cterribly increasing. \u201d (The murder rate has steadily declined over the last decade.) The indefatigable fact checkers at The Washington Post cataloged 24 false or misleading statements made by the president during his first seven days in office. But for students of Mr. Trump\u2019s long business career, there was much about President Trump\u2019s   ways that was familiar: the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details, the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts, the branding as liars those who point out his untruths, the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable \u201cbeliefs. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for   insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump\u2019s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump\u2019s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his   image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand. Nearly 30 years ago, in his   book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d which he described as \u201can innocent form of exaggeration  \u2014   and a very effective form of promotion. \u201d It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum. Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s cascade of falsehoods was \u201ca direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy\u201d in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration\u2019s \u201calternative facts\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. \u201d \u201cIn a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cAll authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state. \u201d Mr. Lewis argued that the president\u2019s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation\u2019s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. \u201c  becomes an act of war by the media,\u201d he said. Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C. I. A. employees that he had \u201ca running war with the media\u201d and called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth. \u201d The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d the new president and promised, \u201cWe are not going to sit around and let it happen. \u201d By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as \u201cthe opposition party\u201d during an interview with The New York Times. \u201cIt feels like this was part of the plan all along,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer   historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s brazen willingness to deny \u201cobjective reality\u201d had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he is doing it strategically,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it certainly had the impact of a magician\u2019s sleight of hand. \u201d Deception, dissembling, exaggeration  \u2014   what Fortune magazine called his \u201castonishing ability to prevaricate\u201d  \u2014   has deep roots in Mr. Trump\u2019s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to   contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a \u201cspurious\u201d lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s denials, there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had \u201chandpicked\u201d each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs. The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing. Once he stepped into the political arena, however,   operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, has scrutinized 356 specific claims by Mr. Trump and found that more than   of the claims were \u201cmostly false,\u201d \u201cfalse\u201d or, in 62 cases, \u201cPants on Fire\u201d false. \u201cTrump is a different kind of figure than we\u2019ve ever seen before in our 10 years of \u201d Bill Adair, the creator of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University, said in an interview. \u201cNo one has come close to Trump in the high percentage of falsehoods. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s election alone is evidence he did not pay a high price for his plethora of false claims on the campaign trail. Nor are there many signs that his loyal base of supporters is troubled by the misstatements he has made in the first week of his presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the messages and the actions of the first week are deeply resonating with tens of millions of Americans,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. And even if some Republican leaders in Washington view the president\u2019s behavior as \u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cworrisome,\u201d he said, they are for now more focused on the tax cuts and deregulation they hope to achieve under his administration. Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about whether he understands the difference between fallacies uttered by the president of the United States and promotional puffery from a real estate developer boasting of his latest hotel or golf course. In Mr. Trump\u2019s first interview as president, David Muir of ABC News asked, \u201cDo you think that your words matter more now?\u201d \u201cYes, very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Yet then Mr. Muir asked, \u201cDo you think that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence?\u201d \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he replied. \u201cNot at all because many people feel the same way that I do. \u201d As if to prove the point, Mr. Trump then doubled down on his lie about millions of illegal votes. \u201cBelieve me, those were Hillary votes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you look at it, they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn\u2019t vote for me. \u201d For Ms. Goodwin, Mr. Trump\u2019s week of reality distortions brought to mind Lincoln\u2019s address to the Young Men\u2019s Lyceum of Springfield, Ill. on Jan. 27, 1838, where he made an appeal to Enlightenment values as the best antidote to what he called the \u201cmobocratic spirit. \u201d \u201cReason  \u2014   cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason  \u2014   must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was worrying about authoritarian behavior,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said.'"}, "time": 1742564308.3798535}
