Meryl Streep campaigned on behalf of Hillary Clinton, so expectations were high that when she took the Golden Globes stage to accept the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she would comment on the recent election. But how political would she be? Pretty political, as it turned out. She used her speech to call out   Donald J. Trump for seeming to mock a disabled New York Times reporter, and to warn that a free press would need to be defended. \u201cThis instinct to humiliate, when it\u2019s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody\u2019s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. \u201d The room roundly applauded her remarks, but on social media some conservative commentators immediately criticized her and the target of her remarks had his own take. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Streep as \u201ca Hillary lover\u201d and said that while he had not watched the ceremony, he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d to come under attack from \u201cliberal movie people. \u201d  \u2014   Daniel Victor and Patrick Healy Read the full text of Meryl Streep\u2019s remarks and read more about the  \u2019s comments. Jimmy Fallon, generally an ebullient cruise director for awards shows, wasn\u2019t a presence so much as a nuisance. The \u201cLa La Land\u201d intro only really worked if you\u2019d already seen \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and the segment lacked the pep and fun of, for example, his \u201cGlee\u201d  musical intro to the 2010 Emmys. There was barely a monologue, but a teleprompter snafu probably shouldn\u2019t derail a comedian who hosts a TV show five nights a week. The rest of his material was tiny  \u2014   and not funny  \u2014   interstitials introducing the presenters with strained wordplay. Does this show need a host? Maybe not.  \u2014   Margaret Lyons Read a review of the telecast. Even cynical   watchers had to smile when the songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, ages 31 and 32, came bounding onto the stage to collect their Globe for the moody \u201cLa La Land\u201d tune \u201cCity of Stars. \u201d The young men had clearly not yet received the show business memo that awards are to be accepted with practiced (false) modesty and coolness. \u201cWe need to calm down!\u201d shouted Mr. Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re so nervous!\u201d They charmingly dedicated their best song award to \u201cmusical theater nerds everywhere. \u201d (Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul also wrote the music for the celebrated \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d) The same kind of emotion could also been seen whenever the cameras passed the \u201cLa La Land\u201d table, where the two producers who shepherded the film the longest, Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz, ages 35 and 36, could be seen melting down with joy as their film racked up one prize after another. Add in multiple trips to the stage by the film\u2019s director, Damien Chazelle, 31, and it felt like an arrival moment for a new set of Young Turks. On to the Oscars?  \u2014   Brooks Barnes Read about the making of \u201cLa La Land. \u201d There\u2019s no movie called \u201cHidden Fences. \u201d There\u2019s \u201cFences,\u201d starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, and there\u2019s \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. First Jenna Bush Hager said it on NBC\u2019s red carpet show when she was interviewing Pharrell Williams (who is a producer of \u201cHidden Figures\u201d) and then Michael Keaton said it onstage. Look alive out there, folks.  \u2014   Margaret Lyons Read about Pharrell Williams\u2019s reaction. Donald Glover\u2019s two acceptance speeches for his work on the FX show \u201cAtlanta\u201d were touching and personal (\u201cI grew up in a house where magic wasn\u2019t allowed\u201d) and also hilarious (\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the Migos  \u2014   not for being on the show, but for making \u2018Bad and Boujee.\u2019 That\u2019s the best song ever\u201d). \u201cAtlanta\u201d was one of the best, most distinctive shows of last season, and everything about the show\u2019s win, and Mr. Glover\u2019s velvet suit, and the cast\u2019s   portrait felt unique and just right.  \u2014   Margaret Lyons Read the complete list of Golden Globe winners. It was a night of facial hair and sparkles, fairy princess frocks and character dressing, with the characters, and the (Hollywood) royals, dressed straight from the silver screen playbook. Of course, some costumes are less obvious than others. And when it comes to the red carpet, at least pretending to dress as yourself as opposed to, say, a cut flower or Disney caricature, has power. Ruth Negga, for example, in a   sequined   gown (who doesn\u2019t love the idea of a   gown?) by Louis Vuitton, took the idea of dressing for the award you want, a popular seasonal trope, and gave it a dose of futuristic cool. Evan Rachel Wood, channeling Marlene Dietrich and David Bowie (and Julie Andrews in \u201c \u201d) in an exactingly cut Altuzarra tux with white vest, offered absolute proof of her words that when it comes to awards season, there was no dress required. And Thandie Newton, in    white Monse, flames picked out in paillettes licking up her hem, just hinted at the idea of an avenging angel come to earth. Also on the   list, though in a more classical mode: Emma Stone, in     (pink was a trend) Valentino, metaphor obvious but still undeniably enchanting Brie Larson, in strapless red Rodarte with a draped and beaded bodice, matching lips and Veronica Lake hair Natalie Portman, in \u2019  chartreuse Prada maternity gown, a little \u201cJackie,\u201d but not too much and Viola Davis in sunshine yellow   sequined Michael Kors, so bright she gave off her own light. For good or ill, Fashion with a capital F dresses can often look overdone or out of place on what has become a pretty visually safe space, and such was the case with Nicole Kidman\u2019s Scottish shipwreck of a   corseted Alexander McQueen. Ditto Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s white   Vera Wang, with its echoes of both wedding dresses past and Princess Leia. And ditto Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s   Armani: short in front, trailing in back, sequined on top. Just when you had taken one detail in: whoa! There was another. The red carpet just doesn\u2019t reward risk. At least the very boring  \u2014   all those sequined columns, yawn  \u2014   doesn\u2019t linger long in the brain.  \u2014   Vanessa Friedman Read a review of the night\u2019s looks and see a red carpet slide show. In \u201cNocturnal Animals,\u201d Tom Ford\u2019s twisty drama, Aaron   plays a sadistic thug who menaces a family on a deserted highway. Critics singled out the terrifying performance but on the awards circuit so far, the actor had garnered just one award (from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival) before his surprise Golden Globe for best supporting actor. Left   were favorites like Mahershala Ali (\u201cMoonlight\u201d). On the red carpet, Mr.   said he watched movies about Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer to prepare, while his wife, the director Sam   confessed, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my favorite part. \u201d  \u2014   Stephanie Goodman  Read a review of \u201cNocturnal Animals. \u201d Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019s acceptance speech was an elegant combination of meaningful ideas and gleeful spontaneity. Winning the Globe for best actress in a comedy (\u201c \u201d) Ms. Ross said that her award was also for \u201call of the women, women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas and thoughts are not always considered worthy and valid and important. \u201d She said that it\u2019s \u201can honor\u201d to be on a show that tells stories \u201coutside of where the industry usually looks. \u201d She also seemed absolutely delighted to have won. Isn\u2019t this what we want from an acceptance speech? A little humor, a bit of thoughtfulness, some seemingly true human emotion.  \u2014   Margaret Lyons Read more about Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019s speech. It\u2019s time to retire \u201cSofia Vergara is not a native English speaker\u201d as a comic premise. She came out and said \u201canal\u201d twice and then \u201canus,\u201d the big joke being that she can\u2019t pronounce \u201cannual. \u201d  \u2014   Margaret Lyons Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig\u2019s introduction for best animated feature was hilarious. And thank God  \u2014   the otherwise abysmal banter segments were draining every iota of energy out of the ceremony.  \u2014   Margaret Lyons The actors who really stole the show were, for the most part, under the age of 15: the kids from \u201cStranger Things\u201d and Sunny Pawar, the   Indian actor who played a lost child in \u201cLion. \u201d The \u201cStranger Things\u201d boys  \u2014   Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp  \u2014   arrived together, charming the red carpet  with their sharp outfits and snappy moves. Caleb later grabbed a selfie with Ryan Gosling during a commercial break. And onstage during the show, when Sunny was hoisted up to the mic by Dev Patel, who plays the older version of their character in the drama \u201cLion,\u201d the entire ballroom erupted in awws and coos, the sound of hundreds of hearts melting.  \u2014   Cara Buckley Read a review of \u201cLion\u201d and a review of \u201cStranger Things. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563301.3050275}
