Big, bold and   the structure, \u201cVessel,\u201d stands 15 stories, weighs 600 tons and is filled with 2, 500 climbable steps. Long under wraps, it is the creation of Thomas Heatherwick, 46, an acclaimed and controversial British designer, and will rise in the mammoth Far West Side development Hudson Yards, anchoring a   plaza and garden that will not open until 2018. Some may see a jungle gym, others a honeycomb. But Stephen M. Ross, the billionaire founder and chairman of Related Companies, which is developing Hudson Yards with Oxford Properties Group, has his own nickname for \u201cVessel\u201d: \u201cthe social climber. \u201d And the steep price tag Mr. Ross\u2019s privately held company is paying for Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s installation? More than $150 million. The back story of the   \u201cVessel\u201d involves two men who are in step in more ways than one: a designer known for dreaming big, and a   developer who will spend whatever it takes to make a statement. Currently under construction in Monfalcone, Italy, the   and concrete pieces that make up \u201cVessel\u201d are not to be assembled on site until next year, but on Wednesday, Related Companies rolled out the design with a Hudson Yards spectacle hosted by Anderson Cooper, with a performance by the Alvin Ailey dance troupe on a set that mimicked the multiple stairways inside \u201cVessel. \u201d The crowd of hundreds included Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe know \u2018Vessel\u2019 will be debated and discussed and looked at from every angle, and Thomas,\u201d the mayor added, addressing the architect, \u201cif you meet 100 New Yorkers, you will find 100 different opinions on the beautiful work you\u2019ve created. Do not be dismayed. \u201d On a visit to New York this summer, Mr. Heatherwick, founder of the Heatherwick Studio in London, was eager to explain his design. \u201cWe had to think of what could act as the role of a landmarker,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that could help give character and particularity to the space. \u201d Mr. Heatherwick said \u201cVessel\u201d was partly inspired by Indian stepwells, but he also referred to it as a climbing frame  \u2014   what Americans would call a jungle gym  \u2014   as well as \u201ca Busby Berkeley musical with a lot of steps. \u201d The design reflects Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s belief that city natives are always looking for their next workout. \u201cNew Yorkers have a fitness thing,\u201d he said. (It will test many city folk who can barely climb into their Ubers, but there will be an elevator for anyone unable to reach the top.) Inside the piece, the 154 interconnecting staircases may put visitors in mind of a drawing by M. C. Escher, especially given that the   structure will have 80 viewing landings. Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s career, as measured by his personal profile, has certainly been climbing. He gained fame for ingenious designs like his torch for the 2012 London Olympics, known as the Caldron. He is collaborating with the architect Bjarke Ingels on the design for Google\u2019s new campus in Mountain View, Calif. and he is reimagining the home of the New York Philharmonic, David Geffen Hall, with Diamond Schmitt Architects of Toronto. But other projects have faced some downward pressure. Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s proposal for a   bridge across the Thames River in London was held up by budget issues in July, though Mr. Heatherwick said it was moving forward again. In New York, the Hudson River island park known as Pier 55  \u2014   funded by another   billionaire, Barry Diller  \u2014   was stalled by a legal challenge that was rejected last week. (According to Mr. Diller, the challenge is being secretly sponsored by Douglas Durst, a real estate rival of Mr. Ross\u2019s.) \u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith in terms of scale,\u201d said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund, who has seen the \u201cVessel\u201d renderings and likes them. \u201c I admire the ambition,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can\u2019t be small in New York. \u201d But Ms. Freedman had her reservations. \u201cThe bigger problem may be traffic control,\u201d she said, given that the work will be near the already crowded High Line, the tourist attraction whose northernmost segment winds around Hudson Yards. \u201cI think people will want to experience it. \u201d Thomas Woltz, of the firm Nelson Byrd Woltz, designed Hudson Yards\u2019 Public Square and Gardens, with input from Mr. Heatherwick, as a dramatically landscaped attraction. The square will be the $200 million centerpiece of Hudson Yards\u2019 eastern section, a   parcel with eight buildings comprising office space, retail outlets, residences and  a new cultural institution, the Shed. The eastern section  stretches from 30th to 34th Streets and from 10th to 11th Avenues, built largely on a platform over the West Side Rail Yards. Despite the name \u201cPublic Square,\u201d Hudson Yards is a private development, and \u201cVessel\u201d was commissioned and approved by a committee of one: Mr. Ross, who has kept the design models in a locked cabinet in the Related offices  \u2014   when not allowing brief peeks to lure commercial tenants. \u201cI have the only key,\u201d he said with a smile. When Mr. Ross began the process of finding a piece several years ago, he first turned to five artists who are known for working in public plazas  \u2014   and whom he declined to name  \u2014   and asked them for detailed proposals. One of the unbuilt plans cost him $500, 000, he said, and another $250, 000. But he was unsatisfied. \u201cBeen there, seen that,\u201d Mr. Ross said of his reaction. A Related colleague suggested Mr. Heatherwick, who had come in previously for a meeting at the company to discuss a future pavilion on the site. Mr. Heatherwick and Mr. Ross talked, and six weeks later, the designer sent a proposal. \u201cI looked at it and said, \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt had everything I wanted. \u201d That was in 2013. \u201cEverybody here thought I was nuts,\u201d Mr. Ross said of his colleagues\u2019 reactions. The idea of \u201cVessel\u201d as an exclamation point toward the northern end of the High Line is part of Mr. Ross\u2019s grand plan to make Hudson Yards the center of New York, despite its    location. \u201cThe most important place in New York is Rockefeller Center during Christmas time,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cI wanted to have a   Christmas tree. \u201d One of Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s main goals for the piece is to raise people significantly above ground level so they can see the city  \u2014   and one another  \u2014   in a new way. \u201cThe power of the High Line is the changed perspective on the world,\u201d Mr. Heatherwick said. The interactive feature of \u201cVessel\u201d was partly a reaction to what Mr. Heatherwick sees as previous failures in public projects: Plop art. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten used to these 1960s, 1970s plazas with obligatory big artworks plunked down,\u201d he said. \u201cVessel\u201d is only 50 feet in diameter at its base, rising to 150 feet at the top, meaning that it has a \u201csmall bum,\u201d Mr. Heatherwick said, and does not take over the plaza\u2019s ground level. The cost of the piece has ballooned from the original estimate, $75 million, Mr. Ross said. Mr. Heatherwick noted that the process of making the steel pieces was unusually complex. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an unlimited budget, but no corners have been cut,\u201d Mr. Heatherwick said, adding that \u201cVessel\u201d was sturdy enough to \u201ctake Hurricane Sandys. \u201d The price does not appear to trouble his patron. Mr. Ross has now hired Heatherwick Studio to design two residential buildings, one at Hudson Yards and one in Chelsea. For Mr. Heatherwick, \u201cVessel\u201d represents his firm\u2019s focus on doing innovative work for the public to enjoy. \u201cI\u2019m doing this project because it\u2019s free, and for all New Yorkers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just itching to see a thousand people on it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561676.5167265}
