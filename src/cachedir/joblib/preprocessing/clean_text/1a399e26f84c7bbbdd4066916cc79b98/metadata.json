Snow may have been in the forecast for the Jersey Shore on Tuesday morning but something else ended up coming down in buckets: sarcasm. \u201cWhat storm?\u201d said Billy Pisano, a painter, who said he \u201cfought the lines for bread and milk\u201d Monday night and canceled his Tuesday job only to wake up to no snow. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to stay home in the rain,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a Netflix day. \u201d At a Wawa convenience store in Neptune, people stopped for coffee, cigarettes and griping. George Martin, 50, had strapped a snowplow to his sport utility vehicle and planned to spend the day using it to scrape up a few dollars. He expected seven inches. His spirits sank when he woke up extra early and looked outside. \u201cLike, oh man, come on, they did it again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a firecracker and you throw it and it\u2019s a dud. \u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to plow. You can\u2019t charge people for something that\u2019s not there. \u201d Al Clark, 38, and Stephen Vierschilling, 26,   at a shop that paints fire engines, shared jokes about weather forecasters. \u201cThe last few storms they said it was going to be Armageddon and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Clark said. Soo Becchina, a   special education teacher from Oceanside on Long Island, tutors students after school four days a week. Because of the storm, she had to cancel sessions with her students. The missed day means missed wages. \u201cTutoring is a side business for me,\u201d Ms. Becchina said. \u201cBut, more important it always upsets me when I cannot give my kids what they need. One of the girls I see is having a math test tomorrow. I am hoping that the teacher doesn\u2019t give the test but, I know this teacher and she normally doesn\u2019t move test dates. \u201d Despite losing the day and the money, Ms. Becchina still plans on doing a phone session with her student later in the day, at no charge.  \u2014   NATE SCHWEBER and RUTH BASHINSKY Cancellation notices covered the international flight board at Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport in Queens on Tuesday morning. But one flight, from Guangzhou, China, had landed shortly before 5 a. m. David Dubois, an engineer and   aviation enthusiast from Hudson, N. H. was among the passengers. He said he was impressed with the plane\u2019s landing, despite the snowy conditions. \u201cThe pilot really had a difficult time and pulled it off really well,\u201d Mr. Dubois said. \u201cThere was no tarmac it was all snow. When he landed, you could just feel it starting to go sideways. He pulled it straight  \u2014   no bounce, no nothing. I couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201d But Mr. Dubois still had to get to New England. Kamari Simon, 18, was in a similar bind in Terminal 5. Mr. Simon, a D. J. said he was scheduled to perform with a    rapper named Smooky Margiela at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. \u201cI hope everything goes through and I\u2019ll be down in Austin,\u201d said Mr. Simon, who studies music at Five Towns College in Dix Hills, on Long Island. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for me to meet other artists and network. \u201d  \u2014   SEAN PICCOLI Tuesday\u2019s storm shuttered schools along the Eastern Seaboard, keeping students out of the classroom. But, even though school was closed, elementary students in Petersham, Mass. a town of 1, 200 in the central part of the state, did not exactly have a snow day. Instead, they had homework  \u2014   books, activities, worksheets and even a science experiment  \u2014   intended to allow them to make up the day of school without being there, and, thus, to prevent the school from having to add a day at the end of the year. The idea emerged after the winter of 2015, when the district had 10 snow days. Tari Thomas, the superintendent of schools for a consolidated school district that includes Petersham, said the district experimented with sending older students home with online coursework to complete on laptops (although that was not the case on Tuesday, because the students had already used up the five days of online learning they were allowed for the year). \u201cThere have been a small pocket of parents that have said, \u2018Why can\u2019t kids be kids and have a snow day? \u2019\u201d said Ms. Thomas. But, Ms. Thomas added, \u201cWe\u2019ve had parents say, \u2018Oh my gosh, thank goodness you gave them something to do. \u2019\u201d In Central Park in Manhattan, it was a different story. It was a true snow day with schools canceled. Aliana Lambert, 6, dragged her purple sled to a   hill. There was no written rule banning girls from the hill at 100th Street and Central Park West, but at 2 p. m. Aliana was the only girl standing. Kat Vlasica, Aliana\u2019s mother, said they came to their neighborhood hill for every snowstorm. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in New York with 800 square feet, you have to take advantage of a hill like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our hill, and we don\u2019t even have to salt or scrape it. \u201d  \u2014   JESS BIDGOOD and EMILY PALMER Navigating New York City streets was a challenge, what with snow and sleet and gusting wind and patches of ice. Drivers on Staten Island confronted another obstacle: a pair of runaway ponies. Terence Monahan, the chief of patrol, said the two ponies escaped from a stable. An   police officer driving his truck saw them walking down Hylan Boulevard on the South Shore. The officer stopped and grabbed a tow strap from inside his truck. \u201cHe grabbed them, tied them to a lamp post. We got a radio car there and we were able to return them back to the stables,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re safe, they\u2019re in great shape. \u201d The mayor, for his part, thanked the \u201ccowboy officer. \u201d  \u2014   ASHLEY SOUTHALL WASHINGTON  \u2014   Washington is finally getting the snow day it thought this winter had forgotten  \u2014   well, kind of. Never mind that only an inch or two of snow, sleet and freezing rain fell across the city and nearby swaths of Virginia and Maryland overnight. Or that public transportation and the federal government, the region\u2019s largest employer, were open for business. As layers of snow and sleet buried crocuses and wilted Washington\u2019s early cherry blossoms, the roads were unplowed and mostly empty at dawn on Tuesday. Business owners who decided to open anyway shoveled front walks only to see them recoated in slippery slush. Even lawmakers in the House of Representatives, who are racing to move major health care legislation forward this week, elected to give themselves something of a snow day on Tuesday. Citing the rash of canceled flights across the country, they postponed all votes until Wednesday. Inside the Oval Office, President Trump hosted Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, for lunch and a  . Outside, the daily steady shuffle of tourists posed for pictures. David and Michelle Wilding of Dallas were among them, accompanied by their daughters, Hope and Grace. They had imagined something of a greener spring getaway. So snow? \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Mr. Wilding said, especially after a winter at home that did not send its usual dose.  \u2014   NICHOLAS FANDOS The snowstorm threw a wrench into Town Meeting Day, a   pillar of the local democratic process in New Hampshire. With the jury out on what, exactly, elections officials were allowed to do, some town moderators postponed the    votes that make up the backbone of governance here. Others let them go ahead, and voters navigated wind and snow to make it to the polls. \u201cWe had to instruct our voter clerks to tell the voters, please don\u2019t drip on the ballots,\u201d said Wayne Colby, the town moderator in Henniker, N. H. west of Concord. \u201cI grew up in New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. Colby said, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t have snow days for elections. \u201d The town meeting, where voters hash out the budget or other issues related to fire and police departments, is older than the state itself. It is also a day of voting for local offices, ordinance changes or bonds. When it became clear that the day would collide with a major winter storm, some town moderators wondered if they could postpone their votes and meetings. The answer from the governor? It\u2019s not clear, but please don\u2019t. \u201cGiven that there are differing opinions, the best we can do is strongly recommend that all towns stay open for voting tomorrow,\u201d said Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican. The issue has become the latest disruption in a state that is reeling over accusations of widespread voter fraud by President Trump, and comes on the heels of a number of proposals by Republicans to tighten voting rules.  \u2014   JESS BIDGOOD'"}, "time": 1742561714.7710776}
