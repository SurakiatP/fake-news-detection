An email released by Wikileaks reveals Podesta was invited to a \u201cspirit cooking dinner\u201d by performance artist Marina Abramovic, and you can rest assured that it\u2019s not anything like it sounds. \\n\u201cI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina,\u201d an email dated June 28, 2015 read. \\nShortly after, the emails, which was sent to Podesta\u2019s brother Tony, was forwarded to john with the message, \u201cAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.\u201d \\nNow you\u2019re probably wondering what all the fuss is about, and I seriously can\u2019t blame you. So let\u2019s turn to Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars for a little background on what this \u201cspirit cooking\u201d is really all about. \\nSpirit cooking refers to \u201ca sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley\u201d and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a \u201cpainting\u201d. \\nAccording to Marina Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. \\nThe video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the \u201crecipe\u201d for the \u201cpainting,\u201d which is comprised of the words, \u201cWith a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.\u201d \\nThe ceremony is, \u201cmeant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism \u201cAs Above, So Below.\u201d \\nBelow is a video of Abramovic conducting the satanic ritual: \\nHow creepy. Even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goat\u2019s head \u2013 a representation of the Satanist symbol Baphomet. The Podestas\\'\"Spirit Cooking\" dinner?It\\'s not what you think.It\\'s blood, sperm and breastmilk. \\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 \\nYeah\u2026 \\nIf you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Sean Brown on Facebook , and check out his website, politicalcult.com . \\nGod Bless.
