Sanders said, \u201cWell, I think what is clear to anyone who looks at where the Democratic Party today is, that the model of the Democratic Party is failing. We have a Republican president who ran as a candidate as the most unpopular candidate in modern history of this country. Republicans control the House, the Senate,   of governor\u2019s chairs and in the last eight years they have picked up 900 legislative seats. Clearly, the Democratic Party has to change. \u201d \u201cAnd in my view what it has to become is a grassroots party, a party which makes decisions from the bottom on up, a party which is more dependent on small donations than large donations, a party, john, that speaks to the pain of the working class in this country. The middle class is shrinking. 43 million people living in poverty,\u201d he continued. \u201cAlmost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1%. People can\u2019t afford to send their kids to college. They can\u2019t afford childcare. They can\u2019t afford health care. The Democratic Party has to take the lead, rallying young people, working people, stand up to the billionaire class, and when we do that, you\u2019re going to see voter turnout swell. You\u2019re going to see people coming in and running for office. You\u2019re going to see Democrats regain control of the United States Congress. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564028.5435648}
