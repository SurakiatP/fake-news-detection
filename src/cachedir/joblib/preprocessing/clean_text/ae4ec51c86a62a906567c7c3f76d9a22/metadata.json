[While honoring Tony   actor Billy Porter with the evening\u2019s Vitto Russo Award on behalf of his LGBT advocacy, O\u2019Donnell, who was not previously announced as a presenter at the event, pulled out a cell phone and  \u201ctexted\u201d Trump, according to Variety.  \u201cF*ck you. Donald. From, the gays,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cSent. \u201d The 28th annual GLAAD Media Awards at the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan honored individuals and media properties that best represented acceptance and inclusivity of the LGBT community over the past year. The night\u2019s big honorees included Porter, Daily Show host Trevor Noah, and actress Debra Messing, who was honored with the organization\u2019s Excellence in Media award. O\u2019Donnell also pledged $100, 000 to fight   legislation at the event, according to a GLAAD press release. The actress and comedian has feuded with Trump for years. The award show\u2019s host, television personality Ross Matthews, also took aim at Trump during the event. \u201cWe have big stars here tonight. We have more stars than a Trump inauguration,\u201d Mathews said, according to Variety. \u201cTo be fair, my Yelp review of the Burger King in Times Square has more stars than Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201d Matthews also reportedly noted that the ballroom in which the awards show was being held was the same one used by Trump to deliver his victory speech after winning the presidential election in November. \u201cSince this is the room where Trump won, we\u2019re going to sage the room,\u201d he joked, pulling a stick of incense and a lighter from his pocket. But Matthews and O\u2019Donnell weren\u2019t the only two stars to slam the president during the show. Will and Grace star Messing criticized Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, while accepting the Excellence in Media award. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to simply say that women\u2019s issues are important to you. It\u2019s time to do something. You can change the lives of millions of women and children just by telling your dad stories about real people who are suffering,\u201d Messing addressed Trump\u2019s eldest daughter.  \u201cPlease stop blindly defending your father and start defending what you say you believe in,\u201d the actress added. Other big winners on the night included MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow (Outstanding TV Journalism Segment, \u201cGay Community in U. S. \u2018Forged in Fire\u2019\u201d) Tegan  Sara (Outstanding Music Artist) Teen Vogue (Outstanding Magazine Overall Coverage) and the Oxygen network program Strut (Outstanding Reality Program).
