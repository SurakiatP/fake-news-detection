Ryan and Senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte on Friday, moving to heal a deepening rift within the Republican Party touched off by Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the parents of a slain American soldier. \u201cI support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally here after announcing his backing of the senators. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. We may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree. \u201d Mr. Trump ignited a controversy within his party on Tuesday when he said he was not \u201cquite there yet\u201d in supporting Mr. Ryan, echoing a similar line of doubt that Mr. Ryan, the nation\u2019s most powerful elected Republican, had cast before eventually endorsing Mr. Trump for president. The endorsement on Friday, in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state, Wisconsin, had the rollout of a carefully crafted campaign event. A   email was sent to supporters immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement. Moments later, subscribers to Trump campaign texts received an alert that said, \u201cParty unity will help Make America Great Again. \u201d He read the endorsement from a script. But before he got to those words, he spent several minutes in the    mode he is known for. He predicted that the Green Bay Packers would have a strong season, excoriated Hillary Clinton and argued that the news media had misconstrued his suggestion at a previous event that a crying baby be escorted out. \u201cThe baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI want to sponsor that baby. \u201d Mr. Trump turned the speech into a   trifecta. He threw his support to Ms. Ayotte, who is facing a tight race in New Hampshire to retain her Senate seat. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain, an Arizona senator, are also up for   beginning with primaries next week. \u201cI need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the change we have to make,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added, \u201cI understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan\u2019s big tent within the party. \u201d \u201cBig, big tent,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember?\u201d He paused to ask the Democrats in the crowd to raise their hands. Hardly anyone made a sound. Mr. Trump, looking unimpressed, offered that he did not need Democrats anyway. With the speech, Mr. Trump sought to move past a tumultuous week that began with his disparaging members of a Gold Star military family who had spoken out against him at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks drew rebukes from many Republicans, including Mr. Ryan, Mr. McCain and Ms. Ayotte, and set the course for the next few days. He caused a tempest with his remarks regarding Mr. Ryan and another with repeated proclamations about viewing a \u201csecret tape\u201d that showed Iran receiving pallets of cash from the United States. Perhaps signaling that he was in a forgiving and unifying mood, Mr. Trump on Friday morning issued a rare admission of an error, explaining on Twitter that the footage he had thought was a secret tape was instead a widely shown clip of American prisoners arriving in Geneva after being released by Iran. His squabbling with Mr. Ryan and the senators threatened to further splinter Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the party and infuriated many officials, including Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, publicly, but peacefully, disagreed with him and backed Mr. Ryan. Mr. Priebus had made clear he hoped that Mr. Trump would get behind Mr. Ryan and the senators but told the nominee that he had to make the decision on his own. The endorsement of Mr. Ryan is unlikely to assuage some Republicans who are concerned by the combative Trump campaign and have grown frustrated that the   controversies have made it more difficult to focus on Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee. On Friday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio told CNN that he was considering voting Democratic for the first time. \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves,\u201d Mr. Kasich said in response to a question on the possibility that he would not vote for a Republican for president. He added: \u201cI wish that I could be fully enthusiastic. I can\u2019t be. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen at the end. \u201d In Wisconsin, a battleground state where Mr. Trump lost a primary decisively to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and endured unrelenting criticism from local conservative radio hosts, the speaker of the State House of Representatives greeted Mr. Trump with an open letter to fellow Republicans, saying, \u201cWe are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans. \u201d \u201cAs Donald Trump has said stupid things and been rude to so many people over the past year, I usually chalked it up to inexperience and the spotlight of an incredibly hostile press,\u201d the speaker, Robin Vos, wrote. \u201cBut since the convention, his lack of judgment has got to concern even the most ardent Trump supporters. \u201d And less than an hour before Mr. Trump took the stage, Mr. Ryan gave an interview to WISN, a Milwaukee radio station, offering more criticism of the presidential nominee. \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t keep doing things like this and distort conservative principles that we have to defend,\u201d Mr. Ryan told the station. He said he had not \u201cchanged anything\u201d with regard to his support of Mr. Trump, but added: \u201cI wish he would be a little more disciplined. What I say to him privately and what I\u2019ve said publicly is Hillary Clinton is the one to focus on, not another Republican, not a private citizen criticizing you. \u201d Mr. Trump made his endorsement after striking notes of unity on Friday afternoon at a rally in Des Moines. He praised Mr. Priebus, saying he was doing a \u201cfantastic job,\u201d and complimented Mr. Pence, who was on the campaign trail with him for the first time since they had taken divergent positions on Mr. Ryan\u2019s primary campaign. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s O. K.,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Iowa crowd. \u201cVote for Pence because it\u2019s the same thing. \u201d Mr. Trump also focused his message in Des Moines on Mrs. Clinton, peppering his remarks with extended riffs and insult lines against her and President Obama. \u201cShe is pretty close to unhinged,\u201d Mr. Trump said, criticizing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s immigration and foreign policy positions, in particular with regard to Iran. He also floated a conspiracy theory that the National Security Agency had the 33, 000 deleted emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account (there is no record, report or indication that this is true). \u201cDoes N. S. A. have them? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSome people have been saying that, that the N. S. A. has them. \u201d The Clinton campaign has been quick to seize on Mr. Trump\u2019s recent controversies. At a rally Friday afternoon in Milwaukee, the Democratic   nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, took aim at Mr. Trump for withholding endorsements of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve been talking about jobs, Donald Trump has been going after a family of a war hero, or Donald Trump has been going after fellow Republicans and talking about why he won\u2019t endorse them in their primaries,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about jobs, and Donald Trump is basically shadowboxing with every enemy he can think of instead of talking about what Americans want to talk about. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563336.1763017}
