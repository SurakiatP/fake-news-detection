It\u2019s totally sexist, misogynistic \u2014 she\u2019s cleaning for seven dwarfs.\u201d \\nThe 1937 Disney animated film pits the titular White against an evil witch, with a colorful cast of dwarves for her to take care of. The \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d singer went on to clarify that it\u2019s not how White spends her time that bothers her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a woman who chooses to stay at home with her family, it\u2019s a hard-ass job, but it\u2019s the way it\u2019s spoken about,\u201d she said. \\nAs an artist, Keys has been known to create anthems for change and focusing on individuality. \u201cFor the first time, I\u2019m recognizing how art, activism, socially what we\u2019re going through, all go together,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the longest time I thought it was all separate.\u201d \\nBlah, blah, blah.
