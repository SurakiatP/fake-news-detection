[\u201cI will say this: I think the table has been set,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cThe tone I think has been very, very good. The Washington establishment is often obsessed with the notion of things running smoothly, and why are things not running smoothly. The problem with that is, it\u2019s kind of akin to saying \u2018my car is running well\u2019 as we drive over the cliff. \u201d  \u201cYou don\u2019t want things to run smoothly if bad decisions and bad leadership is occurring, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve had for a long time,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo I like very much the tone that has been set, that business as usual is not good for the country, that there needs to be change, that there\u2019s rampant corruption and  . The tone has been very good. \u201d \u201cIn the first hundred days, there has not been a lot of movement in terms of legislation or actions that need to be taken,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president has instituted this policy where there\u2019s a ban on lobbying if you serve in the Trump administration. Great idea in theory the reality is, it\u2019s not really a law, it really can\u2019t be enforced, somebody can ignore it when they leave. \u201d \u201cMy hope is that we\u2019re going to see, in combination with people in the Freedom Caucus and other reformers, working with this administration to really get at the root of the business model of official Washington,\u201d said Schweizer.  \u201cWhat I always tell people is, if you don\u2019t like the decisions that are being made and you feel like Washington, DC, is unresponsive to you, chances are it\u2019s because somebody is being paid off or palms are being greased. The reason we don\u2019t have representative government is because we have corruption, and we have payoffs. That\u2019s really the root cause, in my mind, of a lot of the issues we\u2019re talking about today,\u201d he said. Schweizer said there are \u201ca number of reforms that have been floating out there for a couple of years\u201d that would help to drain the swamp. \u201cSome of them have been pushed by guys like Sen. Rand Paul, others of them going back 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them I think would be term limits. I was not a big fan of term limits. I think term limits now are a great idea for Congress. It\u2019s the way you get entrenched people out of there, and I think nobody is irreplaceable. \u201d \u201cThe second thing is, you need to have a lifetime ban on lobbying by members of Congress when you leave, and you need to have a ban on lobbying by immediate family members,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe third reform that I think would be very helpful is one that Rand Paul has pushed, which is a   requirement. \u201d   \u201cOne of the ways in which they hide a lot of nasty things in legislation is, there will be a big highway bill, and they will insert some obscure language two or three sentences is sometimes all it takes, and it could be related on a totally different subject,\u201d Schweizer explained. \u201cThey insert it into the bill, and then, lo and behold, everybody realizes after that transportation bill becomes law that there was some boondoggle inserted. Under a   rule, you could not attach unrelated issues, or embed them or amend them, to complex pieces of legislation. \u201d \u201cThose three things  \u2014   term limits, a ban on lobbying by congressmen and their family members, and   ruling  \u2014   I think would be very powerful in getting started this process of draining the swamp,\u201d he recommended. Schweizer gave the media a poor grade overall for monitoring Washington corruption during the Obama years, although he acknowledged there are \u201csome great reporters out there that do work individually. \u201d \u201cThe large news organizations, I think either some of them certainly had an ideological or philosophical predilection to support Barack Obama. I think second of all when you did have honest news outlets and honest reporters, there\u2019s the resource issue. They just aren\u2019t willing to spend money on it. But the third issue is this issue of transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been critical, I think, that the Trump administration should not stop releasing the White House visitor logs. I think that is a transparency issue that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cYes, I know that in the Obama administration, if somebody in the White House wanted to meet with a lobbyist, instead of doing it in the White House where it would be logged, they would go across the street in a coffee shop, so there are ways around it. But I do think it\u2019s important for there to be transparencies, so I would urge the Trump administration to reverse itself on that issue. \u201d  He said there was \u201cpositive work being done by the Trump administration\u201d in the area of regulatory reform. \u201cThis problem of transparency is a vital one. The reason that bills are so complex, or regulations put out by the EPA are so complex, is because people get paid for complexity,\u201d said Schweizer. \u201cThis is a business model. It\u2019s not just about liberals at the EPA who want to control people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s about people who work for the EPA who know that if you make a regulation complex and hard to understand, the person that wrote that can quit their job and get a very, very lucrative consulting career, by being hired by companies to comply with the rules the wrote. That\u2019s another area where we have this problem of the revolving door where reform needs to occur. \u201d  \u201cIt begins with transparency. It\u2019s like having good intelligence on the battlefield. You can\u2019t know precisely how to respond to the enemy unless you know where the enemy is lurking. That\u2019s what transparency allows us to do with corruption  \u2014   find out where it\u2019s lurking,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope on the area of transparency, where it comes to the big infrastructure projects, we\u2019re going to see transparency, and we\u2019re going to really see a commitment to making sure that the infrastructure projects being done reflect the interests of the country,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who believes that spending money on infrastructure is a legitimate action for the government. This is part of the nerve system of the country. \u201d  \u201cThe problem is that things like the Transportation Committee in the House of Representatives, these massive infrastructure projects often are designed not so much to meet the infrastructure needs of the country, but to line the pockets of the supporters of the politicians who are crafting and designing these projects,\u201d he warned.  \u201cI think the infrastructure project is important. I think it\u2019s going to be helpful to the country. I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s long overdue, having driven roads all around the United States. I think we\u2019re all aware of the shortcomings there. But again, it\u2019s going to be crucial how it\u2019s done,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis is a classic problem in Washington, DC,\u201d Schweizer recalled. \u201cYou go back and you look at Ronald Reagan, you look at FDR. It\u2019s not just a question of having a certain idea we\u2019re going to implement and do this, it\u2019s how it\u2019s implemented. So often, presidents get tripped up because the Deep State, or the permanent political class, essentially hijacks the project and says, \u2018Yeah, we think infrastructure\u2019s a great idea. We\u2019re now going to use this massive program to serve our terrific purposes and to help our people, rather than really design something for the benefit of the country. \u2019\u201d  \u201cI think infrastructure\u2019s important, and I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019re going to have sufficient transparency so it\u2019s not hijacked by the permanent political class,\u201d he stressed.
