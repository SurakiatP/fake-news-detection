Immediately after his campaign announced that he would leave the United States for a \u201c  meeting\u201d at the Vatican, questions arose about the wisdom of the trip. The critical New York primary was just days away. One official of the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which hosted the conference Mr. Sanders would attend, even suggested he had fished for the invitation. Most critically, there seemed to be little chance that Mr. Sanders would meet the Vatican resident whose name he frequently invokes. Pope Francis, it turned out, would not be visiting the conference of the academy, an   think tank of the Vatican. Politically, a trip to Rome without a meeting with Francis would have been a blunder, Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Fordham University who is teaching at Yale, had said on Friday. \u201cThe point is to make sure you are going to get an audience with the pope,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything short of an actual visit will probably be a mistake. \u201d Mr. Sanders continued to hold out hope. \u201cI certainly would be delighted and proud if I had the opportunity to meet with him,\u201d he said before leaving New York. He also had two things going for him: his host, Bishop Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, an Argentine who is the chancellor of the academy and happens to be close to Francis, and his hotel room, also close to the pope. Mr. Sanders was to stay in a   room at Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where Francis keeps his residence. \u201cSo it won\u2019t be difficult to find the pope,\u201d the bishop said last week, seeming to hint at something. On Thursday, the day before the conference, a Vatican spokesman appeared to end all speculation, saying, \u201cThere won\u2019t be a meeting with the Holy Father. \u201d Bishop S\u00e1nchez Sorondo dismissed the statement as \u201cRoman gossip. \u201d But final word, it seemed, came Friday afternoon in the form of a handwritten letter from the pope apologizing to conference attendees for his absence. \u201cI will keep them all in my prayers and good wishes, and send them my heartfelt thanks for their participation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMay the Lord bless you. Fraternally, Franciscus. \u201d Around 5:30 p. m. Friday, the conference\u2019s business ended and Mr. Sanders made an appointment for dinner at the Casa Santa Marta with his foreign policy adviser, Jeffrey D. Sachs, the economist and a fellow conference participant. Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, sat with Mr. Sachs and his wife, Sonia, for a soup and buffet dinner, where they were joined by Bishop S\u00e1nchez Sorondo and Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga of Honduras, the pope\u2019s   man and one of the Vatican\u2019s top power players. \u201cIt was a   conversation,\u201d Mr. Sachs said. \u201cIt was about issues of the church and its history, about Honduras and foreign policy. \u201d But the most important words occurred in the middle of dinner, when a personal secretary for Francis arrived with the news Mr. Sanders had been hoping for, Mr. Sachs said. If Mr. Sanders were in the foyer of the Casa Santa Marta at 6 a. m. the next day, he would be able to speak briefly with Francis as the pope headed to the airport for his Saturday trip to Greece, where the pope would be addressing the migrant crisis. So early Saturday morning, Mr. Sanders stood in the marble foyer, which looks out onto a large cobblestone drive just inside the Vatican walls. Joining him were his wife, Mr. Sachs and his wife and Bishop S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, the senator\u2019s de facto Vatican fixer. The pope, speaking to reporters on his plane later in the day, described the meeting. \u201cThis morning when I was leaving, Senator Sanders was there,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHe knew I was leaving at that time, and he had the courtesy to greet me. \u201d No photos of the encounter were permitted, but Mr. Sachs said the senator was delighted all the same. He was beaming as he left the guesthouse, and celebrated the informal audience with a victory lap of sorts in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica along with Mr. Sachs and the bishop, passing Bernini\u2019s Baldacchino, a monumental bronze canopy over the papal altar, and Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0. Aware that his every statement is parsed for deeper meaning, Francis said he was simply being polite, not political. \u201cI shook his hand and nothing more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone thinks that greeting someone means getting involved in politics,\u201d he added, laughing, \u201cI recommend that he find a psychiatrist!\u201d But the candidate was excited to talk about his coveted souvenir. \u201cI conveyed to him my great admiration for the extraordinary work that he is doing all over the world in demanding that morality be part of our economy,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters aboard the plane as it rushed him back to the campaign in New York.'"}, "time": 1742561760.7937894}
