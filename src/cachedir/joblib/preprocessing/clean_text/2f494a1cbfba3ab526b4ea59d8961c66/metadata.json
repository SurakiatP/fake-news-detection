[\u201cAt one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which concerned and confused me,\u201d Comey said.  Comey made his remarks during a Senate hearing, offering testimony about the ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election and the decision by former President Donald Trump to fire him. He acknowledged during the hearing that there were other reasons why he felt he had to make the statement about Clinton\u2019s investigation, including \u201cone significant\u201d reason, which had to remain classified. He said that Lynch\u2019s meeting on the tarmac with former president Bill Clinton during the campaign was the ultimate reason why he decided to make a public statement when the department decided not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. \u201cIn a ultimately conclusive way, that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the Justice Department,\u201d he said. Comey confessed that he followed Lynch\u2019s advice, admitting that he could have resisted more. \u201cI just said this isn\u2019t a hill worth dying on and so I just said, \u2018O. K.,\u201d Comey said, but added that he was \u201cconcerned\u201d that the Clinton campaign was referring to the investigation with the same language.'"}, "time": 1742564319.9507718}
