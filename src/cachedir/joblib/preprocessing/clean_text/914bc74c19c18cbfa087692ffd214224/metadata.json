And Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and other Western leaders are \u201cinvading their own countries,\u201d says radio host Michael Savage, using a foreign army introduced under the banner of \u201cimmigration,\u201d \u201cillegal migration\u201d and \u201crefugee status.\u201d \\nWrites WND.com , \u201cHistory isn\u2019t about tolerance or peace or understanding. History is about war. History is about conflict. History is about invasions \u2014 and the most consequential invasion in human history is well underway.\u201d WND isn\u2019t talking about just an American problem, a German problem, a Swedish problem, or a French problem, but one that threatens to extinguish all of the greatest civilization ever to grace our planet: Western civilization. And this is effected via what\u2019s euphemistically called \u201cdemographic change.\u201d \\nConsider the United States. In 1965, close to 90 percent of Americans were of European descent, were of the Western tradition. That percentage now stands at 62 \u2014 and falls further each passing day. What happened? The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 happened. Introduced by Congressman Emanuel Celler (D-N.Y.) and aggressively promoted in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), it created a situation in which legal immigration would swell from an average of 250,000 immigrants a year to approximately one million, causing the rate of immigration to exceed the rate of assimilation. Moreover, 85 percent of these new immigrants would come from the Third World, leading to rapid demographic change. Note that this is something Kennedy had promised would not occur . \\nAnd now, though the United States is teeming with unassimilable foreigners, and citizens must press buttons to conduct business in their native language. Obama has accelerated the process by inviting waves of illegals into our nation and granting \u201crefugee status\u201d gratuitously. As WND tells us, quoting Savage and discussing his new book on the subject, Scorched Earth : \u201cWe\u2019re being invaded from the south. We\u2019re being invaded from the north, from the east and from the west. You might say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s the way of things,\u2019 and you might get used to it. They\u2019re here, they\u2019re near, they\u2019re everywhere. The question is, why are liberals so quick to embrace this invasion, and why are traditionalists and conservatives like myself so resistant to erasing the borders, language and culture of this great nation?\u201d [said Savage][.] More than 3 million foreigners came to the United States in 2014 and 2015 according to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies. The foreign-born population in the United States, now standing at 43.3 million people, is at an all-time high. Immigrants now make up almost 14 percent of the population, the highest percentage in 105 years. \\nOf course, liberals aren\u2019t only quick to embrace this invasion, they\u2019ve authored it. Why? \\nPower. \\nSeventy to 90 percent of the Third World and Muslim immigrants in the United States vote for leftists upon being naturalized. This pattern holds throughout the Western world. For instance, in France, where Islamic immigration has become a contentious issue, approximately 90 percent of Muslims voted for socialist president Francois Hollande in 2012. Leftists know this and joyfully import voters. As Andrew Neather, former advisor to ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, confessed in 2009, the massive immigration into the United Kingdom over the previous 15 years was designed by his Labour Party to \u201crub the Right\\'s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date.\u201d \\nBut it\u2019s rendering Western civilization \u201cout of date,\u201d a fact that hasn\u2019t escaped hostile foreign entities. As late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in 2006 while commenting on the \u201ccold invasion,\u201d \u201cWe have 50 million Muslims in Europe. There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe \u2014 without swords, without guns, without conquest \u2014 will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.\u201d \\nAnd the \u201cenemy within,\u201d as Savage would put it, celebrates this rending of the West with a demonic hatred of what should be their own culture. Just consider that Swedish multiculturalist social engineer and Social Democrat politician Mona Sahlin actually said in 2001 that \"the Swedes must be integrated into the new Sweden; the old Sweden is never coming back.\" Of course, if a corresponding sentiment had been expressed by a backwoods tribesman about his own tribe, it would be viewed as most odd; many would call him a traitor. And when a rainforest-dwelling tribe is overwhelmed by outsiders \u2014 or when the Tibetans are inundated with ethnic Chinese, which has been happening \u2014 anthropologists will condemn it as demographic and cultural genocide. In the West, though, it\u2019s marketed as \u201cmulticulturalism.\u201d \\nAnd we\u2019re told, \u201cOur strength lies in our diversity.\u201d \\nObama knows precisely what he\u2019s doing, too, says Savage, and is purposely deconstructing our nation. \u201cObama is invading his own country. He\u2019s destroying it from within, like a worm in an apple,\u201d said the radio host. No doubt. In fact, Obama stated last year that over the long term he was \u201cpretty optimistic\u201d that conservatism would be extinguished \u201cbecause this country just becomes more and more of a hodgepodge of folks.\u201d \\nEven more damningly, it was alleged in 2015 that there\u2019s a secret Obama administration plot to use the new illegal aliens as \u201cseedlings\u201d that will develop a \u201ccountry within a country\u201d; these foreigners will \u201cnavigate, not assimilate\u201d as they eventually \u201ctake over the host,\u201d coming \u201cout of the shadows\u201d and \u201cpushing the citizens into the shadows,\u201d the report informed . \\nIn this vein, WND mentions that at issue isn\u2019t just the massive number of im/migrants, but also their nature. The site further points out that this creeping Third Worldism has already turned states such as California into socialist bastions that vote reliably Democrat. For sure. As I wrote in 2010, placing the matter in perspective: If we imported millions of Scandinavians \u2014 who have created the most liberal governments on Earth \u2014 would we expect them to magically change their ideology upon seeing American terra firma? If not, why would we expect otherwise with south-of-the-border socialists? If they choose Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales types below the Rio Grande, why wouldn\u2019t they above it? Geography doesn\u2019t change ideology. \\nIt doesn\u2019t change jihadist zeal, either. Referring to the recent influx of Muslim migrants into the United States \u2014 Obama has welcomed more than 13,000 almost exclusively Muslim \u201cSyrian refugees\u201d already this year \u2014 Savage mentioned that these individuals cannot actually be vetted and thus are unknown quantities. Moreover, he points out that Obama is preventing border-patrol agents and the police from enforcing immigration law, as the president \u201cinvades his own country with a de facto army from other nations,\u201d as the radio legend put it. He characterizes Obama as \u201cdangerous\u201d and as a \u201cpsychopath\u201d bent on replacing the population of his own country. \\nOf course, Obama did telegraph his intentions in 2008, promising \u201cfundamental change.\u201d Note that \u201cfundamental\u201d means \u201c serving as, or being an essential part of, a foundation or basis .\u201d If a man says his wife requires fundamental change, he doesn\u2019t just mean she needs a new hairdo or wardrobe, or even cosmetic surgery. He means that he doesn\u2019t like the very essence of what she is and wants her transformed into a completely different person. \\nAs for the Left\u2019s destruction of the West, it will continue unless and until Western voters enforce fundamental change \u2014 and divorce leftism, permanently, from their cultures and governments.
