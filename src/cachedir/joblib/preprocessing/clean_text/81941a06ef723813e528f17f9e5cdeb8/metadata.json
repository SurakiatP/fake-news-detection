Her capelet, cresting in tusklike spikes, appeared to be   from aluminum foil. Jeremy Scott, the fashion designer, leaned forward and fixed the contestant, Alyssa Edwards, with a look. \u201cI will just come out of the closet here and say, This is fashion,\u201d he said. And because this is also \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars\u201d  \u2014   one of the reality TV shows in the   empire overseen by RuPaul Charles, the   drag \u201csupermodel of the world\u201d  \u2014   Ms. Edwards, a drawling diva out of Mesquite, Tex. accepted the compliment and went on to   Taylor Dayne\u2019s \u201cTell It to My Heart. \u201d For the uninitiated, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d is a competition on the Logo network to find \u201cAmerica\u2019s next drag superstar. \u201d It is a campy, joyful pastiche of \u201cProject Runway,\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d requiring its   superstars to sing, dance, act, strut and   for the title. Along the way, in and out of drag, contestants design and make their own dresses, spackle on their own makeup and merrily talk trash about, and to, one another. Is it any wonder that it has become the fashion industry\u2019s favorite show? \u201cI\u2019ve seen every episode,\u201d said Marc Jacobs, who, like Mr. Scott, has been a guest judge on the show. (Mr. Charles and his friend and sidekick, Michelle Visage, are two of the constant judges, with a rotating roster of regulars and guests.) \u201cIt makes me laugh, it makes me cry. There\u2019s a lot of power in it, and I\u2019m not a big reality TV show fan at all. \u201d It was first recommended to him by the photographer Steven Meisel. Since its premiere in 2009, \u201cDrag Race\u201d has grown from minor curiosity into niche touchstone, largely by word of mouth and social media. This month, after being ignored by most major awards for years, Mr. Charles won his (and the show\u2019s) first Emmy, for best host. Its audience is growing along with its acclaim. The first episode of the eighth season of \u201cDrag Race,\u201d its most recent, which concluded in May, was the most streamed in the history of the series. Viewership for the second season of \u201cDrag Race All Stars,\u201d in which previous contestants come back for a second chance at a crown, airing now, is up 28 percent over \u201cDrag Race\u201d (and more than 50 percent over the first season of \u201cAll Stars\u201d). Winners and   have gone on to perform around the world, record albums and music videos, team up with cosmetics companies and, in at least one case (Laganja Estranja, Season 6) debut a line of   fashion, accessories and dog clothes. In some circles, the show has been celebrated for its politics of affirmation and visibility. In fashion circles, it is celebrated for this, too  \u2014   but also for minting a class of   who look great in a dress. \u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d said Miss Fame, 31, a contestant on Season 7. \u201cThe doors have been opening. \u201d Since being on \u201cDrag Race,\u201d she has attended New York Fashion Week (and will attend Paris\u2019s this season) and made beauty videos for L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which sent her to the Cannes Film Festival, where she walked the red carpet in a Zac Posen gown. Mr. Charles\u2019s queens are now guests at fashion shows and fashion week parties, adored by the biggest names in the industry. Pat McGrath, the doyenne of runway makeup artists, posts images of contestants on her social media accounts. Miu Miu flew several contestants to Paris for a party to celebrate its perfume last July. They also appear in magazines and ad campaigns. Mr. Meisel was on the vanguard when he shot Carmen Carrera (an early contestant who has since announced she is transgender) for W magazine in 2011. In the years since, more have followed. Pearl, a contestant from Season 7, signed with Wilhelmina Models in 2015. This year, Mr. Jacobs featured Dan Donigan (better known by his nom de drag, Milk) a contestant from Season 6, in his spring ads, wearing his women\u2019s collection. And in April, Naomi Campbell gave a   to Naomi Smalls, a Season 8   who chose a drag name in Ms. Campbell\u2019s honor. \u201cI\u2019m loving Naomi Smalls,\u201d Ms. Campbell told a crowd in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of \u201d said Violet Chachki, 24, the winner from Season 7. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong crossover there. \u201d Known on the show as a \u201cfashion queen\u201d (as opposed to a \u201ccomedy queen\u201d or a \u201cpageant queen\u201d) Ms. Chachki\u2019s signature look involved corseting herself to a   so extreme that one of her accessories was an oxygen tank. Since her win, she has been invited to fashion shows by Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Scott, and was among those flown to the Miu Miu party in Paris (\u201c\u201d she said). The photographer Steven Klein shot her for Interview magazine, alongside the runway model Anna Cleveland, and for Italian Vogue, alongside other \u201cDrag Race\u201d alumni, for an article about the club promoter Susanne Bartsch. \u201cI think that a lot of people in the fashion world have an eye on me, because I do have that crossover,\u201d Ms. Chachki said. \u201cIt seems so normal to me now, but even three years ago I never would have imagined it. Now it seems I\u2019m segueing into that world, more so than the drag world. \u201d \u201cThat world\u201d is watching, and discussing. \u201cI was on set shooting an ad campaign a few days ago, and I think half the set watched the show,\u201d said the designer Jason Wu. \u201cIt was totally the topic of the day. Between the makeup artist and the set designer, we\u2019re all huge fans. \u201d Mr. Wu has a long history with RuPaul as a doll designer before he worked in fashion, Mr. Wu worked on a series of RuPaul dolls. \u201cThere are many weekly discussions in the office,\u201d said the designer Joseph Altuzarra, who called RuPaul \u201cthe heir apparent to Oprah. \u201d \u201cA lot of people go into fashion  \u2014   a lot of designers, certainly  \u2014   because they love clothing, they love makeup and hair and beauty. And I think \u2018Drag Race\u2019 is such an extreme version of it that it only makes sense that people in this industry can appreciate it and latch on. \u201d Bianca Del Rio, 41, the winner of Season 6 and one of the show\u2019s most visible stars, said, \u201cFashion people understand drag. \u201d She has toured the world with her   comedy act, and stars in a new independent film, \u201cHurricane Bianca,\u201d that comes out this week. \u201cIt\u2019s a process, and you get to create absolutely anything you want. The only difference with a fashion show is it\u2019s 15 minutes. For us, it\u2019s usually two hours. \u201d Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, two of the executive producers of \u201cDrag Race,\u201d are also documentarians who directed \u201cIn \u2018Vogue\u2019: The Editor\u2019s Eye. \u201d \u201cWe were a little anxious they might find out that we made \u2018Drag Race,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bailey said about his initial meetings with Vogue editors. \u201cThe reverse was completely true. The embrace was fantastic, because they all watch it. \u201d The affection is mutual. Asked who else from the fashion industry he would most like to have on the show  \u2014   besides Mr. Scott and Mr. Jacobs, the models Gigi Hadid and Chanel Iman have appeared  \u2014   Mr. Charles said: \u201cHow fabulous would it be if we got Anna Wintour on the judges panel?\u201d Of course, drag fashion is not runway fashion. Most of the queens on the show make or commission their outfits, only occasionally straying into designer pieces, which rarely come in regular women\u2019s sizes, let alone    \u2019s sizes. (\u201cI can definitely make sample size work,\u201d said Ms. Chachki dryly, \u201cwhich is more than most. \u201d) More to the point, drag fashion satirizes high fashion as much as it celebrates it. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the bohemian creed,\u201d Mr. Charles said. \u201cYou reserve the right to simultaneously love something with all your heart and absolutely hate it to your core. I love creativity and beauty. Fashion is absolutely that. \u201d Which may in part explain why the fashion industry has found \u201cDrag Race\u201d easy to love. Runway fashion, with very few exceptions, exists in a state of permanent seriousness drag sends it up mercilessly, worshiping its extremes while mocking its pretensions with impunity. It comes as a relief. And that is exactly how some use it. After the grueling production of his most recent fashion week show, Mr. Jacobs said, he dragged himself home and got in bed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move, I was so wiped out,\u201d he said. \u201cEight o\u2019clock came around I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, we get to watch \u2018Drag Race All Stars.\u2019 What could be better? Lying in bed, eating pretzels with peanut butter stuffed inside them, watching \u2018Drag Race\u2019 with my boyfriend. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562667.4561725}
