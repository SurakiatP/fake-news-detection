The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. \\nAnd there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. \\n\u201cWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,\u201d write EF Borra and E Trottier in a new paper. \u201cThe fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis,\u201d the two scientists from Laval University in Quebec write. \\nThe research has appeaed in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, under the title \u2018Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars\u2019.
