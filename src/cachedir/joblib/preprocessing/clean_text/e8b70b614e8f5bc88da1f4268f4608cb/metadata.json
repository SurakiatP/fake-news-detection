In California, at least 300 inmates have been involved in hunger strikes at jails in Santa Clara and Merced counties. \\nIn several states, including Virginia, Ohio and Texas, officials have denied claims by activists that strikes have occurred. \\nAlabama officials acknowledged the protest at the Holman prison, 52 miles northeast of Mobile, though they said it was limited to a one-day strike by 60 inmates who worked in the kitchen and license plate plant \u2014 far less extensive than the 10-plus days in September and October that activists described. \\n\"I know there are inmates who are saying there is this big, wide work stoppage but that is just not the case,\" said Alabama Dept. of Corrections spokesman Bob Horton. \\nHorton denied inmate reports that the prison had been on lockdown in response to strikes, which he described as \"peaceful.\" But he also said he understood some of prisoners\\' complaints about living conditions. Holman is \"overcrowded and understaffed,\" Horton said, adding that state officials were working to fix the problem.'"}, "time": 1742563258.0421426}
