Although he has been unable to verify this document or identify the attendees, he believes it to be an accurate portrayal of ongoing Deep State activities against President Trump. The transcript of an earlier meeting can be found here. [Chair: \u201cThe Executive Committee will come to order.  We\u2019ve made a lot of progress, so let\u2019s get right to it let\u2019s go \u2018round to all of our operating divisions. First, the Core Deep State Division. \u201d  Member #1: \u201cThe big news from CDSD, of course, is the defenestration of Flynn \u2014    (Loud applause)  \u2014  \u201cYes, we leak on Flynn, and Flynn gets fired.  What\u2019s not to like? (Louder applause)  \u201cAnd now, The Washington Post is speculating that Flynn could be guilty of a felony.  Those are the flames of a good rumor to fan!\u201d (Even louder applause)  Chair: \u201cIndeed.  And now, of course, the news is that Admiral Harward has turned down the job as Flynn\u2019s replacement at the NSC.  More \u2018disarray\u2019 stories! In fact, it\u2019s clear that we have rattled Trump.  Here\u2019s what he had to say on the 15th: From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked.  It\u2019s a criminal action, criminal act, and it\u2019s been going on for a long time before me, but now it\u2019s really going on. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a    and Trump is the fish in the barrel, if I might be permitted to mix a metaphor. \u201d (Gentle laughter)  Member #1: \u201cEven now, it\u2019s not so clear that the Trump people have come to grips with a change that the Obama administration made in its final days \u2014  that is, to open up \u2018sharing\u2019 among the 17 agencies in the \u2018intel community.\u2019  There was a headline in The New York Times last month, \u2018NSA Gets More Latitude to Share Intercepted Communications,\u2019 that detailed the collapsing of the silos between the agencies \u2014  I wonder if the Trump people really understood what it meant. \u201d Chair: \u201cYes, that was a deft move, I think, by Ben, John, and Jim.  The rules that safeguarded the Obama presidency were amended just in time for the   of his successor.  As Trump himself might say, \u2018Sad! \u2019\u201d Member #2: \u201cIt\u2019s too late for the Trumpkins now.  Even if they reverse the order, we\u2019ll find a way around it \u2014  we\u2019ve proven our capability.  We are legion!\u201d  (Cheers)  Chair: \u201cYes, but still, we always want to protect our people.  We don\u2019t insist on strict legality, but we do have to be careful.  As Gregg Jarrett of Fox News \u2014   (Boos, hisses) \u201c \u2014  reminded his audience of neanderthals, under 18 USC 798, it\u2019s a crime punishable by up to 10 years to leak classified information on a US citizen. \u201d (Murmurs)  Member #3 \u201cSo what?  They\u2019ll never get a conviction from an    jury!\u201d  Member #4: \u201cYeah! We\u2019ll nullify!\u201d  (Cheers)  Chair: \u201cYes, yes.  If and when we have to fight that fight, we will.  Any federal employee accused of anything   will be able to count on getting the finest representation from the best DC law firm, pro bono \u2014  \u201c Member #5: \u201c \u2014  and the same with Snowden, if the Russians send him back to the US as a favor to Trump.  He\u2019ll never get convicted!\u201d  Chair: \u201cWe certainly hope not after all, Snowden\u2019s a hero.  Although I must say, now that we see what our friends at the NSA and other agencies can do \u2014  do to Trump, that is \u2014  I\u2019m starting to like them better. (Mix of grumbles and applause)  \u201cBe that as it may, we don\u2019t have to settle these matters now.  Still, I have some concerns.  I see, for example, that Jason Chaffetz, chair of the House Oversight Committee, wants the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General to look in on what\u2019s happened,  . \u201d Member #6: \u201cThat\u2019s fine!  The DOJ IG is one of us!\u201d  (Cheers, applause) Chair: \u201cI knew it!  Okay, so what else from Core?\u201d  Member #1: \u201cWe\u2019ve been having fun.  As our friends at The New York Times wrote the other day about the hemorrhage of leaks: So far, the White House has had little success in trying to shift the narrative from the Russian contacts to accusations about the leaking of sensitive information by the intelligence agencies, as well as by the FBI. (Cheers) \u201cYes, no success for them.  The Trumpkins can\u2019t change the narrative because we are the narrative.  We own it!  (Cheers, applause) \u201cAnd on a smaller note, we can note with satisfaction this February 16th headline in Politico: \u201cWhite House dismisses 6 over failed background checks. \u201d  At the beginning of any administration, it\u2019s pretty standard that a few people flunk their SF86 questionnaire   background check, but it\u2019s not standard that we\u2019re all reading about it in   time.  We\u2019ve smeared some Trump underlings, good \u2019n\u2019 hard! (Chuckles)  \u201cAnd meanwhile, the Resistance continues in the agencies.  There\u2019s this report  in The New York Times, citing the heroism of our brothers, sisters, and others, at the EPA:  Employees of the Environmental Protection Agency have been calling their senators to urge them to vote on Friday against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump\u2019s contentious nominee to run the agency, a remarkable display of activism and defiance that presages turbulent times ahead for the EPA. (Cheers, applause)  \u201cOf course, as the Chair reminds us, we do have to be careful.  A   rag, The Washington Examiner, published a story the other day, headlined, \u201cGAO: Cyber attack threat from federal employees. \u201d  Which, of course, is exactly accurate, but we don\u2019t need the Government Accountability Office flagging that.   (Murmurs)  \u201cAnd there are other worrisome developments: For example, the House Science and Technology Committee, controlled, of course, by the Repuglicans, has taken note of the fact that federal employees are increasingly turning to encryption, as Politico puts it, to \u2018thwart Trump.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing, of course, but we don\u2019t need the public to know about it. \u201cIndeed, the Committee is showing more aggressiveness than we might like.  In a February 14th letter to the EPA\u2019s IG, it noted that of 3. 1 million text messages sent or received by EPA employees on   devices, just 86 were archived for the federal records.  That is, only about   of one percent were retained. \u201d Member #7: \u201cSo what can the Repubs do about this?  EPA employees have   protection and unions. \u201d Member #1: \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.  And so it\u2019s not so clear that they can do anything to stop EPA people from using federal equipment like that.  We do, indeed, have the system pretty well wired. We\u2019ll just have to watch developments, that\u2019s all.  (Murmurs)  \u201cMeanwhile, by complete coincidence, the FBI is releasing the raw notes from its investigation of Trump\u2019s company\u2019s   practices from more than 40 years ago.  It\u2019s a small thing, but very unflattering to Trump!  Sad!\u201d (Laughter) Member #7: \u201cQuestion: Is there anything that Attorney General Sessions can do to stop this?\u201d Member #1: \u201cSure, he can try.  He can convey his thinking to FBI Director Comey.  And then, of course, we\u2019ll all be reading about the next day!\u201d (Cheers)  Chair: \u201cThank you, CDSD.  Great job, as always.  Next, we will hear from the Guerrilla Theater Division. \u201d  Member #8: \u201cWe at the GTD have been a little bit quiet.  We are in between   you might say. Still, working with the Indivisible people, we\u2019ve laid out a good road map for the months to come, targeting Republicans\u2019 Congressional offices back in their states and districts.  I saw that The Drudge Report just bannered a headline: \u2018Lawmakers brace for protests during Congressional recess.\u2019 That\u2019s us!\u201d   Member #9: \u201cI was a little concerned to see that incident in California, in which a Republican staffer \u2014  a    woman \u2014  for Congressman Dana Rohrabacher was jostled and knocked down she had to be taken to the hospital.  That was concerning to me, and I\u2019ll bet to a lot of folks. \u201d  Member #8: \u201cThe GTD takes a different view.  As we say, in a revolution, things happen.  You can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking eggs. \u201d  Member #9: \u201cSo the end justifies the means?  I\u2019m not sure that all of us agree with that.  And what if there are legal ramifications?  What if prosecutors start linking an individual violent protester to the rest of us?  There could be significant   conspiracy exposure.  Some of us have assets to protect. \u201d  Member #8: \u201cOh, I see.  So you\u2019re a Conciliationist.  I wonder \u2014  \u201d Chair: \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough! We will have no sharp words here at this meeting!  We want an honest exchange of views, but our hostility must be directed toward the real enemy, Trump, and never towards each other.   \u201cI think that the issue of potentially criminal behavior is one that needs to be watched closely.  We don\u2019t want to cross any lines and end up like the campus protesters and rioters of the 1960s, who inadvertently helped Richard Nixon and other backlash Republicans. \u201d Member #8: \u201cI\u2019ll just point out that in the case of the Rohrabacher protest, not a single protester was arrested.  We got away clean.  And always, when confronting the fires of evil, we must fight fire with fire. \u201d Member #9: \u201cFight fascism with fascism?\u201d Chair: \u201cAll right, thank you both you will please both take your seats.  Very well, we will have to consider these   issues in a subcommittee.  Now let\u2019s move on let\u2019s hear from the Popular Culture Division. \u201d Member #10: \u201cThe bestest news, of course, is that Saturday Night Live has turned into    all the time.  Alec Baldwin, Kate McKinnon, perhaps Rosie O\u2019Donnell \u2014  the show is turning into 90 minutes of clubbing Trump!  And the ratings are up! \u201cAnd I just saw that Kate had dinner with Hillary Clinton \u2014  so bygones are bygones, and now Kate can move on toward perfecting her portrayal of Kellyanne Conway.  Although many of us think that she\u2019s already pretty darn perfect!  (Cheers, applause) \u201cAnd in other fabulous news: The    Stephen Colbert has overtaken the    Jimmy Fallon in the ratings.  Indeed, it\u2019s a contest now, every night, to see who can hit Trump the hardest. \u201d  (Cheers, applause) Chair: \u201cExcellent, excellent.  Now let\u2019s hear from the Media Division. \u201d Member #7: \u201cWe have good news: We have, shall we say, persuaded The Wall Street Journal news side into joining with us.  As we know, the Murdoch minions who think that they run the paper had been aloof from our campaign, and so we turned up the heat.  The Times, for example, hit the Journal with both barrels, news and editorial.  And so, thanks to that and plenty of other pressure, the Journal news side switched sides \u2014  they\u2019re now with us. \u201d Member #4: \u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Jim Rutenberg and David Leonhardt!\u201d (Enthusiastic clapping)  Member #7: \u201cAs evidence of our breakthrough, check out this Thursday headline in the Journal: \u2018Spies Keep Intelligence From Trump.\u2018  That is, Trump is not to be trusted \u2014  even the spooks think so!  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence firmly denied the story, but who cares \u2014  the damage is done! \u201cAnd there\u2019s more:  I can point to another success at, if you can believe it, Fox News.  (Murmurs) \u201cYes, Fox!  On Thursday afternoon, Shepard Smith defended CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta\u2019s questioning of Trump during the White House press conference a few hours earlier.  Smith looked at the camera and aimed his comments directly at Trump. And I quote: It is crazy what we are watching every day.  He keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all, and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we are fools for asking the question.  That you call us fake news and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential.  The people deserve that answer, at very least. Member #8: \u201cThat is good, although, of course, Smith will have to do a lot more than that. \u201d Member #7: \u201cHe will, don\u2019t you worry, he will. \u201cI\u2019d also like to take note of an interesting commentary in Axios by Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen.  As they wrote the other day, \u2018The media \u2014  often, but not always, with an assist from   career government employees \u2014  is the new US Oversight Committee.\u2019  Yes!  That is, indeed, the role that we aspire to: The Oversight Committee for the United States! (Loud ovation)  \u201cNow I will say, in closing, that there\u2019s a little bit of disturbing news.  That is, there was a bad story in the Times \u2014  the Times! \u2014  criticizing the very idea of the deep state.   (Murmurs)  \u201cThe headline reads: \u2018As Leaks Multiply, Fears of a \u2018Deep State\u2019 in America.\u2019  The piece openly compared what\u2019s happening here to what\u2019s been happening in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey.  As the article said, this is \u2018bad for everyone  \u2026    inch [ing] deeper into the gray zone of   activities. \u2019\u201d (Murmurs, boos)  Chair: \u201cThank you.  I\u2019ll make a note to myself: It\u2019s time to have a talk with the Sulzbergers.  The quicker we can persuade Carlos Slim, or Mike Bloomberg, to buy the paper outright, the better. (Tepid applause) \u201cNow to the Politics Division. \u201d Member #11: \u201cThank you.  We\u2019ve had some disappointments.  There are still some Democrats in the Senate, such as Heitkamp and Manchin, who are way too friendly with Trump.    (Murmurs) \u201cAnd yet we seem to have brought other   Dems around, such as Donnelly and McCaskill. (Cheers) \u201cSo it\u2019s an ongoing process.  We would love to primary all these   Democrats and take them out, but we\u2019re not sure a progressive can win.  And we certainly can\u2019t afford to lose their seats to the Republicans.  Please be assured that these questions are receiving the utmost attention from the minority leaders.  (Murmurs) \u201cOn a brighter note, we are well on our way to forcing the Republicans in Congress \u2014  both in the Senate and in the House \u2014  to begin formal investigations of Trump, Flynn, Russia, the whole mess.  That\u2019s the ideal, of course we get the Republicans to do the heavy lifting, and we praise them to the skies \u2014  at least until the next election. (Loud cheers)  \u201cAlso, we look forward to reaching out to Evan McMullin, the renegade Republican who trashes Trump at every opportunity.  I don\u2019t know much about him, but given his own background in the deep state, I think we might have the opportunity to work more closely with him.  Unless, of course, we already are, sub rosa  \u2026    \u201d  (Stone silence)  Chair: \u201cThanks very much, PD.  But we\u2019re running out of time.  So let\u2019s hear, now, from the Corporate Division. \u201d Member #12:  \u201cThank you.  I know that we\u2019re pressed for time, so I\u2019ll be brief.  We got Kevin Plank, CEO of Under Armour, to take back his praise of Trump, in the form of a   ad in The Baltimore Sun, no less.  As celebrities and athletes threatened to boycott him and take away the cool, urban appeal of the brand, the stock was tanking.  And so Plank had no choice but to back away.  Such wonderful humiliation! (Loud cheers)  \u201cNext, we have to get through to Elon Musk, and also, we have unfinished business with CEOs such as Ginni Rometty of IBM. \u201d Chair: \u201cThanks, CD, for that brief but inspiring report.  Now to Legal. \u201d  Member #4:  \u201cPerhaps the biggest single challenge we face is persuading Jeff Sessions to recuse himself on   matters.   (Murmurs)  \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order, of course.  At present, Sessions has no intention, zero, of recusing.  But we have just begun to fight, in public and behind the scenes.  We have virtually the whole of the Justice Department on our side, and so we\u2019re working with the IG, the OLC, and others, in the law schools and legal societies, as well as the punditariat, to mousetrap him into recusing.  Because if we can, the resulting investigations, and leaks, will make Watergate look like a dress rehearsal. Wish us luck!\u201d  (Loud cheers) '"}, "time": 1742628556.162262}
