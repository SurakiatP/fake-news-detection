The former officer, Arthur Lasca\u00f1as, said at a news conference on Monday that Mr. Duterte had sponsored the killings of drug and crime suspects while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao. Mr. Lasca\u00f1as has now become the second professed hit man to level such accusations against Mr. Duterte. At least 3, 600 people, and possibly thousands more, have been killed by the police or vigilantes since Mr. Duterte became president in June. Rights groups have said that the police may have ordered the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users, a charge that officials have denied. Mr. Duterte\u2019s spokesman, Martin Andanar, on Monday dismissed Mr. Lasca\u00f1as\u2019s allegations as \u201cpart of a protracted political drama\u201d intended to undermine the president\u2019s leadership. Mr. Lasca\u00f1as, 56, said that he was the leader of the Davao Death Squad, a group that he said Mr. Duterte had formed to go after   drug dealers and petty criminals but that later evolved into a force to eliminate political opponents. He is the second person claiming membership in the squad to speak out against Mr. Duterte, bolstering the explosive testimony of another professed hit man, Edgar Matobato, who has been in hiding since last year, when he linked the president to the killings. On Monday, Mr. Lasca\u00f1as broke down in tears and said Mr. Matobato\u2019s accusations were true. \u201cWe started the salvaging of people when Mayor Duterte first sat down as mayor in Davao City,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people we targeted are criminals and were into illegal drugs. We were implementing the personal orders of Duterte. \u201d \u201cSalvaging\u201d is a euphemism in the Philippines for summary executions. Mr. Lasca\u00f1as said members of the squad were usually paid $400 to $1, 000 for the killings \u201cdepending on the status\u201d of the target. \u201cAll the killings that we committed in Davao City, whether they were buried or thrown in the sea, were paid for by Mayor Duterte,\u201d he said. Mr. Lasca\u00f1as said that he received an allowance directly from Mr. Duterte\u2019s office and that he had led the group for a long time. He said his earlier testimony, made before the Senate last year, was \u201call lies. \u201d He said that two of his brothers  \u2014   whom he identified as Cecilio and Fernando  \u2014   were among the group\u2019s victims and that he had concealed the details surrounding their deaths from the family until Monday. \u201cThey were involved in illegal drugs,\u201d Mr. Lasca\u00f1as said. \u201cNow my nephews know that I was instrumental to the murders. In my belief about the campaign, I had committed this. \u201d He also confirmed Mr. Matobato\u2019s earlier statement linking Mr. Duterte to the murder of Jun Pala, a radio commentator critical of the former mayor and a known supporter of a vigilante group in Davao guarding against Communist guerrillas. Mr. Lasca\u00f1as said he was paid about $60, 000 to get rid of him. \u201cWe planned and carried out the assassination of Jun Pala,\u201d he said. After Mr. Pala survived an ambush, Mr. Lasca\u00f1as said, he met with Mr. Duterte, who told him to take his time in killing the broadcaster. Mr. Pala was shot by gunmen near his home in 2003, in a killing that the police attributed to a Communist rebel hit squad. \u201cThis is the real truth in the Pala murder case,\u201d Mr. Lasca\u00f1as said. \u201cI am one of those who murdered him. \u201d Mr. Lasca\u00f1as also said that he and other members of the squad killed a kidnapping suspect, his pregnant wife, his    and two servants. He said the victims were seized and taken to a quarry, where they were gunned down. He did not say how the bodies were disposed of, but last year Mr. Matobato testified that victims were chopped up and then their parts taken to sea to be scattered. It was not immediately clear what Mr. Lasca\u00f1as would do next, but he has been under the protection of the Free Legal Assistance Group, an organization of rights advocates and lawyers who have criticized Mr. Duterte\u2019s deadly campaign against drugs. The group said that Mr. Lasca\u00f1as had drawn up a sworn affidavit and was ready to testify before any government body, including the Senate. Mr. Lasca\u00f1as\u2019s statements on Monday were in line with Mr. Matobato\u2019s testimony last year. At the time, he said he was one of the first civilians Mr. Lasca\u00f1as had recruited into the death squad, originally known as the Lambada Boys, that was responsible for kidnappings, killings and the bombing of a mosque in Davao. He said the squad answered to Mr. Duterte and his longtime lieutenant, Ronald dela Rosa, now director general of the Philippine National Police. Mr. Andanar, the president\u2019s spokesman, said in his statement on Monday: \u201cOur people are aware that this character assassination is nothing but vicious politics orchestrated by sectors affected by the reforms initiated by the Duterte administration. \u201d \u201cBringing change is not an easy task,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Duterte administration has disturbed, disrupted the establishment. However, we remain undistracted in delivering goods and services to serve the people, not just the interest of the few. \u201d Senator Antonio Trillanes, who has been feuding with Mr. Duterte and who supported Mr. Matobato when he made his accusations last year, said that Mr. Andanar\u2019s statement was intended to divert attention away from \u201cthe issue of the president\u2019s complicity\u201d in multiple murders. Senator Risa Hontiveros called Mr. Lasca\u00f1as\u2019s allegations a \u201cdirect stab at the credibility\u201d of the president that undermined his \u201cmoral capacity to lead. \u201d \u201cThey strengthen suspicions that the death squads responsible for thousands of unsolved extrajudicial killings are \u201d Ms. Hontiveros said. She called on the Senate to investigate Mr. Lasca\u00f1as\u2019s accusations and respond to what she called the \u201cpublic\u2019s clamor for truth and accountability. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563841.4608228}
