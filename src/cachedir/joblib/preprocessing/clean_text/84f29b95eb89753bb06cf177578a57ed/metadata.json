But there is more. \\nScholar Rebecca Gordon, who has corresponded with this writer last summer, has recounted in her meticulously documented study Mainstreaming Torture: Ethical Approaches in the Post-9/11 United States : \u201cWhen I had occasion in Jordan in 2006 to meet an Iraqi sheik who had been tortured by U.S. forces, his first question to our little group was whether all American women were \u2018promiscuous sluts,\u2019 like the ones who had tormented him by forcing him to look at their naked breasts during his detention\u2026The psychological trauma of sexual humiliation had damaged this man sufficiently so that polite conversation with American women, even those who were likely to be sympathetic, was beyond him.\u201d [5] \\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Gordon discusses one case after another and describes what happened when politicians deliberately abandoned the moral order and pursued perpetual wars in the Middle East at any cost. \u201cForcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped\u201d was just a fair game. [6] \u201cPositioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box, with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric torture\u201d was also quite common. [7] Detainees were also sodomized with chemical lights and broom sticks. [8] \\nGordon writes on the very first page: \u201cFor many years, the United States had secretly funded research on torture at U.S. and Canadian universities. One product of this research was the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual with its sections covering \u2018non-coercive\u2019 and \u2018coercive\u2019 techniques, first printed in 1963\u2026. \u201cThe United States had also provided covert training and support to torture regimes in other countries around the world\u2014from Greece to Uruguay, Chile to El Salvador, Indonesia to Vietnam. The Phoenix Program, implemented during the Vietnam War by U.S. armed forces and the CIA, involved the torture and deaths of tens of thousands of Vietnamese, as part of the U.S. counterinsurgency project designed to break the will of the Viet Cong. In the testimony before Congress, military intelligence officer K. Milton Osborne provided some details of the methods used: \u201c\u2018The use of the insertion of the 6-inch dowel into the 6-inch canal of one of my detainees\u2019 ears and the tapping through the brain until he dies. The starving to death of a Vietnamese woman who was suspected of being part of the local political education cadre in one of the local villages. They simply starved her to death in one of the hooches at that very counterintelligence headquarters. \u201c\u2018There were other methods of operation which they used for interrogation, such as the use of electronic gear such as sealed telephone attached to the genitals of both the men and women\u2019s vagina and the man\u2019s testicles, and wind the mechanism and create an electrical charge and shock them into submission.\u2019\u201d [9] \\nBetween 1968 and 1971, the Phoenix Program was responsible for torturing and killing more than twenty thousand people, [10] many of whom had nothing to do with terrorism. These were not isolated cases. The CIA conducted these essentially diabolical operations \u201con several continents.\u201d [11] \\nIf history is not enough, what about the recent charge by Amnesty International that the US-led coalition in Syria has killed at least 300 civilians? [12] And what about Saudi Arabia (a US ally) \u201cdeliberately targeting impoverished Yemen\u2019s farms and agricultural industry\u201d? [13] Stephen Kinzer, a visiting scholar at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, has recently written: \u201cAnyone who believes the United States is not fighting enough wars in the Middle East can be happy this week. We have just plunged into another one. Twice in recent days, cruise missiles fired from an American destroyer have rained down on Yemen. The Pentagon, a practiced master of Orwellian language, calls this bombing \u2018limited self-defense.\u2019 \u201cSince 2002, our drone attacks have reportedly killed more than 500 Yemenis, including at least 65 civilians. We are also supplying weapons and intelligence to Saudi Arabia, which has killed thousands of Yemenis in bombing raids over the last year and a half \u2014 including last week\u2019s attack on a funeral in which more than 100 mourners were killed.\u201d [14] \\nSo the logic is pretty simple: the New World Order ideology does not and cannot make sense at all. And if we have to fight ISIS, then we have to support the Assad government; if we have to support the Assad government, then the whole idea that Assad is a \u201cbrutal ruler\u201d loses its political force; if that idea goes down the tube, then the New World Order propaganda against Assad is categorically false. In short, we can ignore flaming Neocon Charles Krauthammer when he said last November that Assad is a \u201cdictator and a destroyer.\u201d [15] This brings us to another vitally important issue: New World Order agents spent millions upon millions of tax dollars supporting ISIS or al-Nusra in Syria for absolutely nothing. Barnes-Dacey and Levy concluded their article by saying, \u201cWestern leaders have defined ISIS as a threat to their national security. That should now translate into a more nuanced Syria policy, including working with Iran and encouraging the nascent Saudi-Iranian opening.\u201d [16] \\nI simply could not hold my laughter. For decades, New World Order agents in America and Israel have hammered the spurious idea that Iran is a terrorist state and that it wants to \u201cwipe Israel off the map\u201d; [17] they also spent millions upon millions of dollars trying to destabilize the country both politically and ideologically. \\nRemember how Obama \u201csecretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran \u2019s main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding America\u2019s first sustained use of cyber-weapons\u201d? [18] \\nRemember how New World Order agents in America and Israel developed Stuxnet specifically to attack Iran, a country that has zero nuclear weapons? [19] The New York Times itself acknowledged then that the cyberattack was \u201caided by Israel.\u201d [20] \\nIn the same vein, the Washington Post reported that Stuxnet was the \u201cwork of U.S. and Israeli experts.\u201d [21] And it was developed way back in 2007 . \\nRemember how Bush also made false accusations against Iran and even trained the terrorist group the MEK right here in America? [22] Remember how he worked with Israel to perform a covert operation in Iran? \u201cMr. Kissinger, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.\u201d \\nSo, all the tax dollars that were spent on destabilizing Iran for more than a decade was a waste. At the same time, decent American military hospitals continued to lack funding: \\n\u201cmany of the hospitals are so small and the trickle of patients so thin that it compromises the ability of doctors and nurses to capably diagnose and treat serious illnesses, much less take on surgeries \u2026 \\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the hospitals last year served 30 or fewer inpatients a day \u2014 less than a third as many as the typical civilian hospital. Nine served 10 or fewer \u2014 so few that Dr. Lucian L. Leape, a leading patient-safety expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, said, \u2018I think they should be outlawed.\u2019\u201d [23] \\nObviously New World Order agents don\u2019t care either about military hospitals and even soldiers. In fact, they don\u2019t care about anyone at all. They just care about spreading their essentially diabolical system. Soldiers are just pawns. As Henry Kissinger diabolically declared, military men are \u201cdumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.\u201d [24] \\nOnce those \u201cdumb, stupid animals\u201d can no longer be of service to NWO agents, then they just dump them. They have already dumped at least 360,000 thousand veterans, who \u201cmay have brain injuries.\u201d [25] \\n[1] Julien Barnes-Dacey and Daniel Levy, \u201cTo Beat ISIS, Focus on Syria,\u201d NY Times , September 1, 2014. \\n[2] In 2011, the Pentagon declared that the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d could cost at least $5 trillion. \u201cThe $5 Trillion War on Terror,\u201d Time , June 29, 2011. \\n[3] For a recent study on similar issues, see Rebecca Gordon, Mainstream Torture: Ethical Approaches in the Post-9/11 United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). \\n[4] Dan Murphy, \u201cIraq Violence More Than Doubles in 2013: Is Country Headed Off the Cliff?,\u201d Christian Science Monitor , December 20, 2013. \\n[5] Rebecca Gordon, Mainstream Torture: Ethical Approaches in the Post-9/11 United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 53.'"}, "time": 1742628321.8841565}
