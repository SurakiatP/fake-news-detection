She had been distracted while trying to send her boyfriend a topless photo. \\nMiranda Rader told the officer whose patrol car she crashed into that she had been trying to take the photo to send to her boyfriend on Snapchat. According to the police report, when the officer approached Rader, she had an \u201cunclasped brassiere\u201d and was attempting to put her blouse back on. \\n\u201cI asked her why she was not dressed while driving and she stated that she was taking a Snapchat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at a red light,\u201d the officer wrote in the report, according to KBTX-TV. \\nThe officer was in the area because he had been called to a disturbance in the 2500 block of East Villa Maria Road in Bryan. He heard a car braking hard, then a crash. When he turned, he saw Rader\u2019s SUV had crashed into the back of his patrol car. It does not appear that he was in the vehicle at the time. \\nRader admitted to the officer that she was coming from a friend\u2019s house, where she had been drinking wine. She was on her way back to her on-campus dorm. Fortunately, no one was injured in the accident. \\nAccording to Dallas News , the college freshman had an open wine bottle in the SUV and failed parts of a sobriety test before having her blood drawn. \\nIn years past, you only had to warn teenagers about the dangers of drinking and driving, but with the onslaught of social media and apps for smartphones like Snapchat, we now must also caution them against texting naked pictures of themselves while driving. Insane, isn\u2019t it?'"}, "time": 1742563672.0743961}
