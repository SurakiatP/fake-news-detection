{"duration": 0.08890366554260254, "input_args": {"text": "'in: Government , War Propaganda , World News The neocon Washington Post features their extremist views, urging greater war on a sovereign independent nation threatening no one. Former State Department official/current Wilson Center vice president Aaron David Miller challenged Hillary, saying \u201c(s)he\u2019s on the hook to deliver\u201d as America\u2019s next president. If she\u2026back(s) down\u2026what explanation can she use?\u201d The Center for American Progress, founded by her campaign chairman John Podesta, called for greater use of US air power in Syria \u2013 on the phony pretext of protecting civilians. Throughout her campaign, Hillary supported escalated conflict in Syria, not resolving it diplomatically. Expect her to follow through once in office as Obama\u2019s successor, a near-certainty as things now stand. WaPo editors gave retired US Marine General John Allen and Middle East Institute senior fellow Charles Lister feature op-ed space . Both extremists urge \u201cbring(ing) Syria\u2019s Assad and his backers to account now\u201d \u2013 their arguments based on a litany of deception, misinformation and Big Lies, commentaries WaPo features repeatedly, suppressing opposing viewpoints urging peace and stability. Allen and Lister: \u201cFor 5\u00bd years, the Syrian government has tortured, shot, bombed and gassed its own people with impunity, with the resulting human cost clear for all to see: nearly 500,000 dead and 11 million displaced. Since Russia\u2019s military intervention began one year ago, conditions have worsened\u2026\u201d Fact: Syria is Obama\u2019s war, orchestrated by Hillary Clinton, entirely responsible for horrific carnage and atrocities \u2013 using ISIS and other terrorist foot soldiers, supported by US-led \u201ccoalition\u201d air power. Fact: Russia\u2019s intervention in September 2015 changed the dynamic on the ground \u2013 a vital campaign to preserve Syrian sovereign independence and territorial integrity, what neocons like Allen and Lister want destroyed, so America can claim another imperial trophy and keep the Middle East pot boiling, Iran the next target. Allen and Lister: \u201cWhile subjecting his people to unspeakable medieval-style brutality, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has sabotaged diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing a lasting calm to his country.\u201d \u201cThe most recent such diplomatic scheme was trashed not just by Assad, but also Russia, whose aircraft were accused of subjecting a UN-mandated aid convoy to a ferocious two-hour attack in September.\u201d Fact: Syrians overwhelmingly support Assad, reelecting him democratically in June 2014, wanting no one else leading them. Fact: He\u2019s an eminently decent man, concerned about his nation and welfare of his people, doing his job responsibly, defending them from US-imported death squads. Fact: He\u2019s no \u201cmedieval-style brut(e),\u201d a disgraceful Big Lie claiming it \u2013 he and millions of Syrians victimized by US imperial viciousness, its genocidal mass slaughter and destruction, what neocons like Allen and Lister support. Fact: Clear evidence shows US-supported terrorists were responsible for attacking and destroying most of a UN humanitarian convoy for beleaguered eastern Aleppo residents. Allen and Lister disgracefully blamed Russia and Syria for war crimes committed by America, its rogue partners and terrorist foot soldiers in Aleppo and elsewhere nationwide. They called for more assertive US action, claiming \u201c(t)he world will not forgive us for our inaction\u201d \u2013 while hyping the myth of (nonexistent) moderate rebels waging (nonexistent) civil war against a sitting government both writers want toppled illegally, US-controlled puppet rule replacing it. Allen and Lister: \u201cThe credibility of the United States as the leader and defender of the free world must be salvaged from the horrific devastation of Syria.\u201d Fact: Syria was at peace with its neighbors until America and its rogue allies attacked it preemptively without just cause \u2013 raping and destroying the country, massacring its people, displacing half its population internally or externally. Allen and Lister urge escalating conflict, not resolving it responsibly \u2013 nor holding war criminals in America and its allied countries accountable for high crimes too horrendous to ignore.
