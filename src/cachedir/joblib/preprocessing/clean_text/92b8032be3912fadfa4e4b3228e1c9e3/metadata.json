Former FBI director James Comey told the president three times that he was not under investigation for collusion with Russia, but would not reveal that information to the public. That fact that only emerged publicly once the president fired him and suggested publicly that he might have \u201ctapes\u201d of their conversations. On Friday, the president tweeted: \u201cI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt. \u201d I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017, The media widely interpreted that statement as an admission that Trump was under investigation for obstruction of justice for firing Comey. But Sekulow told the Sunday shows that Trump was referring only to claims made by the Washington Post that he was under investigation, and that he had no reason to believe he was actually being investigated. \u201cAs James Comey said in his testimony, and as we know as of today  \u2014   the president has not been, and is not, under investigation [for obstruction],\u201d Comey told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. \u201cyou\u2019re reading more to the tweet than what\u2019s there,\u201d Sekulow said, noting that the Post had relied on \u201cfive anonymous, unnamed sources from unnamed agencies. \u201d Sekulow repeated that message on CNN, telling host Jake Tapper: \u201cLet me be clear: The president is not under investigation   \u2026     The president is not the subject or target of an investigation. \u201d He also called the Post story a \u201cfake report. \u201d Update: On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Sekulow whether Trump had been \u201cnotified\u201d by Mueller that he was under investigation. Sekulow said that he had not. However, confusion erupted when Sekulow suggested that Trump\u2019s tweet referred to the Department of Justice, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s being investigated. \u201d Wallace chalenged Sekulow on that point, whereupon Sekulow clarified again: \u201cWe have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the President of the United States. \u201d \u201cSir, you just said two times that he\u2019s being investigated,\u201d Wallace replied. Sekulow answered that he had simply been describing the \u201clegal theory\u201d under which the president would be investigated, if he were, which Sekulow denied he was. He added that he could not read Mueller\u2019s mind. Wallace then suggested that Sekulow did not actually know if Trump was being investigated. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
