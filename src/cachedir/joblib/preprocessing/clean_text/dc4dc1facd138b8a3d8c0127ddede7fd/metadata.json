Nearly 25 years ago,   (the   star born Tracy Marrow) and Body Count put out that deliberately      response to police brutality, prompting outrage from President George H. W. Bush and police groups everywhere. The heat became too much for even an outspoken West Coast   pioneer  \u2014   \u201cthe vice president was on my bumper,\u201d he said  \u2014   and he agreed to pull the song from new copies of the album. Body Count, which releases its sixth album, \u201cBloodlust,\u201d on Friday, formed when  \u2019s Crenshaw High School friend Ernie C needed an outlet to play impossibly fast guitar. Then well known for vivid     songs like \u201cColors\u201d and \u201cLethal Weapon,\u201d   introduced the band to crowds on the 1991 Lollapalooza tour. Now 59, he has gone on to portray one of television\u2019s   police characters, Detective Fin Tutuola of \u201cLaw  Order: Special Victims Unit,\u201d a point that this \u201cCop Killer\u201d singer notes with a rumbling laugh. On its first album since the 2014 LP \u201cManslaughter,\u201d Body Count remains heavy and uncompromising, threatening   violence on \u201cThe Ski Mask Way\u201d and pausing for political commentary on \u201cNo Lives Matter. \u201d By phone from his Edgewater, N. J. home, where his    daughter was cooing in the background,   cheerfully reeled off expletives abundantly enough to complicate the editing of these excerpts from the conversation.  Why was it important to include a discussion and defense of Black Lives Matter on the album?  Because I just felt people were really confused. \u201cYou think black people, when they say Black Lives Matter, that\u2019s a statement of power. That\u2019s a statement of despair. \u201d It\u2019s like, come on, man, stop killing us. One of my jobs in music is to try to explain stuff  \u2014   \u201cIce, break it down. \u201d I tried to break it down in a way that you understood: We as black people are just trying to be treated as human beings, and our lives are valuable. Body Count has evolved from shocking to philosophical. On this album, you say, \u201cThe ability to kill is innate as our ability to love. \u201d Why? I\u2019m an older guy now, and I see things. Your perspective is different. The early Body Count, I was much more angry, but I didn\u2019t know why. Now I\u2019m trying to explain it. One guy told me the other day: \u201cIce, you\u2019re very lucky, because you\u2019ve been able to see it from the poor man and the   man, and that\u2019s a view very few people get to see. \u201d Also, let\u2019s be real, when I came out, there was no internet. You could shock people easy. There was no Eminem. Last September, you said of Donald J. Trump, then a presidential candidate: \u201cI\u2019m kinda scared of that dude. \u201d Still feel that way? I think everybody does. He\u2019s a little too hotheaded to have that much power. When you\u2019re basically running the biggest army, [for] the most powerful country on earth, you don\u2019t have to be all excited and amped you can\u2019t get aggravated like that. Obama was catching Osama bin Laden [while he was] out to dinner, giving people daps.  . That\u2019s how presidents react. You don\u2019t get at mad at Nordstrom. Like, come on, son. N. W. A made \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d but you did West Coast gangster rap first. Do you ever think, \u201cWhere\u2019s my biopic?\u201d Nah, nah, nah, nah, absolutely not. People were asking, \u201cWas I out first? ,\u201d and [Ice] Cube and them will tell you. Everybody knows. We used to tour together. I\u2019m just glad the homies got their stories told. I have no desire to do a biopic. What if you do a biopic, and nobody comes to see it? Dear God. I\u2019m good. That\u2019s too risky for me. How quickly did you say yes to the insurance commercial in which you are sitting with adorable kids at a lemonade stand? Once I read it, I thought it was funny. I always try to let people know that the guy on the record is me, but also the guy sitting at home with his kid is me, the guy on \u201cSVU. \u201d I\u2019m all those people. I\u2019m not a   person. People look at me like, \u201cOh, wow, I heard your album, I figure you live in a house full of meat hooks, with people hanging. \u201d No, no, no, no, no. The only bad part about it is, I walk around now, people yell, \u201cHey, lemonade!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563537.2984335}
