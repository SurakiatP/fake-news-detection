[\u201cWe were very very close. It was a very tight margin,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after Speaker Ryan\u2019s press conference, saying that they were probably   votes short. According to reports, over 30 representatives opposed the bill before Ryan pulled the bill at the president\u2019s request.  Trump said that the bill\u2019s failure would actually help Congress come up with a better plan to fix Obamacare. Trump admitted that the bill fell short, but blamed Democrats for opposing the bill. But Trump appeared confident that political momentum for repealing and replacing Obamacare would return, despite Republican\u2019s failure to unite behind a solution. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for the last year and a half, that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploding right now. \u201d He predicted a disastrous year for Obamacare, appearing hopeful that even Democrats would back an future solution. \u201cWe will have a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes,\u201d he concluded. Trump thanked his staff, Republican leadership, and even Speaker Paul Ryan for their efforts on the bill. \u201cI want to thank Paul Ryan who worked very, very hard,\u201d he said.
