Rand Paul ( ) on Friday told Breitbart News that several sources have told him that the Obama administration spied on his presidential campaign. [\u201cWe\u2019ve had several people come to us and say that it happened. I don\u2019t have access to that information, but I\u2019ve been very concerned that too many Americans\u2019 information is being culled through without a warrant,\u201d he told Breitbart News.  \u201cI don\u2019t have any facts to say it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cBut numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen so I want to search through, find out why I wasn\u2019t notified. Was it on purpose?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things to be found out, particularly since we found out that Susan Rice was unmasking people and we need to know was there a political motivation, because one of the real dangers in a free society is if government gets so powerful it\u2019s listening to all of our phone calls, the possibility of extortion, the possibility of blackmail  \u2014   all of that goes up exponentially,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, Paul revealed that he had requested information from the White House and the intelligence community on whether he was surveilled by the Obama administration or the intelligence community. I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!  \u2014   Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017,  In a letter Paul sent to President Trump on April 10, he asked that the administration \u201cpromptly investigate\u201d whether his name or the names of other members of Congress, individuals from their staffs or campaigns, were included in queries or searches of database of the intelligence community, or if their identities were unmasked in any intelligence reports or products. Paul said at a CATO Institute speech later that he was sending a new letter Friday morning. \u201cWe have several sources telling us that members of the Obama administration were looking at politicians, particularly who were running for office,\u201d he said.  Paul said he has never received a \u201cGates notification,\u201d which Congress is supposed to receive if the intelligence community reveals the identity of a lawmaker in a National Security Agency intercept.  He said in the new letter, he is asking specifically whether there was a Gates notification for him.  He said he\u2019s heard from people \u201cspecific aspects of a private conversation\u201d he had with President Obama. \u201cHow\u2019s anybody know that? How did General Flynn\u2019s conversation get reported? They keep using the word incidental. Don\u2019t let that let your guard down. There\u2019s a million Americans having their phone calls recorded incidentally. It\u2019s not just a no big deal to have your phone call recorded,\u201d he said.  \u201cParticularly if someone in the intelligence community uses the media to destroy you  \u2026    As an American citizen, I\u2019m horrified that his private conversation was leaked. Does the president not have any privacy in who he talks to?\u201d  Trump\u2019s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was forced to step down after a private conversation he had with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kisylak was leaked to the Washington Post.  \u201cThis is very very worrisome, and what we\u2019ve allowed to happen,\u201d Paul said.  Paul was among several Republican members of Congress who ran for president in 2016. The others were Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) Lindsey Graham ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ). Paul\u2019s query comes after news reports revealed last month that former President Obama\u2019s National Security Adviser Susan Rice had requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officials. She has not denied doing so, only doing anything illegal or \u201cuntoward. \u201d Rice on Wednesday denied an invite from Graham to appear before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Monday to testify on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Rice\u2019s lawyer said in a letter that Rice declined after the subcommittee\u2019s Democrat ranking member had notified her that he disagreed with the invite.  Paul told Breitbart News \u201cI think it\u2019s especially egregious if it\u2019s happening to another branch of government, that one branch of government is spying on the other branch of government and you don\u2019t really have checks and balances. \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t for the life of me think of any reason why I would be part of an investigation. And it also goes further to prove that maybe we have an intelligence community run amok if they\u2019re looking at political figures, because I had nothing to do with any of the other things,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742563041.317769}
