[Dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced a plan Monday to arm as many as one million chavistas seeking to join   gangs on Tuesday in anticipation of the protest.  Addressing a socialist rally on Monday, Maduro announced he would begin expanding the ranks of the National Bolivarian Militia, a creation of late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez meant to arm radical socialists in a nation where legally owning firearms outside of such groups is banned. According to the Fox News report on the rally, Maduro said he was seeking to quadruple the militia\u2019s size from its current 100, 000 membership in the short term. The Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that Maduro was seeking to build a   militia as soon as possible but ultimately sought a   army of socialists to intimidate the opposition into silence. \u201cWe will advance towards the organization and training of one million organized militiamen, trained and armed to defend peace, sovereignty, and the independence of the nation,\u201d Maduro reportedly said. To calm the military, which the opposition has been actively courting into participating in the resistance, Maduro has also announced something he is calling the \u201cZamora Plan,\u201d which   Presse (AFP) describes as \u201ca military, police and civilian operation aimed at combatting a supposed coup attempt\u201d organized by America. Maduro has repeatedly accused the United States generally, and former Vice President Joe Biden specifically, of organizing a   coup against him. He has never produced proof of such a conspiracy. Maduro has faced growing protests since the   Supreme Court attempted to impose itself as the nation\u2019s legislative body last month, nullifying the power of the   National Assembly. After a wave of protests, the Supreme Court backed down on the ruling, but the government nonetheless prevented legislators from entering the assembly for some days. Following this move, the government also banned Henrique Capriles Radonski  \u2014   the governor of Miranda state and opposition presidential candidate in the past two elections  \u2014   from holding public office for 15 years, with little explanation. Capriles is among the leaders organizing Wednesday\u2019s \u201cMother of All Protests,\u201d meant to bring together the   opposition throughout the country to demand Maduro step down. According to the AFP, the opposition plans \u201cto march from 26 rally points toward central Caracas, a   bastion and the seat of government. \u201d   \u201cWe\u2019re scared but we\u2019ve got to do this,\u201d one protester,    Carmen Medina, told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re marching for the freedom of our country. \u201d Speaking to the outlet, Capriles added that he sees the Maduro regime as being \u201cterminal\u201d and protests pivotal to holding \u201cfree and fair democratic elections. \u201d The protest appears to have taken its first victim, a student identified as Carlos Jos\u00e9 Moreno, either 17 or 19 years old. Moreno was shot in the head in the San Bernardino neighborhood of Caracas, and reports indicate he was not participating in the protest. Witnesses say he was shot in the head by colectivos, unofficial roving gangs who attack protesters on behalf of Maduro.
