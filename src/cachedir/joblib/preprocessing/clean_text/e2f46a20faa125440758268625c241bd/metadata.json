The former president\u2019s Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress \u201cEnergizer\u201d because of the way Bill always \u201cperked up\u201d and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cEnergizer,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of Clinton\u2019s lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute McMahon\u2019s claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary wasn\u2019t home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the woman\u2019s name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a president\u2019s family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees. Bill Clinton\u2019s Secret Service name is reportedly \u201cEagle\u201d and Hillary\u2019s is \u201cEvergreen.\u201d The Secret Service may have run out of \u201cE\u201d codenames over the years thanks to all of Bill\u2019s lady friends.
