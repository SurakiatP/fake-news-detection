He also announced the sudden departure of another   executive, Jon Rubinstein, a former senior executive at Apple who was once a deputy to Steve Jobs. Mr. Rubinstein, who joined Bridgewater 10 months ago, is the third   executive in recent years to leave the firm after spending less than a year on the job. Referring to Mr. Rubinstein\u2019s departure, Mr. Dalio said they \u201cmutually agree that he is not a cultural fit. \u201d Craig Mundie, a former   chairman who introduced Mr. Rubinstein to Bridgewater executives, resigned at the end of last year, said two people with direct knowledge of the firm who were not authorized to speak publicly. He and Mr. Rubinstein remain advisers to the firm. Mr. Dalio\u2019s announcement is the latest sign of turmoil at the top of Bridgewater, which manages money for more than 300 pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. Last year, Greg Jensen, one of Mr. Dalio\u2019s longtime lieutenants, who was viewed as his heir apparent, was suddenly stripped of his role as   executive amid reports of a power struggle. Both men denied there was any rift, and Mr. Jensen remains at the firm as   investment officer. With the latest move, Mr. Dalio will not be going far  \u2014   he will remain chairman and   investment officer  \u2014   and it is not clear how much authority he will be willing to yield. Over the years, the firm has developed a corporate philosophy that resembles a cross between a religion and something of a cult. Mr. Dalio named David McCormick, the firm\u2019s president, as   executive with Eileen Murray, who has been a longtime member of Mr. Dalio\u2019s management committee. Some in the industry were encouraged by the announcement. \u201cWe are seeing a peaceful transition of power, usually a positive indicator,\u201d said Putri Pascualy, managing director and credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management. \u201cNonetheless,\u201d she added, \u201cthe real test is over the next few years, on whether the firm can outlast its founder. \u201d Bridgewater has had a frenzy of hires, departures and promotions in recent years, and several prominent executives have suddenly left the firm after short tenures. In 2010, Julian Mack, once a top executive at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Tony Murphy, a former top executive in the Americas for HSBC, left after less than six months on Bridgewater\u2019s executive committee, according to an internal document seen by The New York Times. Other prominent hires were removed from the management committee not long after they joined the firm. A due diligence report for Bridgewater investors from the end of 2011 detailed how Joe Parsons, hired away from GE Capital in 2010, left Bridgewater\u2019s management committee a year after joining the firm. Mr. Parsons left the hedge fund altogether in 2014. Something similar happened with James B. Comey, a former United States deputy attorney general, whom Mr. Dalio hired from Lockheed Martin in 2010 as general counsel. Mr. Comey left Bridgewater\u2019s executive committee in 2011 and left the firm in early 2013. He was subsequently nominated by President Obama to become director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Turnover at Bridgewater is not confined to the management ranks. It is estimated that as many   of employees at Bridgewater leave within the first two years because they have difficulty with its unusual culture, which focuses on a book of philosophical underpinnings penned by Mr. Dalio called \u201cPrinciples. \u201d Bridgewater, which employs about 1, 500 people, most at its secluded corporate campus in Westport, Conn. is widely known for videotaping all employee meetings and encouraging debates on many topics, even some as mundane as what kind of yogurt to stock in the employee dining area. Mr. Dalio has made no secret that life at his firm is not for everyone. \u201cSome people absolutely hate it, and some people could never work anywhere else,\u201d Mr. Dalio said at a hedge fund conference in Manhattan in September. The firm\u2019s culture was the focus of articles in The Times and The Wall Street Journal last year. Mr. Dalio reacted angrily to the coverage, posting lengthy responses on LinkedIn and calling the articles sensational and misleading. Mr. Dalio was annoyed over the Times\u2019s reporting last year on the firm\u2019s handling of a sexual harassment complaint filed by a male employee against his supervisor. On Wednesday, he said he was posting details of the management   on LinkedIn because \u201cour communications often find their way into the media in distorted ways. \u201d Most of the firm\u2019s employment contracts contain stringent   noncompete clauses, and employees are required to sign nondisclosure agreements that often limit the ability of former employees to discuss their time at the firm. An email sent to Mr. Rubinstein seeking comment was answered by an email from a Bridgewater spokesman, who said, \u201cJon asked me to decline on his behalf. \u201d In his letter on LinkedIn, Mr. Dalio said the moves were part of Bridgewater\u2019s   transition strategy in preparation for the day when he would step down. That strategy involved creating a management committee with multiple members in what it has called a \u201cplanful transition from a   boutique to a professionally managed institution. \u201d He added, \u201cAny organization run by a 60+ year old that says that it isn\u2019t in transition is either na\u00efve or disingenuous. \u201d Bridgewater operates three main investment funds. Last year, its All Weather Fund II was up 12. 8 percent, its Optimal fund was up 7 percent, and its Pure Alpha II fund was up 2. 4 percent Mr. Dalio is well known for popularizing the kind of investment called risk parity, which seeks to protect clients from losses when stocks or bonds sell off. The strategy relies heavily on investing in bonds using leverage. The firm has written many white papers on the topic and posted them on its website. Mr. McCormick, the firm\u2019s president, who was Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under President George W. Bush, was said to have been considered for several jobs in the Trump administration. He met with President Trump shortly after the election. Ms. Murray had a   with top executives that culminated in an investigation into an incident involving her and another employee and whether she had lied about her conversations with that employee. Interviews conducted in the investigation, which was led by Mr. Comey, were videotaped and widely seen by employees at the firm and came to be known as \u201cEileen Lies. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564074.7882638}
