I live in Brooklyn and work in Manhattan, two of the most liberal places in the country. But even online, I wasn\u2019t seeing many signs of support for him. How did that blindness occur? Social media is my portal into the rest of the world  \u2014   my periscope into the communities next to my community, into how the rest of the world thinks and feels. And it completely failed me. In hindsight, that failure makes sense. I\u2019ve spent nearly 10 years coaching Facebook  \u2014   and Instagram and Twitter  \u2014   on what kinds of news and photos I don\u2019t want to see, and they all behaved accordingly. Each time I liked an article, or clicked on a link, or hid another, the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought I wanted to see. That meant I didn\u2019t realize that most of my family members, who live in rural Virginia, were voicing their support for Trump online, and I didn\u2019t see any of the   memes that were in heavy circulation before the election. I never saw a Trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds, and the only Election Day selfies I saw were of people declaring their support for Hillary Clinton. To be clear, I\u2019m not blaming the algorithms for what I assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview. They did exactly what I told them to do, blocking out racist, misogynist and   comments, hiding anyone who didn\u2019t support Black Lives Matter, all with such deftness that I had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election. But considering that more than 40 percent of our country\u2019s population consumes news on Facebook, finding alternative perspectives shouldn\u2019t have been that hard. I knew about Eli Pariser\u2019s theory on filter bubbles, or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see, and even so, I still chose to let algorithms shape how I perceive the world. Everything I could want to see is available at my fingertips, and yet I didn\u2019t look. In April, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network. Facebook, he said, has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet. \u201cThe internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community, and we are all better off for it. \u201d But that\u2019s not what has happened. Zuckerberg\u2019s idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site. On Facebook, the political divide has only been entrenched further. It\u2019s the BuzzFeed dress debate, only for our entire lives: We are two countries, one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold. The internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another. But they are rapidly disappearing. Most social media  \u2014   like Facebook and Instagram  \u2014   is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it, but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness, a Gal\u00e1pagos of sorts, where culture thrived untouched. They included Vine (whose closure was announced in October) and Snapchat, and even Tumblr, which were homes for marginalized ideas, theories and lifestyles. The   app Vine was the first place I got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own, including those of the Middle East. I was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them: prospering, aware. A young woman living in Saudi Arabia who goes by the name Amy Roko used Vine to show clips of herself living her life  \u2014   her version of normalcy  \u2014   at the mall, goofing off at home. In her most viral video, she stares into the camera, her face covered in a niqab, save for her perfectly outlined eyes. \u201c[expletive] called me ugly,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI said, [expletive] where?\u201d The emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath. I was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own. Vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community. But Vine links could be shared independent of the network, and people did so with abandon, meaning that Vines appeared scattershot around the web, defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds. They could land on your screen via text message, direct message, email. Roko\u2019s Vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black American named Brionna London, who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty. You can draw a straight line from brown women in Saudi Arabia to black women in America, a marvel unto itself, a window into the way the internet flattens space and time  \u2014   a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides. At Vine\u2019s peak, it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of times, and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities: that, say, black kids in New Orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in Florida. (At the very least, they shared a similar humor and taste in music, which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as well.) And yet Twitter, which owns Vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers, could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature (which reportedly costs millions a month to maintain) afloat. Following news about Twitter\u2019s decision to close the service, there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing Vine\u2019s remains. But it\u2019s most likely too late to salvage the community there. In its earlier days, Snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange. The app had an incredible series on \u201ccity life\u201d that gave users direct windows into different worlds. People submitted short video diaries about life in their cities, which the company compiled into a single video, viewable by anyone using the app. I remember feeling delighted watching people in Istanbul and S\u00e3o Paulo showing off their routines and customs. But the company is now prioritizing \u201clive stories,\u201d which feature more mainstream events like the Super Bowl and music festivals. The effect is still fascinating, but less intimate. Snapchat seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar. The future of Tumblr, the blogging platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender theory, critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the internet, is the most uncertain. Yahoo, its parent company, succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by Verizon, raising questions about the future of its properties. What we\u2019re seeing with Snapchat, Tumblr and Vine reflects a larger shift in the   economy.   content, by and large, is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies investors, and as a result, most   companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams. One of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging. Semiprivate messaging applications  \u2014   group text threads and applications like WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook) and Slack  \u2014   have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for conversation, a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks. New features are introduced daily, it seems, to make messaging with your friends more \u201cfun. \u201d The latest version of the iPhone\u2019s software includes the ability to make messages \u201cexplode\u201d with confetti. WhatsApp now offers the ability to tag people in messages, as you might tag them in a photograph online. These changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications overseas, which used similar features to attract and retain customers. (Line, a Japanese company that built an addictive messaging app with 220 million monthly users worldwide, had one of the biggest initial public offerings  \u2014   $1. 1 billion  \u2014   earlier this year.) These new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter together, by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large. What happens when we would rather look inward? I have found something of an answer in a short story called \u201cThe Great Silence,\u201d by Ted Chiang, about humankind\u2019s search for signs of alien life. The story is narrated by a parrot in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. \u201cTheir desire to make a connection is so strong that they\u2019ve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe,\u201d the creature begins. \u201cBut I and my fellow parrots are right here. Why aren\u2019t they interested in listening to our voices?\u201d The paradox is not to be missed: We are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with. The story ends on a somber note. \u201cHuman activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction,\u201d the narrator explains. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it maliciously. They just weren\u2019t paying attention. \u201d Chiang\u2019s lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment. Social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with people instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we don\u2019t agree with. But if we can\u2019t pay attention to one another, we might as well not live on the same planet at all.'"}, "time": 1742628544.534094}
