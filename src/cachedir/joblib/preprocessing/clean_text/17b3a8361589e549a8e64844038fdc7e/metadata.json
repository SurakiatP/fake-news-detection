You must have done something seriously wrong to have pissed off the big man upstairs to such a point that he moved you from the ledger marked \u2018a normal death\u2019 to the one marked \u2018a spectacularly horrific death\u2019. \\nSee God lets a lot of people die in their sleep, or surrounded by loved ones after a long and fulfilling life. But you? \\nHe chose for you to plummet to your death from a mile in the sky. That\u2019s quite a swing, don\u2019t ya think?
