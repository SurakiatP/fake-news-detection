But after Tuesday\u2019s election, the states bordering the Pacific Ocean feel increasingly like an island unto its own. While large parts of the American electoral map, particularly in the industrial Rust Belt, turned more Republican in Tuesday\u2019s election, California went more Democratic, with 61. 5 percent of voters choosing Hillary Clinton, the highest percentage for a Democratic presidential nominee since the   of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. On social policies, the election made the Rockies look more like a border than a mountain range. In a raft of ballot measures, voters embraced causes like bilingual education, stricter gun control and taxes on sugary drinks. Amid Donald J. Trump\u2019s promises to slash taxes, voters in the West decided the opposite, raising taxes and voting to pour billions of dollars into schools and transportation. And the entire West Coast has legalized marijuana, now that California joined Washington and Oregon. While there have been gestures of conciliation in Washington toward Mr. Trump, political leaders in the West were defiant. Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, said the election inspired him to team up with \u201cenlightened\u201d leaders in the West to \u201cpush back aggressively\u201d against policies on immigration and the environment from the future Trump administration. \u201cWe are a nation state,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, referring to the state\u2019s diversity and vast, dynamic economy. \u201cIn so many ways, we are America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are just ahead of the curve. \u201d The election of Mr. Trump prompted street protesters in the liberal bastions of California to call for secession from the union  \u2014   and a promise from Shervin Pishevar, a Silicon Valley investor, to fund a #calexit campaign, as it has become known on social media. A petition for Oregon to secede was filed with the Oregon secretary of state\u2019s office on Thursday, allowing backers to start gathering signatures. The notion of West Coast states leaving the United States is fanciful and often   . But it reflects a sentiment here that after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory on Tuesday, the West increasingly sees itself as separate  \u2014   a place of innovation, economic dynamism and a belief that government can be an agent of change. Abby Ginzberg, a documentary filmmaker who lives in Albany, Calif. said she felt both deflated by the result but somewhat insulated from its consequences. \u201cRight now, I am depressed and upset and aware we live in a bubble,\u201d she said. \u201cThank god for the bubble!\u201d In Oregon and Washington, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s margin of victory was close to President Obama\u2019s four years ago. She received about 73 percent of the vote in Oregon\u2019s biggest urban county, Multnomah, which includes the Portland area  \u2014   with most of the votes counted in an   election. In Washington, the concentrations of blue intensified from the last presidential election. In King County, which includes Seattle and is the most populous in the state, Mrs. Clinton did better than Mr. Obama, with nearly three out of four residents voting for her, compared with 69 percent for Mr. Obama in 2012. Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle, a Democrat, described his city in recent days as almost like a fortress under siege, scanning for attack on the ramparts. Fighting, he said  \u2014   in defense or offense  \u2014   seems inevitable. \u201cThis country has elected a president who, during the campaign, demonstrated outright misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, nationalism, racism and authoritarian tendencies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have to challenge what we believe is wrong. \u201d Mr. Murray, the city\u2019s first openly gay mayor, said he believed Mr. Trump, based on his comments as a candidate, could also aim to \u201ctrim back\u201d gains that places like Seattle have made in gay rights. \u201cLet me tell you, this city is committed that we will not lose the things that we have gained, the rings that we wear on our fingers,\u201d the mayor said. Not every result was so liberal. Californians voted to keep the death penalty, and some inland counties clearly supported the Trump candidacy. Still, one reason Mr. Trump\u2019s populist revolt bypassed the West is that the economic landscape did not reflect decades of decay and job losses. Yes, there are areas of anger and strain, from the   ranches of eastern Oregon to coal towns in northwestern Colorado to strawberry farms in the Central Valley of California to steel towns struggling to reinvent themselves. But there are also new solar and wind farms,   tourist towns and cities from Denver to San Jose, Calif. to Seattle that are buzzing with businesses, construction cranes and swarms of new residents. \u201cPlaces like Colorado, we have a robust economy,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents the Denver area. \u201cWhat you see in the West is the development of a new economy that they\u2019re not seeing the Midwest and the South. \u201d Over all, Colorado sided narrowly with the Democrats on Tuesday, but the state embraced liberal ballot measures like a rise in minimum wage and a law allowing medical assistance in dying for terminally ill people. Voters rejected a   health care system, however. Like states across the nation, California is unsure to what extent Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to slash government programs such as the Affordable Care Act will be carried out. Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco and for decades a major player in state Democratic Party politics, said he did not believe California would be singled out for its support of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a Trump jihad on California,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not so much into policy. He\u2019s into saying what he thinks people want to hear. \u201d Kevin de Le\u00f3n, Senate president pro tem of California, said that his staff was not taking any chances and had begun a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of all federal programs that had an impact on California, and that it was looking at the impact that \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d would have. Kamala Harris, California\u2019s newly elected senator and a Democrat, said on Thursday that she would fight to protect immigrants and push back against Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed policies. Some mayors in the West vowed to push ahead with plans to protect salmon, to limit greenhouse gases, to feed undocumented immigrants and to outlaw discrimination against gay and transgender residents. \u201cOur agenda here in Colorado, our agenda here in Denver, does not change,\u201d said Michael B. Hancock, the mayor of Denver. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to design policies that are more inclusive. States like Colorado, cities like Denver, are ahead of the curve. We\u2019re trying to forge a future where we say, \u2018How do we not leave people behind? \u2019\u201d Other West Coast political leaders said they did not necessarily envision a war with the Trump administration and its allies but more a kind of competition for hearts and minds. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was elected to her first term in Congress on Tuesday representing part of Seattle, said that whispers of what might be called West Coast values  \u2014   particularly a higher minimum wage  \u2014   found echoes on Tuesday in states like Arizona that also voted for Mr. Trump. West Coast states, she said, should look for those allies and cultivate them. Voters in Colorado, Maine and Washington State also voted to raise their minimum wages. \u201cI absolutely believe that we can pull people toward this model,\u201d said Ms. Jayapal, the first   woman to serve in Congress. \u201cI think we are showing how to do things  \u2014   we passed gun control legislation for the second time in three years on the ballot. We passed a statewide   increase, the highest in the country. \u201d On Thursday, as Mr. Trump visited the White House for the first time as   city officials in Portland, Ore. and environmental activists met to discuss a restriction on export terminals for coal, oil and other fossil fuels. \u201cRegardless of whether we have climate deniers in charge at the national government, it doesn\u2019t change the facts,\u201d said Mayor Charlie Hales of Portland. He said he was \u201cheartsick\u201d over the election, calling it a \u201cnational catastrophe. \u201d \u201cRivers flood. Droughts persist. We don\u2019t have the luxury of living in an ideological bubble on this,\u201d he said. The Obama years had given Portland a close partner in Washington. That relationship could be upended if Mr. Trump follows through on promises to cut off all federal funding for cities deemed to be \u201csanctuary cities\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Federal money flows to everything from rail lines to crime fighting to school lunch programs for poor children. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a better place, and the world is beating a path to our door,\u201d Mr. Hales said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how to feed people with or without the federal government\u2019s help. \u201d In other liberal towns across the West, students joined protests against Mr. Trump, chanting what has now become a familiar motto, \u201cNot Our President. \u201d In Portland, some of the protests turned violent on Thursday night. In Boulder, Colo. Mrs. Clinton had a bigger win than Mr. Obama four years earlier. High school students streamed out of classes on Wednesday afternoon there to protest the election results, as they have in a several secondary schools across the West. On the pedestrian Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Heidi Ames, 41, kept a lonely vigil with a sign that said, \u201cTrump Is Not My President. \u201d \u201cThere are a lot of shocked and depressed people right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to show other liberal people I\u2019m doing something. I\u2019m not just talking on Facebook. \u201d On the day after the election, Mr. de Le\u00f3n, of the California Senate, sent out a statement written with a colleague in the Legislature that said the victory of Mr. Trump made them feel like \u201cstrangers in a foreign land. \u201d In an interview on Thursday, Mr. de Le\u00f3n said he felt a mix of disillusionment and defiance. \u201cCalifornia has long set an example for other states to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to allow one election to reverse generations of progress. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562414.4684122}
