[Shirley is also the author of an important book on one of the most significant months in all of history, December 1941: 31 Days that Changed America and Saved the World. This was the work SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked about in light of Memorial Day.  LISTEN: Shirley noted that December 1941 marked America\u2019s entry into World War II two years after the beginning of \u201ca war that we swore we would never get involved in. \u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get involved. There was an America First movement which rose up, which pressured the Roosevelt administration  \u2014   civic leaders, business leaders, military leaders, everybody in America. There wasn\u2019t anybody who really was for getting involved in another war,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe had a bad taste in our mouth after World War I. There was a saying going around America after World War I that all we got was debt, death, and George M. Cohan,\u201d he said, the latter being the lyricist who wrote the enduring anthem of the First World War, \u201cOver There. \u201d Shirley described America as \u201cessentially isolationist\u201d after the horrors of World War I, until the Pearl Harbor attack, followed by Germany and Italy\u2019s declarations of war the following week, \u201cchanged our outlook instantaneously. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a cue ball hitting an   and sending it off in a radically different direction than the path it had been previously on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives rise to Dwight Eisenhower, who was a   clerk on General Douglas MacArthur\u2019s peacetime staff, who goes on to become the great commander of the   invasion, the supreme commander of the Allied forces against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers, goes on to become an underestimated but still great president. \u201d \u201cJohn Kennedy becomes president  \u2014   in large part, he runs in 1960 as a war hero,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe was a war hero in World War II. Without his injuries in the Pacific, without his Navy Cross and the other awards he won, he would have just been considered a rich lightweight playboy in 1960, and would probably have lost. \u201d \u201cOn the other hand, it gave rise to Richard Nixon,\u201d he added, noting that Nixon was a supply officer in the Pacific during World War II. He wryly observed that Nixon became an accomplished poker player during his leisure time during the war and won enough money to finance his first political campaign. Both his poker winnings and his wartime experience were arguably crucial to establishing his political career in 1946. Shirley observed that World War II profoundly advanced technology, in fields ranging from rocketry and nuclear power to industrial science and medicine, with both military and civilian applications. \u201cWorld War Ii literally changes our world in ways that we think about, and in more ways that we don\u2019t think about,\u201d he concluded.  Those profound changes were not limited to America or the Western world, as evidenced by such profound events as the Rape of Nanking. \u201cWe are all guilty, I think, of being \u201d Shirley said. \u201cAlso, the more compelling figures of history  \u2014   most especially Churchill and Hitler  \u2014   are from Europe, so the European history of World War II has tended to dominate. \u201d However, he noted that \u201cthe atrocities committed by the Japanese were unspeakable. \u201d \u201cThey not only waged war against civilians, as they did in Manchuria, as they did in the Rape of Nanking, as in other aspects in the Philippines. They also, unlike the Germans, were brutally cruel to their POWs. The Germans were actually quite decent toward American and British POWs, especially pilots and officers. They treated them with a certain amount of respect. Those in POW camps were treated fairly well, relatively speaking. \u201d \u201cBut in the Japanese culture, in the shogunate culture that came up to dominate Japan in the Thirties, and then launched Japan into war with America, it was considered by that culture that the worst possible thing was for one man to be held captive or imprisoned by another man. That was the ultimate humiliation. It meant that they had no respect whatsoever for the American POWs, or the Australian POWs,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis manifested itself in the Bataan Death March, in which thousands of American officers and military men, and Australians, were brutally savaged by the Japanese,\u201d Shirley said, citing such torments as dousing prisoners in gasoline and setting them ablaze. \u201cThey performed unspeakable atrocities on American, Australian, and British enlisted men and officers  \u2014   much, much worse than the Germans did,\u201d he said. Conversely, Shirley agreed with Marlow\u2019s observation that Japan learned the lessons of the war better than Germany, with respect to foreign policy and immigration in particular. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying about the German people: they\u2019re either at your feet, or at your throat,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cWhat dominates Germany, dominates the culture and dominates politics, is an enormous sense of guilt, even    years later  \u2014   over World War II, over the Holocaust, over the atrocities and the conduct of Adolph Hitler and the Third Reich toward Europeans, toward Americans, toward the British, toward Russians. Now they go in the opposite direction. \u201d \u201cWhereas they were unspeakably cruel, they were horribly, evilly cruel, their natural reaction is to go just in the opposite direction and open up their gates to let in all sorts of immigrants, illegal immigrants, people from the Middle East. This is what dominates the German politics and culture in every way,\u201d he argued. Shirley found December 1941 so eventful that he was able to dedicate a separate chapter of his book to each day. \u201cIt was a fun book to write, because there are a lot of good books on the military response to December 7 1941, but there haven\u2019t been many books written on the civilian response  \u2014   on the transition from a peacetime economy to a wartime economy,\u201d he noted. He said he wanted to go into depth on what was happening across the country and around the world, inspired by childhood memories of how family dinners inevitably turned to conversations about World War II. \u201cMy grandfather would say something like, \u2018Well, I bought that DeSoto before the war, but I didn\u2019t sell it until after the war,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere would be discussions about gas rationing, meat rationing, victory gardens. I just became really infused with how much the war really affected the culture of America. Iraq and other modern wars, even Vietnam, didn\u2019t impact the civilian population too much, because they weren\u2019t really involved. \u201d  \u201cWorld War II was the first, and really the last, war in which the government called on the American people to make ultimate sacrifices, and they did so  \u2014   gladly, willingly, happily. The refrain at the time, if somebody complained about coffee rationing at the local grocery store, the grocer would look at you and say, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a war on.\u2019 Everybody sacrificed,\u201d he said. Shirley said his research found no evidence of extensive hoarding or black market activity to evade these wartime sacrifices despite ample incentives, since \u201ceverything was rationed. \u201d \u201cThe American serviceman came first in clothing, in medicine, in food, and if the American serviceman didn\u2019t come first, it went to Britain and to Russia. The American civilian was pretty much last in line for food, goods, and services in the United States. And the irony is that nobody complained about it,\u201d he said.  \u201cEverybody knew what was at stake. Everybody avidly followed the war news. Everybody listened to the radio broadcasts  \u2014   Gabriel Heatter, Lowell Thomas, and other war broadcasts. They listened to Winston Churchill, listened to Franklin Roosevelt, read their newspapers avidly, and knew about places that they\u2019d never heard of before: The Burma Road, or Thailand, or Patton\u2019s desert campaign against Rommel in North Africa. Everybody was knowledgeable and everybody was sophisticated in their conversations about the war,\u201d Shirley recalled. Shirley recalled his uncle paying \u201cthe ultimate price\u201d when he was shot down over the Pacific on his 20th birthday. He remembered childhood visits to the gravesite to leave flags and offer prayers for his Uncle Barney  \u2014   a nickname he earned when Shirley\u2019s   observed that his huge eyes resembled those of cartoon character Barney Google.  His father and another uncle also served in the war.  \u201cFor our family, it was deeply, deeply personal,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandmother would shed some tears. My grandfather would shed some tears. But there was also a certain amount of solemnity and dignity to our day,\u201d he said of the family dinners and memorial visits. \u201cI remember going as a child to the graveyard and seeing other families there, doing similar things for their family members, for the men in their family who had fought and died in World War II, or even World War I, as a child. I think there are many ways to celebrate Memorial Day: to think about it, to pray about it, to act on it, to do something charitable for your fellow Americans. Whatever you do, I think it\u2019s important to do something to memorialize those who made the ultimate sacrifice,\u201d Shirley urged.
