He was greeted by lawmakers who tossed water bottles at him, banged on tables and chanted for his ouster. \u201cThis session is illegal!\u201d one of them shouted. Leaving his squabbling opponents behind, Mr. Abadi moved to another meeting room, where supportive lawmakers declared a quorum and approved several new ministers  \u2014   technocrats, not party apparatchiks  \u2014   as a step to end sectarian politics and the corruption and patronage that support it. But, like so much else in the Iraqi government, the effort fell short, with only a handful of new ministers installed and several major ministries, including oil, foreign and finance, remaining in limbo. A new session of Parliament on Thursday was canceled. Almost two years after the Islamic State swept through northern Iraq, forcing the Obama administration to   in a conflict it had celebrated as complete, Iraq\u2019s political system is barely functioning, as the chaotic scenes in Parliament this week demonstrated. With the surprise visit to Baghdad on Thursday of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \u2014   who, as a senator, called in a 2006 essay for the partition of Iraq into Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish zones  \u2014   it seems fair to ask a question that has bedeviled foreign powers for almost a century: Is Iraq ever going to have a functioning state at peace with itself? \u201cI generally believe it is ungovernable under the current construct,\u201d said Ali Khedery, an American former official in Iraq who served as an aide to several ambassadors and generals. Mr. Khedery said that a confederacy or a partition of Iraq might be the only remedy for the country\u2019s troubles. He called it \u201can imperfect solution for an imperfect world. \u201d Mr. Khedery is now a sharp critic of American policy in Iraq, saying it has consistently ignored the realities of the country\u2019s underlying political problems. Iraq, he said, \u201cis a violent, dysfunctional marriage, and we keep pouring American lives and dollars into it, hoping for a miracle. We should instead seek to broker an amicable separation or divorce that results in   for Iraq\u2019s fractious communities. \u201d Writing last year in Foreign Affairs, Mr. Khedery said Washington should \u201cabandon its fixation with artificial borders\u201d  \u2014   a reference to the map of the Middle East drawn by the British and the French after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I  \u2014   and allow Iraq to break up. With the Islamic State in control of territory in Iraq and Syria expanding into Libya, Afghanistan and elsewhere and having carried out attacks in Paris and Brussels, it is perhaps easy to forget that the group rose in the first place as a consequence of the failure of politics in Iraq  \u2014   in that case, the sectarian policies of Mr. Abadi\u2019s predecessor as prime minister, Nuri Kamal   also a Shiite. American officials have said that maintaining Iraq\u2019s unity is still their policy, but United Nations officials in Baghdad have quietly begun studying how the international community might manage a breakup of the country. The political problems of Iraq have been made worse by the collapse in the price of oil, the country\u2019s lifeblood the grinding war against the Islamic State and, more recently, fighting between Shiite militias and Kurds in the north that analysts worry could foreshadow a new, violent struggle in the country. Iraq, it seems, is stuck in a cycle of history that endlessly repeats. Mr. Biden has worked to promote Iraqi unity, despite his proposal a decade ago to divide Iraq into thirds. But in comments on Thursday to American diplomatic and military personnel in Baghdad, he harked back to that proposal. \u201cThink of all the places we are today trying to keep the peace,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the places we\u2019ve sent you guys and women. They\u2019re places where, because of history, we\u2019ve drawn artificial lines, creating artificial states made up of totally distinct ethnic, religious, cultural groups, and said: \u2018Have at it. Live together.\u2019 \u201d Almost 100 years ago, Gertrude Bell, the British official and spy who is credited with drawing the borders of modern Iraq after World War I, fretted about the project. In creating a new nation, she wrote, \u201cwe rushed into this business with our usual disregard for a comprehensive political scheme. \u201d A coming documentary, \u201cLetters From Baghdad,\u201d explores the life and legacy of Ms. Bell, demonstrating how little has changed in Iraq over a century. Even today, her legacy is felt: This week, Mr. Abadi put forward Sharif Ali bin Hussein, a descendant of King Faisal, who was chosen by Ms. Bell in 1921 to rule Iraq, as foreign minister. But lawmakers rejected him as a reminder of Iraq\u2019s failed monarchy. Much of what troubles Iraq today is the legacy of Saddam Hussein\u2019s brutality. Shiites and Kurds, oppressed under Mr. Hussein\u2019s   administration, have been unable to overcome their grievances. Sunni Arabs say their entire community has been unfairly marginalized for the crimes of Mr. Hussein. \u201cIraq, it seems, has a long memory but is short on vision,\u201d Kate Gilmore, a human rights official at the United Nations, said this week in unusually descriptive language after visiting Iraq. \u201cIt is like a vehicle traveling over rocky terrain, with a large rearview mirror but only a keyhole for a windscreen, despite a vicious contest for the wheel. The dominant narrative among many of Iraq\u2019s leaders is of \u2018my community\u2019s grievance,\u2019 failing to acknowledge the widespread nature of Iraqis\u2019 suffering and failing to chart a course for an inclusive future. \u201d Mr. Maliki, in an interview this year with The New York Times, acknowledged that he had been unable, while in office, to overcome this history. \u201cThe Kurds want compensation for the past,\u201d said Mr. Maliki, who seems determined these days to undermine Mr. Abadi at every turn. \u201cThe Shia, too. Sunnis still fear from the majority and fear being called in to account for what Saddam did. \u201d Divisions within the Shiite leadership  \u2014   with Mr. Maliki and others pushing back against Mr. Abadi\u2019s efforts at restructuring  \u2014   are also at the core of the current political crisis. Mr. Maliki, whose grandfather participated in an armed uprising against the British in the 1920s, became one of Iraq\u2019s three vice presidents after he lost the prime minister\u2019s post in 2014. One of the first changes proposed by Mr. Abadi last summer, when he faced protests, was to eliminate the offices of vice president. But two of the occupants refused to leave, even though their salaries were cut off. One of those was Mr. Maliki, who still occupies his palace and insists he is still a vice president of Iraq. Still, he said he had no ambition to return to office, even though many Iraqi officials and Western diplomats believe he has been scheming to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to return to it. \u201d Hadi   a Shiite rival to Mr. Abadi, who runs a powerful militia that is supported by Iran, is seen by many as harboring ambitions to replace him. Even so, Mr. Ameri said, \u201conly if I were crazy would I accept\u201d the job of prime minister. \u201cWe don\u2019t have democracy in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, everyone wants to drive the car. The winner and the loser. \u201d He added, as a way of defending Mr. Abadi\u2019s failures in uniting the Iraqi state, \u201cEven if a prophet came to rule Iraq, he wouldn\u2019t be able to satisfy all sides. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562610.0531318}
