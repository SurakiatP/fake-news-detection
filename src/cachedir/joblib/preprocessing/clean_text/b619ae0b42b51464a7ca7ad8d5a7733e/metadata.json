Join me on @thedonaldreddit Reddit AMA right now! https://t.co/tpyfSB0M75 \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 25, 2016 \\nMost importantly, the story also presents another side of the Trump campaign, an active effort to persuade Democrats not to vote. It concentrates on three key groups. 1) White Liberals \\nTrump\u2019s invocation at the debate of Clinton\u2019s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. 2) Young Women \\nThe parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. 3) African-Americans \\nHer 1996 suggestion that some African American males are \u201csuper predators\u201d is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls\u2014particularly in Florida. \\nThat strategy in action: \\nOn Oct. 24, Trump\u2019s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he\u2019d created of Clinton delivering the \u201csuper predator\u201d line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: \u201cHillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.\u201d \\nThe animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook \u201cdark posts\u201d\u2014nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, \u201conly the people we want to see it, see it.\u201d The aim is to depress Clinton\u2019s vote total. \u201cWe know because we\u2019ve modeled this,\u201d says the official. \u201cIt will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.\u201d \\nEarly voting shows that the efforts to decrease turnout may not be working according to the Trump campaign's plan, but it's rare for a campaign to so openly boast of an effort to get people not to vote. \""}, "time": 1742563959.3233805}
