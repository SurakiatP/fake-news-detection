A new video for one of Mr. Bowie\u2019s final songs and a brief EP of previously released tracks were made available late on Saturday, almost exactly a year since the release of the musician\u2019s final album, \u201cBlackstar,\u201d and days before the first anniversary of his death on Jan. 10. The video, for the song \u201cNo Plan,\u201d was directed by Tom Hingston, who also worked with Mr. Bowie on videos for the songs \u201cI\u2019d Rather Be High (Venetian Mix)\u201d and \u201cSue (Or in a Season of Crime). \u201d The clip features a ghostly row of television screens flashing the lyrics of Mr. Bowie\u2019s song, which explores themes of disembodiment and confusion. Above the screens is a sign for Newton Electrical, a reference to Thomas Jerome Newton, Mr. Bowie\u2019s character in the film \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth. \u201d That character was resurrected as the protagonist of \u201cLazarus,\u201d a musical featuring Mr. Bowie\u2019s songs that began its run in late 2015. All of the songs on the new EP were featured on the \u201cLazarus\u201d cast recording released this fall. The EP, also called \u201cNo Plan,\u201d includes \u201cLazarus\u201d from \u201cBlackstar,\u201d as well as \u201cNo Plan,\u201d \u201cKilling a Little Time\u201d and \u201cWhen I Met You. \u201d The four songs, all of which were recorded during sessions for \u201cBlackstar,\u201d are Mr. Bowie\u2019s final studio recordings. Mr. Bowie recorded \u201cBlackstar\u201d with the Donny McCaslin Quartet, a jazz combo he had scouted in Greenwich Village, from January to March 2014 at the Magic Shop in SoHo. In \u201cDavid Bowie: The Last Five Years,\u201d a new documentary exploring the final period of his career that was broadcast on the BBC on Saturday night, Johan Renck, the director of the \u201cLazarus\u201d video, said Mr. Bowie had learned his cancer was terminal during the filming of the clip, three months before he died. Reacting to the new release on social media, fans celebrated and mourned the musician anew. \u201cHappy Birthday, Starman,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. \u201cI miss you every single day. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563261.740187}
