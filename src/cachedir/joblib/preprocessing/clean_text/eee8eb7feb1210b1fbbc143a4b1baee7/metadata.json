S. elections and any collusion with the Trump campaign. According to the Independent Journal Review: \u201cI believe it hurts the country terribly because it shows we\u2019re a divided,     country,\u201d he said, according to CNN. \u201cAnd we have very important things to do right now,\u201d he added, citing trade deals, military issues, and the spread of nuclear weapons. \u201cIt also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the Electoral College being slated so much in their way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all this is. I think it shows division, and it shows that we\u2019re not together as a country. And I think it\u2019s a very, very negative thing. \u201d Trump closed his comments by stating that \u201chopefully, this can go quickly, because we have to show unity if we\u2019re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world. \u201d This is the second time Trump has met with TV news anchors privately. The first time was before his address to a joint session of Congress. Pelley reportedly moved the CBS evening news show from New York to Washington partly as a result of the lunch. Trump, who has blasted CNN as \u201cfake news,\u201d is an avid consumer of cable news and reportedly recently installed a new large screen TV in the White House.'"}, "time": 1742561637.0708776}
