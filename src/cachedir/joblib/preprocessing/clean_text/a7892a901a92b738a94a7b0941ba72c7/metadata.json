Their latest video, entitled \u201cWe Stand With Israel: Kerry and Obama don\u2019t know where they stand,\u201d lambasts Kerry for his address last week on the   conflict. In apparent reference to Kerry\u2019s wife Teresa Heinz, Hardaway said, \u201cKerry must be slipping in all of that Heinz Ketchup \u2014  \u2019cause he trippin\u2019!\u201d Hardaway continues by attacking Obama for not having Israel\u2019s back and for being \u201cout of touch. \u201d \u201cLet me tell you something: Israel is our ally, so that means we have to have their backs! I don\u2019t care if their back is small, and our backs are big, we still got to have their backs  \u2014   period. \u201d \u201c[Obama] was out of touch with this election.
