Skelos, the   New York state senator, was sentenced last month on federal corruption charges, one of his lawyers asked the judge to allow Mr. Skelos to remain free on bail while he appealed his conviction. Her argument: A case pending in the United States Supreme Court, challenging the conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, could help undermine the criminal charges against Mr. Skelos. \u201cIt is extremely likely that the court will reverse the conviction in Governor McDonnell\u2019s case,\u201d Alexandra A. E. Shapiro, the lawyer, told the judge. Her prediction proved accurate. And within moments after the Supreme Court reversed Mr. McDonnell\u2019s conviction on Monday, defense lawyers from Illinois to New York were citing the unanimous ruling as grounds to challenge past and pending criminal corruption cases brought by the Justice Department. \u201cThis is a sign of the court saying to prosecutors, \u2018You are overreaching,\u2019\u201d said Leonard Goodman, a lawyer for former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2011 and is scheduled to be resentenced in August. \u201cThey think they have unfettered discretion to take down any elected officials. \u201d Current and former prosecutors strongly disagreed. In Manhattan, a spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney there, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cWhile we are reviewing the McDonnell decision, the official actions that led to the convictions of Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos fall squarely within the definition set forth by the Supreme Court today. \u201d Mr. Bharara has repeatedly said he remains committed to ending a pattern of corrupt acts by elected officials, and most recently, his office won the convictions of Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver, a former State Assembly leader. Still, there was agreement among legal experts on Monday that the ruling would make it harder for the government to win corruption convictions. For the second time since 2010, the court narrowed the avenues that prosecutors have to file such charges. The decision could even discourage some cases from being brought in the first place. \u201cThe bar is now higher in terms of what you have to prove,\u201d said Randall D. Eliason, a former chief of the public corruption section at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington. \u201cThis will leave a lot of unsavory conduct unpunished. \u201d Mr. McDonnell was accused of accepting gifts, loans and vacations from an affluent Virginia businessman who wanted the governor\u2019s help dealing with state officials. \u201cOur concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court, adding that \u201csetting up a meeting, talking to another official or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so)  \u2014   without more\u201d  \u2014   does not fit the definition of an \u201cofficial act. \u201d In 2010, in a decision also involving   honest services fraud, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction of Jeffrey K. Skilling  \u2014   the former chief executive of Enron, the bankrupt energy company  \u2014   ruling that the law could be used to prosecute only bribery or kickbacks, not more limited actions like \u201cself dealing,\u201d in which an official secretly takes an action for personal gain. Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group, said the combination of rulings was likely to have a major impact because elected officials involved in wrongdoing often did not have the power to personally deliver the favor that had been requested. Mr. Bookbinder said examples of cases that might now be harder to prosecute included those of Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, who pushed the Defense Department to select a particular contractor after receiving gifts and pleaded guilty in 2005, and Representative William J. Jefferson, Democrat of Louisiana, who was convicted in 2009 of taking bribes from a company that asked him to press executive branch officials to buy its products. \u201cThe Supreme Court seems to be giving people a way to go ahead with corrupt conduct, with kind of a wink and a nod,\u201d Mr. Bookbinder said. Joel Bertocchi, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, cautioned against overstating the impact of Monday\u2019s ruling. \u201cHaving the same set of facts, they may be able to file different charges,\u201d he said. But defense lawyers and some conservative legal groups that have been critical of the Justice Department said they hoped the ruling would bring real change. They argued that the government had, in its zeal to win headlines, filed charges in recent years for activities that did not meet the standard for federal corruption. \u201cOnce again, it has taken the U. S. Supreme Court to remind prosecutors that they do not have a blank check to read all kinds of unintended and overly broad criminality into vaguely worded statutes passed by Congress,\u201d said E. G. Morris, a lawyer in Austin, Tex. and the president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The precise impact of the McDonnell ruling on the Skelos and Silver cases was not immediately clear. Lawyers for Mr. Skelos, the former State Senate majority leader and a Republican, had no comment on the decision. But at Mr. Skelos\u2019s sentencing last month, Rahul Mukhi, a prosecutor in Mr. Bharara\u2019s office, argued that Mr. Skelos\u2019s corrupt acts had gone far beyond those taken by Mr. McDonnell, and that the cases were not \u201cfactually analogous. \u201d \u201cMcDonnell involved only meetings,\u201d Mr. Mukhi said. \u201cThis case involved, overwhelmingly, legislation. \u201d Mr. Bharara\u2019s office had said, for example, that Mr. Skelos supported legislation in Albany to benefit companies that arranged payments to his son, Adam B. Skelos, who was convicted along with his father. The elder Mr. Skelos received a   prison term his son was sentenced to six and a half years. Lawyers for Mr. Silver, a Democrat who received a   sentence, said Monday that the McDonnell decision \u201cwill be central\u201d to their client\u2019s appeal. The lawyers, Steven F. Molo and Joel Cohen, said the decision \u201cmakes clear that the federal government has gone too far in prosecuting state officials for conduct that is part of the everyday functioning of those in elected office. \u201d Noel J. Francisco, who argued Mr. McDonnell\u2019s case before the Supreme Court, said that he hoped the ruling would be the end of his client\u2019s prosecution and that the charges would be dropped entirely. \u201cThey brought the case they brought,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that was the most they could get a conviction on. That theory has been squarely rejected. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564365.0626876}
