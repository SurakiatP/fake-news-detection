The Clinton campaign, and its mainstream media extension, have weathered with surprising ease the fainting episode on September 11. \\nIn the next two days they will focus on: the possibility (they will claim likelihood) that Anthony Wener\u2019s/Huma Abedin\u2019s server does not contain any emails not known to the FBI already, let alone those designated confidential, classified, secret or top secret\u2014that was Hillary Clinton\u2019s predictable immediate reaction ; the assertion that the FBI will not be able to sift through thousands of emails quickly enough to provide a clear answer to (1) before the election, which is the coded message behind the Clinton camp\u2019s demand for a \u201cdetailed and thorough\u201d investigation\u2014demands for \u201cimmediate\u201d disclosure notwithstanding\u2014and an unnamed official has already indicated that it was not likely that the FBI\u2019s review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day; and the claim that the FBI was acting under political pressure from Clinton\u2019s foes: Sen. Dianne Feinstein has already declared that \u201cthe FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today\u2019s break from that tradition is appalling.\u201d \\nThe one truly appalling event in this saga was James Comey\u2019s decision last spring not to ask for a grand jury, without which the entire investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails was predictably sidetracked. On that inglorious form, his surprise Friday announcement may indicate that the potential for scandal is so great that his options for further damage limitation in Clinton\u2019s interest were extremely limited. \\nHowever . . . In 1982 I interviewed for the BBC World Service one of Ireland\u2019s best respected diplomats and political commentators, Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien, at his home by the cliffs above the Irish Sea. In passing he mentioned Ireland\u2019s scandal-ridden prime minister of the day, Charles Haughey, who had managed repeatedly to survive numerous disclosures of corruption and wrongdoing. O\u2019Brien said that if he saw Charlie Haughey \u201cburied at midnight at a crossroads with a stake driven through his heart, I should continue to wear a clove of garlic around my neck, just in case.\u201d \\nHillary Clinton\u2019s detractors should take note.\""}, "time": 1742628505.4119837}
