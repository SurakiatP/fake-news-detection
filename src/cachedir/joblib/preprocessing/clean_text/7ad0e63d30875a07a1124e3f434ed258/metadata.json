When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. \\nBee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. \\nShe finally asked Obama if he would \u201cmess\u201d with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. \\n\u201cAfter you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trump\u2019s ear, \u2018You were right, I wasn\u2019t born here,\u2019 just to, like, mess with him?\u201d Bee asked. \\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where I\u2019m not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,\u201d Obama shot back. \\nThey did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States.
