Having criticized German officials for barring their Turkish counterparts from campaign events this month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan turned his ire on the Netherlands after the Dutch stopped the Turkish foreign minister from landing there for a rally on Saturday, and then escorted the Turkish family minister out of the country early on Sunday, citing risks to public order and security. It was an unusually strong reaction from the Dutch, who have generally taken an open stance toward diverse points of view, but who are in the midst of an election campaign in which immigration and integration are major topics. \u201cWhen those incidents began, I said those are fascistic measures,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a speech on Sunday afternoon. \u201cI said Nazism had risen from the dead. And then I added: I thought Nazism was over, but I was wrong. \u201d The   remarks from Turkey inflamed tensions among the Turkish community in the Netherlands, who protested in Rotterdam until the early hours of Sunday, when they were dispersed by police officers wielding batons and water cannons. The police arrested 12 people, and seven were injured, including a policeman, whose hand was broken. Though Turkish law technically bars the practice, Turkish ministers are touring Europe to persuade the Continent\u2019s sizable Turkish diaspora to vote yes to an expansion of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s powers, amid fears that the \u201cno\u201d campaign may hold the edge in the April referendum. But this campaign has collided with closely fought local elections in the Netherlands and France, where   politicians have sought political capital from stoking tensions with the Turks. The push for votes also comes at a time of increased European alarm over Turkey\u2019s democratic backslide and rising concerns over immigration and integration. The Dutch government said it refused to allow the Turkish foreign minister\u2019s plane to land after the Turkish government publicly called on \u201cDutch nationals of Turkish origin to turn out in great numbers. \u201d The two countries were negotiating over finding a smaller venue like the Turkish Consulate to hold the meeting, but \u201cbefore these talks had been concluded,\u201d Turkey \u201cpublicly threatened the Netherlands with sanctions\u201d making a \u201creasonable compromise\u201d impossible, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said. Elsewhere in Europe, the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, canceled a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Binali Yildirim, in protest of Turkey\u2019s \u201crhetorical attacks. \u201d In Sweden, a lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party, Mehdi Eker, rearranged a campaign event after the meeting\u2019s initial hosts backed out for safety reasons. In France, two   candidates, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Marine Le Pen, criticized the decision to allow the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to proceed with a rally in France. Switzerland and Austria have previously made it clear that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s campaign is unwelcome there. In the Netherlands, both the conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte, and his   opponent, Geert Wilders, hoped to benefit from the dispute, though it was not immediately clear if either would see appreciable gains. The election is on Wednesday, and while it was Mr. Wilders who first elevated the issue publicly, Mr. Rutte could get credit for barring the Turkish ministers. \u201cRutte now has premier bonus,\u201d said Bianca Pander, a political strategist at BKB, which works on campaign strategy, referring to his status as prime minister. \u201cHe can now show what leadership means. \u201d He is also benefiting from nearly constant news media coverage on the issue. \u201cRutte is in the picture now: He\u2019s on every TV show, and on every newspaper,\u201d Ms. Pander said. Mr. Rutte said the pejoratives leveled at the Dutch were \u201cbizarre\u201d and that the \u201cTurkish republic is moving in the wrong direction for a democracy. \u201d In response, Mr. Erdogan accused the   Dutch government of playing to a domestic audience by blocking his ministers. \u201cHolland, if you are sacrificing   relations because of the election on Wednesday, you will pay the price,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said Sunday. Inside Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, too, was accused of trying to curry favor with the country\u2019s voters. With the referendum result in doubt, some of the president\u2019s critics argued that he was manufacturing fights with Europe to win the support of nationalists in Turkey who were undecided about whether to back the expansion of his mandate. \u201cTurkish foreign policy today  \u2014   whatever it is, wherever it is, from Syria all the way to the Netherlands and Germany  \u2014   is related to the domestic political agenda,\u201d said Cengiz Candar, a veteran Turkish columnist and academic. \u201cThere is no Turkish foreign policy now,\u201d Mr. Candar added in a telephone interview. \u201cTurkish foreign policy is related to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s referendum campaign. \u201d But others supported Mr. Erdogan\u2019s stance. The leader of the main Turkish opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who is against the proposed Constitution, called on Mr. Erdogan to suspend relations with the Netherlands. A small crowd of   protesters gathered outside the Dutch Consulate in Istanbul, while an unknown intruder briefly managed to replace the consulate\u2019s Dutch flag with a Turkish one. In a province west of the city, another crowd of protesters squeezed a series of oranges, in a theatrical gesture apparently intended to insult the Dutch, whose national color is orange. Arriving back in Turkey after her deportation, the Turkish family minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, accused the Netherlands of hypocrisy for claiming to stand up for human rights while restricting her own. \u201cWe faced a very inhumane, unethical treatment,\u201d she said at Istanbul\u2019s main airport, according to Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. \u201cWe had a really very painful night in Holland, which talks about democracy, freedoms, freedom of speech. \u201d In addition to targeting wavering members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s own party, some analysts said the Turkish government\u2019s movements in Europe were particularly aimed at supporters of the country\u2019s largest nationalist movement, the Nationalist Movement Party, which is known in Turkey as the M. H. P. The M. H. P. has traditionally been wary of Mr. Erdogan, but its leadership now supports giving him more power, in the private expectation that its own cadres will subsequently be rewarded with more influence. While an estimated three million German residents are of Turkish origin, as well as about 400, 000 Dutch residents, the number of people in Germany and the Netherlands who are eligible to vote in the Turkish elections is far lower, said Alexander Clarkson, a specialist on the Turkish diaspora at King\u2019s College London. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s recent gestures were therefore primarily targeted at the M. H. P. \u2019s rank and file in Turkey, many of whom are skeptical of their leadership\u2019s alliance with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Clarkson said. \u201cThe audience isn\u2019t really the diaspora the audience is at home,\u201d Mr. Clarkson said of the government\u2019s stance toward the Netherlands and Germany. The heated language helps achieve this goal, Mr. Clarkson said, since \u201cit enables Erdogan and the A. K. P. to say: We are out there protecting the rights of Turks abroad. \u201d The A. K. P. is an acronym for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s group, the Justice and Development Party. Mr. Erdogan was accused of hypocrisy for criticizing Europe\u2019s perceived authoritarianism while overseeing a sweeping crackdown on dissent in his country. Since a failed coup in July, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has ruled mostly by decree, allowing it to suspend or fire more than 120, 000 government employees, and arrest an estimated 45, 000 people suspected of being dissidents or rebels. The detainees come from a broad section of public life and include soldiers, police officers, teachers, judges, academics, journalists and lawmakers. \u201cHe is the president of a country,\u201d Mr. Candar said of Mr. Erdogan, \u201cwhere more than 150 journalists,   writers, columnists, opinion makers are in prison. And the leaders of the   caucus in the Turkish Parliament\u201d  \u2014   as well as 12 other members of Parliament who belong to it  \u2014   \u201care also in prison. \u201d Turkey, Mr. Candar argued, \u201chas transformed into a republic of fear. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561701.8714185}
