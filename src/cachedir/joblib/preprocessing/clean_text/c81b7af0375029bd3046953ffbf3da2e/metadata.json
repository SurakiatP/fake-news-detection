Ryan, bound for the basement of the Capitol, was preparing to deliver the news to his conference. And inside the House gallery on Friday, still teeming with lawmakers debating legislation that would never get a vote, Gary and Tammy Comes, visitors from Vero Beach, Fla. were straining to puzzle out the shouting just after 3:30 p. m. \u201cVote! Vote! Vote!\u201d came the lawmakers\u2019 chants, echoing as the body suddenly adjourned, setting in motion a whirring of members, journalists and assorted guests wandering through the Capitol, conscripted to spend the next several minutes  \u2014   days? election cycles?  \u2014   making sense of what had happened. \u201cHe\u2019s like the coach,\u201d Mr. Comes, a    Trump voter, said of his president as he left, lamenting the finale of a   education in legislative incineration. \u201cWhy do you want the coach to lose?\u201d They were not alone in this hour of congressional processing, shuffling toward the exits with more questions than insights. Republican members fumed loudest, racing into elevators after their conference meeting. \u201cDon\u2019t bother to go,\u201d Representative Darrell Issa of California told a   colleague. It was over, he said, turning a thumb down. Staff members digested the moment in varying degrees of distress. \u201cHealth care is hard,\u201d one young woman said quietly to a peer. Building employees gossiped. \u201cRyan did an interview downstairs,\u201d one man told a police officer on his way out, referring to Mr. Ryan\u2019s session with reporters after 4 p. m. \u201cSaid Obamacare\u2019s the law of the land. \u201d Others drifted through the halls with little sense of the surrounding tumult. Workers pushed carts into closets, eager to complete their week. Music blared from the headphones of high school visitors waiting by a bathroom. Then there were the Comeses. They had not planned to tour the Capitol during their vacation here. But sensing something momentous afoot, they first wandered into the gallery on Thursday. \u201cThey adjourned trying to debate what time to start this morning,\u201d said Ms. Comes, 47, marveling at the inanity. \u201cThey cited some kind of rule,\u201d her husband added, shrugging beneath a National Hot Rod Association hoodie. The two are not Trump   they suggested, describing the 2016 election as a battle of relative evils. But they expressed satisfaction with Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts so far. \u201cHe\u2019s doing good,\u201d Ms. Comes said. \u201cI think more people need to support him. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue,\u201d Mr. Comes noted, a partial echo of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent musing that \u201cnobody knew that health care could be so complicated. \u201d Still, the couple, returning soon to their Florida log cabin  \u2014   \u201cour neighbors call us Lincolns,\u201d Mr. Comes said  \u2014   said their attendance on Friday had been instructive. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to be a part of history, even if it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. Moments later, a guard walked over. The space was closing to the public. The House was no longer open for business, he said. Or whatever that was.'"}, "time": 1742563346.2706466}
