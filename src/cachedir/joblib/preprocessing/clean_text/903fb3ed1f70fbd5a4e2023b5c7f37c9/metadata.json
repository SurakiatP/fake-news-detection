How do you pick off enough of his constituents and prevent him from making inroads into yours? In Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and her Democratic allies face a candidate for whom there is no precedent in presidential politics. It remains unclear whether Trump can be brought to his knees the way Mitt Romney was by ads like \u201cCoffin\u201d and \u201cFirms,\u201d which alleged that Romney\u2019s investment firm, Bain Capital, closed factories and shipped jobs abroad. In April, during the primary campaign, Politico reported that Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster currently working for the   \u201csuper PAC\u201d Priorities USA Action, contended in a phone interview that Trump\u2019s immunity to criticism worked only in the primaries among Republican voters: \u201cTrump is not Teflon. \u201d Among all voters, Garin argued, \u201ca majority has come to the conclusion that Trump is unfit for the job and that he would represent a significant risk as president. \u201d Polling and focus group testing, Garin said, have shown that one ad produced by Priorities, \u201cGrace,\u201d has been highly effective. It shows Grace, who was born with spina bifida, her parents, Chris and Lauren Glaros, and a clip of Trump ridiculing a disabled New York Times reporter. The ad concludes with the father on camera: I asked Garin, along with other strategists and political observers, how they would respond to a long list of Trump\u2019s rambling, theatrical promises, which he would, in fact, be unable to keep. Just a partial list of these includes refusing to defend America\u2019s NATO allies, returning 11 million undocumented immigrants to their home countries, saving $300 billion annually on a prescription drug program that spends only $78 billion a year, nationalizing concealed weapons permits and vowing that \u201cIf I become president, we\u2019re gonna be saying Merry Christmas at every store . .. You can leave Happy Holidays at the corner. \u201d Should Democrats, I inquired, point to the infeasibility of Trump\u2019s proposals and the damaging results of any attempts on his part to follow through? That approach would not work, Garin said, because voters, including many of Trump\u2019s supporters, don\u2019t really \u201cbelieve he will build a wall, or get Mexico to pay for a wall\u201d  \u2014   they have already discounted many of Trump\u2019s    assertions as hyperbole. \u201cThe real case has more to do with his character and temperament,\u201d Garin said. \u201cThe biggest concern is that he is temperamentally unsuited to lead the country. \u201d Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster unaffiliated with the Clinton campaign, argued in an email that there were risks in attacking specific Trump proposals as unrealistic: In an interesting warning to Democrats, Arthur Lupia, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, wrote me: Making a related argument, a Democratic strategist who sought anonymity in order to protect his relationship with the Clinton campaign, wrote me: This strategist cited the futility of accusing Trump of hyping crime: Democrats have to negotiate a tricky path in communicating their candidate\u2019s \u201cidentification with the main concerns of many of Trump\u2019s voters\u201d on such issues as immigration, the strategist argued. This empathy has to be Robert Borosage,   of the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, a liberal advocacy group, described the problem of attempting to refute Trump   : Clinton\u2019s task, in Borosage\u2019s view, is not an easy one for a politician who has been in the national spotlight for more than a quarter of a century: \u201cH. R. C. \u2019s challenge is to claim the future  \u2014   one that is different than the past,\u201d Borosage wrote. In his speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Bill Clinton sought to address the issue Borosage raises of how Hillary Clinton can plausibly \u201cclaim the future. \u201d The former president referred to his wife\u2019s record of making \u201cpositive changes in people\u2019s lives\u201d and noted that his wife is a \u201cwoman who has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. \u201d Borosage brought up a second point, that Hillary Clinton, who has campaigned on the theme that she will protect and enhance the Obama legacy, needs to jump an additional hurdle: \u201cHer biggest challenge is to be different than Obama  \u2014   bolder, challenging Wall Street, corporate trade and tax deals. \u201d Borosage\u2019s argument  \u2014   that the Trump campaign is based on attitudes and ingrained belief systems, not on a set of policies  \u2014   points to the difficulty of addressing Trump\u2019s   rhetoric. Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology at Princeton and the author of \u201cBeyond Smoke and Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Age of Economic Integration\u201d pointed out in an email, for example, that Similarly, The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2015 that numerous studies These facts are unlikely to dissuade voters convinced that immigrants are taking jobs, committing crimes and undermining American values. From their point of view, any crime by an illegal immigrant is one crime too many. There are many Democrats who believe that taking on Trump does not require nuance or calculation. \u201cWhen 60 percent of voters say they\u2019ll never consider voting for you and you have a 29 percent approval rating, you\u2019ve got a serious image problem,\u201d Jim Jordan, who managed John Kerry\u2019s presidential campaign and served as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote me in an email. \u201cTrump is already gushing blood. This is just blocking and tackling for the Clinton folks. \u201d Jordan argues that \u201cthe two real imperatives\u201d for Democrats are 1) \u201cto deny Trump the \u2018I\u2019   \u2019 space,\u201d and 2) \u201cto keep hammering on how bizarre and dangerous he is to America and our interests around the world. His weird   on Putin and his invitation this week to Russia to invade the Baltics seem like good places to start. \u201d Despite Jordan\u2019s confidence in Democratic presidential prospects, at the moment Trump has moved ahead of Clinton by 1. 1 percent in the RealClearPolitics aggregation of recent polling. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at N. Y. U. told me in an email that Democrats need to adopt a more subtle strategy in dealing with Trump. This, Haidt argues, is because the The elephant \u201creally runs the show,\u201d Haidt said, Translating this analytic approach to the 2016 election, in Haidt\u2019s view, means that To counter Trump, Democrats have to get into the electorate\u2019s automatic, intuitive and unconscious level of responding to events before attempting a critique based on reasoned argument, according to Haidt. To do this, he wrote, the goal should be to portray Trump in ways that conflict with \u201cdeep moral intuitions about fairness versus cheating and exploitation. \u201d And how do you do that? The next step is to present a vision of Trump that violates \u201cmoral intuitions about loyalty, authority, and sanctity:\u201d On Monday night in her speech, Michelle Obama tapped into this theme when she described \u201cthe kind of president that I want for my girls and all our children. \u201d The first lady declared: Haidt put it another way: I could not have said it better myself. Despite the overt chaos, the competing narratives of the fall campaign  \u2014   each side\u2019s attempt to define the other as weak or crazy and itself as tough and dependable  \u2014   are clearly emerging from the conventions. The question is whether the Democratic Party can get emotional enough or reach deep enough into our brains to counter the sheer id of Trump\u2019s primeval appeal.'"}, "time": 1742564540.1723747}
