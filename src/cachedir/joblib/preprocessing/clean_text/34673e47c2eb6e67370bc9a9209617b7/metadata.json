Kennedy appointed his brother Robert Kennedy attorney general.  When Brzezinski asked if he was making such a comparison, Scarborough responded by objecting to Brzezinski\u2019s question and said he wasn\u2019t saying Robert Kennedy was Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Partial transcript as follows: SCARBOROUGH: As it was when my hero  \u2014   my political hero was appointed attorney general for his brother, and Republicans didn\u2019t like that back then. I think if you looked at Bobby Kenendy\u2019s record, some good things came out of that. And no  \u2014   BRZEZINSKI: So you\u2019re comparing Ivanka Trump to Bobby Kennedy? SCARBOROUGH: You don\u2019t have to be so snotty. I was about to say, you didn\u2019t let me get it out. BRZEZINSKI: I was curious  \u2014   SCARBOROUGH: You don\u2019t have to be so rude. The fact of the matter is that they are not Bobby Kennedy as I was about to say but you wanted to get your cheap shot in so you got your cheap shot in. No, I am not saying Jared and Ivanka are Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy did a lot of things before he became attorney general of the United States of America. But, I am saying just like when John Kennedy had a question, he called the one person he could trust in the world, Bobby Kennedy to come into the Oval Office and they sat there and talked. When Donald Trump needs to talk to somebody, he talks to these two people. You may like it. You may not like it. But as Willie said, that\u2019s the reality.
