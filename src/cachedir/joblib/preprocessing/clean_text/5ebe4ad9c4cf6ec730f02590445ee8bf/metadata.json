[The Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, signed into law Wednesday by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) protects historical Confederate monuments which have come under fire in recent weeks by Democratic politicians.  The new legislation prohibits: The relocation, removal, alteration, renaming, or other disturbance of any architecturally significant building, memorial building, memorial street, or monument located on public property which has been in place for 40 or more years. State Sen. Gerald Allen ( ) who proposed the bill, noted protecting monuments is about preserving history for future generations to learn from, the Huffington Post reported. \u201cI appreciate Gov. Ivey standing up for the thoughtful preservation of Alabama\u2019s history,\u201d Allen said. \u201cContrary to what its detractors say, the Memorial Preservation Act is intended to preserve all of Alabama\u2019s history \u2015 the good and the bad \u2015 so our children and grandchildren can learn from the past to create a better future. \u201d Last week, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D) had the famous Civil War era monument of Robert E. Lee removed from its place at the center of the city\u2019s most famous traffic circle  \u2014   it had been in place for more than a century, Breitbart Texas reported. \u201cIt is   that these men did not fight for the United States of America. They fought against it. They may have been warriors, but in this cause, they were not patriots. \u201d Landrieu said. \u201cThese monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy. \u201d On February 6, the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, also voted to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee that had stood in the city park for nearly a century, Breitbart reported. The decision to erase history from the city sparked outrage as people gathered and protested peacefully for several weeks. Eventually, two organizations and 11 local citizens came together and filed a lawsuit against the City of Charlottesville to stop the removal of historical Confederate monuments. Other states have already taken steps to preserve historical monuments from those who would seek to rewrite history. In Mississippi, \u201cno statue, monument, memorial, or landmark from any war can be removed from a public property unless it\u2019s being moved to another approved location or if it blocks drivers from seeing,\u201d WLBT reported. In 2016, eBay announced they would \u201cprohibit the sale\u201d of Confederate flags following the June 17 attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church by crazed gunman Dylann Roof. Confederate flags were reportedly \u201cselling like crack\u201d after the announcement. Ryan Saavedra is a contributor for Breitbart Texas and can be found on Twitter at @RealSaavedra.
