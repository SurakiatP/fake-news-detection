The homage to the host San Diego Padres, who once wore similar uniforms, helped distinguish Home Run Derby day from every other day of this curious baseball season. Home runs are up. Way, way up. Baseball arrived at the   break with hitters on pace for more than 5, 600 home runs, a level exceeded only once in history: in 2000, at the height of the steroid era. \u201cI\u2019d like to say that guys aren\u2019t cheating,\u201d said Stephen Vogt, the Oakland Athletics\u2019 catcher. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to speculate  \u2014   right?  \u2014   when the home run numbers go up. But we are cleaning up the game, and I hope that\u2019s not the reason behind it. \u201d Before 2003, when baseball began testing for   drugs, we searched for reasons to explain the surge in home runs. Expansion, smaller ballparks and better nutrition all played a part  \u2014   but history, rightly, gave steroids most of the blame. So what now? Besides Dee Gordon  \u2014   last year\u2019s National League leader in batting average and steals  \u2014   the players caught in this season\u2019s drug net have mostly been marginal. Perhaps some sluggers are beating the system, but a widespread cheating epidemic seems unlikely. But something is happening. Two years ago, there were 4, 186 home runs, or 0. 86 per team per game. That was the lowest figure in any of the last 20 full seasons, dating to 1996. This season, there are 1. 16 homers per team per game, up from 1. 01 in 2015. Put another way, at the current pace, home runs will rise by more than 700 over the previous season for the second year in a row. That\u2019s a lot more balls soaring over fences, and one pitcher is keeping his theories private. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one who throws that stone,\u201d said Washington Nationals starter Max Scherzer, who leads the National League in homers allowed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say anything and make accusations. That\u2019s not the way you do things. But if they are up significantly, it would be interesting to see what M. L. B. actually thinks about it. \u201d Mike Teevan, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said the league does \u201cextensive reviews of the performance of the baseball, and there have been no differences\u201d to explain the increase in homers. Strikeouts, said starter Jon Lester of the Chicago Cubs, are also rising, and hitters are taking a different approach. \u201cI know our hitting coach wants you to hit the ball in the air,\u201d Lester said. \u201cThere\u2019s no slug on the ground. Guys are willing to take their   to hit the ball in the air, and swing hard in case they hit it. \u201d That theory would seem to make sense, especially as hitters react to the increasing use of extreme infield shifts. Yet the overall percentage of fly balls has not risen. According to Fangraphs, it is 34. 2 percent now only two of the past 15 seasons have been lower. What has changed is that a greater percentage of fly balls are turning into home runs. At 12. 9 percent, that figure is the highest it has been since Fangraphs started tracking the statistic in 2002. At least in one sense, perhaps, throwing harder may be working against pitchers. \u201cSecondary stuff isn\u2019t as big of a thing as it used to be, I feel like,\u201d Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said. \u201cIt\u2019s now, \u2018Can you throw 98, 99?\u2019 And a lot of breaking balls that are hanging end up getting hit out. \u201cThat\u2019s my theory: The types of arms that are getting moved through the system are guys that can really throw hard, and command sometimes comes later for them. But they get to the big league level while they\u2019re throwing hard, and then they learn command. Home runs, more times than not, are mistakes  \u2014   they\u2019re not the wrong pitch, they\u2019re just mistakes in the middle of the plate. \u201d Vogt, the Oakland catcher, said he had been calling more fastballs up in the zone lately, because umpires seem more willing to call them strikes. Missing with a high fastball can lead to home runs, of course, and so can a poorly placed cutter. If a cutter does not dart sharply at the last moment, it is just a slower fastball that stays in a hitter\u2019s bat path. \u201cThe cutter has become such a big pitch, and more guys are trying to throw it,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cBut a cutter that doesn\u2019t cut is a really good pitch to hit out. \u201d Vogt and other catchers, like San Francisco\u2019s Buster Posey and Milwaukee\u2019s Jonathan Lucroy, said they had noticed nothing different about the actual baseballs  \u2014   which, of course, they handle just as often as pitchers, though not with the same intent. \u201cWe throw those things so much, we\u2019d be able to tell if there\u2019s something different about them,\u201d Lucroy said. Lucroy pointed to recent changes at ballparks  \u2014   like Petco Park, Citi Field and Marlins Park, where fences have all come in  \u2014   as having an impact. But some pitchers, like Texas\u2019 Cole Hamels, have thrived at smaller venues because they have multiple weapons to keep hitters guessing. Younger pitchers are rarely as skilled. \u201cIt\u2019s not only having that second pitch, but having that third pitch,\u201d Hamels said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for hitters to have success when it\u2019s    \u2014   a lot better than a 25 percent chance. So when guys don\u2019t have four pitches they can essentially throw for strikes, that makes it a lot tougher. Guys are just homing in on certain counts and what guys have done statistically in the past, and they\u2019re getting it. \u201d Daniel Murphy of the Nationals best embodies the trend around him. Murphy made the   team with the Mets in 2014, when he played a full season and hit nine homers. Now he has 17 to go with a . 348 average. Murphy emphasizes damage over contact, with startling results  \u2014   and fastballs do not bother him. \u201cGuys throw so hard now, you either become accustomed to it or you have to find another line of work,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe more velocity you see, you\u2019re able to slow it down a little more. \u201d That last sentence might only make sense in the peculiar orbit of baseball, where fast can mean slow and a trend can quickly reverse itself.'"}, "time": 1742564181.1461592}
