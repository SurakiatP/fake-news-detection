Trump and Hillary Clinton collided in an almost unremittingly hostile debate on Sunday night, a   spectacle of character attacks, tawdry allegations, and Mr. Trump\u2019s startling accusation that Mrs. Clinton had \u201ctremendous hate in her heart. \u201d In a remarkable political maneuver, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton had smeared women who accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of sexually assaulting or harassing them, seeking to salvage his presidential candidacy after explosive reports about his past lewd comments about women. Tense at first, and then increasingly angry as he grew more comfortable on the attack, Mr. Trump noted that three of Mr. Clinton\u2019s accusers were sitting in the audience. It was one of several moments when Mr. Trump aimed to energize his most conservative supporters and drive a wedge between them and the elected Republican officials who have been abandoning him. He even threatened that if it were up to him, Mrs. Clinton would \u201cbe in jail\u201d for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Both candidates were visibly uneasy throughout the debate, even refusing to shake hands at the beginning, as the town hall event unfolded on a small stage in a highly charged atmosphere. It was a deeply ugly moment in American politics, featuring the sort of personal invective rarely displayed by those who aspire to lead the nation. \u201cBill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women  \u2014   attacked them viciously,\u201d Mr. Trump said, arguing that the accusations against Mr. Clinton were \u201cfar worse\u201d than Mr. Trump\u2019s own remarks in 2005 that he could grope women because he was \u201ca star. \u201d Mr. Trump apologized for those comments but also repeatedly minimized them as \u201c  talk,\u201d and even tried to blame Mrs. Clinton for raising them in light of Mr. Clinton\u2019s behavior. \u201cShe brings up words that I said 11 years ago  \u2014   I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and she should be ashamed of herself, to tell you the truth,\u201d Mr. Trump said to scattered applause. Mrs. Clinton did not specifically rebut his charges about her husband, saying only, \u201cSo much of what he just said is not right. \u201d Instead, she broadened her indictment of Mr. Trump beyond the 2005 recording, assailing him for refusing to show contrition for his many inflammatory statements. \u201cHe never apologizes to anybody for anything,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. She unfurled a litany of his provocations, including his mocking a Gold Star family, accusing a Hispanic judge of being biased by virtue of his ethnicity, ridiculing a reporter who has a disability, and falsely claiming that President Obama was not born in America. \u201cYes, this is who Donald Trump is,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said about his 2005 remarks. \u201cThe question for us, the question our country must answer, is that this is not who we are. \u201d After a tumultuous political weekend, the debate was watched extremely closely by Republican members of Congress, who are deciding whether to join dozens of elected officials who have broken away from the party\u2019s nominee. Mr. Trump\u2019s performance was   enough that no more Republican officials disavowed him in the immediate aftermath of the debate, and it prompted his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, to assure him via Twitter he would remain on the ticket after Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig debate win. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the Clintons  \u2014   including a promise that, as president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices  \u2014   were striking even in a presidential campaign that has often seemed like a race to the bottom because of Mr. Trump\u2019s    assaults on his rivals. But no single answer by Mr. Trump seemed sufficient to put to rest the controversy over his 2005 remarks. As much as he apologized, he did not confess or reveal anything new about his treatment of women over the years. Instead, Mr. Trump alternated between sounding chastened or defensive and trying to energize his base, which remains deeply hostile to Mrs. Clinton. He did so by blasting Mrs. Clinton relentlessly over her State Department email and repeatedly interrupting her, barely concealing his contempt. He said again that Mrs. Clinton should be \u201cashamed\u201d of herself for deleting some of the personal emails she sent as secretary of state. \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t delete them?\u201d he said sarcastically. Mrs. Clinton, plainly exasperated, shot back: \u201cO. K. Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight  \u2014   anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. \u201d At several points, Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with the moderators, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC, demanding that Mr. Cooper focus more on one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities, her email. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bringing up the emails?\u201d he asked, before flatly accusing the moderators of conspiring against him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, one on three,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump appeared more confident and aggressive than he had in the first debate, often dismissing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arguments out of hand and painting her as a politician \u201cfor 30 years\u201d who had no record of accomplishment. \u201cIt\u2019s just words, folks it\u2019s just words,\u201d he said about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy proposals.   minutes later, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s all talk and no action. \u201d Mr. Trump made little, if any, effort to appeal to moderate voters, instead hurling a series of insults at Mrs. Clinton. At one point, an audience member pressed him about whether he could be a \u201cdevoted president\u201d for all Americans, and he said emphatically that he could be, without acknowledging that his comments over the past year had been extraordinarily divisive. Instead, he attacked Mrs. Clinton. \u201cShe calls our people \u2018deplorable,\u2019 a large group, and irredeemable,\u201d Mr. Trump said, invoking a comment that Mrs. Clinton made last month disparaging what she said was half of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s response reflected a strategy of hers throughout the town   debate: trying to engage directly with the undecided voters in the audience who asked some of the questions, and showing her empathetic side. \u201cMr. Carter,\u201d she said, naming the man who asked the question, \u201cI have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. \u201d Mr. Trump, however, was far less concerned with connecting with the voters seated in front of him than with attacking Mrs. Clinton in ways that would rally his voters behind him, and against the Republican officials who have been coming out against him. \u201cShe\u2019s lied about a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Trump said, contending that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shift to opposing the   Partnership trade deal was a falsehood. Moments later, he painted her in some of his most vicious language of the campaign. \u201cShe has tremendous hate in her heart,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe has tremendous hatred. \u201d In that moment and several others, Mr. Trump sought to bait Mrs. Clinton into lashing out, just as she did to great effect during their first debate. But she kept her composure, while Mr. Trump often seemed disgusted and running at a high boil. He even swiped at the Republicans now disavowing him, saying they should have done a better job holding Mrs. Clinton accountable over her emails. \u201cI am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,\u201d he said. He also used a question about Mr. Pence\u2019s   rhetoric on Russia at last week\u2019s   debate to breezily dismiss his running mate. \u201cHe and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mrs. Clinton found herself on the defensive more than in the first debate, as Mr. Trump showed himself capable of some agility. When the moderators challenged her over revelations that in one of her paid speeches, she had asserted that politicians needed a \u201cpublic and a private position\u201d in making deals, she gave a meandering answer about how her remarks related to the plot of the Steven Spielberg film \u201cLincoln. \u201d Mr. Trump pounced. \u201cShe got caught in a total lie,\u201d he said. \u201cNow she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. \u201d As some audience members laughed, he added, \u201cHonest Abe never lied. \u201d Mrs. Clinton also had several strong moments, especially early in the debate, when she reminded voters of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent attacks on a former Miss Universe for gaining weight. At one point, Mr. Trump dissembled when he was pressed by a moderator about why he had posted on Twitter before dawn to accuse the beauty queen, Alicia Machado, of recording a sex tape. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018check out a sex tape,\u2019\u201d he said at the debate. Mr. Trump had in fact tweeted, \u201cCheck out sex tape. \u201d The night unfolded in dramatic fashion. Shortly before the debate, Mr. Trump held a brief news conference in St. Louis with three women  \u2014   Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey  \u2014   who allege that Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted or harassed them during his years in office in Arkansas or as president. They were joined by a fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, who was 12 when she was raped by a    in Arkansas Mrs. Clinton represented the man, who ultimately pleaded guilty to a reduced charge. Only in the final minutes was there a brief cessation in the warfare. One audience member asked the candidates to cite something positive about each other, and Mrs. Clinton reached for a common answer to such questions. \u201cLook, I respect his children,\u201d she said. \u201cHis children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. \u201d Mr. Trump thanked her for the \u201cvery nice compliment,\u201d and then offered his own. \u201cI will say this about Hillary: She doesn\u2019t quit, she doesn\u2019t give up,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter. \u201d A moment later, after the moderators concluded the debate, Mr. Trump reached out his hand, and Mrs. Clinton shook it.'"}, "time": 1742562782.8114533}
