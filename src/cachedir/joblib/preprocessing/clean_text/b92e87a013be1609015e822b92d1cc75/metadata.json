Cuomo on Monday located the cure to the nation\u2019s political fever in New York State, implicitly offering himself as an antidote to a   whose name went unmentioned. \u201cNew York knows that our progressive principles of acceptance and diversity are not the enemy of our middle class, and we know that   success is not the enemy of our progressive beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it was the progressive policies that created the nation\u2019s middle class in the first place. \u201d Ahead of his scheduled stops in western and central New York, on Long Island, in Westchester County and in Albany, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s remarks in a   room at 1 World Trade Center colored largely within state lines. But remarkably for a politician who has avoided even the appearance of White House ambitions since entering the governor\u2019s mansion in 2011, his speech also seemed aimed at an audience outside New York. Mr. Cuomo reiterated his promise to upgrade Queens\u2019s two major airports, but he dwelled far longer on the reality on Queens\u2019s streets. There, he said, the economic recovery trumpeted by the Obama administration had somehow never gotten around to the Hillside Avenue gas station where he worked as a teenager or the \u201cpizzeria where we hung out. \u201d \u201cIt is not what they feel,\u201d he said, referring to the white   voters who proved so receptive to Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt is not their reality. \u201d Lines drawn from the Elizabeth Warren syllabus got the Cuomo treatment (at one point, he noted that the Wall Street executives who presided over the financial crisis were never punished). One of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s chief proposals on Monday was a \u201c  recovery act\u201d that he said would provide jobs and erect infrastructure, expand access to education and lower taxes. Lest anybody miss the point, the governor\u2019s staff circulated \u201ckey takeaways\u201d and quotations from the speech, billing the address as a groundbreaking blueprint for moving forward in the Trump era. There were   \u2019   proposals covering what seemed like the whole spectrum of liberal causes. Doubling the   tax credit for more than 200, 000 families. Executive orders intended to reduce a wage gap for women working for the state. Criminal justice reforms affecting the state\u2019s bail system, recordings of police interrogations, the age of criminal liability and access to a speedy trial.   voter registration and early voting. Mr. Cuomo proposed a defense fund guaranteeing legal representation to immigrants, as well as passing the Dream Act, a   piece of legislation that would open financial aid at state colleges to undocumented immigrants. For environmentalists, Mr. Cuomo unveiled a deal, reported by The New York Times on Friday, that would lead to the shutdown of Indian Point, a nuclear plant north of New York City. The governor had already announced several initiatives before the speech, including a pledge to cover tuition costs at state universities and community colleges for families making up to $125, 000 a year. Some of his ideas seemed to be flags planted directly on the liberal territory previously staked out by Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, who listened from the second row on Monday  \u2014   the latest subplot of a feud between governor and mayor that recently reached new depths over the death of a   deer. Mr. Cuomo even took credit for establishing a universal prekindergarten program in New York City, a mayoral proposal ultimately financed by Albany. Yet for all that Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont might find to like in the speech, Mr. Cuomo, who has been criticized by the left over collaborating with Republicans, faces a bumpy session in Albany. Legislators have taken the governor\u2019s decision to split the traditional State of the State address in Albany into six regional events as a snub, and legislative leaders have declined to attend. But there was someone present who wanted to air the legislators\u2019 grievances, however lonely the quest. About 64 floors below the pristine white room in which Mr. Cuomo spoke, Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party and a Trump supporter who had been denied entrance, monitored the proceedings from a Joe  the Juice shop. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid to face them,\u201d Mr. Cox said outside afterward, referring to state legislators. \u201cSo he\u2019s running around the state giving great speeches that really sound like speeches for someone who\u2019d like to be president of the United States, rather than someone who\u2019s governor of New York State. \u201d In the cold wind, Mr. Cox fended off a shiver. He planned to follow the governor to his afternoon speech in Buffalo, where Mr. Cox would be, doubtless, equally unwelcome.'"}, "time": 1742628372.2401931}
