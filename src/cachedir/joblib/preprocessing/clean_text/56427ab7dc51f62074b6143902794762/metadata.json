[The smooth swinging    Els, AKA The Big Easy, thinks it quite plausible that Tiger can work his way back to winning tournaments again, including major championships. Els, who won the last of his four major at the British Open at Royal Lytham  St. Annes Golf Club in 2012 at age 42, points out, \u201cIf players like myself, Darren Clarke and Mark O\u2019Meara won (majors) in our 40s, surely Tiger thinks he can do it too. I am sure it\u2019s on his agenda. \u201d  Els says he would love to see Tiger play like his old self and thinks that he can do it if he can get it going at some of his favorite tournaments.  \u201cMentally, he is as strong as anybody but he needs to find some momentum at his favorite events and if he gets that, he can start believing again. I would love to see him play like he did back in the 90s, but I am not sure that is going to happen,\u201d Els told reporters on Wednesday. Certainly, there are a number of events he likes and no one exemplifies the idea of \u201chorses for courses\u201d more than Tiger. Woods has dominated more golf courses than any golfer in the history of the sport. He\u2019s won at least four times on the same course at seven different Tour stops: Cog Hill (former home of the BMW Championship) Firestone (WGC Bridgestone) Doral (WGC Cadillac) Muirfield Village (the Memorial) Bay Hill (Arnold Palmer Invitational) Augusta National (the Masters) and Torrey Pines (Farmers Insurance Open). The South African knows where his bread is buttered and who has held the spreader for the last couple of decades. \u201cWe would not be playing for the money we play for if it wasn\u2019t for Tiger, so we have to thank him for that, for what he has done for the game and it can only be good if he plays well. \u201d Els praised Tiger for his achievements, observing that \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 years since he won his first major at the Masters and it\u2019s quite amazing what he has achieved. \u201d He added, Woods \u201chas won 14 majors in that span and he was injured for at least three or four of those seasons, so it\u2019s really a major for every year he has been healthy as a professional. That\u2019s incredible. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564538.387288}
