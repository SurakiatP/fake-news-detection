[With seventeen votes against two, along with two abstentions, the committee agreed that \u201cthe most sophisticated autonomous robots could be established as having the status of electronic persons with specific rights and obligations, including that of making good any damage they may cause. \u201d  The   report asserts that humanity stands \u201con the threshold of an era\u201d in which artificial intelligence could be responsible for a \u201cnew industrial revolution. \u201d It includes obligations that robots would be held to as well, which seem based on Asimov\u2019s Three Laws of Robotics, introduced by the author in a 1942 short story. His visionary fiction is now on the road to becoming a legal reality. Luxembourg MEP Mady Delvaux has further proposed a \u201ckill switch,\u201d a mechanism by which humans could deactivate any artificially intelligent entity that operates outside of the laws established. Different levels of accountability would be assigned robots based on their level of sophistication, with increased levels of personal responsibility commensurate with the complexity of the synthetic being in question. Despite offering a semblance of humane treatment to robots, the draft report also proposes very stringent boundaries on their design. It clearly draws a line in the sand, where \u201ca robot is not a human and will never be human. A robot can show empathy but it cannot feel empathy. \u201d Furthermore, it declares that no robot should ever appear to be \u201cemotionally dependent. \u201d Robots should never be allowed to seem overtly human, or \u201cthat he loves you or he is sad. \u201d Delvaux addressed the need to solve the complicated problems arising from daily interaction with complex AI in a brief interview. Among those issues are things as obvious as safety and privacy, but as nuanced as \u201cinformed consent. \u201d The rise of artificial life will very likely be humanity\u2019s first interaction with intelligent   entities. Despite being of our own creation, there is a distinct possibility that they could outstrip us both mentally and physically. It\u2019s heartening to see such concepts addressed with the gravity they\u2019re owed, even if such rules are somehow never necessary. The draft report and its revolutionary proposals are now on their way to the house, which will vote on it in February.
