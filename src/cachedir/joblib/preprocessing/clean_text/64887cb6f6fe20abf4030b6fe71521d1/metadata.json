[Marlow asked what Dow 21, 000 means to the average person. Carney replied that \u201cpeople\u2019s retirement savings [and] investment portfolios, have gone up tremendously. \u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a tremendous rally  \u2014   in fact, the fastest ever, or it tied the fastest ever   gain on record. You might remember just a little while ago, we were talking about Dow 20, 000, and then in just a few weeks, we\u2019ve hit Dow 21, 000. Huge, tremendous rally,\u201d Carney said. Marlow asked if President Trump\u2019s \u201cgloating\u201d and \u201cbraggadocio\u201d over the stock market rally could backfire. \u201cYeah, look, you\u2019ve got to be careful, right? Because if you own the rally, and it reverses, you\u2019re going to end up owning the slump, as well,\u201d Carney cautioned. \u201cStock markets don\u2019t only go up. They\u2019re not only going to go up during the Trump administration. So far, they have  \u2014   the stock market\u2019s actually up 15 percent since Election Day, which is gigantic. It\u2019s up five percent just over the last few weeks. But history is very clear: stock markets go up, and they go down. You\u2019ve got to be a little cautious about this. \u201d \u201cA lot of the force behind the rally is a lot of optimism about what\u2019s going to happen with taxes, with trade, with regulation, but all that stuff has to go through Congress, and Congress can be a very messy place,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot of the details about what\u2019s going to happen with Trump\u2019s tax plan. Even if we knew the details about what he wants, that\u2019ll get changed when it goes to Congress. People could be disappointed. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates ibn fact, they\u2019re likely to. That could also end up putting the brakes on the rally and perhaps causing stocks to go the other way. \u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve got to be cautious when you start bragging about the stock market going up,\u201d he advised. Marlow asked if Met Life\u2019s \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d case would be a major test of Trump\u2019s agenda, a subject Carney is writing about at length for Breitbart News. \u201cMet Life is one of the three largest insurance companies in the United States. AIG and Prudential are the others,\u201d Carney explained. \u201cUnder the Obama administration, a financial regulatory body called FSOC labeled them as \u2018too big to fail.\u2019 The official label is a SIFI, Systemically Important Financial Institution. Met Life fought it, won in court, and the court struck down that designation. \u201d \u201cThe Obama administration appealed that case and said, \u2018Even though the court struck it down, we would like the appeals court to put that label back on them as too big to fail.\u2019 The court hasn\u2019t decided anything yet. The Trump administration can, if it wants to, rescind the appeal  \u2014   in other words, ask the court, \u2018Hey, never mind. We\u2019re okay with the original decision\u2019 and go forward with that,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis will be a test. The president has said he wants to slow down the enormous growth of the regulatory state. This is an opportunity to do that, but there\u2019s a ticking clock on it. Once the appeals court makes its decision, you can\u2019t sort of wave it away the way you can right now, and you\u2019ll end up having to appeal it perhaps to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to slow the growth of the regulatory state. The question is whether or not they\u2019re going to take it now,\u201d Carney concluded. Marlow noted that Trump has been criticized as a \u201cchampion of Wall Street,\u201d even though he ran a populist campaign. \u201cLook, I think that there are multiple ways of thinking about somebody as a \u2018champion for Wall Street,\u2019\u201d Carney argued. \u201cThe Trump administration so far, at least in terms of the stock market, has been very good for a lot of these big financial institutions  \u2014   but it\u2019s also been very good for the smaller businesses. If you look at the broader index, the SP 500 or the Russell 2000, those stocks have also done very well. \u201d  \u201cEven though it entails putting more regulation on them, it also sort of puts a patina of protection around them and says these are the institutions that the United States thinks are so important it will never let them fail,\u201d he said.
