Reuters, however, never explains why any weapons at all would be provided to \u201crebel\u201d groups so clearly and transparently in league with Jabhat Al Nusra in the first place. \\nFinally, Reuters claims: \\nGrad rockets were launched at Aleppo\u2019s Nairab air base before the assault began said Zakaria Malahiji, head of the political office of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim rebel group, adding that it was going to be \u201ca big battle\u201d. \\nThe Observatory also said that Grad surface-to-surface rockets had struck locations around the Hmeimim air base, near Latakia. \\nGrad rockets are an effective weapon in combat on open terrain. In the confined urban environment of Aleppo, they are an indiscriminate weapon the West, its media and its human rights advocates have little trouble pointing out their use constitutes a war crime, but only when used by forces of nations the West seeks to undermine and ultimately overthrow. No mention of their indiscriminate, inappropriate nature when used in urban environments is made when used by forces backed by Western interests. \\nAlso, Reuters\u2019 inadvertently mentions the \u201crebel\u201d group Fastaqim in the closing paragraphs of its report, a faction operating under the Aleppo-based Fatah Halab (Aleppo Conquest) coalition. It was revealed by the West\u2019s own rights advocacy group, Amnesty International, in a post titled, \u201c Syria: armed opposition group committing war crimes in Aleppo \u2013 new evidence ,\u201d that: \\nThe Aleppo Conquest armed groups may have used chemical weapons, as well as \u2018hell cannon\u2019 gas canister munitions. \\nArmed groups surrounding the predominantly Kurdish Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo city have repeatedly carried out indiscriminate attacks \u2013 possibly including with chemical weapons \u2013 that have struck civilian homes, markets and mosques, killing and injuring civilians, and have displayed a shameful disregard for human life, said Amnesty International today. \\nIndeed, even groups described as \u201crebels\u201d by the Western media, are guilty of serial offences that clearly make them terrorists, not \u201crebels.\u201d The fact that this information is omitted from Reuters\u2019 reports and the nature of these groups\u2019 relationship with Al Qaeda affiliates made as intentionally nebulous as possible, reveals a common theme that has run through Western coverage of the Syrian conflict since it began; a concerted effort to conceal the true terroristic nature of so-called \u201crebels\u201d in a bid to legitimize the illegitimate, and defend the indefensible.\""}, "time": 1742562255.9127107}
