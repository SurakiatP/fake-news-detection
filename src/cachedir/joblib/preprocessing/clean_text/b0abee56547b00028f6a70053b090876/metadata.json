American national security is our government\u2019s first and foremost responsibility, then the economy \u2013 those two issues really are paramount to any American,\u201d Miami chapter president Vincent Foster told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening. \\n\u201cOur membership has gotten behind the Republican national nominee and it\u2019s unfortunate that other Republicans are unable to do so. Regardless of differences, we understand that a Hillary Clinton presidency is only going to be detrimental to the LGBT community and the general American population.\u201d \\nLCR announced on Oct. 22 that it would not support Trump despite his being \u201cperhaps the most pro-LGBT presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Party\u201d because he has \u201cconcurrently surrounded himself with senior advisers with a record of opposing LGBT equality.\u201d \\nFoster said the national organization\u2019s decision was a \u201cbig surprise\u201d and prompted the South Florida chapter to re-evaluate the matter. On Oct. 26, the 20 members of Miami LCR unanimously voted to endorse Trump. \\nThe Miami chapter has had a long-standing relationship with Trump, Foster explained. The billionaire businessman\u2019s campaign initially reached out to the group months ago to work together in the battleground state. Foster added the campaign attended the group\u2019s Lincoln Day dinner and has been fully supportive of them. \\n\u201cTo have a Republican presidential nominee who cares so much, especially after Orlando \u2013 that resonated so much,\u201d Foster said. \\nAlthough LCR typically does not allow local chapters to support other candidates, the organization is allowing for flexibility in this election. The Washington, D.C.-based national group is permitting regional chapters to endorse or not endorse Trump in this election. \\nLog Cabin Republicans in Cleveland, Los Angeles, Orange County, Texas and Georgia have also endorsed Trump, according to Angelo.
