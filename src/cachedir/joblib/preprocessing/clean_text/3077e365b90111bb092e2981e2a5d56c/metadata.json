A   hit with two Oscar nominations for acting, it contains one of the genre\u2019s most memorable images and an ending that has been ripped off dozens of times. It also gave a career lift to a young novelist named Stephen King. Yet revisit \u201cCarrie\u201d 40 years later, as you can do on a new   version from Shout! Factory, and you might think, \u201cThis . .. is not that scary. \u201d A high school drama, yes. A resonant look at the emotional damage caused by bullying, yes. But a horror movie? Not so much. \u201cI never really approached it as a horror movie,\u201d said its director, Brian De Palma, who scored his first hit with the film. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a character piece. She does go berserk after she gets hit with the bucket of blood, but until then, not really. What made this really good  \u2014   both the book and the film  \u2014   is that it capsulized everyone\u2019s high school experience of being an outsider. \u201d Mr. King\u2019s first published novel, \u201cCarrie\u201d (1974) focuses on the teenage daughter of a repressed religious mother. She is a loner, a victim of constant mockery and, oh yes, able to move things with her mind. Carrie has her first period in the school shower and is assaulted by classmates. After she goes to the senior prom with one of the most popular boys, then is doused with pig\u2019s blood as a prank, she goes on a telekinetic rampage. Mr. King has written many doorstoppers, but \u201cCarrie\u201d is one of his shortest novels. \u201cIt\u2019s really a simple story,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cAnd people saw Carrie as an extreme case of what they went through in high school. \u201d Fresh out of college when he started the book, teaching high school English by day, Mr. King said he understood \u201cit from both sides of the desk. There was a visceral sense that I was writing about something that I understood and felt deeply at the time. \u201d In the   few had heard of Mr. King, a teacher who had mainly published short stories in men\u2019s magazines. Lawrence D. Cohen, then working for a movie producer in New York, had certainly never heard of him when he first came across the manuscript. He was later hired to write the screenplay after it was optioned by the producer Paul Monash. \u201cI understood why critics were perplexed as to what genre \u2018Carrie\u2019 belonged to,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cWas it a high school movie, a   novel, a horror piece, a psychological thriller?\u201d The film eventually landed at United Artists with Mr. De Palma as director. Holding joint auditions with George Lucas, who was then casting \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Mr. De Palma found a relatively   cast, including John Travolta, Betty Buckley, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving. Though written in the novel as a \u201cchunky girl\u201d and a \u201cfrog among swans,\u201d the screen Carrie was Sissy Spacek, who had starred in Terrence Malick\u2019s first film, \u201cBadlands\u201d (1973). \u201cThe studio didn\u2019t even want me to test Sissy,\u201d Mr. De Palma said of Ms. Spacek, who had come to audition with Vaseline smeared in her hair to look greasy and unglamorous. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the part she\u2019ll be best remembered for even though she won an Oscar for another role. \u201d (Both Ms. Spacek and Piper Laurie, who played her mother, were nominated for \u201cCarrie. \u201d) After decades of slasher flicks,   films and   movies, it\u2019s surprising to see how much of \u201cCarrie\u201d is a naturalistic, compelling story about high school: shopping for prom clothes, cruising around town, serving detention, dancing first dances together. That bucket of blood doesn\u2019t fall until the last 20 minutes. United Artists considered marketing it as a  . \u201cThey wanted to change the title to \u2018Pray for Carrie,\u2019 which is a very   title,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cAnd they ended up taking out an ad that was a poster of Carrie covered in blood, which was a spoiler before that word was used, but a clear way of selling the movie. I remember looking at it going, \u2018They\u2019ve lost their minds they\u2019re giving away the whole movie. \u2019\u201d In retrospect, the poster is a superb example of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s explanation of the difference between suspense and surprise  \u2014   knowing a bomb will explode and tensing for it, versus having it blow up with no warning. Bloody Carrie is the bomb the audience saw before the movie even started. One reason \u201cCarrie\u201d is considered such an effective horror movie is its final two minutes, in which Ms. Irving\u2019s good girl, Sue Snell, visits a grave and a hand shoots from the ground, sending audiences from the theater with one more scare. It was the last thing they remembered about the movie and the first thing they told friends. \u201cWhat the ending did was establish Stephen King as a brand name for horror,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who also wrote a \u201cCarrie\u201d stage musical and the screenplay for the 2013 movie remake. The success of the original film boosted sales for the novel, and Mr. King\u2019s next novel after the movie, \u201cThe Shining,\u201d became his first hardcover best seller, and he was off. But Mr. King has never lost his view of high school as a place like the island in \u201cLord of the Flies. \u201d Those   hallways are the true dark corridors, and you don\u2019t need to add too much to make it scarier than it already is. \u201cI tell people, \u2018If you look back on high school as the high point of your life,\u2019\u201d you\u2019re one   American, Mr. King said, using rougher language. \u201cMost of us look at high school as something we escaped. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562405.9280965}
