He doesn\u2019t have an anti-Semitic bone in his body.\u201d \u2014 David Horowitz, Jewish founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center and editor of FrontPage Magazine . \\nWhen president-elect Donald Trump named Steve Bannon, the controversial media figure behind the alt-right website Breitbart News Network, as his \u201csenior strategist\u201d \u2014 major Jewish groups raised the alarm. \\nThe Anti-Defamation League condemned the move, saying Bannon\u2019s website was home to racists and fostered hatred against Jews. But to his Jewish defenders \u2014 which include Breitbart\u2019s CEO and senior editors for the site \u2014 he is an ally and proud Zionist. \\n\u201cI can say, without hesitation, that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel, as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader,\u201d Joel Pollak, an Orthodox Jew and a senior editor for Breitbart News, wrote on Monday. \\nIndeed, Breitbart\u2019s origin story has its roots in Israel, according to Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s CEO and president, another close Jewish colleague of Bannon. \\nIn a November 2015 post on Breitbart News, Solov describes the conception of the news site in 2007. It happened, Solov writes, during a trip to Israel with Andrew Breitbart, the Jewish founder and namesake of the website. \\nThe site was born to defend the Jewish state. \\n\u201cOne thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel,\u201d Solov wrote. \u201cWe were sick of the anti-Israel bias of the mainstream media.\u201d \\nSolov and Breitbart were \u201cblown away by the spirit, tenacity and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip,\u201d Solov wrote. \\nBreitbart died in 2012 and Bannon became editor of the site. \\nUnder Bannon\u2019s leadership, the site became one of the best known platforms and gateways for the alt-right, a diverse group that traffics in white nationalism and racism. Richard Spencer , a founder of the political movement who advocates for the creation of a \u201cwhite ethno-state,\u201d called Breitbart a \u201cgateway\u201d to alt-right ideas and writers. \\nDuring Trump\u2019s campaign, the site became particularly enamored with the Republican candidate and lampooned and attacked his opponents. \\nFor Ben Shapiro, a former writer at Breitbart News, Bannon betrayed the original vision of the site\u2019s founder. \\n\u201cAndrew Breitbart despised racism,\u201d Shapiro wrote on Monday. \u201cWith Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website \u2026 pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.\u201d \\nBut even as the site may have appealed to anti-Semites, it retained its Zionist bona fides under Bannon. \\nIn 2015, Bannon launched a Jerusalem branch of Breitbart News, which covers events in Israel. It is edited by Israel-based American reporter Aaron Klein, another Bannon advocate. Klein, a Yeshiva University graduate, is also a columnist for the Jewish Press, a weekly newspaper with a conservative bent. \\nKlein recently called the anti-Trump protests across the country a product of \u201cprofessional agitators\u201d who are seeking the \u201cdownfall of the U.S. capitalist system.\u201d \\nThe activist Pamela Geller, known for her anti-Islamic campaigning, also counts herself among Bannon\u2019s Jewish allies. On Twitter, Geller defended Bannon recently, dismissing those who were characterizing Bannon as an anti-Semite. \\n\u201cHe partnered [with] Breitbart \u2014 a Jew,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe partnered [with] Larry Solov (after Breitbart died) a Jew. He worked [with] me \u2014 a Jew.\u201d Then she added: #Zionist. \\nDavid Horowitz, founder of the conservative think tank David Horowitz Freedom Center also came to Bannon\u2019s defense, saying Bannon does not have an \u201canti-Semitic bone in his body.\u201d \\n\u201cAs a Jew who has worked for years with Steve Bannon,\u201d Horowitz wrote in an email to the Forward, \u201cI can tell you he is not an anti-Semite or a white nationalist.\u201d LD : For further proof that Steve Bannon is not going to do anything to challenge Jewish power in America or stand up to Israel, see this thought-provoking article in the Occidental Observer : Anti-Semitism as Political Assassination: The Smearing of Steve Bannon. I really do feel at this stage, though of course I could be wrong, that diehard anti-Semites and ardent White Nationalists are most unlikely to see any of their dreams come true in the foreseeable future. That\u2019s what makes anti-Semites and White nationalists the angriest people on earth: their dreams are constantly being shattered as they see the Jews becoming more powerful and tyrannical at their expense. Constant defeat leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Like this? Share it now.'"}, "time": 1742561742.907594}
