Nobody in the current administration knows whether anyone in the next has read any of it. Less than three days before President Obama turns the keys to the White House, and the nuclear codes, over to   Donald J. Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition staff has barely engaged with the National Security Council below the most senior levels. His designated national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, has met four times with his Obama counterpart, Susan E. Rice, most recently on Tuesday afternoon. But the chronic upheaval in Mr. Trump\u2019s transition, a delay in appointing senior National Security Council staff members, and a dearth of people with security clearances have deprived the Trump team of weeks of prep work on some of the most complex national security issues facing the country. \u201cWe really wanted to make sure there was nothing a new team needed to know that we hadn\u2019t told them,\u201d Ms. Rice said in an interview. \u201cIt took them more time than we expected for them to be ready to engage with us. \u201d Now, she added, \u201cwe\u2019re racing to make up lost time. \u201d Ms. Rice insisted that she was confident the Trump administration would have the information it needed by the time Mr. Trump was sworn in. The process has settled down in recent days with the arrival of Keith Kellogg, a retired   Army general whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff of the N. S. C. last month, and who is now running the transition. In a statement, Mr. Flynn said, \u201cMembers of our incoming team have held extensive meetings with their N. S. C. counterparts. \u201d He thanked Ms. Rice for her \u201ccooperation and assistance. \u201d Last week, the two engaged in a public display of harmony, shaking hands at a \u201cpass the baton\u201d conference sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. Still, officials from both the Obama and Trump teams acknowledged that the transition had been rocky, in no small part because Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton caught both the outgoing and incoming administrations so completely by surprise. Had Mrs. Clinton won, her staff planned to place a transition team in the N. S. C. within a couple of days. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, the first contact with the National Security Council did not come until Nov. 22, two weeks after Election Day. That delay was caused by the purge of the original transition team led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Among those swept out was Matthew Freedman, who had been chosen to run the N. S. C. transition but quickly came under scrutiny because of his foreign lobbying ties. Mr. Freedman\u2019s replacement, Marshall Billingslea, a former Pentagon and State Department official, arrived in the West Wing with six people, only two of whom had security clearances. The Obama administration began meeting with that team after Thanksgiving, but its lack of clearances meant that Mr. Trump\u2019s emissaries could not read the materials that the Obama people had prepared for them. The N. S. C. began creating unclassified versions of the papers. Then, in   there was another   when Mr. Billingslea was replaced by General Kellogg, who began meeting with his Obama counterparts this month. By some accounts, the situation is even more fluid in the State Department and the Pentagon, where the Trump team has devoted much of its attention to lining up cabinet secretaries and will now have to win Senate confirmation for dozens of other senior officials. Officials in the State Department\u2019s transition office said that they had had only intermittent contact with Trump representatives, and that those people often changed. But the snags in the National Security Council transition may be more problematic, current and former officials said, because that is the organization that advises the president on the most urgent foreign policy issues, drawing together recommendations from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies. \u201cThis is the nerve center of the White House,\u201d said David J. Rothkopf, the chief executive and editor of the FP Group, who has written a history of the N. S. C. \u201cRunning the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power. \u201d \u201cIf your brain isn\u2019t functioning, your arms and legs aren\u2019t going to function. \u201d Because none of the jobs on the National Security Council require Senate confirmation, it can in theory be staffed more quickly than other government agencies. Much of the organization\u2019s policy staff is composed of career civil servants, who are lent by their agencies to the White House for a limited term of service. The Trump administration plans to keep on most of these people, as the Obama administration did. But that still leaves a cadre of senior directors, who run departments that develop policy on Asia, Western Europe, Russia, nonproliferation and other areas. While the Trump team has chosen several senior directors, an official said, it has not yet announced them. And the efforts have been complicated by outside distractions. On Monday, Monica Crowley, a Fox News commentator and writer whom Mr. Trump had named deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, announced that she would not take the post after CNN disclosed that she had plagiarized passages of her 2012 book, \u201cWhat the (Bleep) Just Happened?\u201d Later, Politico reported that she had done the same in her doctoral dissertation. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers initially defended Ms. Crowley, labeling the plagiarism charges \u201ca politically motivated attack. \u201d But her position became untenable because part of her job would have involved writing speeches. HarperCollins, Ms. Crowley\u2019s publisher, said it would withdraw the digital edition of her book until she revised the copied passages. \u201cThe Monica Crowley episode is a sign of failure on several levels,\u201d Mr. Rothkopf said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t vetted enough, and they waited too long after the plagiarism scandal broke to act. \u201d Ms. Rice said that ensuring a smooth transition had been one of her major priorities for 2016, and that she had set a goal to \u201cmeet or exceed what the Bush administration did for us. \u201d N. S. C. officials began drafting briefing papers last summer. Some focused on nuts and bolts: How do you arrange meetings? How do you circulate information to the agencies? Others discussed the evolution of administration policies or contingency planning for crises. Most were three to five pages to make them easy to digest. A Trump official said that members of the team had read some of the memos and praised their quality. But there is an inherent tension in transitions, particularly between two administrations with starkly different political views. Officials in the Bush administration said they doubted that the incoming Obama people read all the briefing papers they prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, because you campaigned on how these guys drove the car into the ditch,\u201d said Peter D. Feaver, who served on the Bush N. S. C. \u201cNow, here are memos from the guys who were driving the car, and they drove the car into a ditch. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564162.5065017}
