[Dr. Uran Botobekov, an expert on political Islam, argues in an   published by the Diplomat that Beijing should take the threats seriously.  \u201cIt must be noted that these two groups [ISIS and  ] have similar strategies of jihad against Beijing and   propaganda tactics,\u201d notes Dr. Botobekov. \u201cThe main characters in both videos are Uyghur militants fighting under the auspices of ISIS and   in Syria and Iraq. Both videos feature calls to the Muslim world to wage jihad against the kafirs [ ] of China and to perform acts of revenge for the deaths of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. \u201d The Chinese province of Xinjiang, which borders   Afghanistan and volatile   Kashmir, is home to China\u2019s largest concentration of Uyghurs, or Uighurs. China\u2019s communist government has acknowledged that jihadist groups, particularly the   affiliate known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to \u201csecurity and stability of China and the region. \u201d During a Chinese military parade on February 28 featuring 10, 000 armed police officers, Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party\u2019s secretary in China\u2019s autonomous province of Xinjiang, urged Chinese authorities to \u201cbury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the people\u2019s war,\u201d reports the Shanghaiist. Xinjiang, which borders   Afghanistan and volatile   Kashmir, is home to China\u2019s largest concentration of Uyghurs, or Uighurs. In late February, ISIS and the    TIP released propaganda videos featuring members of China\u2019s Uyghur Muslim minority vowing to carry out attacks on Chinese soil. \u201cSoon the black flag of Tawhid [Unity of Allah] will be hanging in the capital cities of the United States, Russia, and China,\u201d declares a Chinese Uyghur jihadist in the ISIS video. \u201cOh, you Chinese, who do not understand what people say! We are the soldiers of Allah, will make you understand Islam with the tongues of our weapons. We will come to you to shed blood like rivers and avenge the oppressed,\u201d he adds before savagely decapitating a prisoner dressed in red, a color traditionally associated with communism. China has repeatedly denied allegations of religious persecution against its Uighur population, described as oppressed by Beijing in an assessment from the New America   last year. The recent threats against China come amid mounting pressure from U. S.  local forces fighting both ISIS and   in the Middle East. In his Diplomat piece, Dr. Botobekov, notes, \u201cThe leaders of global jihadist movements are likely to want to relocate the center of the conflict area closer to China, Central Asia, and Afghanistan after the downfall of the Islamic State in the Middle East. \u201d ISIS is increasingly losing territory to U. S.  troops in Iraq and Syria. Although   is believed to be benefiting from the international community\u2019s primary focus on its younger rival ISIS in the Middle East, the older terrorist group is also taking losses. Dr. Botobekov writes: Despite significant losses on the battlefield, ISIS and   are intensifying propaganda activities in the virtual world. Last month, both groups released media targeting China specifically  \u2026     The final days of February 2017 saw both ISIS and a group affiliated with   target China specifically. Given that both have carried out devastating terrorist attacks, it\u2019s reasonable to say that Beijing needs to take the Islamists\u2019 threats seriously. ISIS and   have established official branches in Asia, particularly in Afghanistan  \u2014   the Khorasan Province (   ) and the   in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) respectively. In late February, ISIS released a propaganda video specifically targeting citizens of Central and Asia and China. Days later, the Turkestan Islamic Party published its own propaganda video targeting China. \u201cInterestingly, the video prepared by ISIS takes aim both at China and at the TIP,\u201d notes the  . The South China Morning Post reports that Beijing is planning to boost military spending to combat Uyghur jihadists in Xinjiang.'"}, "time": 1742561994.452607}
