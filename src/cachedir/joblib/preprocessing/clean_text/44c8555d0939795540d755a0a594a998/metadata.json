I\u2019m not scared, though. \u201d  But Freeman, who narrated a campaign ads for Clinton during the primary and the general election, says he\u2019s being positive about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI\u2019m holding out hope that Donald Trump has to be a good president,\u201d the   actor said. \u201cHe can\u2019t not be. What I see is a guy who will not lose. \u201d Freeman\u2019s comments were made before Trump\u2019s signed an executive order temporarily prohibiting the arrival of Syrian refugees into the United States and halting the entry of most citizens from Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Freeman went from a short career in the United States Air Force to being nominated for three Academy Awards and winning one. He\u2019s played God once, and POTUS a couple of times, along the way. \u201cSome people thought Hollywood wasn\u2019t ready for a black president, but I didn\u2019t consider it,\u201d said Freeman, who played U. S. President in Deep Impact (2008) and Olympus Has Fallen (2013). \u201cI\u2019m not a professional black actor I\u2019m a professional actor. I can remember only once in the movies playing black, and that was Driving Miss Daisy. \u201d The    actor recently kicked off the second season of National Geographic\u2019s The Story of God, which follows Freeman as he explores various religions and cultures around the world. Freeman is being honored with AARP\u2019s \u201cMovies for Grownups Career Achievement Award. \u201d You can read Freeman\u2019s full cover story in the   2017 AARP: The Magazine.
