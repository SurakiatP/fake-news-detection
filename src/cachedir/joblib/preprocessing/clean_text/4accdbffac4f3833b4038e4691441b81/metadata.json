Hosts of this year\u2019s Hilton parties  \u2014   held in ballrooms and massive tents around its compound  \u2014   included HBO, the Weinstein Company, Fox, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Amazon, Warner Bros. and InStyle. The biggest stars often skipped those parties altogether, and instead beelined to the exclusive talent agency fests, held at the Sunset Tower Hotel and the Chateau Marmont. Confined to the Hilton, the Bagger joined the star stalkers herself, seeking answers to the burning question: What did celebrities think of Meryl Streep\u2019s speech? (For a general idea, click here). The Bagger first cornered the preternaturally glamorous Joan Collins, as the British actress was carefully ascending a small flight of stairs at the Fox party. \u201cI think she is one of the greatest actresses of a generation,\u201d Ms. Collins said of Ms. Streep. \u201cShe has the right to say whatever she wants. And I think if you look at people\u2019s faces in the audience, people went along with her. \u201d At the HBO party, Eddie Redmayne said he found Ms. Streep\u2019s speech \u201cincredibly emotional,\u201d but was so distracted by her presence in the audience while presenting the award for best musical or comedy that he almost forgot to read the nominees. He wouldn\u2019t say whether he thought Hollywood should take a page from Ms. Streep and speak out politically. The Bagger nabbed Bryan Cranston at the HBO party, too. Mr. Cranston, who has spoofed a Donald J. Trump presidency on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d got a little misty just speaking about Ms. Streep\u2019s words. \u201cShe was able to deliver an important message that resonated with all of us, with grace and dignity and no vitriol or hyperbole,\u201d he said, \u201cIt was just beautifully delivered, to convey the anxiety that we are feeling, and the concern. \u201d Vince Vaughn, who has supported Republican presidential candidates in the past, was chatting a few feet away, so the Bagger asked him, too. Did he think Ms. Streep\u2019s speech was an example of how Hollywood should respond to the politics of our time? \u201cI think people should say what they want to say, and what she said was beautiful,\u201d Mr. Vaughn said. The Bagger\u2019s eyes then fell on John Corbett, a. k. a. Aidan from \u201cSex and the City. \u201d Was Hollywood the platform to address politics? \u201cA whole lot of \u2018Apprentice\u2019 watchers just elected the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Corbett said, breaking into a dazzler of a grin, \u201cso I guess it is!\u201d The night ended on a high note, with Kerry Washington, who was at the party with her husband, Nnamdi Asomugha, agreeing to weigh in. (\u201cOne question!\u201d her manager told the Bagger.) Ms. Washington said she found Ms. Streep\u2019s speech beautiful too, adding that in a democracy, there\u2019s never a time when citizens, whatever their stripe, shouldn\u2019t speak out. \u201cI don\u2019t think that people of Hollywood should be silenced because of what we do for a living,\u201d Ms. Washington said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s important that she said what she said because she\u2019s an actress. I think it\u2019s important she said what she said because she\u2019s a citizen. We all have a First Amendment right of free speech. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563756.8962026}
