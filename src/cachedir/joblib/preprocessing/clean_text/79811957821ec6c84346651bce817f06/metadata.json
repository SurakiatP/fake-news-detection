And he saw that it was good at spreading his belief that the Bible is a book of history, the universe is only 6, 000 years old, and evolution is wrong and is leading to our moral downfall. And Mr. Ham said, let us build a gargantuan Noah\u2019s ark only 45 minutes away to draw millions more visitors. And let it be constructed by Amish woodworkers, and financed with donations, junk bonds and tax rebates from the state of Kentucky. And let it hold an animatronic Noah and lifelike models of some of the creatures that came on board    such as bears,   giraffes  \u2014   and juvenile Tyrannosaurus rexes. And it was so. Mr. Ham\u2019s \u201cArk Encounter,\u201d built at a cost of more than $102 million, is scheduled to open on July 7 in Williamstown, Ky. Mr. Ham and his crew have succeeded in erecting a colossal landmark and an ambitious promotional vehicle for their particular brand of Christian fundamentalism, known as \u201cyoung earth\u201d or \u201cyoung universe\u201d creationism. But it was hardly smooth sailing. The state tried to revoke the tax rebates after learning that Mr. Ham would require employees to sign a \u201cstatement of faith\u201d that would exclude people who were gay or did not accept his particular Christian creed. Mr. Ham went to court and in January, he won. On a recent afternoon, the   Mr. Ham looked out on the workers in hard hats affixing pine planking to cover the Tyvek plastic wrap still visible on the stern. The ark stretches     football fields long, rises as high as a   building and is said to be the largest   building in the world. Mr. Ham is betting it will become an international pilgrimage site, as well as a draw for the curious, the seculars and even the skeptics. \u201cThe reason we are building the ark is not as an entertainment center,\u201d Mr. Ham said in an interview in a cabin overlooking the construction site. \u201cI mean it\u2019s not like a Disney or Universal, just for anyone to go and have fun. It\u2019s a religious purpose. It\u2019s because we\u2019re Christians and we want to get the Christian message out. \u201d The ark is also intended to serve as a vivid warning that, according to the Bible, God sent a flood in Noah\u2019s time to wipe out a depraved people, and God will deliver a fiery end to those who reject the Bible and accept   evils like abortion, atheism and   marriage. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming more like the days of Noah in that we see increasing secularization in the culture,\u201d Mr. Ham said. Yet his interpretation of what he calls \u201cthe Christian message\u201d is derided by most scientists and educators, and resented even by some Christians who consider it indefensible and even embarrassing. Young earthers believe that God created the universe in six   days, and since all of history is only 6, 000 years, humans coexisted with dinosaurs. An exhibit at the Creation Museum shows two smiling children playing in a lush garden next to two petite Tyrannosaurus rexes. Bill Nye, best known as \u201cthe science guy\u201d on television and in books, said in a telephone interview, \u201cHumans and ancient dinosaurs did not live at the same time. It\u2019s completely unreasonable. \u201d Science has established that the earth is billions of years old, and no worldwide flood occurred in the last 6, 000 years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to raise a generation of kids who are scientifically illiterate,\u201d said Mr. Nye, who debated Mr. Ham at the Creation Museum in 2014, a matchup watched online by millions. A group of local atheist activists, the   Freethinkers, recently tried to put up billboards on the highway approaching the ark, calling it the \u201cGenocide and Incest Park,\u201d but no billboard company would agree, said the Freethinker\u2019s founder and president, Jim G. Helton, so they plan to protest at the ark\u2019s grand opening. \u201cThe moral of the flood story is horrible,\u201d Mr. Helton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying he can\u2019t build his park. But we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a family fun day. \u201d Young earth creationism gained currency only about 60 years ago, and has remained a marginal creed within Christianity. Even many   and evangelicals accept the science showing that the universe is billions of years old  \u2014   some reasoning that each of the six \u201cdays\u201d of creation in the Book of Genesis may have lasted millions of years, not 24 hours. And of course, many Christians accept evolution. But now the young earthers are having a heyday, thanks largely to Mr. Ham and his supporters. Their ministry, Answers in Genesis, produces books, magazines, videos and curriculums used by thousands of churches and home schoolers. The Creation Museum  \u2014   which sells these materials in its gift shops  \u2014   claims 2. 7 million visitors have come in the nine years since it opened. But about half of those visitors came to the Creation Museum in the first three years, suggesting that interest may have dropped off. The ark could change that. Mr. Ham projects that the ark will attract 1. 4 to 2. 2 million visitors in the first year, and will double the attendance at the Creation Museum. Inside a cavernous warehouse in an office park in Hebron, a few miles from the museum, about 50 artists, designers, carpenters, sculptors and volunteers have been working   weeks to prepare the exhibits for the ark. A sculptor inserted stiff   hairs one at a time into the chin of what looked like a wild boar. Another wiped off the black dye on a bear\u2019s chest to make it look less like a contemporary black bear. A giraffe with a short neck was being baked in a large oven to set the dye on its fur. Tim Chaffey, a content manager and writer for the Answers in Genesis ministry, explained that most of the models do not resemble animals the way they look today, but extinct species. According to young earth creationists, the ark carried up to 1, 400 kinds of creatures that gradually evolved into the animals we know today. Young earthers accept the notion that nature makes small adaptations over time  \u2014   but do not accept that humans and chimpanzees descended from a common ancestor. The ark designers had to scale back their initial ambition to have live animals living on board to demonstrate the truth of the Noah story, said Mr. Chaffey, a graduate of Liberty University, a Christian college in Virginia founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. And there will be only about 30 pairs of stuffed animals on the Ark Encounter because there just isn\u2019t enough space. \u201cWe have to have dozens and dozens of bathrooms for visitors. Noah didn\u2019t have to have that,\u201d Mr. Chaffey said. Drawings of Noah and his seven family members hung on a wall. Their skin is \u201cmiddle brown\u201d and their faces are a blend of racial features because, as the only survivors of the biblical flood, all the races and ethnicities on earth would have descended from these eight people, Mr. Chaffey said. But in some of the displays in the warehouse, there were indications of the ministry\u2019s dark vision of humanity. An artist, Stephanie Fazekas, stood at a computer drawing figurines of women in togas. They were prostitutes for a diorama portraying the morally decadent society that the Bible says was wiped out in a flood. William Trollinger, a professor of history at the University of Dayton, has been studying Mr. Ham\u2019s museum, website and blogs for a new book \u201cRighting America at the Creation Museum,\u201d written with his wife, Susan L. Trollinger, a professor of English also at University of Dayton. \u201cHe calls on Christians to participate in a culture war,\u201d Mr. Trollinger said, of Mr. Ham. \u201cHe says, if you\u2019re really going to be a Christian, you\u2019re in this war against the atheistic, humanistic enemy. \u201d In an interview, Mr. Ham railed against atheist groups for trying to prevent his project from receiving tax incentives from the state of Kentucky. Answers in Genesis claimed that the state\u2019s denial of those tax credits violated the group\u2019s First Amendment rights. Judge Greg Van Tatenhove of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky agreed, writing in his January decision that tourist attractions  \u2014   even those that advance religion  \u2014   meet the neutral criteria for the tax incentives. The ark is now in calmer waters. The workers, standing on hydraulic lifts, have covered over the Tyvek, and just in time. The Tyvek was printed all over with the slogan of its maker, Dupont: \u201cThe Miracles of Science. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628440.8271108}
