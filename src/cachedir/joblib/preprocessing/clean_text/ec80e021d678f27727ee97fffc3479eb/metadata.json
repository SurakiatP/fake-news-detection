Pretty straightforward, yes. Intrepid or surprising, not in the least. The Fandor experience is quite different. Based in San Francisco, Fandor combines breathtaking eclecticism with an   platform that\u2019s an exemplary example of the digitization of   culture. Search for a film in the \u201c \u201d genre, and you\u2019ll get 18 pages with 18 choices on each, but there are even more options: The top of the page has links to 10 other very specific subgenres, including \u201cMartial Arts,\u201d \u201cSword and Sandal,\u201d \u201cWilderness\u201d and \u201cTreasure Hunting. \u201d You can also refine your search by checking off from a list of about 30 countries, or toggle between film durations (shortest to longest) and years of release (oldest to most recent). Going down the Fandor rabbit hole is the most fun I\u2019ve had with a streaming website in a while. While \u201cDocumentary\u201d isn\u2019t the first place I look when exploring movies on streaming sites, one recent afternoon two of the many documentaries the service offers jumped out at me. The first was \u201cKomeda: A Soundtrack for a Life. \u201d This 2010 short feature directed by Claudia   tells the life story of Krzysztof Komeda, the Polish jazz musician and film score composer whose life came to a freakishly tragic end not too long after he went to Hollywood to work on his friend Roman Polanski\u2019s first American film, \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby. \u201d The next documentary was Mark Rappaport\u2019s \u201cDebra Paget, for Example,\u201d from 2015, a study of the onetime 20th Century Fox contract bombshell best known for her work with Elvis Presley and Fritz Lang. Not all of the documentaries are so   but this is a site that rewards buffs capable of appreciating the tendrils of its library and how it\u2019s organized. Returning to \u201c\u201d the selection under that rubric reflects a wide and arguably generous interpretation of the category. There\u2019s the searing 1980 military saga \u201cBreaker Morant\u201d and the 2001   cult item \u201cIchi the Killer. \u201d There\u2019s John Ford\u2019s seminal \u201cStagecoach\u201d Ted V. Mikels\u2019s    evergreen, \u201cTen Violent Women\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Geese,\u201d a  \u201970s mercenary (in every sense of the term)   action picture in which Richard Harris and Richard Burton phone it in while Roger Moore does his usual level best. According to Gail Gendler, the head of programming at Fandor, the site\u2019s goal is to maintain access to 6, 000 titles (more or less) at any given time, even as titles come and go. \u201cWe want to present a canon for film fanatics and millennial movie lovers,\u201d Ms. Gendler said in a phone interview. She was quick to point out that the site, which started in 2011, functions as a vital bridge between cult and mainstream. \u201cWe have the first film by Damien Chazelle and the first film by Barry Jenkins,\u201d she said, citing two filmmakers who had good showings at this year\u2019s Academy Awards. (Those are \u201cGuy and Madeline on a Park Bench\u201d by Mr. Chazelle, the \u201cLa La Land\u201d director, and \u201cMy Josephine\u201d by Mr. Jenkins, the \u201cMoonlight\u201d director both are well worth checking out.) \u201cWe have early work by Kelly Reichardt, one of the most vital indie filmmakers in the United States. \u201d Speaking to Ms. Gendler about the site\u2019s remarkable menus, I mentioned that while looking through Fandor\u2019s L. G. B. T. Q. page, I found \u201cOut 1,\u201d French director Jacques Rivette\u2019s   experimental drama from 1971, a picture that I never considered as thematically L. G. B. T. Q. But thinking about how one of that film\u2019s characters, a street hustler played by Juliet Berto, struggles with identity questions throughout her story line, it occurred to me that perhaps I had been looking at the film narrowly. \u201cWe\u2019re always having interesting arguments internally about genre and tagging systems. \u201d she said. \u201cDoes one category contain too many films or not enough films is one aspect of the discussion. But often times where we place a given film offers an opportunity for conversation with the film community of both subscribers and nonsubscribers who look at the editorial and social part of the site, or on the Facebook page. We want to make the experience not just about viewing, but connecting with other film lovers. \u201d To that end, the editorial side of the site, Keyframe, has a great asset in the correspondent David Hudson, who deftly aggregates film news, connecting readers to outside material while maintaining a reliable and witty voice and displaying a   sensibility. Keyframe itself offers a lot of video essays, with topics recently ranging from a profile of the silent film pioneer Alice   to a primer on the \u201cchopped and screwed\u201d genre of   featured on the soundtrack of \u201cMoonlight. \u201d Also contributing to what Ms. Gendler calls a \u201conce you get there, it\u2019s hard to leave\u201d aim, the site features monthly \u201cSpotlights,\u201d which gather library films under occasionally timely topics. February, for instance, featured 2017 Oscar nominees, with work by Mr. Jenkins Mr. Chazelle and Maren Ade, whose \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d was a nominee for best foreign language film. Sometimes the topics are just topics, as in last month\u2019s \u201cTwenty Something,\u201d with titles from Bertrand Blier\u2019s corrosive      \u201cGoing Places\u201d (  a young and hunky G\u00e9rard Depardieu in 1974) to Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cStarlet\u201d (2012) about an aimless young woman in the fringes of California\u2019s porn industry (a very fringy place to be). This month, a nod to the Tribeca Film Festival comes in the form of a \u201cNew York films\u201d spotlight. The company is expanding into the funding and production of original documentary shorts  \u2014   one of which, \u201cGut Hack,\u201d is having a premiere as a New York Times   on Monday, April 10  \u2014   and anticipating more good things from a deal with Amazon, offering the service at a slightly reduced rate for Amazon Video subscribers. (Fandor\u2019s   monthly fee is $10.) \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful for us,\u201d Ms Gendler said. \u201cAny platform wants more growth. And we\u2019re hungry to build our subscription base. \u201d I\u2019d say the site deserves that.'"}, "time": 1742562455.9913306}
