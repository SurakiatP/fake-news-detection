In Montgomery County, polling places are said to be bustling with scores of schlubby, overweight voters, while Bucks and Delaware counties were reportedly busy all morning with an influx of unsightly, poorly groomed constituents, with many of the local oinkers having to wait upwards of an hour in line to cast their ballot.

The Onion 9:51 PM The Onion Calls Upon The Cowardly State Of Iowa To Stop Its Dithering And Declare Itself For One Candidate Or The Other \\nWith 42 percent of precincts reporting and the margin between the candidates holding at less than a percentage point, The Onion calls upon the spineless state of Iowa to quit its tarrying, pull itself together, and make a goddamn choice already. According to The Onion \u2019s electoral models, the Midwestern state needs to get its shit in order and figure out which way it\u2019s going to go, because this isn\u2019t even that complicated, for Christ\u2019s sake. The Onion projects that the timid little Hawkeye State has 20 minutes or so to decide which candidate will get its six puny electoral votes, or we\u2019ll just go ahead and call it for Jill Stein, and you\u2019ll just have to deal with it.

Think about it: Has any president been able to carry out their platform to the letter? No. Nothing\u2019s ever as bad as it seems, believe me.\u201d According to sources, a calm and composed Mirenge\u2014who reportedly has about five seconds before his mouth is shut for him\u2014then added that the country\u2019s been through much worse and everything turned out okay. 9:27 PM Tim Kaine Shows Hillary His Belly Button To Cheer Her Up After Losing Ohio \\nAfter it was officially projected that Donald Trump would take the critical swing state of Ohio and its 18 electoral votes, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine quickly ran over to a visibly disappointed Hillary Clinton and attempted to lift her spirits by pulling his shirt up above his midriff and showing her his belly button. The Virginia senator spent several minutes holding up the bottom of his shirt with his chin while repeatedly pointing at his navel and informing Clinton that he has \u201ca innie [sic],\u201d prompting Clinton to curtly nod and say \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d before craning her neck to look past him at the electoral map to track her progress in Florida and Nevada. \\nOnion chief political correspondent Martin Hazelton is reporting live from Clinton HQ in New York City throughout the evening.

Secretary Clinton could be seen weaving between cars in Manhattan, driving on the sidewalk to get past several areas of heavy traffic, and then accelerating to speeds in excess of 110 miles per hour once she reached the interstate. Reporters were unable to keep up with the Democratic nominee, but numerous witnesses confirmed that Clinton had a baseball bat stowed next to her and appeared incredibly irate before she pulled down the tinted visor on her helmet, revved the motorcycle\u2019s engine, and tore away. \\nOnion chief political correspondent Martin Hazelton is reporting live from Clinton HQ in New York City throughout the evening.

The Onion 7:36 PM Election Flashback: Nation Finally Shitty Enough To Make Social Progress (2008) \\nWASHINGTON\u2014After emerging victorious from one of the most pivotal elections in history, president-elect Barack Obama will assume the role of commander in chief on Jan. 20, shattering a racial barrier the United States is, at long last, shitty enough to overcome. \\nAlthough polls going into the final weeks of October showed Sen. Obama in the lead, it remained unclear whether the failing economy, dilapidated housing market, crumbling national infrastructure, health care crisis, energy crisis, and five-year-long disastrous war in Iraq had made the nation crappy enough to rise above 300 years of racial prejudice and make lasting change. \\n\u201cToday the American people have made their voices heard, and they have said, \u2018Things are finally as terrible as we\u2019re willing to tolerate,\u201d said Obama, addressing a crowd of unemployed, uninsured, and debt-ridden supporters. \u201cTo elect a black man, in this country, and at this time\u2014these last eight years must have really broken you.\u201d \\nAdded Obama, \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for our nation.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742561724.6560104}
