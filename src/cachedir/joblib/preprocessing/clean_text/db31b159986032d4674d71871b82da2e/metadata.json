But of course, just like the entire U.S. Banana Republic, the use of extreme obfuscation, deceit, propaganda and lies once again is the norm with Tesla\u2019s quarterly report. \\nTSLA\u2019s use of revenue recognition, deferred revenue and operating leases and its definition of \u201cfree cash flow\u201d are enough to create a dedicated forensic accounting case study at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where I did indeed nearly ace a forensic accounting course. \\nI don\u2019t have enough time to lay out all of specifics and I\u2019m not getting paid to write this blog post \u2013 but suffice it to say that several items in Tesla\u2019s financials this quarter serve as big red flag warning flares. Of course, the market probably won\u2019t care, as it seems that the market cap of a company\u2019s stock is directly proportional to the grandiosity of the Company\u2019s accounting abuse and fraud. And there\u2019s no one in DC to enforce the laws already in place that are designed to prevent this fraud because the guys running these companies make substantial contributions to the Establishment politicians \u2013 just ask Jeff Bezos and Hillary Clinton. \\nBut I\u2019ll point out some of the glaring problems in TSLA\u2019s \u201cGAAP\u201d accounting based on cursory sleuthing. \\nFirst and foremost, in his description of the results for the quarter, Musk stated that \u201cresidual lease risk\u201d exposure was 32% of deliveries, down from 36% in Q2. But this is a highly deceptive metric. IN FACT , deferred revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the quarter soared to 61.4% from 44% in Q2. Deferred revenue is the amount of revenue that is subject to \u201cresidual risk\u201d from leasing financing. This number is found on the liability side of the balance sheet. The deferred revenue liability account went from $558 million in Q2 to $1.4 billion in Q3. This is a huge jump in amount of risk-infused lease-based financing used to generate sales. \\nIn and of itself, using deferred revenue accounting to this degree is highly subjective and susceptible to fraudulent risk assumptions. But the fact that Musk tries to mask the truth by using a bogus metric to make it seem like TSLA\u2019s exposure to the residual risk embedded in the profoundly questionable leases used to generate revenues and unit sales is a loud signal that there\u2019s fraud embedded in TSLA\u2019s \u201cGAAP\u201d financials. \\nWhen you look at what is being reported as \u201cGAAP operating income\u201d consider that a huge proportion of that income is subject to the risk of coming back at the company in form of \u201cone-time\u201d GAAP charges which result from having to reverse out a large portion of the \u201cGAAP\u201d revenues when the value attached to the cars that will likely come flying back at TSLA when the leases expire is substantially lower than the amount guaranteed by TSLA. This \u201cGAAP\u201d presentation makes a farce of bona fide accounting standards. \\nAnother huge red flag is the huge jump in accounts payable. In June, accounts payable were 87% of revenues. But by September, accounts payable were more than 100% of revenues. The only reason TSLA would stretch out its payables like this is if it needed the cash. Not paying bills for a company like TSLA is a source of free financing. But this is an extreme slow-down in bill payments. There\u2019s no way to know for sure what\u2019s going on, but something is wrong. \\nA third huge red flag is the way in which Musk throws around the term \u201cfree cash flow.\u201d His definition is just as fraudulent as Amazon.con\u2019s definition. At this point in time, because TSLA has only released an 8k which does not contain an GAAP statement of cash flows, there\u2019s no way to know the amount of free or negative free cash flow attributable to TSLA\u2019s operations. That is, \u201cfree cash flow\u201d in the context of the deceitful manner in which TSLA\u2019s financials are presented. \\nHaving said that, Musk states in the 8k that TSLA generated \u201cpositive free cash flow.\u201d No, Elon, you did not. Buried in the 8k is a section titled, \u201cselected cash flow information.\u201d He lays out his definition of \u201cfree cash flow\u201d showing $176 million defined as cash flows provided by operating activities less capex. The GAAP definition of free cash flow, however, also includes debt repayment and other sundry items that drain cash. We won\u2019t know the full extent of these items until the 10Q is released. \\nHowever, TSLA reported that it payed down $178 million on its borrowing facilities. Using GAAP free cash flow, this takes Elon free cash flow negative. Furthermore, if TSLA had maintained accounts payable at 86% of revenues, this would have sucked another $324 million of cash from TSLA\u2019s operations, leaving the Company with a free cash flow deficit of $326 million. \\nThere\u2019s a lot more going on with TSLA\u2019s operations that is deceitful, if not outright fraudulent. This is just the \u201clow hanging fruit.\u201d At some point the capital markets will stop funding this fraud and that\u2019s when the fun begins. Of course, by that time insiders will have sucked $100\u2019s of millions of wealth out this Company that will never be retrievable. In just the last 12 months, insiders have unloaded 4.1 million shares, or roughly $860 million worth of stock. Oh wait, there was one open market purchase of stock by an insider of a whopping 1,394 shares. \\nIt\u2019s my view the idiotic shareholders who give money to TSLA deserve what they\u2019ll get eventually. But then again, many of them are sheeple who have placed trust in financial fiduciaries, like pension managers and investment advisors, to invest their savings.
