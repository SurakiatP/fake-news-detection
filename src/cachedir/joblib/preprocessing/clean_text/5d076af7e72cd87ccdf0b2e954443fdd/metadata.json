Others will be avidly following the European Soccer Championship in France or biting their nails in anticipation of the next episode of hit teenage soap \u201cHollyoaks. \u201d Oh, and there is the referendum that day asking them whether Britain should leave the European Union. \u201cWait, are we even registered to vote?\u201d Priya Patel, 25, asked her friend recently, as they waited outside a theater in east London to see their favorite stars arrive at the British Soap Awards. Would she want Britain to stay in the European Union? \u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Ms. Patel, a medical practitioner, answered impatiently, switching her attention to her smartphone, visibly more interested in televised dramas than in the   tensions between her country and Brussels. \u201cWait, what just happened?\u201d she exclaimed as a \u201cHollyoaks\u201d star rolled by in a car. Holding the attention of young voters  \u2014   and getting them to turn out on June 23  \u2014   is one of the biggest challenges for both sides in the campaign over Britain\u2019s place in Europe, especially for the advocates of remaining in the European Union. Polling suggests that younger people are more favorable to continued British membership in the bloc than are older voters, and in a close race could decide the outcome. The problem for the   forces is that young people are historically less likely to vote. In this case, some analysts say, it could be particularly hard to motivate them, not just because many of them will be immersed in summer activities, but also because they are being asked to embrace the status quo rather than to take up an idealistic cause of change of the type that typically energizes young people. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get them passionate about remaining,\u201d said Scott Townsin, 26, who recently directed a campaign video urging young people to vote in favor of staying in the European Union. Older voters tend to decide based on information they get from traditional media. But with young people, Mr. Townsin said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be loud, you\u2019ve got to compete with brands, favorite friends, Instagram, whatever, to get their attention. \u201d Zak Reynolds, 20, from London, said he had yet to make up his mind. One of his parents will vote to stay in, the other to leave. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of propaganda stuff,\u201d he said. Sam Hemphill, 24, an engineering student from Swindon in southwest England, said he had not made up his mind but was leaning toward Britain\u2019s remaining. Part of his uncertainty, he said, was driven by the perception that the campaigns \u201care both lying. \u201d \u201cAll the facts and figures feel manipulated, which makes the decision hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are both polar opposites appealing on emotions rather than facts. \u201d The In campaign used targeted Facebook ads to imply (falsely) that a British exit, or Brexit, could stop British soccer clubs from signing European players. (\u201cIf we leave the E. U. how will Tottenham be affected?\u201d one ad asked.) The Out campaign lent its support to a pop concert in Birmingham, only to have three acts pull out because they did not agree with its   position. The voter registration deadline was Thursday, prompting ambitious drives by both sides to sign up supporters. Groups like Bite the Ballot, an organization that tries to encourage youths to vote, teamed up with Starbucks, which favors Britain\u2019s remaining in the European Union, to hold registration drives in coffee shops across the country. Uber, which has not taken a position on the referendum, flashed ads on customers\u2019 smartphones reminding them to register. Some surveys indicate that half of those between ages 18 and 30 want to remain in Europe, with the proportion higher among those under 25. Young Britons are generally comfortable with a multicultural society, surveys have found, and they value the opportunity to work and travel in 28 European nations without a visa. A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of those 18 to 34 years old in Britain had a favorable view of the European Union, compared with 38 percent of people 50 and over. The 180, 000 or so people attending the   festival in Glastonbury will have to vote by mail  \u2014   a relatively tedious process  \u2014   or apply to have someone else vote on their behalf. (There will be no polling booths on the festival grounds, 900 acres of farmland in Somerset, since people have to vote where they are registered.) The same voting rules apply to the 300, 000 to 500, 000 British fans, many of them under 30, who the police expect will travel to France for the monthlong European Soccer Championship. Some of the efforts to get young people to vote are paying off. Since March 1, more than a million people have registered to vote, with big gains among those 18 to 34 years old, according to figures published recently by the government. Ashleigh Breedy, a    florist in favor of Brexit, said the referendum was so important that she would vote for the very first time. \u201cAll that money we\u2019re sending to Belgium and them telling us what to do,\u201d she said, referring to Brussels, where the European Commission is based. \u201cOur queen doesn\u2019t have a say,\u201d she said. \u201cIs Belgium going to tell our queen what to do?\u201d she asked, puffing on a cigarette and drinking a can of Red Bull. \u201cIf enough of us stand up to leave, we\u2019ll leave. \u201d Brexit campaigners are calling for more controls on immigration and greater national sovereignty the option of remaining is appealing to voters because of the economic benefits. Charlie Carline, 31, a British exit supporter who will be in France on referendum day, said he had made sure to vote by mail. It is \u201cvery important,\u201d he wrote in a message on Facebook. \u201cI want out of the European Union dictatorship. Look at the state of Europe because of these   scum leaders. \u201d By contrast, some of the young people supporting Britain\u2019s continued membership in the European Union are less passionate. For them, the monthslong campaign often felt more like   Conservative politicians arguing over a dining bill. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to get bored by it,\u201d said Josh Glancy, 29, who plans to go to Glastonbury and who applied for a postal vote only because a friend had insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of spat among the Tory party, so I\u2019ve become quite fed up with it. \u201d Still, he said he planned to vote to stay in Europe because he liked \u201cthe idea of a Europe that can cooperate\u201d over issues including the migrant crisis. Vahan Salorian, 23, who juggles work as a composer, primary school music teacher and pub supervisor, said he would vote for Britain to remain in Europe. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching with mild terror\u201d the possibility of a British exit, he said, wearing a   decorated with avocados and sipping beer with friends in a park in east London. \u201cI\u2019m terrified it might happen. \u201d Mr. Salorian, who is from the rural town of Barnoldswick in northern England, said living in a cosmopolitan city like London shaped his views. Friends in Barnoldswick, he said, were planning to vote out even though the area has had very little immigration. Back in east London at the British Soap Awards, Jennifer Burnett, 33, said she was registered to vote, but was unsure about her intentions. She had more definite views about the soaps. \u201cI know exactly who I\u2019m going to vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cVote \u2018Hollyoaks\u2019!\u201d she exclaimed, raising a plastic champagne cup in a celebratory gesture.'"}, "time": 1742628590.4298406}
