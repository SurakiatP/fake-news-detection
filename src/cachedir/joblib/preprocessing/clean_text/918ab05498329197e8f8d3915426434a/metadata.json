Far down on the list, attracting almost no attention, was a boldface name from the disco days and nights of Manhattan in the 1970s. Ian Schrager, a hotelier and real estate developer whose club, Studio 54, was a notorious celebrity hangout, was among the 64 people granted a pardon in the waning moments of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. The wild nightclub was central in Mr. Schrager\u2019s conviction in 1980 on felony tax evasion charges he was accused of hiding money the club made from the government, concealing some of it in trash bags and ceiling panels. With a portfolio that has included some of the most expensive residential real estate in Manhattan  \u2014   and boutique hotels, whose very concept he helped invent  \u2014   Mr. Schrager seems to have little tangible need for a presidential intercession to set aside his conviction. He agrees, to a point. \u201cI was able to overcome everything by being tenacious and, I suppose, relentless, and having successful products,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that I needed to continue business. \u201d Instead, he said, it was knowing that his son, who is 6, would grow up to learn what he had done that pushed Mr. Schrager to hire a Washington law firm, Hogan Lovells, four years ago to apply for a pardon. \u201cI wanted it for closure. I wanted it for my family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a good example for your kids when you did something like what I did, and you try to teach your kids to live by the rules and be an upstanding person. \u201d Mr. Schrager applied in 2012 for the pardon, which restores civil liberties like voting but does not expunge a criminal record, and he waited each year for a decision, with no word back. The lawyer who helped with Mr. Schrager\u2019s pardon application, H. P. Goldfield, said it was not his client\u2019s financial success or connections that ultimately made his pardon application successful, but how Mr. Schrager had lived his life in the years since he left prison. \u201cIt\u2019s not just saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 There has got to be a sense that the person is really remorseful and admits their wrongdoing and that they\u2019ve lived an exemplary life ever since,\u201d Mr. Goldfield said, pointing to the thousands of jobs that Mr. Schrager\u2019s company had created and his history as a mentor to young people. \u201cHe has really lived an exemplary life. He asked for forgiveness, and the president saw it in his heart to forgive. \u201d The application also asks for written testimony from three character witnesses. Mr. Schrager, 70, declined to say who they were. \u201cIt happened when I was young enough, and thank God, having lost everything, I didn\u2019t lose my enthusiasm for life,\u201d he said. \u201cEither I was just going to give up, or dust myself off and put my head down and just try and recoup everything that l lost. \u201d \u201cSome of it you can\u2019t recoup,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll always have the scar. \u201d The felony conviction made it difficult to   himself after his release from prison. Mr. Schrager recalled having to drive to Virginia just to get a credit card, because banks in New York would not do business with him. Convicted felons cannot legally obtain a liquor license, so his first hotels in Manhattan, including Morgans and the Paramount, could not serve liquor, he said. In 1992, a lawyer for Mr. Schrager convinced the State Liquor Authority that he was sufficiently rehabilitated to merit another license. Mr. Schrager was convicted with his closest friend and business partner, Steve Rubell, who died in 1989. Some of his first thoughts upon learning of the pardon were of Mr. Rubell, Mr. Schrager said. \u201cI\u2019ll never have another friend like Steve,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I am here bringing closure to this event, and it\u2019s bittersweet  \u2014   I can\u2019t share that with him. \u201d His conviction has brought other lingering effects. At airports, he is detained for questioning when he   the country, Mr. Schrager said. He said he was unsure if those stops would diminish after the pardon. But the lasting effect after more than three decades is mostly emotional, an abiding sense of shame. On Tuesday, when Mr. Goldfield called to tell him the news, Mr. Schrager was at his home in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. His son overheard the ensuing excited conversation between Mr. Schrager and his wife, Tania Wahlstedt. \u201cHe knew something good had happened, and he asked me, \u2018Well, what\u2019s so good that happened? \u2019\u201d Mr. Schrager recalled. \u201cI still didn\u2019t feel like talking about it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, the president said I was a good guy\u2019  \u2014   that was enough. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561735.4224837}
