Recently, new information has surfaced from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, insisted the Ambassador from Qatar would \u201clike to see [Bill Clinton] \u2018for five minutes\u2019 in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for [his] birthday in 2011,\u201d adding that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would \u201cwelcome [the Clinton Foundation\u2019s] suggestions for investments in Haiti \u2014 particularly on education and health.\u201d Desai added that while Qatar had already \u201callocated most of their $20 million \u2026 [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.\u201d\\nEarlier this year, Al Jazeera, a Qatar-based, state-funded news organization ran a list of \u201crevealing, juicy and quirky emails\u201d that were leaked by WikiLeaks. The Clinton Foundation was involved in a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme with the news organization. The King of Morocco offered $12m \u201cfor the endowment\u201d \u2014 as long as Clinton was willing to participate with the scheme.\\nUnfortunately, there wasn\u2019t enough proof provided by the state-funded broadcaster to bring up the Qatar connection with the Clinton Foundation. WikiLeaks made a post on Facebook stating, \u201c\u201c Al Jazeera\u2019s list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton. \u201d\\nRight after WikiLeaks pointed out the omission, Twitter exploded with concerns by users pressuring Al Jazeera to explain why the publication failed to link Qatar to ISIS and Clinton.\\nAl Jazeera's list of juiciest WikiLeaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton: https://t.co/aBIuF861kk \\n\u2014 Max Abrahms (@MaxAbrahms) October 25, 2016 \\n@MaxAbrahms @wikileaks You mean @AlJazeera is not critical of Qatar?

No matter how much attention the story received from social media, news organizations failed to report them. Is the media afraid to tell the truth because they\u2019re in fear that it will help Clinton lose her the presidential election? Maybe it\u2019s just a difficult topic to talk about. We need answers!\\n\""}, "time": 1742563809.6507623}
