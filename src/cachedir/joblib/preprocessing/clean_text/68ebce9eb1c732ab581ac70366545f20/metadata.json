As I noted yesterday, Politics As Usual Is Dead , and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes.\\nThe corruption of pay-to-play and the commingling of public and private influence is not the failing of an individual\u2013it is the logical conclusion of a thoroughly corrupt political system.\\nGiven the incentives built into politics as usual , public/private pay-to-play doesn\u2019t just make sense\u2013it is the only possible maximization of the political system .\\nCobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike.\\nAll the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in \u201ccontributions\u201d and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.\\nThe nation\u2019s political system needs a thorough cleaning from top to bottom. Exposing the Clintons\u2019 perfection of politics as usual won\u2019t change the conditions and incentives that created the Clintons\u2019 harvester of corruption.\\nThat will require rooting out the incentives that made the Clintons\u2019 perfection of corruption both logical and inevitable.
