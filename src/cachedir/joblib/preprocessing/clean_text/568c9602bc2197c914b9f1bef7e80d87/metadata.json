Mejia, reportedly laughed as he was arraigned in court, according to the local ABC News affiliate. [Mejia was once released under AB 109, Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s signature prison reform, and now stands accused of committing two murders, including the murder of a Whittier police officer in February.  The explosion of violent and serious crimes across Southern California in the past several months  \u2014   some committed by offenders that Brown released from state supervision, promising they were \u201c  \u201c \u201d and \u201c \u201d \u2014   has sparked a heated discussion about whether or not the controversial \u201cprison reforms\u201d known as AB 109 and Propositions 47 and 57 are responsible for recent deadly assaults on law enforcement officers. Three days after the February 20 murder of Keith Boyer, a   old Whittier Police Officer, the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board wrote a scathing editorial attacking Officer Boyer\u2019s grieving boss, Whittier PD Chief Jeff Piper, for putting the blame on \u201ccriminal justice reforms\u201d championed by Gov. Brown and the Times. The board severely chastised Piper for \u201cmischaracterizing\u201d the AB 109, Prop 47 and 57 prison and sentencing reforms in his moment of grief, claiming he \u201cneed[s] to be held accountable for false or misleading statements that are calculated to sway opinion on important policy matters, even if those comments come during times of great duress   \u2026     [Chief] Piper misused the occasion of Boyer\u2019s traumatic death to lash out at recent criminal justice reforms. \u201d No one likes to be wrong  \u2014   and when someone is caught in a lie, they often double down  \u2014   but it\u2019s unfortunate to see a major Los Angeles newspaper engage in a campaign of deliberate distortion. Take Mejia, Boyer\u2019s alleged murderer, whom the Orange County Register reported had been serving time for grand theft auto before he was released from Pelican Bay State Prison in April 2016. According to the Times, Mejia was not the beneficiary of \u201cearly release\u201d or \u201cotherwise at large because of some supposed defect in AB 109, the 2011 \u2018realignment\u2019 law that assigned more criminal justice responsibilities to counties. \u201d Michele Hanisee, President of the Association of Los Angeles Deputy District Attorneys, destroyed the Times\u2018 claim in a single comment. \u201cUnder the old system, [Mejia] would not have been out there to kill Officer Boyer.  Simple as that,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Tuesday with Breitbart News. \u201cUnder custody of the state parole system,\u201d Hanisee explained, \u201cMejia would have been thrown back into state prison for a full year for any one of the five  \u2014   yes, count \u2018em  \u2014   five violations he committed after being released. \u201d Tragically, Mejia\u2019s final probation violation occurred on February 2nd, 2017  \u2014   only 18 days before Officer Boyer\u2019s murder. If only AB 109 had not restricted law enforcement from sending Mejia back behind bars for a longer period of time than 10 days for his repeated violations, Officer Boyer might be alive today. Instead, thanks to Jerry Brown\u2019s AB 109 \u201creform,\u201d Mejia was only required to report to Los Angeles County Probation, under the   program known as \u201cPost Release Community Supervision (PRCS)\u201d \u2014  and under AB 109, probation violations are limited to a   maximum \u201cflash incarceration. \u201d Hanisee recently condemned AB 109 in the harshest possible terms on 790 KABC\u2019s McIntyre in the Morning Show, according to a local affiliate of ABC in Los Angeles (KABC 7). \u201c\u2018If you open these profiles and read them, every time it says, \u2018this individual was qualified to be released to the supervision of parole under AB 109 because their current commitment offense is defined as    . \u2019\u201d She says AB 109, like Propositions 47 and 57, was sold to the public by the politicians. \u201cAnd they also give them really catchy names like \u2018Public Safety Realignment Act\u2019 rather than \u2018Transfer Dangerous Felons to Your Jurisdiction Supervision Act. \u2019\u201d Hanisee says AB 109 continues to threaten public safety, citing the descriptions of the 120 persons currently on the \u201cL. A.\u2019s Most Wanted. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying, absolutely horrifying. \u201d And the result for L. A. and the state? \u201cThis is a great place to commit crime. You\u2019re going to get off easy and you\u2019re going to get out early if you go in. \u201d Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.
