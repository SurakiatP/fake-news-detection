Hibbert eyed a group of six children whipping red and yellow balls at one another in a large, reverberant pit made with trampoline floors and walls. He wanted in. But one player needed to get nailed by a ball and knocked out of the game first. He stood in line, his feet fidgeting, before bailing. He ran over to a nearby trampoline, pulled up his hoodie, crouched down and launched himself first upward and then backward into a flip. \u201cYou bend your feet, keep your hands all the way and jump as high as you want,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get maximum air. Once you hit the air then you flip. But you don\u2019t want to do too much because you might do a double flip. \u201d Alex is the    actor who plays Chiron (also knows as \u201cLittle\u201d) in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the    film about growing up in a   area of Miami as a character in the process of understanding his sexuality. The film has received eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture. In real life, he lives in Miami, where he is a   student, but he was recently in Los Angeles for a busy weekend of award shows (he attended both the Producers Guild Awards and the Screen Actors Guild awards) and auditions. So he would have a proper tux to wear to the SAG awards, he also had to stand still for a suit fitting. That\u2019s a lot for an energetic kid. A few hours at the Sky Zone trampoline park in the Van Nuys neighborhood was his   play time. \u201cI\u2019m open,\u201d he yelled, his arms spread wide. A ball came straight at his head and he ducked. Then he grabbed it and hurled it at the opposite side of the dodgeball pit, which now had him alone against three boys. He came to the tables, out of breath but happy. \u201cIt\u2019s a battlefield out there,\u201d he told his mother, Donna Wellington. \u201cBut I\u2019m coming out on top. \u201d He grabbed for a cherry Icee she was holding for him and took a big gulp. Ms. Wellington snagged it. \u201cDon\u2019t drink all of that,\u201d she said to her son. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a stomachache. \u201d He made a face, then set the drink down. He has gotten a lot of attention because of his ability to make faces. \u201cMoonlight\u201d opens with a scene focused on Alex, but it\u2019s not until about 10 minutes into it that he actually has a line. Critics and moviegoers have been taken by Alex\u2019s performance, most of it delivered without any words, in which he communicates the adolescent angst of a young boy growing up in an environment where his sexuality is not understood. \u201cMahershala taught me a lot of tips about facials,\u201d he said of his   Mahershala Ali, whom he calls his second father. \u201cHe was all like, \u2018Just think about the moment that is going on. \u2019\u201d Alex didn\u2019t grow up as an   kid looking for a big break. He was living a typical life when stardom found him. He was born in New York City, and lived in Queens until 2011, when his mother decided to move with him to live closer to her own mother. (Alex has one sister, Robin, 22, from his father\u2019s side, who lives in New York with their father.) He goes to a performing arts magnet middle school in Miami Gardens, Fla. loves science class (even though he said school was \u201cmostly boring,\u201d he knows it will help him succeed in his life\u2019s ambition of curing cancer) and is expected to help out at home by doing the dishes and taking out the trash. But in March 2016, Alex\u2019s drama teacher, Tanisha Cidel (she played the role of the principal in the film) suggested to him that he audition for \u201cMoonlight. \u201d He assumed it was a school production. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to be that big,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was going to be like a play or something. \u201d It was Alex\u2019s grandmother, Hillary Frye, who took him to the \u201cMoonlight\u201d audition. She is now his unofficial publicist. \u201cEvery day since the film came she buys a New York Times paper at the   and looks for Alex\u2019s picture in it,\u201d Ms. Wellington said. \u201cShe\u2019s going crazy, she tells everyone at work, \u2018That\u2019s my grandson! \u2019\u201d His mother is trying to adapt to the new normal of having a son who suddenly is invited to award shows and auditions. So long as the hoopla doesn\u2019t interfere with school, Ms. Wellington is accommodating. On Monday, it was back to their normal routine. \u201cNothing changed,\u201d said his mother, who works at a nursing facility. \u201cWhen I travel back and forth, I go right back to work. And Alex goes back to school. \u201d But he had a few days of glamour before he returned to real life, and some time before the media crush to just be a little kid. After dominating the trampoline, the foam pit, air hockey and the dodgeball court, he had by now moved on to the basketball   game. Before his mother could even make her way over, he had racked up 41 points. \u201cI beat the record,\u201d he hollered to her. He sidestepped to the adjacent machine where he tossed the ball some more, to the tune of 43 points. In celebration, he dabbed. He wasn\u2019t done, though. He was ready for more dodgeball. It was 8 p. m. and his mother wasn\u2019t. \u201cAlex, I\u2019m tired,\u201d said Ms. Wellington, who had just accompanied her son to London, where Alex accepted an award on behalf of Mr. Ali. \u201cMom, one more game,\u201d he pleaded. She gave him a    \u2014   apparently a talent for nonverbal communication is a family trait. \u201cO. K.,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess it is time to go. \u201d Anyway, he will need his sleep, given the magnitude of his dreams. There is the whole   thing. He would also like to have an acting career like Denzel Washington, to do action movies like Andrew Garfield and get cast on a popular TV series. \u201cI want to be on \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI need to talk to my managers about that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628306.188043}
