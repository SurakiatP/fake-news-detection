To illustrate that point, author Samantha Schmidt used anecdotal evidence of a child who said she had a scary dream involving the GOP nominee. \\nSchmidt wrote: \\nBilal Elcharfa was pouring cereal for his children before school this month when his 7-year-old daughter, Maaria, walked into the kitchen, calling for him. \\n\u201cBaba, I had a scary dream,\u201d she said, hugging him tight. \u201cAbout Donald Trump .\u201d \\nIt was the morning after the second presidential debate, which the Elcharfa family\u2019s two youngest daughters watched in the basement of their Staten Island home with their parents. In the middle of the night, Maaria went to her parents\u2019 room twice, unable to sleep, and walked to the living room and checked her family\u2019s security camera. \\nThat morning, Mr. Elcharfa, 52, asked his daughter what she saw in the nightmare. \\n\u201cHe was so mean to us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had a scary face, like a zombie or something.\u201d In the dream, Maaria later said, Mr. Trump came to the home of every Muslim family in the country and put each one in jail. \\n\u201cMany Muslim parents fear that the tensions could push their children away from the faith entirely. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to handle it sometimes,\u201d Elcharfa is further quoted. \u201cMaybe someday they won\u2019t believe in anything,\u201d Schmidt added. \\nBut how is this Trump\u2019s fault? Isn\u2019t it the parents\u2019 job to raise their children? \\nA post at the American Thinker observed: \\nHere we have an article blaming Donald Trump for terrorizing children for something he has never said or even intimated. He doesn\u2019t want to put all Muslims in jail; he just wants to reduce immigration from countries that are un-vettable in the Middle East. One does not translate into the other. \\nBut that assumes one deals in facts, logic, and reason. As we\u2019ve seen this election season, the so-called \u201cmainstream media,\u201d known here as the Democrat-media complex, have decided to toss facts, logic and reason out the window in a concerted effort to elect Democrat Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most evil person ever nominated to the White House by a major party, by any means necessary \u2014 even using propaganda the likes of which would make Josef Goebbels smile. \\nThere\u2019s no question \u2014 if Democrats nominated Satan, the media would worship him and call you a bigot for opposing him. \\nRelated Articles'"}, "time": 1742563698.043854}
