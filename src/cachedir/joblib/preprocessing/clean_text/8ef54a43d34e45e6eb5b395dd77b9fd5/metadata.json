In the other six, people who were registered in a different state also voted in Colorado. \\nLincoln Wilson, a registered Republican from Hale, in Northeast Colorado, is accused of voting in both Colorado and Kansas in 2010, 2012 and again in 2014. Wilson told CBS4 he voted in both states, but only \u201cvoted on local issues\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t vote twice for President.\u201d \\nWilson is one of five Coloradans now charged by the State of Kansas for voting in both states. \\nRandall Killian, an unaffiliated voter, pleaded guilty to voting in Douglas County, Colorado and Kansas in the 2012 presidential election. Ron Weems, a registered Democrat, pleaded guilty to voting in Teller County, Colorado and Kansas in both 2012 and 2014. Both men were fined for their offenses. \\nKansas has also charged James Criswell, a Republican from Douglas County, and Sharon Farris, a Republican from Denver, with double voting. Their cases have not been resolved yet. \\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said his office is \u201caggressively prosecuting\u201d double voting cases because it\u2019s a crime that \u201ccan\u2019t be caught ahead of time.\u201d \\nHe says after each election, Colorado and Kansas crosscheck voters to identify double ballots and clean up their databases. But Kobach still believes 10,000 people are registered to vote in both Colorado and Kansas. \\nCombing through voter data, CBS4 found three suspected double voters in Denver, one suspected double voter in Arapahoe County and one suspected double voter in Douglas County. All five cases that CBS4 uncovered have now been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal action. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively small number,\u201d said Williams, \u201cBut, it is a problem of any magnitude because we have close elections in Colorado.\u201d \\nBut, Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams admits other Coloradans are getting away with it. Combing through voter data, CBS4 found three suspected double voters in Denver, one suspected double voter in Arapahoe County and one suspected double voter in Douglas County. All five cases that CBS4 uncovered have now been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal action.'"}, "time": 1742628581.0383701}
