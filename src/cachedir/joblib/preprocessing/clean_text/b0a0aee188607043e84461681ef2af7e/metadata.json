Ninni Laaksonen, crowned the 2006 Miss Finland , has become the fourteenth woman to come forward and accuse Trump of unwanted advances. Speaking to local newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, Laaksonen described how moments before she was set to appear on the Late Show With David Letterman , Trump came up to her and began groping her buttocks. \\n\u201c\u201cBefore the show we were photographed outside the building. Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don\u2019t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: \u2018What is happening?\u2019\u201d \\nLaaksonen later attended a party with other contestants. \u201cSomebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger. It left me disgusted.\u201d \\nThe story echos the complaints made by numerous women about Trump, who boasted on a hot mic of casually committing sexual assault on women he finds attractive. \u201cI\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful women \u2014 I just start kissing them, it\u2019s like a magnet\u2026I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything\u2026 Grab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d said Trump to Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Billy Bush. \\nThat admission opened the floodgates as dozens of women came forth telling stories that all reinforce each other\u2019s credibility, painting a portrait of a serial predator who treats women\u2019s bodies as objects for him to grope and force himself upon as he pleases. His response to the allegations has been to demean the women, insult them for their looks, and threaten to sue them for \u201clibel.\u201d The consistency of the women\u2019s accounts taken in the context of his own words should leave little doubt in the mind of the American voter of who is telling the truth here.'"}, "time": 1742563915.9901936}
