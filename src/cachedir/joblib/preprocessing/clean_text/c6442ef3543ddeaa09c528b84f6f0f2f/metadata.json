He was 60. Mr. Meaney\u2019s former wife, Mary Ann Halford, confirmed his death. She said the cause was not yet known. Mr. Meaney made numerous appearances on   television talk shows, including more than a dozen on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d beginning in 1987, a year after his first HBO special, according to his website. He played the title role, an irresponsible slob saddled with raising his brother\u2019s three children, on \u201cUncle Buck,\u201d a CBS sitcom based on the John Candy movie of the same name. The show lasted only one season (a 2016 version, starring Mike Epps, had an even shorter run) but Mr. Meaney was seen frequently on television after it was canceled in 1991. In addition to the talk shows of David Letterman, Conan O\u2019Brien and Carson, he was seen on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u201c2 Broke Girls\u201d and other shows. An energetic live performer with the sensibilities of an   entertainer, Mr. Meaney skewered family life, in particular his mother\u2019s seemingly boundless concern that his actions would cause them to \u201close the house. \u201d \u201cAnything in my house could poke an eye out when I was a kid,\u201d he said in one routine, adding: \u201cI\u2019d be passing pizza across the table. \u2018You\u2019re going to take your brother\u2019s eye out with that slice.\u2019 \u201d He sometimes incorporated music into his act. One signature bit was a   spoof of the hit   single \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d in which he impersonated Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Stevie Wonder and other singers who had performed on the recording. He later employed his singing skills when he was cast in the Broadway musical \u201cHairspray. \u201d He played several roles and understudied the part of Edna Turnblad, played by Divine in the John Waters movie that inspired the musical. (He went on to play Edna at the Connecticut Repertory Theater and elsewhere.) Ms. Halford said Mr. Meaney\u2019s experience on the show, which he described on his website as \u201clife changing,\u201d prompted a period of   that led him to realize he was gay. He came out in 2008 while being interviewed on a satellite radio show. His sexual orientation later figured in some of his   routines. In one, Mr. Meaney, who was raised Roman Catholic, described a request from his mother that he go to confession. \u201cI told the priest I was gay, and it was very difficult to tell him that,\u201d Mr. Meaney said in a routine captured on video. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re dating. \u201d Mr. Meaney was born in White Plains, N. Y. on April 23, 1956, and grew up in nearby Valhalla, the middle child of five. His father, John, was a firefighter his mother, Patricia, a librarian. While in high school he worked as a waiter at the Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford, N. Y. where he met a   New York radio and television host, Bob Fitzsimmons, who was a club member. \u201cBob was Kevin\u2019s inspiration,\u201d Ms. Halford said. \u201cHe kept asking Bob how to get into show business. \u201d Mr. Meaney attended a state college before dropping out and moving to San Francisco to pursue a comedy career. At the time, the city was home to a lively comedy scene. He met comedians like Robin Williams and Dana Carvey there, and performed at one of the city\u2019s most popular comedy clubs, the Holy City Zoo. Later, while living in Los Angeles, he met Ms. Halford. They married in 1997 and had a daughter, Kathleen Ann, two years later. She survives him, as do his mother three brothers, Jack, Tim and Thomas and a sister, Cathy Meaney Paulsen. Mr. Meaney and his family moved back to New York in 2002 to be closer to relatives, Ms. Halford said. In addition to performing on Broadway, he continued to perform   across the country at venues of all sizes. \u201cComedy clubs, private functions,   PTAs, firehouses  \u2014   Kevin could do it all,\u201d his agent, Tom Ingegno, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cHe was just a   performer. The stage was really his home. \u201d Mr. Meaney was scheduled to perform in East Providence, R. I. on Saturday night. The news of his death drew a flood of reactions from his fellow comedians and entertainers. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken at the loss of one of the best, kindest people I ever knew,\u201d the writer and producer Lizz Winstead posted on Twitter. Also on Twitter, the comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote that he first knew Mr. Meaney as a \u201cbrilliant comedian,\u201d and that \u201cthen we hung out in Ireland and I found out he was also a terrific person. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563313.836998}
