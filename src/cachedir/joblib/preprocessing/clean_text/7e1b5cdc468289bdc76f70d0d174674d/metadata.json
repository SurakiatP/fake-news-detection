Held at the request of Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley (D), the Oct. 14 meeting also included Deputy Secretary of the Interior Mike Connor, and was intended to allow the federal official to hear comments and gauge public support for the proposed expansion. \\nOriginally created by President Bill Clinton in 2000, the 66,000-acre Cascade Siskiyou National Monument has long been a point of contention between environmentalists, ranchers, and loggers, all of whom share close quarters in Oregon\u2019s southwest corner. \\nThe proposed expansion would add another 65,000 acres of public land in both Jackson and Klamath Counties, as well as a small portion of California\u2019s Siskiyou County. \\nWhile attendance at the meeting appeared overwhelmingly in favor of expanding the monument, opponents argue that this was because key stakeholders were not told a meeting was taking place. \\n\u201cThere was no notice of any meeting,\u201d says rancher Lee Bradshaw. \u201cIt was pretty underhanded. \\nWhen we did find out, we called as many people as we could, but on a Friday afternoon at 2:00, most folks are at work.\u201d \\n\u201cWe got an email from Merkley\u2019s office late on [Oct. 7], which was a Friday,\u201d says Klamath County Commissioner Tom Mallam. \u201cWe really weren\u2019t aware of it until Monday.\u201d \\n\u201cA lot of the parties that would be directly affected were never informed at all,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis includes our local BLM office, as well as the BLM office in Redding. I haven\u2019t heard of any of the ranchers that got notifications. \\n\u201cI would call it a very transparent attempt to keep those who would oppose (expansion) in the dark.\u201d \\nDespite having little time to respond, Mallam did attend the meeting, where he says those in favor of the monument appeared much better prepared. \\n\u201cI saw professionally made signs supporting the monument, and a sea of t-shirts,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was extremely disturbing; you don\u2019t get those made up overnight. It was very obvious that they had plenty of notice ahead of time.\u201d \\nAs of press time, Merkley had not responded to requests for comment. However in a letter from the senator to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell dated Oct. 4, Merkley requested her presence at the Oct. 14 meeting, and claimed that the proposal had \u201cstrong backing\u201d from the regions elected officials, citizens, chambers of commerce, and landowners. \\nThe reality, says Mallam, is much different than Merkley\u2019s claim. According to Mallam, officials from two cities in the area, Ashland and Talent, have announced their support of the expansion. However, the remaining communities, as well as the county governments from all three affected counties either oppose the proposal, or were not aware of it. \\n\u201cMerkley\u2019s office has, time and again, referenced substantial support based on two small cities,\u201d says Mallam. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to say the least.\u201d \\nAmong the ranchers who were in attendance to speak against the monument, primary concerns centered on the potential loss of public grazing and the inclusion of private lands within the monument boundary. \\n\u201cMerkley\u2019s comment to me was that making it a monument won\u2019t necessarily stop grazing,\u201d says Bradshaw, whose BLM permit falls within the proposed expansion area. \u201cBut I know what the end result will be.\u201d \\nFor Bradshaw and other ranchers living in the shadow of the existing monument, all this has happened before. \\n\u201cWhen the initial monument was created, they allowed grazing to continue as part of a three-year study,\u201d explains Bradshaw. \u201cWe all knew how that was going to turn out.\u201d \\nEventually finding that grazing was incompatible with the monument, the government offered to purchase permits from willing sellers. \\n\u201cThose guys could see the writing on the wall,\u201d says Bradshaw. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t sell out, they were going to get regulated out. Their permits were bought out, and there\u2019s no longer any grazing over there.\u201d \\nBradshaw believes the same scenario will be repeated if the monument is expanded. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to find a butterfly over here, or a frog over there, and eventually, they are going to regulate you off,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I thought there was a chance I could work with them and still be running cows up there in 10 years, I\u2019d pursue it.\u201d \\nThe inclusion of private lands is an additional concern. Along with the 65,000 acres of public land, the proposed expansion boundary also includes 34,000 acres of private timber and grazing land. Expansion supporters insist that this land will remain in private hands. Opponents, however, are quick to point out that this claim has not been borne out by circumstances on the existing monument. \\nWhen it was initially created, the monument was comprised of 86,000 acres, 52,000 of which were public lands. Since that time, approximately 15,000 additional acres have been converted to public ownership, and much of the remainder is in the hands of conservation groups, awaiting public purchase. The reason for this, according to opponents, is constant pressure to sell using tactics such as restricted access, forcing a landowner into the position of a willing seller rather than face the legal battle required to keep their property. \\nAccording to both Mallam and Bradshaw, opponents of the monument are exploring their legal options, but with just a few months left in the Obama administration, there isn\u2019t much time to mount a defense. \\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going to do it, it\u2019s going to happen very quickly,\u201d says Mallam. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any way to reverse it.\u201d \\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how they can do something like this,\u201d adds Bradshaw. \u201cIf you put it out for a vote, most of the people here would be against it. Yet here we are.\u201d \u2014 Jason Campbell, WLJ Correspondent'"}, "time": 1742628419.531414}
