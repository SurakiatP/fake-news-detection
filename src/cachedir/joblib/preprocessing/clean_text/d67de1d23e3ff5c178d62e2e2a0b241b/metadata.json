Many researchers and scientists are arguing that mainstream science\u2019s current understanding of the Universe is not accurate, because it does not acknowledge that electricity plays a very important role in the creation of the Universe. Does the Electric Universe theory have all the answers to explaining how the Universe works? I do not think it does but it does have a lot of essential information for helping us innerstand how the Universe works.\\nAs described on ElectricUniverse.info :\\nThe Electric Universe theory argues that electricity plays a more important role in the Universe, than is generally accepted (see also \u201c Electricity throughout the Universe \u201c).\\nAs a theory, it offers explanations of various natural and astrophysical phenomena, some of which it claims are better understood without the need for various ad hoc explanations. As with any theory, the Electric Universe makes predictions that have been tested, and is published in both peer-reviewed papers, and popular books.\\nThe Electric Universe theory is interdisciplinary, integrating and supporting subject as diverse as the science (astronomy, geology, physics), with the soft sciences such as ancient history and comparative mythology.\\nHere is another excerpt from the same website :\\nThe Electric Universe theory highlights the importance of electricity throughout the Universe . It is based on the recognition of existing natural electrical phenomena (eg. lightning, St Elmo\u2019s Fire), and the known properties of plasmas (ionized \u201cgases\u201d) which make up 99.999% of the visible universe, and react strongly to electro-magnetic fields. Much of the material considered by the Electric Universe is peer-reviewed , but not all (see Speculative Theories, below).\\nThe Electric Universe \u2013 Information They Don\u2019t Want You to Know About \\nSource: Energy Fanatics \\n'"}, "time": 1742562216.6630666}
