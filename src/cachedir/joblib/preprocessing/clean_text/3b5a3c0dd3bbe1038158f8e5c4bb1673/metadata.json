Various mainstream media outlets, including the New York Times (NYT) and the Washington Post (WaPo) published the contents of this document, suggesting it was a legitimate draft from White House officials. The alleged draft directs national security officials to \u201crecommend to the president whether to   a program of interrogation of   alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States,\u201d and addresses whether to lift the ban on the use of   \u201cblack site\u201d prisons overseas implemented by Barack Obama. Moreover, it orders the Pentagon chief to \u201cmaintain and continue to use the detention and trial facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base for the detention and trial by military commission of alien enemy combatants [already] captured in the armed conflict  \u2026     including for the detention and trial of newly captured alien enemy combatants\u201d not only affiliated with the Taliban and   but also the Islamic State ( ). NYT acknowledged in their report that the Trump White House did not respond to a request for comment on the draft order. Today, the White House press secretary denied any affiliation with the document. The alleged draft order would have also directed U. S. Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis to work with the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to \u201creview the military commissions system and recommend to the president how best to employ the system going forward to provide for the swift and just trial and punishment of unlawful enemy combatants detained in the armed conflict with violent Islamist extremists. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563741.4635684}
