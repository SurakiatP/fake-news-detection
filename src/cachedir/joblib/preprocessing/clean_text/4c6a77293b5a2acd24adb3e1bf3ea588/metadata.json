There were only machines owned by a company linked to Soros. \\nAccording to the Epoch Times , a London-based company known as Smartmatic International has provided voting machines to 16 states this election season, and the chairman of this organization, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, happens to be directly tied to Soros. \\n\u201cMalloch-Brown is on the board of the Open Society Foundations, run by Soros,\u201d the international newspaper reported. \u201cHis brief biography on the Smartmatic website says he was also formerly the vice chairman of Soros\u2019s Investment Funds and of Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations.\u201d   \\nThe Times added that \u201cone of the easiest and most effective ways to alter the outcome of an election would be to gain access to a company that controls the voting machines,\u201d as determined by a report published last month by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology. \\nThe Daily Caller cautioned, however, that Soros has no \u201ccontrolling interest in\u201d Smartmatic International \u2014 and that the 16 states reportedly had no intention of using the company\u2019s machines this election season. \\nDespite Soros neither owning the machines nor having a \u201ccontrolling interest,\u201d it may nevertheless be a good idea just to get rid of the machines altogether. Why take any risks, given the massive importance of America\u2019s election process? \\nPlease share this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about this petition!
