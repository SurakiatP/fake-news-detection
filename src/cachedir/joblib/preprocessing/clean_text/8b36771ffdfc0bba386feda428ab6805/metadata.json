[\u201cWe are frustrated and angry that what [has] felt like a productive conversation and an exchange of ideas and information about how to ensure the safe and fair treatment of immigrants in their [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] custody has morphed into a meeting with organizations whose mission is to restrict immigration,\u201d one   advocate told CNN.   \u201cImmigrants\u2019 rights organizations have since notified ICE that they have dissolved the   Working Group and will no longer participate in the quarterly gatherings,\u201d CNN said.  \u201cIt is not a surprise  \u2014   they can\u2019t tolerate anyone there that doesn\u2019t agree with them\u201d responded Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cThey figure they owned those meetings and the fact is now that they don\u2019t, so they\u2019re having a tantrum. \u201d Since the new administration arrived, Krikorian said he was invited to attend one ICE stakeholder meetings with the   groups. \u201cIt was just kind of a general information thing about what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s new with regard to ICE [policies on] detention, removal and all that,\u201d he said.  Immigration advocates mostly \u201csat on one side of the table   \u2026     we sat on the other side of the table,\u201d he said, adding \u201cone of them even kind of joked about it [although] it was not like there was some kind of icy atmosphere in the room. \u201d During the Obama administration, the   groups used the stakeholder meetings to lobby and pressure agencies, and to cooperate on shared goals. In 2010, for example, ICE officials used one of the meetings to ask   groups to collect complaints about ICE\u2019s actions, according to a posting by a group titled \u201cStop Detaining Immigrants. \u201d ICE has informed members of the   Working Group   \u2026      ICE has asked that NGOs provide to them complaints that we are seeing around the country specifically on issues that demonstrate that IGSA facilities are not currently meeting the baseline requirements   \u2026      In order to respond to ICEs request for complaints data, we would like to provide examples of violations of detention standards to present a national overview of some of the more egregious violations for the snapshot period of January 1, 2010 to March 2010. Before Donald Trump\u2019s election,   groups were invited to only a few of the events scheduled by Obama\u2019s appointees.  Obama\u2019s officials at the Department of State ended meetings with the   advocacy groups once the   groups managed to bypass bureaucratic barriers to get into the national and regional meetings, said Ann Corcoran, the director of Refugee Resettlement Watch. In 2016, for example, the main meeting in D. C. was canceled, and opponents of   refugee inflows were allowed only to submit recommendations that were never released, she said.  \u201cThe stakeholder meetings that the refugee industry has [with agency officials] are really keep very secretive,\u201d she said. \u201cThey love to have stakeholder meetings [about refugees] and I\u2019ve never gotten wind of them,\u201c Krikorian said.  The new boycott against the agencies comes alongside complaints by   groups about the administration\u2019s hiring of two immigration experts formerly employed at   reform groups. According to CNN: Two   opponents of illegal immigration have obtained   advisory jobs at federal immigration agencies in the Department of Homeland Security. Jon Feere, a former legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, or CIS, has been hired as an adviser to Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan. At Customs and Border Protection, Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, has been hired as an adviser to Customs and Border Protection acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, said Lapan.   advocates protested the appointments, according to CNN:  \u201cThese groups have spent 20 years looking for ways that they could hurt immigrants and now they\u2019ve been given the keys to the kingdom,\u201d said Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America\u2019s Voice, a   advocacy group based in Washington whose goal is to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The agencies should continue to open up their meetings to all side in the debate, said Krikorian.  \u201cObviously these kinds of information sessions with ICE officials should be open any interested party,\u201d Krikorian said, adding \u201cyou can\u2019t just grab people off the street, but any organization that works on the immigration issue should be able to come to these meetings. \u201d \u201cIt is outrageous that that wasn\u2019t the case before, and I have to give credit to the agencies,\u201d Krikorian said.
