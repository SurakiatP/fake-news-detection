As a result, when the Protestant Reformation ended the Dark Ages and removed the Bible from its Vatican shackles, it was a book that remained quite a mystery to most people. Out of all of its 66 books, the most misunderstood, most debated over and most feared book is, ironically and undoubtedly, the book of Revelation. \\nOn this episode of Rightly Dividing , we apply Paul\u2019s command to \u201crightly divide\u201d to the book of Revelation, and in the process of doing so remove much of the mystery in the process. God didn\u2019t write any part of the Bible to be out of reach of anyone who, by faith, wanted to plumb its depths and unlock its mysteries.
