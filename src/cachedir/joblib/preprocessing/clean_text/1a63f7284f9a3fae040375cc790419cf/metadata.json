BREAKING: Justice Dept. says it'll dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in Clinton case. \\n\u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) October 31, 2016 \\nBoth announcements, made after Clinton aid Huma Abedin\u2019s emails were discovered on estranged husband Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer, come amid growing internal contention, as the FBI and DOJ parse out how to deal with the pressure of a rapidly approaching presidential election, as well as public perception the original investigation had been purposely bumbled in favor of the Democratic nominee. \\nHowever welcome or unwelcome the news of reopened investigations might be, one major detail \u2014 revealed in Wikileaks ongoing publications of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s emails \u2014 presents evidence the Justice Department\u2019s probe could amount to little more than a smoke screen to placate an irate public. \\nAssistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik promised Congress in a letter the Justice Department \u201cwill continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible.\u201d #BREAKING Senior DOJ official sends letter to lawmakers responding to request for more information about email review. #8days pic.twitter.com/PCgT2ODkQd \\n\u2014 Just the Facts (@JTF_News) October 31, 2016 \\nPerhaps that vow, from a government branch putatively dedicated to ensuring the criminal element is duly punished for misbehavior, should reassure those increasingly suspicious of an obviously-rigged system. \\nPerhaps, before Wikileaks revealed interdepartmental communications and corruption, that promise might have held weight beyond a symbolic gesture of obligation \u2014 but as Podesta\u2019s emails reveal, it\u2019s entirely possible this reopened investigation is failed from the start. \\nKadzik, in fact, maintains a cozy enough relationship with Podesta to have had dinner with the Clinton insider just one day after the former secretary of state testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October. \\nAnd the pair\u2019s familiarity isn\u2019t held to a simple dinner party, as the Daily Caller reported , \u201cPodesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta\u2019s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik\u2019s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign.\u201d \\nSo, Kadzik \u2014 an extremely close friend to the chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 is tasked with heading the newly reopened investigation of Hillary Clinton. \\nClinton couldn\u2019t ask for an arrangement better situated to again find insufficient evidence worthy of bringing charges against her. As far as conflicts of interest go, this takes the cake. \\n\u201cThe political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don\u2019t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,\u201d executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, Matthew Whitaker, told the Daily Caller . \\nIf political wranglings and connections marred transparency and neutrality the first time around, it would be reasonable to assume the players haven\u2019t since magically unentangled themselves from Clinton and her campaign mere days before Americans take to the polls. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Whitaker continued, also noting the controversial meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac in Phoenix during the DOJ\u2019s previous investigation. \\nIn fact, Kadzik, as an Obama appointee to the Justice Department beginning in 2013, also initiated the effort to have Loretta Lynch appointed to the role of Attorney General. \\nAnd the friendship between Kadzik and Podesta \u2014 as well as their connections to the Obama administration and additional officials overseeing the Clinton investigation \u2014 spans decades. \\nIn 2008, for example, as the Washington Free Beacon reported from one of the leaked emails, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik have a supportive role in Obama\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 particularly because the latter was a \u201cfantastic lawyer\u201d who managed to keep Podesta \u201cout of jail.\u201d \\nAlthough Kadzik, as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, does not have a direct role in \u2018chain of command\u2019 for the Clinton investigation, he does field inquiries from Congress concerning her emails. \\nNoted by the Daily Caller , in \u201cNovember, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation,\u201d which sparked outrage by the GOP over potential conflicts of interest. \\nFlorida Rep. Ron DeSantis voiced particular concerns about Lynch\u2019s longtime connections to the Clintons in a February 1, 2016 letter , and that Obama\u2019s appointees \u201care being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.\u201d \\nWhile the Daily Caller \u2019s report goes much further in depth concerning the relationships of Podesta and Kadzik with the Clintons and their insiders, it can be easily surmised in even a simple perusal of facts there could be no possible way an investigation this critical \u2014 and with resounding implications \u2014 would maintain any semblance of impartiality. \\nWhen Julian Assange vociferously denounces the U.S. electoral and political systems as rigged beyond repair, these connections are precisely what he\u2019s referring to. \\nIt might calm an irate public to hear an investigation had to be reopened \u2014 but when the effort involves the same players as the first round, the outcome is all-too predictable.
