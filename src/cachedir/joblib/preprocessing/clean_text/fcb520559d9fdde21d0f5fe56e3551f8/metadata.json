[Seeing their neighbors Christmas decorations, Naomi and Seth Ellis\u2019s three children insisted on decorating their home for the Jewish festival, the Washington Post reported. Their parents obliged by erecting an oversize   menorah outside of their home, made of   PVC pipe and using solar powered lights.   \u201cJust waking up to see that first thing is kind of rattling,\u201d Seth Ellis told ABC15. \u201cIt just makes me sad and it makes me feel sick that\u2019s still how people look at the world in 2016,\u201d he added. The children did not see what the vandals had done to the menorah but Naomi Ellis said that explaining to her boys, aged five, seven, and nine, what had occurred was difficult. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure how I will explain this to [my children],\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I quite understand it myself.   \u2026     How can people be filled with so much hate and violence? To think that someone would make such an effort to hurt and vandalize a family is downright sickening. \u201d \u201cWe live in a great neighborhood with kind and welcoming neighbors. We never would have imagined that someone would spread so much hate here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk a lot about the importance of equality and tolerance, loving everybody no matter what,\u201d she told the Washington Post after speaking with her children. \u201cI had to tell them that not everybody feels that way. Some people are ignorant, and this is what they do. \u201d \u201cThis is the real reality that we live in: People hate us for no reason or want us to feel scared for who we are. That\u2019s not something I wanted to have to tell them,\u201d Naomi told the Post. Seth and Naomi Ellis spent Friday afternoon putting the menorah back together again. \u201cYou have to put it back up,\u201d Seth Ellis told ABC15 reporter Megan Thompson. \u201cI mean, what kind of statement is it for me not to put it back up, especially for my kids?\u201d When asked what he would do if the new menorah was also vandalized, Seth answered he would go about rebuilding it again: \u201cAs many times as I have to. \u201d The Ellis family invited their community to attend a Hanukkah lighting ceremony of the new menorah at their home. No arrests have been made.'"}, "time": 1742564612.251031}
