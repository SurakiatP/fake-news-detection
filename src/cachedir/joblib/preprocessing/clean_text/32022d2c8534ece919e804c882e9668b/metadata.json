(Geremy Jasper was one at the festival that just ended in Park City, Utah.) These lucky few tend to go on to   or critical success, maybe even the Oscars. Think Damien Chazelle, whose \u201cWhiplash\u201d was the toast of the 2014 season his \u201cLa La Land\u201d is now the    . But what about the festival filmmakers whose works are lauded and distributed, but whose career paths are less charmed? After they\u2019ve packed up their snow gear, there are tantalizing moments and deep frustrations. Many go on what\u2019s known as the \u201cwater bottle tour,\u201d meetings with development executives and agents in Los Angeles (where you\u2019re more likely to leave with a bottle of Evian than a production deal). Most don\u2019t have new scripts ready, a huge impediment, said the producer Anne Carey. Then they struggle against the industry\u2019s narrow expectations. \u201cAny person coming out of Sundance is in a box, particularly if you only have one film under your name,\u201d said the filmmaker Justin Simien. \u201cAnd if you happen to be in the black box or the gay box or the woman box, I think you\u2019re in a smaller box. \u201d Meanwhile, the clock is ticking: \u201cYou have a whole year, and then there\u2019s a whole new batch of kids at Sundance, and then it\u2019s their year,\u201d said the director Kat Candler. \u201cYour spotlight has shifted. \u201d For three filmmakers  \u2014   Mr. Simien, 33, from Los Angeles Ms. Candler, 42, who lives in Austin, Tex. and Sara Colangelo, 37, based in New York  \u2014   who made their feature debuts in 2014, alongside Mr. Chazelle, what happened next felt like one step forward, two back. Their paths hold lessons for other artists and offer a glimpse into how Hollywood careers are really made. 2014 Two years before, Justin Simien quit his day job to make his debut feature, \u201cDear White People. \u201d He had worked in movie marketing, so he had some insider savvy. What he didn\u2019t know was how his film, a satire of race relations set on a college campus, would be received by the mostly white audiences at Sundance. \u201cI was kind of terrified, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cDear White People\u201d struck a chord, earning a festival award for breakthrough talent. A distribution deal soon followed. \u201cI went into it just hoping that when I came out, I could at least pay my rent,\u201d Mr. Simien said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. \u201d But in Los Angeles afterward, he was in demand, attending dozens of development meetings for months. He understood the process: \u201cPart of being a development person is checking off the list\u201d that you\u2019ve met with Sundance alumni, he said. Nonetheless, it seemed like he had arrived. Even if the offers were not as big as those some of his white counterparts were getting  \u2014   \u201cNobody was talking about \u2018Jurassic World,\u2019\u201d he said, the film Colin Trevorrow landed after his Sundance debut  \u2014   he didn\u2019t feel pigeonholed. Several projects floated up, like a dark comedy with Anthony Mackie attached. Yet Mr. Simien was still strapped for cash. Driving to those Beverly Hills meetings, \u201cI was afraid to pull up to the valet, because my hubcaps were falling off,\u201d he said. In the spring, he sold a book version of \u201cDear White People\u201d that kept him afloat financially. The film opened in the fall, to critical acclaim. 2015 As Mr. Simien toured with his film, he found a second career as a speaker, especially at colleges. \u201cAny school that was dealing with a race issue would book the film and then book me,\u201d he said. He made the movie to spark discussion, so these encounters were gratifying and meaningful. He jotted down stories he heard from the students, too. When a studio approached him about making a TV version of \u201cDear White People,\u201d his notes  \u2014   fresh ideas  \u2014   were immediately useful. 2016 In May, Netflix announced the series. In June, Mr. Simien sat in a production space and marveled at his fortune. \u201cI\u2019m in an office! There\u2019s a lamp from HomeGoods! It\u2019s \u201d he said. He presided over a diverse writers\u2019 room of seven people, discussing civil rights, \u201cblacktivism\u201d and cultural identity. With the veteran showrunner Yvette Lee Bowser, he learned to make a TV series. 2017 \u201cThat was probably the hardest thing I ever did,\u201d Mr. Simien said in January after finishing the show\u2019s first season. Production had wrapped on Election Day the series\u2019 themes were landing in a much more charged cultural landscape than where they were conceived. \u201cThis show is 100 percent part of the resistance,\u201d he said. Mr. Simien is pleased with it but itching to get to other projects. \u201cCreatively, I just need to prove to myself and to others in the industry, I\u2019m not a   pony,\u201d he said. Hiring for his series, he had noted that white male colleagues had been given more career chances. \u201cThe opportunities that I have tend to be \u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou just gotta keep grinding  \u2014   which has worked out so far. \u201d  2014 The   Sara Colangelo arrived at Sundance that January with an ambitious debut, \u201cLittle Accidents. \u201d Set and shot in a West Virginia   town, with a sprawling story line, it was created after Ms. Colangelo won a coveted spot in the Sundance screenwriting and directing labs three years earlier, and secured a budget of $1. 2 million, all major for a   indie filmmaker. The cast  \u2014   including Elizabeth Banks, Josh Lucas and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny  \u2014   was enviable, too. But even as she set out to unveil it, Ms. Colangelo said, she knew that her film was not exactly what she wanted it to be. \u201cThere were moments in the editing room where I was like, I\u2019m enormously proud, but these things might not be working,\u201d she said. Was the film too sad? How would the marketplace react? \u201cI was aware of what the challenges were. \u201d The film came with    expectations. Critics at the festival praised the acting, though, and the  . Ms. Colangelo made the Los Angeles rounds that fall, and was sent a few scripts, but no jobs materialized. She made ends meet doing corporate videos. Financially, she said, \u201cthere were nine months or so where it was like, it\u2019s going to be tough. \u201d 2015 \u201cLittle Accidents\u201d made it to theaters a full year after Sundance. Reviews were largely welcoming, but it barely eked out $10, 000  \u2014   total  \u2014   at the box office. Still, Ms. Colangelo earned a nomination for best first screenplay at that year\u2019s Indie Spirit Awards, and that led to a few    jobs, polishing other people\u2019s work. In the meantime, she watched friends and Sundance alumni  \u2014   mostly men  \u2014   advance. Doubts crept in: Could she have done more on \u201cLittle Accidents\u201d? Her male counterparts were often allowed reshoots. Somehow, for them, \u201cthe money was found. \u201d She asked herself, \u201cWhat kind of leader do you have to be to get those things? Is it charisma? Is it truly gender?\u201d She was buoyed when Israeli producers asked her to adapt an acclaimed,   foreign drama. (They declined to reveal it.) Ms. Colangelo worked on the script for months and finally signed a deal at the end of the year. 2016 As the Israeli film\u2019s location and financiers bounced from Canada to New York, and casting decisions loomed, Ms. Colangelo hung on to direct. She vowed to be more flexible on production details and bolder in her focus on story. 2017 Her   was erased, replaced with excitement, and pride: She plans to begin shooting the new film this summer, shortly after the birth of her first child. \u201cThere\u2019s this feeling that the industry sometimes gives you, that you have this window of opportunity after Sundance and if you don\u2019t perform perfectly in that moment or have a perfect script, then the window shuts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a dangerous way to think about it. \u201d Momentum, she discovered, can rebound. \u201cAnd it\u2019s O. K. to retrieve it and find it later. \u201d 2014 A   filmmaker with several shorts to her credit, Kat Candler landed at Sundance with the family drama \u201cHellion. \u201d \u201cI was definitely hoping to get representation,\u201d she said, a distribution deal and attention for other projects. She knew that breakout success was rare and that her route would be tough, especially without superlative reviews. A month later, she did her water bottle week in Los Angeles. \u201cIt felt like \u2018The Amazing Race,\u2019\u201d she said, eight meetings a day. Little came of them. \u201cHellion,\u201d starring Aaron Paul of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d opened in theaters five months later, and Ms. Candler hit the road to promote it. Live Q. and A. s, Skype sessions  \u2014   \u201cAnytime anybody asked, it was a yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was exhausting, after a while. I wish someone had warned me. \u201d Her promotion helped, but not much \u201cHellion\u201d just did not have the marketing dollars. In retrospect, she said, her efforts distracted her from \u201cputting all the pieces for another project together. \u201d 2015 A year after Sundance, Ms. Candler was growing anxious. \u201cI felt like, oh, what am I doing?\u201d she said. But she was halfway into a   mentorship program, sponsored by the Sundance women\u2019s filmmaking initiative. \u201cThe life coach was pretty transformative,\u201d she said. She shelved her jealousy about others\u2019 deals. \u201cI can go write for four hours and feel a sense of accomplishment,\u201d she said. A push to break into TV directing was fruitless, though. No one wanted to an untested TV director, even if she had already conquered the big screen. (Male directors, research shows, face a lower bar for hiring.) \u201cSometimes you just wonder, how much harder do I have to work to prove myself?\u201d Ms. Candler said. Her life coach offered a mantra: You belong in the room. So at every meeting, she said, \u201cI tell myself, \u2018You\u2019ve earned your space. \u2019\u201d In the summer, she shot a campaign for Canon. Besides money from teaching a college class, it was her first real paycheck in years. Still, she worried about car insurance payments and other bills. 2016 Back in Los Angeles, Ms. Candler had meetings about a   feature she was writing. It could go indie or mainstream, depending on the stars and how much control Ms. Candler ceded. \u201cDo I really want to go out for a project that doesn\u2019t have great humanity? No,\u201d she said. A turning point came in the spring, when she shot two episodes of \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d the series created by Ava DuVernay that employs only female directors. No pitch meetings were necessary they knew each other through the festival circuit. The paucity of female directors has been a hot topic in Hollywood, but Ms. Candler was over it. \u201cJust hire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t that hard. \u201d 2017 \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d was renewed, and Ms. DuVernay asked Ms. Candler to return, now as the producing director. Ms. Candler went on to shoot episodes of other series. She has work lined up through 2018. She felt confident before \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that people had confidence in us. Ava legitimized all of us. \u201d After 17 years in the field, she said, she was at last making a living as a filmmaker.'"}, "time": 1742561922.2657526}
