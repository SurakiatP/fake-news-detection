But the Halloween party in San Francisco\u2019s gay Castro district finally returns in 2014. \\nIt will be recalled that the Halloween bash attracted as many as 500,000 each year and has become a major tourist attraction, second and third only to the Pride parade and Folsom Street Fair. Stabbing and shooting incidents, believed to be perpetrated by straight revelers, prompted city officials to permanently ban the event beginning in 2010. \\nAs part of the agreement, the \u201cnew\u201d Castro Halloween will be open only to members of the LGBTQ community who will have to register with city hall and be included in a \u201cgay registry.\u201d Registrants, who will take an oath admitting that they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning, will be issued special identification cards linked to the official registry. The IDs will be the only accepted pass to gain entry to the Halloween event. ID\u2019s will be scanned at entrances to the event to confirm that individuals are listed in the official registry. \\nGet ready to say \u201cBoo!\u201d Again.
