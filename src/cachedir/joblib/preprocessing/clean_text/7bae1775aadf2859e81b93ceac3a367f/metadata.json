On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clinton\u2019s close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedin\u2019s estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. \\nIt remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. \\nClinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. \\nAs of Thursday, Clinton\u2019s odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. \\nClinton\u2019s lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romney\u2019s 206. \\nBut even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trump\u2019s accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager\u2019s account. This week\u2019s leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clinton\u2019s finances. \\nAnd her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didn\u2019t see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. \\nStill, Trump\u2019s path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. \\nEarly voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The project\u2019s broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. \\nIn Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. \\nIn Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. \\nEven in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results. \\nThe States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington D.C.
