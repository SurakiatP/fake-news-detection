Graham \u2014 Daily Mail.com Oct 30, 2016 James Kallstrom, former FBI assistant director \\nA former FBI official described the Clintons as a \u2018crime family\u2019 days after the bureau reopened its investigation into Hillary\u2019s personal email server. \\nJames Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI, spoke out against the Clinton family on Sunday in a radio interview with host and Greek-American billionaire businessman John Catsimatidis on \u2018The Cats Roundtable\u2019. \\n\u2018The Clintons, that\u2019s a crime family. It\u2019s like organized crime, basically. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool,\u2019 Kallstrom said. \\n\u2018It\u2019s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money \\n\u2018And she\u2019s a pathological liar, and she\u2019s always been a liar. And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House.\u2019 \\nKallstrom, who is best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late 1990s, also went after the FBI in the interview and said the initial investigation into the email server was \u2018never a real investigation.\u2019 \\n\u2018They never had grand jury empaneled. And the reason \u2026 was that Loretta Lynch would not go along with that,\u2019 Kallstrom said. \\n\u2018So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.\u2019 \\nHe added that the FBI \u2018left so much stuff on the table\u2019. \\nKallstrom did defend the agents who were tasked with investigating Clinton. \\n\u2018This is not the FBI agents who\u2019s to blame for this fiasco going on. This is the leadership. This is Jim Comey \u2026 The agents are furious with what\u2019s going on. I know that for a fact,\u2019 he said. \\nKallstrom praised Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a \u2018good human being\u2019 and a \u2018patriot\u2019.'"}, "time": 1742628441.420592}
