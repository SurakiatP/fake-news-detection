And measured against my plan, this is hieroglyphics. Measured against my plan, this is like trying to learn a foreign language. And not just learn the language, but then learn all of the dialects and all the hidden meaning with the use of slang and so forth. It\u2019s impossible. \u201cSeven Reasons Why Obamacare 2. 0 Is All But Guaranteed to Impose Crushing Costs on Voters, Hurt Trump\u2019s Base, and Hand Power Back to the Democrats. \u201d Okay, that\u2019s the headline of the Breitbart piece. Let me ask you a question. I mean, the way I react when I see a headline like this, if it\u2019s this bad, how in the world can the people in charge of it not know it\u2019s this bad? If it is this bad, then why do the Republicans want to hand power back to the Democrats? Why do the Republicans want to hurt Trump\u2019s base? Now, that I can answer. Why do Republicans want to impose crushing costs on voters? Does any of this make sense? And why do Republicans want to hand power back to the Democrats? And why does Trump want to do that? Trump supposedly signed on to this. Okay, so let\u2019s take this incrementally. Now, at the bottom of this piece is perhaps the most important aspect of story with nothing to do with health care. \u201cSixty percent of adults are \u2018hopeful and optimistic\u2019 about America\u2019s future. \u201d As asserted in this story, that\u2019s from polling data. Sixty percent of adults are hopeful and optimistic? Now, as the Breitbart writer, Katie McHugh is her name, writer of the story. She says, \u201cThat\u2019s a precious opportunity, one that shouldn\u2019t be wasted. \u201d \u201c\u2018The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f \u2014  ed over. If we deliver, we\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years,\u2019 White House Chief strategist Steve Bannon said during a November interview. \u2018That\u2019s what the Democrats missed  \u2026     They lost sight of what the world is about. \u2019\u201d Bannon, chief strategist for Trump  \u2026     So Breitbart claims here that this Obamacare repeal and replacement bill actually targets senior citizens in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and makes their tax credits less effective and raises their health care costs. Those are three blue states that Trump won. Why would the Republicans do that? Do you believe that they have? Do you think that\u2019s in the bill? The Washington Post says it is, and Breitbart\u2019s accepting it. Read Rush\u2019s transcript here. LISTEN: '"}, "time": 1742628359.0280778}
