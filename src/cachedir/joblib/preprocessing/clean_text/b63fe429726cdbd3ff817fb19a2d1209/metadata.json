[Christoph Knappes\u2019s has christened his proposed site \u201cSchmalbart\u201d a   words reffering to the German origins of the surname \u2018Breitbart\u2019. While \u2018Breitbart\u2019 translated, refers to one in possession of a \u2018broad beard\u2019 Schmalbart describes the opposite  \u2014   \u2018Smallbeard\u2019.  So far, Mr. Kappes has raised just over \u20ac700 (\u00a3600, $750) in monthly subscriptions for the project, including from Social Democratic MP Saskia Esker who has recently taken to tweeting at German companies while claiming that Breitbart News is a \u201c  site\u201d. According to the fundraising page, Mr. Kappes\u2019s project is designed to \u201ccombat populism\u201d and the site will \u201cfight incitement, racism,   and any other kind of human hostility\u201d. He says the site will not just be limited to articles but will be active on social media, saying \u201cWe will be at the places where the discussions are\u201d. The manifesto for the proposed   site was released in November on Mr. Kappes\u2019s website. According to the post, Breitbart News follows an \u201cextreme right wing ideology of social Darwinism\u201d. He claims that a German language Breitbart bureau could garner an audience of up to \u201csix million\u201d in Germany, and complains that the German middle class \u201clack civil courage\u201d. Writers should \u201cavoid arrogance\u201d when dealing with the public, Mr Kappes goes on to opine, saying: \u201cSchmalbart must avoid condescension\u201d. He added: \u201csimple language is mandatory\u201d. The project is set to employ several authors, editorial staff, web designers, and others to manage fundraising campaigns. It is not known how the site intends to maintain such a large paid staff given that it is presently is raising just \u20ac740 per month. As the German federal election approaches later this year, the German establishment media, along with their counterparts in the U. S. have targeted Breitbart News. Accusations of \u201cfake news\u201d have abounded and some, like The New York Times, have encouraged readers to hound advertisers on social media. American left wing political operative David Brock announced a similar project to Schmalbart last month and like his German counterpart is seeking cash. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also taken steps toward a free speech crackdown by accusing Russia and others of trying to influence the federal election through news and cyber attacks. The German Interior Ministry has also proposed a \u201cdefence centre\u201d be created to combat news and information the German government deems to be \u201cfake news\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742628411.36988}
