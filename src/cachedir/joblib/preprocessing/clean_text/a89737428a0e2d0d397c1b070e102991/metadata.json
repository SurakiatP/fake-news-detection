In Colombia, prosecutors say its president\u2019s   campaign accepted dirty money. And intelligence agents in Venezuela arrested journalists and researchers looking into scandals there. Latin America\u2019s biggest corruption scandal is shaking the continent\u2019s political establishment. It can all be traced back to Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction company, which has built major projects throughout the region and late last year settled with the United States, Brazil and Switzerland for up to $4. 5 billion under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for an elaborate bribe scheme involving $800 million in payoffs in exchange for lucrative contracts. It was the largest anticorruption settlement in history. Prosecutors said the company paid bribes on 100 projects in more than a dozen countries, from Mexico to Angola, in one case buying a local bank branch to hide the transactions, and even opening a division specifically dedicated to payoffs. Throughout Latin America, the company built bridges, dams, power plants, roads and stretches of a highway to link Brazil and Peru that went more than four times over budget. Nearly three years of investigations have resulted in 77 Brazilian Odebrecht executives signing plea deals, and the company\u2019s former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, is in prison. Now the charges are cascading across the region. \u201cOnce you start opening these cases, it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box  \u2014   it could go on for years,\u201d said Shannon K. O\u2019Neil, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. Yet she called it a positive development for the region, showing \u201cthe anticorruption movement in Latin America is gaining ground. \u201d Perhaps the most spectacular case so far involves Alejandro Toledo, the president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, and a wanted man since a judge issued an arrest warrant last week on charges that he had accepted up to $35 million in bribes. Mr. Toledo\u2019s whereabouts was unknown, and Peruvians have been captivated. On Sunday night, he surfaced on Twitter, where he posted a statement attesting to his innocence and denied that he was hiding out. \u201cI never fled from anything. When I left Peru, there were no Odebrecht charges against me, but they call me a \u2018fugitive,\u2019 \u201d he wrote, saying nothing of his location. The current Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has asked President Trump to extradite Mr. Toledo should he be found in the United States. In Lima, the capital, the legacy of Odebrecht is hard to miss. A statue of Christ with arms outspread that overlooks the city\u2019s coast was donated by the company. But Odebrecht has also reaped the benefits of its connections to the country. The Interoceanic Highway, for example, begun under Mr. Toledo\u2019s administration, cost $4. 5 billion, four times over budget. The overruns were approved by an official who is also under investigation by prosecutors. Under Ollanta Humala, Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s predecessor, Odebrecht began a   $7 billion natural gas pipeline to connect the Amazon to the coast by cutting through the Andes Mountains. Another former president, Alan Garc\u00eda, oversaw the bidding for a subway line in Lima, which Odebrecht won and constructed. If Mr. Toledo is apprehended and convicted, he would be the second Peruvian president behind bars, after Alberto K. Fujimori, the country\u2019s former dictator, who was convicted of human rights abuses. \u201cFor Peru, like any other country, even the possibility of having two presidents as prisoners is an embarrassment,\u201d Marisol P\u00e9rez Tello, the country\u2019s justice minister, said in an interview. But she added, \u201cI think this is an important moment to think about our ability to institutionalize the fight against corruption. \u201d Farther north, in Colombia, leaders were on the defensive as prosecutors said they had evidence that Odebrecht had donated $1 million to President Juan Manuel Santos\u2019s   campaign in 2014. Speaking to reporters last week, the country\u2019s attorney general said a former lawmaker, Otto Bula, had funneled Odebrecht money through an intermediary to the campaign. Mr. Bula is currently under arrest on charges of having paid about $4. 6 million in bribes for various projects in Colombia, including a road linking the country\u2019s interior to the Magdalena River and Caribbean highway known as the Ruta del Sol. Mr. Santos had said he did not do anything wrong and is interested in a full investigation of the case. Roberto Prieto, Mr. Santos\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement last week he had not met Mr. Bula, \u201cnot even for a coffee. \u201d Investigators are also looking into dealings involving other politicians\u2019 campaigns, including Oscar Iv\u00e1n Zuluaga, a   candidate for president in the 2014 election. Ivan Garz\u00f3n, a political scientist at Colombia\u2019s University of La Sabana, said Odebrecht had shown how easy it was to hijack the country\u2019s elections for its own gain. \u201cIt shows that the problems of exorbitant campaign costs, ones so high the candidates are ready to make a pact with the devil,\u201d he said. In Venezuela, the authorities seem to be taking a different tack toward the revelations: cracking down on outsiders trying to investigate them. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the former president of Venezuela, was one of Odebrecht\u2019s principal patrons, steering $11 billion toward Odebrecht for infrastructure projects, including public housing, that undergirded his   revolution. But many of the projects, from bridges to agricultural buildings, were never finished. On Saturday, two researchers from Transparency International and two Brazilian journalists were arrested by Venezuelan intelligence agents while looking into an unfinished bridge Odebrecht was meant to construct over Lake Maracaibo, one of the company\u2019s biggest projects. Jes\u00fas Urbina, one of the researchers, said they were questioned but not harmed. The Brazilian journalists were later deported. Juan Guaid\u00f3, an opposition lawmaker involved in investigating bribes, said the country\u2019s secret police, controlled by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, fears any attempts to document the unfinished projects. \u201cI think the images of the projects as they look now with nothing done would leave them looking naked,\u201d he said of the government.'"}, "time": 1742562260.4427023}
