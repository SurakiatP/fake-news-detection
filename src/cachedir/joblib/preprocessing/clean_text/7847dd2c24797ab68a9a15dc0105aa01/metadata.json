But they were under considerable pressure to finish the first episode for the 20th season of this satirical animated series, which was due in less than 48 hours and would air that Wednesday. At this stage  \u2014   on the ninth draft of a script called \u201cMember Berries\u201d  \u2014   they would like to have 16 minutes of a   episode Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker said they had 12 and a half. (\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what we have done,\u201d Mr. Parker cautioned. \u201cThat means that\u2019s all we have figured out. \u201d) A   board in the room showed a nearly nonexistent third act, all empty ovals stacked like pancakes, as the collaborators kicked around the episode\u2019s story elements: a new American national anthem rebooted by J. J. Abrams a comically inept xenophobe running for president and an addictive talking fruit that induces nostalgia for the   of one\u2019s youth. How these pieces fit together wasn\u2019t clear yet. But after two decades of making their show in this stressful,       way, Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker were reasonably certain they would figure out something. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m surprised by it,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cHow do we get to this point and have no story? But we just go through it again. For the eight millionth time. \u201d Since its debut in 1997, \u201cSouth Park\u201d has spun more than 250 tales about   fourth graders in a Colorado town that invariably gets swept up in whatever social crisis the nation is facing that week. What began with a show about aliens installing a satellite in a child\u2019s butt has evolved  \u2014   sort of  \u2014   into a series that, in its unapologetically crude way, can address debates over transgender bathrooms, racial discrimination or gratuitous sex and violence in \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d Even as animation technology has improved and the \u201cSouth Park\u201d staff has grown exponentially, the show is still fundamentally the work of Mr. Parker, 46, and Mr. Stone, 45, who agonize over every installment. (Mr. Parker has had sole writing and directing credit on all but a few episodes since 2001.) The mechanics of making the show haven\u2019t changed much, but Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have. The   punks who were on LSD at the 2000 Academy Awards have grown up: Mr. Stone telecommutes half the week to be with his wife and children in New York, while Mr. Parker\u2019s office is strewn with the   toys of his    daughter. In its 20th year, \u201cSouth Park\u201d offers a pointed and, surprisingly,   platform for commentary on current events. New episodes typically draw around two million viewers, many of them the   to    that advertisers covet, a showing that Comedy Central decidedly needs while its   lineup is in flux and other signature franchises like \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d are on hiatus. \u201cFor a network that no longer has Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, having \u2018South Park\u2019 is extremely important to us,\u201d said Doug Herzog, the president of Viacom\u2019s Music and Entertainment Group, which includes Comedy Central. \u201cWith all due respect to Jon and \u2018The Daily Show,\u2019 \u2018South Park\u2019 is the foundation on which Comedy Central is built. \u201d If the earliest \u201cSouth Park\u201d episodes reflected a juvenile desire to see what they could get away with on television, their later work suggests Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone have honed their ability to channel their growing exasperation with a polarized world into comedy. Vernon Chatman, a comedy writer who has worked on \u201cSouth Park\u201d for more than 15 years, said that Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have thrived by embracing their roles in \u201ctheir     relationship. \u201d \u201cMatt has this sharp, analytical mind that\u2019s focused and relentless,\u201d he said. \u201cTrey has the dreamy, emotional storyteller thing. \u201d Mr. Chatman added, \u201cTo be in such a heightened, intense relationship, with so much stakes and pressure on it  \u2014   the fact that they haven\u2019t killed each other is incredible. \u201d Already, Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone had spent this Monday in a multihour meeting with Mr. Chatman and Anne Garefino, an executive producer, talking through plot points for \u201cMember Berries\u201d and shooting them down. \u201cIf we only have three scenes left to write, that\u2019s a win,\u201d Ms. Garefino said. \u201cIt\u2019s when you still have that whole last act  \u2014   \u201d Her voice trailed off. In the afternoon, Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker caromed from office to office in a building decorated with their trophies  \u2014   \u201cSouth Park\u201d toys and memorabilia framed posters from their Tony   Broadway musical, \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d  \u2014   while trying to bring \u201cMember Berries\u201d into focus. For a few minutes, Mr. Parker stepped into a recording booth to perform the voices of two football announcers introducing the new national anthem, while Mr. Stone directed him to be more excitable. Then it was off to an editing suite, where Mr. Parker reviewed a vividly vulgar montage featuring Mr. Garrison, the \u201cSouth Park\u201d character who has turned into a buffoonish populist demagogue, describing exactly how he\u2019d bring death to America\u2019s enemies. Mr. Parker writes in private, emerging occasionally to pull Mr. Stone from wherever he might be and ask his help. In the writers\u2019 room, the two creators were trying to pin down the motivations of Randy Marsh, the show\u2019s ambivalent adult moral compass, as he grapples with a presidential race between two candidates he dislikes and decides whether he should try the narcotic member berries. Where should Randy be introduced to the enticing fruit  \u2014   at a bar or in a friend\u2019s house? Do the berries come in boxes or grow in bunches? Mr. Parker was in constant motion as he considered each question, walking many agitated laps around a long conference table. Together, he and Mr. Stone improvised a scene in which the exhortations of the talking berries grow more sinister: Remember \u201cStar Wars\u201d? Remember being a kid? Remember feeling safe? Remember no immigrants? As Mr. Parker stepped away to resume his solitary work, Mr. Stone explained that his role in these moments was to be a sounding board for Mr. Parker but also to remind him that he\u2019s just got to write something down. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to do it,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that one perfect line, you can fix that later. \u201d In a phone interview a few days earlier, Mr. Parker explained how he and Mr. Stone had abandoned their preseason ritual of holding a writers\u2019 retreat to drink, carouse and think up ideas. \u201cAs soon as we\u2019re like, \u2018We could do this, this could be funny,\u2019 we\u2019re like, \u2018Stop talking about it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cBecause in two months, when we\u2019re doing the show, it won\u2019t be funny to us anymore. \u201d Being more extemporaneous, he said, led to unexpected discoveries like their 19th season in 2015, presented as 10 interconnected episodes that told a broader story about gentrification, identity politics and a perceived resurgence of political correctness. The renewed debate about sensitivity in speech and the policing of language was one that \u201cSouth Park\u201d could not avoid, for its own sake. \u201cThis might finally be the year that we get run out of town,\u201d Mr. Parker recalled thinking at the time. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to, let\u2019s make fun of the fact that we\u2019re the old guys at the table. All those shows were an honest part of us going, \u2018Should we go away? \u2019\u201d Instead, the 19th season was a critical hit in a review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that \u201cSouth Park\u201d had \u201cgone and revitalized itself,\u201d in part \u201cby asserting that it takes an outrageous comedy to capture an era of outrage. \u201d Mr. Herzog, who has worked with Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone since the debut of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d said they have Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cabsolute, 1, 000 percent eternal trust. \u201d As long as the show satisfies the network\u2019s Standards and Practices department, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re cool with the show. \u201d Yet that success created more angst for Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker as they approached Season 20. Were they obligated to tell a serialized narrative again? Did they have to dwell on the 2016 campaign, when their indifference to presidential politics is a   subject? All they can do, the \u201cSouth Park\u201d creators said, is continue to apply a principle that has guided them from the beginning. No matter how serious an issue seems, Mr. Parker said, \u201cLooking at it with a sense of humor is not only healthier for you, it actually makes you think more clearly about things  \u2014   being able to make fun of either side of an issue, rather than just, \u2018Trump is evil and Clinton is good. \u2019\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always room to equally rip on both of them,\u201d he said. Comedy Central has signed Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone to keep making \u201cSouth Park\u201d through 2019. Ms. Garefino, who has worked on the show for 19 of its 20 years, suggested they could stick around longer still. \u201cThey said they didn\u2019t still want to be making \u2018South Park\u2019 when they were 40,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be doing it when they\u2019re 50. \u201d She tried to make herself sound as confident that the current episode would be completed under deadline. \u201cThere\u2019s always a moment where Trey will fall in love with the show, and the pages start flowing,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething will happen. \u201d \u201cMember Berries\u201d was broadcast at 10 p. m. on Sept. 14, but hardly without   incident. That morning, South Park Studios suffered a system crash, and the episode\u2019s audio went missing for an hour and a half. When the episode was transmitted to Comedy Central, it had a mystery   sync problem that was finally fixed and delivered one hour before airtime. The following day, Ms. Garefino said, \u201cTrey\u2019s like, \u2018I think from now, we should think about getting the show in earlier. \u2019\u201d Even \u201cSouth Park\u201d would have to bleep out Ms. Garefino\u2019s response.'"}, "time": 1742628600.8874385}
