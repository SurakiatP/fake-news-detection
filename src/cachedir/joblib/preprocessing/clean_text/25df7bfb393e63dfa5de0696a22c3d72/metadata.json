[LaPierre made clear there would be no apologies for the smackdowns. Rather, he pointed out that one of the things the American people love about the NRA is the fact that the group speaks truth.  LaPierre said: For the last quarter of a century, in poll after poll, whether it\u2019s Gallup or NBC or The Wall Street Journal, Americans have said they view the NRA more favorably than both chambers of congress or either national political party  \u2026    . The majority of Americans admire and trust the NRA because we always say out loud what we believe. We speak the truth, even when it may be hard, and we fight like hell to defend it. In light of the NRA\u2019s voice for truth, Breitbart News pulled together eight   Amendment smackdowns, along with a bonus smackdown at the end. Most of the smackdowns require no commentary. Colonel Allen West  \u2014   West said, \u201cHere I stand as a son of Atlanta, a native Georgian, and a board member of the oldest civil rights organization that this country has ever known: the National Rifle Association. \u201d  Sheriff David Clarke \u2014  Clarke said: \u201cWe won a huge battle last November but we did not win the war. You see, our fight for freedom continues in earnest. You see, these rat bastards on the left never give up  \u2026    for them defeat is never final, election defeats don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s simply a time to regroup and continue their assault on our constitution, the rule of law, liberty, and American exceptionalism. \u201d Chris Cox  \u2014   Cox recounted a conversation he had with President Trump after the inauguration, saying, \u201c[It got so] ridiculous that the media, they were even lying about the number of people who watched [[President Trump\u2019s] inauguration. I told him that the only number that mattered was the number of people that watched Hillary Clinton\u2019s inauguration \u2014  ZERO!\u201d Senator Ted Cruz  \u2014   Cruz said, \u201cWhen the election results came in we heard a piercing wail of agony, as mainstream media reporters shrieked in horror because the American people had risen up and defied Washington, defied the mainstream media, defied pundits, and said, \u2018We will defend our constitution and we will defend our freedom. \u2019\u201d Wayne LaPierre  \u2014   After listing the mainstream media\u2019s failure to report the truth regarding the devious goals of Democrats and gun control groups around the country, LaPierre asked, \u201cWhen did the media stop being journalists and start becoming PR flacks for the destruction our country?\u201d President Donald Trump  \u2014   After recounting the way he ran and won on the Second Amendment with the NRA\u2019s endorsement, President Trump laughingly told the thousands of attendees at the Leadership Forum to be ready to be wooed by Democrats, \u201cI have a feeling that in the next election you\u2019ll be swamped with candidates, but you\u2019re not going to be wasting your time. You\u2019ll have plenty of those Democrats coming over and you\u2019ll say, \u2018No Thanks\u2019 or \u2018No Sir\u2019 \u2014  \u2018No Ma\u2019am\u2019 perhaps \u2018Ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2014  it may be Pocahontas, remember that. \u201d Amid applause Trump said, \u201cYou came through for me and I am going to come through for you. \u201d Chris Cox \u2014  Cox stressed that while Trump\u2019s election changed everything for   gun owners, it changed nothing for the media and Hollywood, And he made clear it didn\u2019t change gun controllers\u2019 determination either, saying, \u201cMichael Bloomberg, he\u2019s still short, rich, and angry. \u201d Colonel Allen West  \u2014   \u201cThe oldest civil right, the oldest individual right, the thing that enables us to be this great independent country, is that we will not become subjects, we will not let anyone take away our guns we will not allow anyone to subjugate us under a tyrannical rule. \u201d BONUS SMACKDOWN  \u2014   LaPierre said, \u201cBernie Sanders was not \u2018a movement,\u2019 as fawning media called his campaign. Bernie is a political predator of young voters who were lied to by school teachers and college professors\u201d \u2014  LaPierre said young voters were told \u201cfree, free, free, for me,\u201d but \u201cno one told the truth about how all that stuff was going to be paid for. \u201d Nevertheless, LaPierre made clear that the media was in on the play because socialism would have aided in the goal of disarming and enslaving the American people.
