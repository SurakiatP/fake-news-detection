Now, you may wonder why Hillary would be giving Michelle the spotlight at her own rally, but as it turns out, there\u2019s a very simple explanation: Michelle Obama is just so gosh-darn inspiring! \u201cSeriously, is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\u201d \u2014Hillary \\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 27, 2016 \\nSeriously, you guys. I get liking Michelle Obama, even admiring her. But the notion she\\'s off the charts inspiring is lost on me. https://t.co/TdGvODBQUu \\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) October 27, 2016 \\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s lost on a lot of other people, too: @JonahNRO @bennyjohnson can we honestly ask why she\\'s inspiring at all? What has she done that my wife couldn\\'t have given FLOTUS assets? \\n\u2014 Todd Lemmon (@toddlemmon) October 27, 2016 . @JonahNRO Michelle being the \"most inspiring person ever\" is like Clinton being the \"most qualified candidate ever\" \\n\u2014 Andrew Chouinard (@alchouin) October 27, 2016 \\nDid someone wipe Hillary\u2019s memory clean? Like, with a cloth? @JonahNRO @bennyjohnson the bar has been set really low this year \\n\u2014 John Allen (@JohnTAllen) October 27, 2016 \\nOK, fair enough. But still. It\u2019s not very hard to come up with a list of people more inspiring than Michelle Obama. @HillaryClinton yeah \u2026 how about the troops?'"}, "time": 1742561700.7720358}
