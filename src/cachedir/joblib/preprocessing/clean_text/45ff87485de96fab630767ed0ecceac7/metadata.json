But this is not the sharia of America. \u201d \u201cSharia is a set of legal rules that deal with a range of issues from the minutia of washing hands and feet to purify oneself before prayer to inheritance rules. It\u2019s also about spirituality,\u201d Uddin and Arastu wrote. Sharia Law is the brutal and often oppressive   islamic law, practiced, in varying degrees, in several   countries  \u2014   Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan. Such barbaric tenants of Shariah Law, including imprisonment or death for apostasy (abandoning Islam) mental and physical subjugation of women, and genital mutilation of girls are still practiced throughout the Muslim world.
