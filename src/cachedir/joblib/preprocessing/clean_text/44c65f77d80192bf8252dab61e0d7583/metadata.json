[Adams, who earned an MBA degree at UC Berkeley, announced that he is terminating his support of the public institution over concerns that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cfeel safe or welcome on campus. \u201d  Speaking of Hitler, I\u2019m ending my support of UC Berkeley, where I got my MBA years ago. I have been a big supporter lately, with both my time and money, but that ends today. I wish them well, but I wouldn\u2019t feel safe or welcome on the campus. A Berkeley professor made that clear to me recently. He seems smart, so I\u2019ll take his word for it. I\u2019ve decided to side with the Jewish gay immigrant who has an   boyfriend, not the hypnotized   in black masks who were clubbing people who hold different points of view. I feel that\u2019s reasonable, but I know many will disagree, and possibly try to club me to death if I walk on campus. Adams writes that a Berkeley professor \u201cmade it clear\u201d to him that he wouldn\u2019t be welcome on campus due to his political beliefs. In July 2016, Adams regularly placed a disclaimer at the bottom of his blog posts which claimed that his endorsement of Hillary Clinton was made out of concern for his personal safety. Note: I endorsed Hillary Clinton  \u2014   for my personal safety  \u2014   because I live in California. It isn\u2019t safe to be viewed as a Trump supporter where I live. My politics don\u2019t align with either candidate, but backing Clinton reduces my odds of dying at the hands of my fellow citizens. (And yes, I am 100% serious. It just happens to be funny by coincidence.) Adams frequently praised President Trump during his run for the White House and was one of the few public figures who predicted his victory.'"}, "time": 1742561771.113283}
