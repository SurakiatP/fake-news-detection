Suddenly, what was five would be three, reshaping the industry. But on Thursday, antitrust regulators said, Not so fast. United States Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced that the government had filed lawsuits to block the deals, between Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna. The proposed mergers, she said, \u201cwould leave much of the   health insurance industry in the hands of three mammoth insurance companies. \u201d \u201cIf these mergers were to take place, the competition among insurers that has pushed them to provide lower premiums,   care and better benefits would be eliminated,\u201d she said. The companies responded by vowing, in varying degrees, to fight the government\u2019s challenge. Aetna, which had hoped to gain an advantage by being the first to reach a deal, aggressively defended its proposed merger, which it contended was different from the larger   deal that followed. \u201cI like my chances in front of a judge,\u201d Mark T. Bertolini, chief executive of Aetna, said in an interview. In a statement, Anthem said the Justice Department\u2019s \u201caction is based on a flawed analysis and misunderstanding of the dynamic, competitive and highly regulated health care landscape. \u201d The company said it was \u201cfully committed\u201d to challenging the lawsuit. But Cigna, which has appeared to be a somewhat reluctant partner in the merger, said only that it was evaluating its options within the confines of the merger agreement but did not expect the transaction to close anytime soon, \u201cif at all. \u201d Anthem and Cigna declined to comment beyond their statements. The health insurers have been concerned for a few years about how the government would respond to consolidation. Anthem had mulled a merger with Cigna in 2014 but ultimately dropped the idea. They were forced to revive the combination after Humana put itself up for sale in early 2015 and \u201csparked a bidding frenzy in the industry,\u201d according to the government\u2019s lawsuit. The big five, including UnitedHealth Group, were desperate not to be left out of any potential  . After the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\u2019s signature piece of legislation, federal officials have kept a close eye on the sweeping changes taking place in health care. One of the major provisions of the federal law was to encourage more competition among insurers to provide people with more choices and more affordable policies. The health insurers were seeking to merge during an administration that has not been shy about quashing deals  \u2014   especially in health care. The government has blocked mergers among large hospital systems, as well as contributed to the scrapping of the $152 billion deal between Pfizer and Allergan for tax reasons. Large deals in the energy and retail industry were also abandoned this year over antitrust. If both health insurance deals are withdrawn, 2016 would set a record for the volume of abandoned deals, according to data from Dealogic. \u201cThe Obama administration has had robust antitrust enforcement in the realm of mergers, particularly in health care,\u201d said Matthew L. Cantor, a partner who focuses on antitrust issues at the law firm Constantine Cannon. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s going to attempt a horizontal merger should take note of that and particularly consider the antitrust merits of the deal. \u201d Mr. Bertolini of Aetna, however, had a much more skeptical view on Thursday. \u201cThere are a lot of politics in this,\u201d he said. From the moment they were announced, the proposed mergers were met with an outcry from critics, who said the deals would lead to higher prices for consumers and would stunt innovation by the companies. Congress held hearings, and there was a concerted push by consumer advocates and others to stop the mergers. \u201cThe level of consumer opposition was impressive,\u201d said David A. Balto, a lawyer and former antitrust official who helped lead the effort to oppose the mergers. Erik Gordon, a professor of business and law at the University of Michigan, said the lawsuits suggested that the Justice Department looked at the two mergers together in the context of the whole industry, instead of more specific markets, making it harder to justify both deals. Professor Gordon pointed to the broad statements about the health insurers contained in the suit, saying the government went beyond the typical legal arguments. It is the \u201cmost politicized antitrust case I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. The Justice Department declined to comment on whether there was any political aspect to their decisions. By looking at the deals in combination, the Justice Department makes a stronger case, said Thomas L. Greaney, the   of the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University and a former Justice Department lawyer. \u201cThere is a tactical advantage to having both cases go on at the same time,\u201d he said, adding that the case against one merger \u201cpoisons the other. \u201d The insurers may not have many options to push their deals through. At its news conference on Thursday, the Justice Department made it clear that the companies\u2019 proposals had not assuaged their concerns about competition. \u201cThere are some mergers that can be solved through divestitures, but we\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest they can,\u201d said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. As a result, the companies\u2019 best bet may be to persuade a federal judge that they should be viewed as very different in nature. The Aetna and Humana deal raises concerns largely in the private Medicare market. Those companies may have an easier time divesting themselves of assets to appease regulators. The larger deal, between Anthem and Cigna, is more vulnerable because of its size and overlap nationally, where large employers have fewer options when they pick plans for their workers. \u201cThere were substantial risks and they took risks,\u201d said Mr. Cantor of Constantine Cannon. \u201cThe risks were very real. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564134.6027272}
