[Johnstown Milliken School District Superintendent Martin Foster said the incident took place at Roosevelt High School in Johnstown during the Spanish class\u2019s celebration of Cinco de Mayo, CBS Denver reported.  \u201cThis was an incredibly disrespectful act that does not reflect the values of Roosevelt High School or the school district,\u201d Foster said in a statement. The teacher\u2019s name has not yet been released. Photos and video of the incident circulated on Facebook and Snapchat, offending many parents. \u201cHe\u2019s been defeated,\u201d read one caption of a Snapchat photo showing two students holding up the   pi\u00f1ata with Trump\u2019s face on it. One parent, Lesley Hollywood, posted the Snapchats to Facebook and shared her displeasure with the incident: \u201cIt is disturbing that this would be happening in a school setting,\u201d Hollywood told CBS Denver. \u201cWhy divide people? Why do this? There are so many other ways we can address politics in schools. \u201d Hollywood said that according to some of the students, the pi\u00f1ata also featured an image of Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t of cared if it was Obama\u2019s face on that pi\u00f1ata, or if it had been Hillary Clinton\u2019s face,\u201d Hollywood added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. This is not how we should be teaching our children politics in this country. \u201d KDVR reported that the district will launch an investigation starting Monday.'"}, "time": 1742561634.9490318}
