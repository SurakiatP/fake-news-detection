Partial transcript as follows: RADDATZ: Do you support president Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban from these predominantly Muslim countries. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL ( ) MAJORITY LEADER: Well, I think it\u2019s a good idea to tighten the vetting process. But I also think it\u2019s important to remember that some of our best sources in the war against radical Islamic terrorism are Muslims, both in this country and overseas. And we have had some difficulty in the past getting interpreters as you suggested in the earlier segment who are helpful to us treated properly. So we need to be careful as we do this. Improving vetting, something  \u2026     RADDATZ: And yet right now they\u2019re being detained so  \u2014   do you support this or not support this. MCCONNELL: It\u2019s hopefully going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far. I don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting. I think we need to be careful. We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country. RADDATZ: In the past, you\u2019ve called the Muslim ban completely and totally inconsistent with American values. The president says this is not an outright Muslim ban, even if this is temporary, how is this order consistent with American values? MCCONNELL: Well, if they\u2019re looking to tighten the vetting process, I mean who would be against that? But I am opposed to a religious tests. The courts are going to determine whether this is too broad. RADDATZ: So it sounds to me like you are opposed to certain parts of this. If we\u2019re detaining or holding back people who have helped Americans in the fight. MCCONNELL: Well, obviously I\u2019m against that. RADDATZ: A religious test then you\u2019re opposed to certain parts of this. MCCONNELL: Look, the president has a lot of latitude to try to secure the country. And I\u2019m not going to make a blanket criticism of this effort. However, I think it\u2019s important to remember, as I said, a lot of Muslims are our best sources in the war against terror. RADDATZ: So, do you think this will have blowback in the world? I mean, are you sensing that already? You\u2019ve seen the reactions. MCCONNELL: Yeah, well, we\u2019ll see. And it\u2019s important, however, to emphasize it\u2019s important to keep America as secure as possible and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. RADDATZ: Just tell me again how you would summarize what happened with this executive order. MCCONNELL: How I would summarize. RADDATZ: Yes, how would you  \u2014   what would you say about it? Others are saying it\u2019s devastating, others are saying it\u2019s  . MCCONNELL: Well, I\u2019m not saying either of those things, I\u2019m saying what I just said a few minutes ago, which is to the extent they\u2019re trying to improve the vetting process, I think that\u2019s in order. We need to bear in mind that we don\u2019t have religious tests in this country and we also need to remember that some of our best allies in the war against Islamic terrorism are Muslims.
