Mr. Pereira pulled out the sign from his suit jacket and, during a solo portion of the song, sang: \u201cWe\u2019re all brothers and sisters. All lives matter to the great. \u201d The traditional lyrics at that point in the anthem are: \u201cWith glowing hearts we see thee rise. The True North strong and free. \u201d The other members of the group  \u2014   Clifton Murray, Fraser Walters and Victor Micallef  \u2014   said later they were \u201cshocked and embarrassed\u201d by the actions of Mr. Pereira, whom they described in a statement as being a \u201clone wolf. \u201d They added that his stunt was \u201cextremely selfish\u201d and that he would not be performing with the group until further notice. \u201cOur sincere apologies and regrets go out to everybody who witnessed this shameful act, to our fellow Canadians, to Major League Baseball, to our friends, families, fans and to all those affected,\u201d the statement said. \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d was written on the back of Mr. Pereira\u2019s sign, The Associated Press reported. Major League Baseball had no idea Mr. Pereira planned to make a political statement, a spokesman, Matt Bourne, said. The episode happened against a backdrop of heightened racial tensions in the United States. Last week, two black men were killed in separate police   shootings and five police officers in Dallas were shot and killed by a black man who the authorities said was targeting white officers in retribution. \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d is a statement frequently delivered in response to \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d which has been used by activists to call attention to police shootings. The Canadian anthem was not broadcast live on American television, but it aired in Canada. At the stadium, fans reacted with surprise when Mr. Pereira\u2019s sign was broadcast on the scoreboard. But that was nothing compared with the fury that appeared on Twitter: The Tenors were formed in 2007 and have performed more than 500 concerts on five continents and have made over 150 television appearances, according to the group\u2019s biography. The singers appeared at the 2010 Olympic opening ceremony in Vancouver and with artists including Andrea Bocelli, Sting and Elton John. While the change in the anthem\u2019s lyrics was widely criticized, some on Twitter found room for humor:'"}, "time": 1742564510.6451344}
