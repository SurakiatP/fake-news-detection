[Make that the Boring Machine, monikered Godot, a reference to a mysterious character that never appears in a Samuel Beckett play called \u201cWaiting for Godot. \u201d  Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, announced last week that his new venture is ready for its first project. The Boring Company will be creating a network of underground tunnels connecting Los Angeles International Airport and L. A.\u2019s westside neighborhoods: First tunnel for The Boring Company begins   \u2026     Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to  \u2026     https:  .   \u2014   Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2017,  \u201cFirst tunnel for The Boring Company begins   \u2026     Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to Culver City, Santa Monica, Westwood and Sherman Oaks. Future tunnels will cover all of greater LA,\u201d Musk wrote in his Instagram account. After completion, cars may be loaded onto a   \u201celectric sled,\u201d which would allow a vehicle to be transported from \u201cWestwood to LAX in 5 minutes,\u201d according to Musk. To those unfamiliar with Los Angeles, the most congested city in the U. S. (according to Forbes) a typical drive between LAX and Westwood takes about 30 minutes. It\u2019s not unusual to take an hour or more to traverse those 10 miles on the 405 Freeway during heavy traffic hours. Musk posted a video of a test run on the sled inside the nearly   experimental Hyperloop   tunnel he had built outside SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, just south of LAX: [Warning, this may cause motion sickness or seizures]This is a test run of our electric sled  \u2026     https:  .   \u2014   Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2017,  There is no word yet on when the project will officially start or be completed. But for Angelenos perpetually stuck in traffic, this could be the best news until flying cars come along. (Then again, if you have to wait a long time in line to get on the sled  \u2026     but we\u2019re way ahead of ourselves now.)
