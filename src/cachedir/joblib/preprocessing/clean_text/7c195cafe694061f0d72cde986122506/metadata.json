There were approximately 1, 700 people at the rally, the local newspaper reported.  An imam was said to have told the group, \u201cWe will continue to live without fear.

The Morning News reported that a wife of a legal immigrant, Brooke Wang of nearby Plano, Texas, said she was there to show support for the president. \u201cWe are just for legal immigration   \u2026     We want people to come here legally. \u201d Wang\u2019s husband is a legal permanent resident who emigrated from China. She sported a \u201c2016 Trump for President\u201d   and was carrying an assault weapon. Wang and others at the march took the opportunity to not only support the president and his immigration policies, but to exercise their constitutional right to carry arms. The march in Dallas followed protests at schools in the city, and in Austin, Texas, and the #DayWithoutImmigrants.  There\u2019s a #protest at #Dallas #TX in my school. #AntiTrump pic. twitter.   \u2014   \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Nick Wilde\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd (@9NickPWilde9) February 17, 2017,  As reported by Breitbart Texas\u2019 Bob Price: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are continuing to defend themselves against the national media which continues to mischaracterize the role and intent of the   of criminal aliens. Media reports have called the Operation Cross Check arrests of criminal aliens a   effort by ICE officials and the Trump Administration, despite the fact that this operation has been carried out in the past. More than 2, 000 criminal aliens were rounded up in March 2015, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. The nearly 700 arrests in last week\u2019s operation pales in comparison, yet the mainstream media appears to have lost total perspective in its attacks on the men and women tasked to protect our nation from these criminals. As reported by Breitbart News, the #DayWithoutImmigrants was \u201ca political dud\u201d however, some who decided to skip work, including those who did not show up in order to protest were fired.
