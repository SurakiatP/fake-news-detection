[Writing in USA Today, Cox pointed to the nomination and confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Jeff Sessions to attorney general, and Ryan Zinke to secretary of the Interior.  The confirmation of Gorsuch means that \u201cwe are now back to having a     majority on the U. S. Supreme Court\u201d and upholding the crucial decision in District of Columbia v Heller (2008). Sessions\u2019 confirmation means \u201cthe Department of Justice will return to focusing on prosecuting violent criminals instead of targeting   gun owners. \u201d And the confirmation of Zinke as secretary of the Interior means \u201chunting and shooting\u201d opportunities on our public lands will be protected. In addition to these nominations and confirmations, Cox points out that Trump has repealed Obama\u2019s Social Security gun ban, a ban which would have allowed the Social Security Administration to strip elderly beneficiaries of their Second Amendment rights without due process. Cox pointed out that more must be done. For example, the gun ban for military veterans needs to be repealed, national reciprocity for concealed carry needs to become law, and firearm suppressors need to be deregulated via the Hearing Protection Act. Yet the   successes of Trump\u2019s first 100 days suggest the remaining   Amendment proposals will also succeed. Cox wrote, \u201cAfter eight long years, we once again have a president who respects and cherishes individual freedom. For America\u2019s   gun owners, the Trump administration is proving to be among the best in history. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
