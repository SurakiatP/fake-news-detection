Democrats, after lavishing Comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an \u201cimpartial\u201d way, have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the 2016 election cycle with Hillary herself describing his recent actions as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d. Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Comey\u2019s recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to Clinton staffers. \\nAccording to the Daily Mail , and a source close to James Comey, the decision, at least in part, came after he \u201ccould no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI\u201d who \u201cfelt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\u201d \\nJames Comey\u2019s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \\n\u2018The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\u2019 said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \\n\u2018Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\u2019 said the source. \u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\u2019 \\nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \\nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. \\n\u2018The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,\u2019 the source continued. \u2018And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. \\nThough we\u2019re sure there are many facets behind Comey\u2019s decision making process, we can all be quite certain, at this point, that he\u2019s not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in Washington, both in law enforcement and in both political parties. In fact, after Tim Kaine just last week praised Comey as a \u201cwonderful\u201d career public servant with the \u201chighest standards of integrity\u201d \u2026.
