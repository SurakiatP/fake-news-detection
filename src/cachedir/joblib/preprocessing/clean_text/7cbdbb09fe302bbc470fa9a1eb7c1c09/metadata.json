Now advocates for legal marijuana are looking to New England, hoping this part of the country will open a new front in their efforts to expand legalization nationwide. But this largely liberal region is struggling with the devastating effect of opiate abuse, which is disrupting families, taxing law enforcement agencies and taking lives. And many lawmakers and public officials are balking at the idea of legalizing a banned substance, citing potential social costs. \u201cThe shadow of the heroin epidemic is something that people think about when they think about the legalization, and they ask themselves, \u2018Are we sending the right message about legalization?\u2019 \u201d said Shap Smith, the speaker of the House in Vermont, who is open to legalizing marijuana. \u201cI think in the public\u2019s mind, it\u2019s making passage of this bill more difficult. \u201d A Vermont bill supported by Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, and approved by the State Senate in February would create a regulated market for recreational marijuana in this deeply progressive state  \u2014   the cradle of Phish and New England\u2019s proud hippie haven. But the bill is hobbling through the House, where it was stripped this month of the parts that would allow legalization. As of Friday, it contains only a cautious provision to allow   and legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana  \u2014   well short of the regulated market that Mr. Shumlin has called for. Lawmakers\u2019 largest concerns are those that have emerged in state after state as the legalization movement has taken off: use and abuse by young people, impaired driving and commercialization. But the opiate crisis, in which heroin, fentanyl and other drugs have killed more than 2, 000 people in New England in the last year, is a substantial stumbling block, complicating efforts throughout the region and figuring into   political alliances. \u201cAt a time when we are trying and working so desperately hard to get help to those who need it, telling young people to not do drugs, trying to eliminate some of the barriers to treatment and to promote recovery, this effort at legalization seems to be directly at odds with those efforts,\u201d said Maura Healey, the attorney general in Massachusetts and a Democrat, who opposes an initiative that is expected to land on the ballot in November. It would allow adults to possess up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home, permit edibles and create a regulated market. Advocates are using the heroin crisis as an argument in favor of legalization, saying that it would move the substance out of the hands of traffickers and that it \u201cwould reduce the amount of interaction with hard drug dealers, period,\u201d said Matt Simon, the New England political director of the Marijuana Policy Project, a national organization working on legalization. National advocates of legalization hope that with New England, they can find success in a new part of the country. \u201cOne part of it is demonstrating quite powerfully that marijuana reform is not just a West Coast phenomenon it\u2019s also an East Coast one,\u201d said Ethan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. But the future of the Vermont bill is unclear. A bid to place a proposal on the ballot in Massachusetts is opposed by the state\u2019s most powerful politicians a ballot question in Maine was held up by the secretary of state (although it may have new life) and officials in Rhode Island are moving slowly, partly to see what happens with their fellow New Englanders. \u201cI think if there was any motion in any state in the Northeast, Rhode Island would take it up very quickly,\u201d said State Senator Joshua Miller, a sponsor of a bill there that would legalize marijuana. The heroin epidemic was at the center of debate in Massachusetts last week, when a coalition of state leaders  \u2014   including Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, and Speaker Robert A. DeLeo of the House, a Democrat  \u2014   announced a campaign against the initiative. An analysis last month by WBUR, a public radio station in Boston, noted that all 85   ballot questions in Massachusetts\u2019s history had passed, and public opinion could well favor legalization this time around, too. But in a statement, Mr. Baker argued that legalization would \u201cthreaten to reverse progress combating the growing opioid epidemic so this industry can rake in millions in profits. \u201d The coalition also has the support of Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston, a recovering alcoholic who is widely admired for his outspokenness about substance abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a personal issue,\u201d Mr. Walsh said in an interview. \u201cI have too many people that I know that started their addiction road by smoking marijuana. \u201d The Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol responded on Friday by highlighting Mr. Baker\u2019s and Mr. Walsh\u2019s support of policies that would loosen liquor regulations  \u2014   although a graphic of the men with a speech bubble saying \u201cDrink More Alcohol\u201d was criticized as insensitive to Mr. Walsh. The groups said opponents of legalization were unfairly conflating heroin and marijuana. \u201cThere is no more evidence that using marijuana leads to heroin than there is that riding a tricycle leads to joining the Hells Angels,\u201d Jim Borghesani, the campaign\u2019s communications director, said in a statement. In states that have legalized marijuana, voters, not lawmakers, made the decision. That could become the case in Maine, which has a libertarian streak and began decriminalizing marijuana decades ago. A proposed ballot initiative there was halted when the secretary of state invalidated thousands of signatures, but it was recently granted a new review. If that initiative makes the ballot, \u201cI think they\u2019ve probably got a relatively good chance of passage,\u201d said Mark Brewer, a political scientist at the University of Maine. Health officials in that state are considering whether to make opiate addiction a qualifying condition for the use of medical marijuana. On Tuesday, Maine\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services heard testimony from advocates who said marijuana could help treat opiate withdrawal, and from experts who disagreed. Vermont does not have a referendum process, and that has made the state a test case for legislative approval. Mr. Shumlin, who is in his final term, said a carefully constructed bill legalizing marijuana could raise tax dollars that could be used to combat substance abuse and improve public safety. \u201cIf Vermont really is the first state that writes a cautious, sensible bill that\u2019s adopted through a legislative process and signed by a governor, that would be a big deal,\u201d Mr. Shumlin said in an interview. \u201cIt would be a big step forward for legalization. \u201d Many law enforcement officials are opposed. \u201cAll assets  \u2014   whether it be rehabilitation, medical, law enforcement  \u2014   we should be focusing our assets on opiate addiction,\u201d said George Merkel, the police chief in Vergennes and the president of the Vermont Police Association. \u201cThat\u2019s a reason not to legalize marijuana, because it\u2019s going to make things even worse. \u201d The bill advanced on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee in Vermont would create permits for residents to grow marijuana for personal use, but it would not legalize the sale of the drug. In a statement, Mr. Shumlin welcomed the development. \u201cThe committee\u2019s action today takes a step towards addressing the nonsensical system that asks the one in eight Vermonters who admit to using marijuana on a monthly basis to buy it from a drug dealer,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628449.1417048}
