Ms. Romingquet knew Ms. Kershaw, one of her closest friends, had been there that night and had planned to join the group in the mountains. But it was not to be. \u201cShe really was the best of humans,\u201d Ms. Romingquet said in a telephone interview, reflecting on her friendship with Ms. Kershaw, whom she had first met on a dance floor in 2009.
