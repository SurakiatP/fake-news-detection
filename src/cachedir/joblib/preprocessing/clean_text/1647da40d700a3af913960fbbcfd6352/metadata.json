Much of the cast had scant acting experience. The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen. Just a decade earlier, its writer and director, Luis Valdez, was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California. But audiences kept coming, and coming, selling out show after packed show. Fans came one week and returned with their families the next Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times. After running for 11 months to   audiences, first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, \u201cZoot Suit\u201d moved to New York\u2019s Winter Garden in 1979, where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway. Mr. Valdez then directed a   version, which was released in 1982. \u201cWe had no idea any of this would happen, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like this huge explosion. \u201d On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of \u201cZoot Suit\u201d begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theater\u2019s   season. A fantastical reimagining of the   Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, \u201cZoot Suit\u201d features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache) and \u201cThe Press,\u201d a barking headline made flesh. The show is both a homecoming and a reunion. Four decades after its world premiere, Mr. Valdez, who is 76, is back as director. Daniel Valdez (Luis\u2019s brother) and Rose Portillo, who in 1978 portrayed Henry Reyna and Della Barrios, the young lovers at the heart of the play, this time around play Henry\u2019s parents. \u201cI got kind of choked up the first time I heard those words all over again,\u201d Daniel Valdez said. \u201cComing back to it is a little like coming home. \u201d In the intervening years, Latino playwrights, from Cherrie Moraga to Luis Alfaro, have made their mark on American theater. Karen Zacarias started the Young Playwrights\u2019 Theater in 1995 in 2003, Nilo Cruz became the first Latino to win a Pulitzer for drama. Then there\u2019s   Miranda. But no other Latino play has had the cultural impact of \u201cZoot Suit,\u201d not to mention its influence on generations of subsequent Latino playwrights. On a recent morning, the cast rehearsed a scene set in a Los Angeles dance hall. Several men wore   trousers, long watch chains dangling from their belts the women sported   tights and sneakers. The men were strutting, the women spinning, but when a rival gang arrived, colorful curses flew, then fists, and before you knew it, the switchblades were out. El Pachuco snapped his fingers, stopping time just as Henry was about to cut his rival\u2019s throat. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the play needs right now,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo more Mexicans killing each other. \u201d The relevance of this scene in the Trump era isn\u2019t lost on the cast and crew. Much of the play focuses on how   are vilified in the United States as violent criminals and perpetual outsiders  \u2014   \u201cthis ain\u2019t your country,\u201d El Pachuco tells Henry early on. \u201cThat was part of the reason I felt that I had to be in this production,\u201d said Demi\u00e1n Bichir, the   actor who plays El Pachuco. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a better opportunity for the arts to respond to so much nonsense and ignorance and stupidity. \u201d (When not acting, Mr. Bichir, who is Mexican, is an American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador for immigration rights.) For Luis Valdez, mixing the political and the theatrical is nothing new. Dressed all in black, his voice a rich baritone, he recalled the years that led up to \u201cZoot Suit. \u201d In 1965, he founded El Teatro Campesino, a theater troupe and \u201ccultural arm\u201d of Cesar Chavez\u2019s United Farm Workers. The group staged   skits, which he wrote and directed, in halls and on the backs of flatbed trucks. After the troupe left the farm workers\u2019 group in 1967, Mr. Valdez continued to write plays that examined the Chicano experience, including \u201cBandito!\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Have to Show You No Stinking Badges!\u201d \u201cI call him the father of contemporary Chicano theater,\u201d said Jorge Huerta, who wrote the book \u201cChicano Theater: Themes and Forms. \u201d \u201cNot only did he found the Teatro Campesino, the teatro inspired other teatros, an entire movement from the West Coast to the Midwest all the way to the Dakotas. \u201d In 1977, Mr. Valdez met with Gordon Davidson, who was the director of the Taper then, about creating something for its New Theater for Now series. He arrived clutching a pamphlet about the Sleepy Lagoon murder that he had gotten years earlier from David Sanchez, the founder of the   organization the Brown Berets. \u201cHe essentially gave me carte blanche,\u201d he said. Mr. Valdez set to work on the play, combining elements of Aztec mythology (Tezcatlipoca\u2019s    colors, for example, mirror El Pachuco\u2019s zoot suit) prison letters from the defendants culled from U. C. L. A. Library\u2019s special collections department and court transcripts. In one courtroom sequence from the 1982 film, a police officer testifies that pachucos have an \u201cinborn\u201d tendency for violence inherited from \u201cthe bloodthirsty Aztecs. \u201d \u201cI took that from the transcripts,\u201d Mr. Valdez said. \u201cI didn\u2019t invent that stuff. That wasn\u2019t agitprop. \u201d \u201cThe Second Zoot Suit Riot begins,\u201d an ad in a local newspaper declared in 1978. \u201cThat was probably hatched right here in this office,\u201d Mr. Valdez laughed. \u201cBut there was a rush for tickets, so in that sense, it was a riot. A good riot. An artistic riot. \u201d The play helped start the career of Edward James Olmos, who played El Pachuco in Los Angeles and on Broadway, as well as in the film. Mr. Valdez soon shifted his focus to movies as well  \u2014   his 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic \u201cLa Bamba\u201d was both a critical and   hit  \u2014   but he\u2019s still best known for \u201cZoot Suit,\u201d which broke Los Angeles theater records for ticket sales during its first run. The Taper, which also hosted the world premiere productions of \u201cAngels in America\u201d and \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d hopes to create a similar buzz this time around. Univision and Hoy sponsored a party at the theater to celebrate the first day of ticket sales, complete with   dancers and live swing music. The AltaMed Art Collection in Los Angeles is lending art that will be on display in the theater lobby. Strong sales have prompted the Taper to extend the show\u2019s   run another week, through March 19 even after adding the additional shows, 35 high school groups remain on a waiting list to see special student matinees. \u201cWe do   shows a year, and you can feel the excitement among the staff about having this show rehearse in our building,\u201d said Michael Ritchie, artistic director of the Center Theater Group, which includes the Taper. \u201cYou can feel the buzz in the hallways. \u201d Those hallways aren\u2019t far from many places, historic and infamous, brought to life in the play. Los Angeles\u2019s Hall of Justice, where the young men were tried and convicted, is two blocks away flash points of the riots erupted in the area. \u201cSome of the riots actually took place very near where we\u2019re rehearsing,\u201d Daniel Valdez said. \u201cTemple and Main, right down the street. \u201d A big difference between this production and the 1978 one is the level of the cast\u2019s experience. \u201cIn those days, there weren\u2019t many Latinos looking for a career in theater, so we were working with a lot of   actors,\u201d Daniel Valdez added. \u201cWe had people who had never really been onstage. Now, watching the casting calls and the dance auditions, they\u2019re absolutely amazing. \u201d The nationwide call drew 800 actors for 25 parts, and most cast members have backgrounds in film and TV. Mr. Bichir (\u201cThe Hateful Eight,\u201d \u201cWeeds\u201d) a star in his native Mexico before coming to Los Angeles, was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the 2011 film \u201cA Better Life\u201d Jeanine Mason, a   actor and dancer from Miami who plays Della, was the youngest competitor to win the Fox series \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance. \u201d Though the play was written in 1978 and set in 1942, Mr. Valdez feels its story is timeless, its themes part of an   historical cycle. He traces lines from the   internment camps to the Zoot Suit Riots, from Black Lives Matter to the vilification of Muslims. \u201cAnd now the Mexicans are getting it again, thanks to Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the closing of a complete circle. \u201d At a table reading between dance rehearsals, Mr. Bichir and Tom G. McMahon had questions for Mr. Valdez about how to tackle their roles as El Pachuco and the Press. In many ways, they\u2019re more archetypes than people, jumping in and out of the action at will. The challenge, Mr. Valdez said, is finding the human in the trickster spirit. The play presents lots of similar challenges for audiences. \u201cMy play has the same relationship to a normal realistic play as a zoot suit has to a normal suit,\u201d Mr. Valdez said. \u201cIt\u2019s different. The lengths are longer. There\u2019s more fabric. But it\u2019s very cool! And I think that\u2019s part of the appeal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564500.1468217}
