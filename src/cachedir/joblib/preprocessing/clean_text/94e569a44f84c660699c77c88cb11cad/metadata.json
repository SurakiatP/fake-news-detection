It was early afternoon on a Tuesday, but the muscles in his jaw were slack, his blue eyes vague. He spoke with quiet urgency, his words faintly misshapen, and when he gestured for emphasis, he didn\u2019t seem to notice that his hands were right in my face. The sober boundaries of social behavior had dissolved, abruptly, in an alcoholic haze. That was the idea, of course. Perched in the window of an espresso bar on West 47th Street, drinking nothing stronger than a cortado, Mr. Roxburgh, 55, was demonstrating a   skill: playing drunk. \u201cIn terms of the study of alcohol and its effects, I probably have an unfair advantage in that I am, A, Australian, and, B, an actor,\u201d he said, his eyes perfectly clear now, glinting with humor. \u201cI\u2019ve had probably an unhealthy overexposure to the shenanigans of booze over time. \u201d If so, he\u2019s putting it to good use. Through March 19 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, he\u2019s starring opposite Cate Blanchett in \u201cThe Present,\u201d a Chekhov adaptation that floats along on a vodka tide, gradually snaring his character, Mikhail, in the undertow. (It does not help that Mikhail downs a whole bottle of the stuff in Act III.) Back home, on the Australian television series \u201cRake,\u201d Mr. Roxburgh has spent several seasons playing a different sort of alcoholic, a lawyer determined even in middle age to keep the party going. Performing drunkenness requires striking what is, for many actors, an elusive balance  \u2014   somewhere between sloshy and straight. \u201cSeeing bad drunk acting is probably like watching an actor trying to squeeze out tears,\u201d Mr. Roxburgh said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of     excruciating. \u201d This is his advice for getting it right. \u201cThat would be my first question always: Why are you doing it?\u201d Mr. Roxburgh said. \u201cBecause we all do it for a reason. \u201d How to play the character, and the drunkenness, depends in part on the answer. \u201cA lot of what I do is instinctual in a way,\u201d Mr. Roxburgh said, \u201cand it\u2019s based on observations that I made over a life of being surrounded by Australian actors, and stealing from it. \u201d Well, that and muscle memory a family man these days, he drinks less than he used to. But he\u2019s familiar with the moment when a pleasant buzz gives way to a loss of control, and he recognizes the difference between sanguine drunks and the darker sorts, like Mikhail, whose vodka demons keep him company. Mr. Roxburgh stood up, planting his feet some distance apart. \u201cThere\u2019s a stance that might happen at a certain point, which is a kind of slightly wider leg stance. If your legs are together, your center of gravity is a much more dangerous element, and you will literally fall over. A very drunk person, the room is doing this for them,\u201d he said, tilting his arms from one side to another. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they\u2019re on a ship at sea. \u201d That doesn\u2019t mean they will lurch or clutch, but they might rest a hand on a chair, \u201cjust for a little bit of support,\u201d a fixed point of physical reference. \u201cThe more you try and stand up straight, there\u2019s always a part of you that has to know the world is spinning. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s also a very subtle kind of tipping that might happen in the body,\u201d Mr. Roxburgh said, and as he leaned, his eyes clouded over. For a moment, he might have been utterly wasted. \u201cAnother element is the gaze, which is that famous   thing where somebody is talking to you, but they\u2019re not quite there. The world is bleary to them, and your face at a certain point becomes, to all intents and purposes, pixelated. So they\u2019re not looking with any clarity into your eyes. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating reading things like the police studies into blood alcohol levels and what they actually do to your response times\u201d behind the wheel, Mr. Roxburgh said. \u201cThe same thing obviously applies in terms of your conversation, your responses, the way you inhale and feed out information just in the normal sense of conversation when you\u2019re drunk. \u201cBut it can be very subtle stuff, I suppose the way you might slightly stutter on a word or rethink the way that you\u2019re going to go into a sentence. It blocks clear thinking that\u2019s a fact. \u201d Counterintuitive, yes, but Mr. Roxburgh was adamant that this is an essential part of playing drunk: struggling against the sloppier effects of inebriation rather than giving in to them. \u201cRemember that the person that you\u2019re playing almost invariably doesn\u2019t want to appear drunk,\u201d he said. \u201cIn bad drunk acting, you see somebody wobbling around all over the place and slurring their words in a very overt way. \u201d In the real world, though, the   try to get their minds and bodies to obey the normal rules: speaking clearly, making sense, not falling over. And it\u2019s precisely that extra focus that can give their game away. The more determined they are not to seem drunk, Mr. Roxburgh said, the more clearly drunk they will seem.'"}, "time": 1742563246.975782}
