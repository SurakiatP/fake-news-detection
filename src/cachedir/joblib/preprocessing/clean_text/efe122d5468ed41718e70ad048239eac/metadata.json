Signs of friction threatened to undercut a deal between Ted Cruz and John Kasich to coordinate against Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is expected to dominate in Tuesday\u2019s primaries in five northeastern states, but his delegate count could fall short if he loses in Indiana next week, allowing the rivals to fight it out at the convention. Polls show Bernie Sanders gaining on Hillary Clinton in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Indiana, though she appears ahead in Pennsylvania and Maryland. _____ 2. President Obama, wrapping up a   trip to Europe, said he would send 250 more U. S. military personnel to Syria to help local forces fight the Islamic State. Addressing Europe\u2019s economic and migration problems, he appeared to refer to Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive politics. Mr. Obama said challenging conditions opened the door to \u201cthose who would try to exploit those fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way. \u201d _____ 3. The family of Tamir Rice, the    fatally shot by the Cleveland police in 2014, is set to receive $6 million if a court approves. It\u2019s the latest in a series of   settlements made by major cities over the deaths of   at the hands of the police. _____ 4. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s surprise album, \u201cLemonade,\u201d and an accompanying video focus on the harm men have done to black women, insinuated that her husband, Jay Z, had an affair. (Above, the couple last year.) Her admirers  \u2014   the Beyhive  \u2014   took the other woman identified in song as \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d to be the designer Rachel Roy. But, oops, some accidentally exacted their social media revenge on the Food Network star Rachael Ray. (Also oops, we spelled her name Rachel earlier.) _____ 5. Tough news for the Golden State Warriors. Stephen Curry is likely to be out for at least two weeks because of a sprained right knee. The king of   will miss, at minimum, the start of the second round of the N. B. A. playoffs. He took a positive tone on Twitter: \u201cThanks 4 all the prayers  messages. Can feel all the positive energy. God is Great! All things considered I\u2019m Gonna be alright!\u201d _____ 6. Football made headlines off the field. A U. S. appeals court reinstated Tom Brady\u2019s   suspension in the Deflategate case, agreeing that the N. F. L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, had broad discretion to suspend players. And Johnny Manziel, the      quarterback, pictured above in December, was indicted on a misdemeanor assault charge. Commentary on his fall, our reporter says, exposes \u201cthe underbelly of fandom. \u201d _____ 7. At North Carolina\u2019s statehouse, supporters and critics held battling protests over a law blocking protections for gay people and limiting transgender people\u2019s bathroom access. _____ 8. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a \u201croad map for  \u201d to help those leaving prison stay out. The plan includes a federal focus on job training and substance abuse treatment before release, and closer monitoring after. And Ms. Lynch urged states to allow the newly released to trade their prisoner IDs for   IDs. Above, an auto repair training shop at the Louisiana state penitentiary in Angola. _____ 9. An international panel\u2019s  report on 43 missing Mexican students reverberated through the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The students had been engaged in a night of confrontation with the police that turned unexpectedly violent before they disappeared, the report said, countering the official narrative that they fell victim to a drug gang. _____ 10. China halted plans for    power stations in many parts of the country after signing the Paris climate accord. That means about planned 200 plants, with a combined generating capacity of 105 gigawatts, may not be built. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of power,\u201d a coal specialist said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot of power. \u201d _____ 11. Finally, meet a few of the dwindling population of the world\u2019s largest primate, Grauer\u2019s gorilla. Conservationists say years of conflict in the jungles of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have eased, enabling them to make a head count that confirmed their fears. With fewer than 3, 800 remaining, extinction is possible. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
