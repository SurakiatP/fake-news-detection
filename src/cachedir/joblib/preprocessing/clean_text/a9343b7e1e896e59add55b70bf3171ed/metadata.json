He also urged Congress to act to abolish the independent counsel established by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged ties between the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Gingrich told host John Catsimatidis, \u201cThe more amazing thing I thought that Comey did that I think is going to have a lot of repercussions is Comey admitted publicly, in fact, boasted about it, that he had deliberately leaked   \u2026     in order to set up the pressure to get a special, independent counsel. And I think that is an astonishing statement. \u201d \u201c[I]t\u2019s very clear that Comey hates Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think Congress should now intervene and should abolish the independent counsel because Comey makes so clear that it\u2019s the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking to the New York Times to deliberately set up this particular situation. I think it is very sick. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562162.917717}
