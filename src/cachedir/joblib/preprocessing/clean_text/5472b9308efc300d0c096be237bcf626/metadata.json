Beth Moore, well-known false teacher and false New Age prophet, has decided that this is the person we need in the White House. Let that sink in for a moment. By supporting HIllary Clinton Beth Moore will be working to increase, fund, guarantee and protect abortion in America. Hillary Clinton OK With Abortion Day Before Birth: \\nBeth Moore suggested that Trump\u2019s words from 11 years ago highlight how men are \u201cobjectifying\u201d women today, and she made clear that she will not support Trump over it. She issued a number of tweets on the topic, not one of which criticized Hillary Clinton for the way she has treated the women who allege Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them \u2014 women like Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick, the latter of whom recently recounted the way Bill Clinton allegedly raped her. False teachers Beth Moore and Joyce Meyer promoting unbiblical unity: \\nThe Daily Mail reported that \u201cJones reached an out of court settlement\u201d in a suit wherein she alleged that Bill, while Governor of Arkansas, dropped his pants and asked her \u201c to kiss it .\u201d Beth Moore False Vision: \\nWhat does a false teacher and false prophet sound like? It sounds exactly like this\u2026. \\nTrump stood up for these women , holding a press conference with them on Sunday as a way of breaking through the mainstream media\u2019s refusal to report on Bill\u2019s sexual history and Hillary\u2019s efforts to undermine that history. Heretofore, Hillary\u2019s canned response to Bill\u2019s accusers has been to go after the women. In fact, she has gone after the women with such fervor that the Washington Post recently asked if Hillary was Bill\u2019s \u201cenabler\u201d? Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump spar over partial-birth abortion during third debate: \\nThe Post reported : \\n\u2026 Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers \u201csome failed cabaret singer who doesn\u2019t even have much of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to fall back on.\u201d She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, \u201cI mean, I would crucify her.\u201d \\nTrump brought a small number of women from Bill\u2019s past to the October 9 presidential debate, where he pointed out that they should be honored for standing up, rather than humiliated. Politico published the transcript of Trump looking at Bill\u2019s accusers, then saying: \\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women, and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight \u2026 So don\u2019t tell me about words. I am, absolutely, I apologize for those words, but it is things that people say, but what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones who is also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. \\nYet Christian speaker Beth Beth Moore focused her attention on Trump. In an October 9 tweet, Moore said , \u201cI\u2019m one among many women sexually abused, misused, stared down, heckled, talked naughty to. Like we liked it. We didn\u2019t. We\u2019re tired of it.\u201d \\nIn another tweet on the same day, Moore criticized evangelicals who continue to stand with Trump: \u201cTry to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big a deal.\u201d \\nIt would be interesting to ask Monica Lewinsky , Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick which was most painful, words that Trump spoke 11 years ago \u2014 and subsequently apologized for \u2014 or Bill Clinton\u2019s actions and alleged actions, combined with Hillary Clinton\u2019s treatment of women who dared to speak up? source \\n\u201cAnd I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\u201d Revelation 18:4 (KJV) \\nGeoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
