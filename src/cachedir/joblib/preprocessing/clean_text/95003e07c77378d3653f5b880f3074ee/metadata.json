[His comments came in response to the release of a film, \u201cStranger Fruit,\u201d during Austin, Texas\u2019 South by Southwest Film Festival. The film reportedly reveals new video footage taken from a market in Ferguson Michael Brown was accused of robbing, CNN reported. Director Jason Pollock claims Brown did not rob the store as widely reported, but was simply picking up some cigarillos the clerks had given him in exchange for marijuana.  The film\u2019s producers accuse the City of Ferguson of hiding this video and only releasing the later video with claims Brown was robbing the store. \u201cMaybe the City of Ferguson wouldn\u2019t have gotten tore up like that,\u201d Michael Brown Sr. said during a press conference about the video. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they asked for it, if you ask me, for not keeping no truth in there. \u201d Ferguson police responded to the claim by the senior Brown, stating that Michael Brown was not initially stopped in connection with the incident at the store. He was stopped for walking in the middle of the road, CNN stated. The riots that erupted following the shooting death of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer had nothing to do with anything that happened at the store, or even the facts of Brown\u2019s encounter with the police officer. Rather, the riots broke out following a false \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d narrative put forward by politically motivated activists. The riots were further fueled by the Obama Administration\u2019s fanning the flames with rhetoric that supported the false narrative, Breitbart News reported in 2015. \u201cNow the campaign of terror against police has come back to where the great lie started. Obama and Holder will not finish until they have destroyed Ferguson \u2014  destroyed it, in the   parlance of the Vietnam era, in order to save it, razed it to rebuild it in the stylized image of Selma 1965, razed it in order to fit the delusions of an Attorney General who thinks we have made no progress since the era of Malcolm X and a President who once promised \u2014  incredibly! \u2014  to unite America,\u201d Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollock wrote at the time. Breitbart News reported extensively on the aftermath of the shooting in Ferguson and the subsequent riots and political chaos that arose over the next several months. The release of the new video sparked a new round of protests in Ferguson over the weekend, CNN reported. During a protest Sunday night, a Ferguson police officer\u2019s nose was broken after a female protester punched him in the face. Brandon Darby contributed to this report.
