[According to AdWeek\u2018s TVNewser, which first broke the news, the last episode of Red Eye will air Friday, April 7 at 3 a. m.  The irreverent news program with the    timeslot launched in 2007 with host Greg Gutfeld, who left the show in 2015. Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart played a pivotal role in Red Eye\u2018s inception. Breitbart was a frequent guest on the program, which also regularly featured Gutfeld\u2019s \u201crepulsive sidekick\u201d Bill Schulz, \u201combudsman\u201d Andy Levy and Tom Shillue, who became permanent host of the show in 2015. In a 2012 segment honoring the late conservative icon, Gutfeld said that Red Eye \u201cwould not exist\u201d without Breitbart\u2019s involvement. \u201cIt was him who talked to Fox to get me a job,\u201d Gutfeld explained shortly after Breitbart\u2019s passing. \u201cI was living in England, and he talked to people at Fox. I met with people at Fox, and the next thing you know it was Red Eye. And everybody here who\u2019s sitting here  \u2026     we never would have met if it wasn\u2019t for Andrew Breitbart bringing us together, because that\u2019s what Breitbart does. \u201d The March 2, 2012 episode of Red Eye was dedicated to Breitbart, with the show airing clips of the late conservative icon\u2019s most memorable appearances. In a column for Breitbart News following his departure, Gutfeld said Red Eye was successful because of a \u201cbeautiful deal made between its staff and its viewers. \u201d \u201cThe Redeye gang would refuse to underestimate the viewer\u2019s intelligence, and the viewers would forgive us for our incoherence,\u201d Gutfeld explained. \u201cWe attracted people that we would drink with, given the chance. These were late night types  \u2014   up in the lonely hours for different reasons. Some had graveyard shifts. Others were nursing moms. Many, I learned were sick  \u2014   or in hospitals, desperate for a distraction. \u201d According to TVNewser, current Red Eye hosts Tom Shillue and Andy Levy will remain with Fox News. A representative for Fox News Channel said the show\u2019s 3 a. m. slot would be filled by repeats of Tucker Carlson Tonight.
