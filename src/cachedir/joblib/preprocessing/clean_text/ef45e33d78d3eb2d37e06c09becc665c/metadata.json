[\u201cWe are very much worried because it seems that the Vatican is going to make a very bad agreement with China,\u201d Cardinal Zen told LifeSiteNews in an interview published Tuesday.  Zen said that Pope Francis \u201cis really na\u00efve\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the Chinese communists. \u201d Moreover, \u201cthe people around him are not good at all. They have very wrong ideas. And I\u2019m afraid that they may sell out our underground Church,\u201d Zen added. In past months, the Vatican has been engaged in talks with leaders of China\u2019s Communist Party in an effort to establish diplomatic ties with the country. Critics suggest that if the deal happens, the Vatican would likely have to give up its existing ties with the government in Taiwan, which currently only has official ties with a few small, mostly poor countries. The deal being discussed would reportedly hand over a certain amount of   power to the Chinese government regarding the naming of new bishops. The government would propose candidates and the Pope would choose from among the clergy vetted by the communists. Priests and bishops in the underground church have faced imprisonment for their fidelity to the Holy See, rather than submitting to the \u201cpatriotic\u201d church under the control of the Communist government. Zen, the Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong, said that China\u2019s communist rulers want \u201ctotal surrender\u201d from the Church. In an apparent move to placate Chinese leadership, Pope Francis recently defended the practice of religious liberty in the officially atheist country, insisting that in China churches are full and religion is freely practiced. In a lengthy interview with the Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds, the Pope said he would love to visit China \u201cas soon as they invite me,\u201d something he says he has made clear to Chinese authorities. Francis said that the Vatican is engaged in ongoing dialogue with China and that a commission has been set up that meets every three months, with Beijing and the Vatican alternating as hosts of the encounter. \u201cChina always has this aura of mystery about it that is fascinating,\u201d Francis said, noting that not long ago the Vatican Museums held an exhibition in Beijing and that China would be reciprocating with an exhibit to be housed at the Vatican. \u201cIn China the churches are full,\u201d Francis insisted. \u201cYou can practice your faith in China. \u201d Cardinal Zen has said that diplomatic relations with China are not worth selling out the underground Church which has suffered for decades because of its fidelity to Rome. In Zen\u2019s mind, the proposed deal would betray what the Church holds most dear. \u201cYou cannot go into negotiations with the mentality \u2018we want to sign an agreement at any cost\u2019 then you are surrendering yourself, you are betraying yourself, you are betraying Jesus Christ,\u201d Zen said. The Cardinal also said that a Vatican deal with the Chinese government would undermine the Church\u2019s credibility and set a bad precedent for dealing with other countries as well. According to Zen, some officials of the Holy See consider the underground faithful to be \u201ctroublemakers. \u201d Although he has met with the Pope to explain the situation faced by Catholics in China, Zen isn\u2019t confident that Francis will come to their aid. I\u2019ve written many letters to the Pope, Zen said, but then \u201che doesn\u2019t answer my letters. \u201d \u201cThe thing we can do is to pray,\u201d said Zen. \u201cWe believe in the power of prayer. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
