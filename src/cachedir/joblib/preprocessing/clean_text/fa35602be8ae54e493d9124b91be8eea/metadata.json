In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\\nFBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen . Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \u2018reopening\u2019 an investigation but Comey\u2019s words do not match that characterization. Director Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.\\nIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. \\nThe Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.\u201d\\nSource: Zero Hedge \\n'"}, "time": 1742561900.538208}
