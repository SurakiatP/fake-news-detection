Y. He was 97. His death was confirmed by Deborah Smullyan, a cousin. Professor Smullyan was a serious mathematician, with the publications and the doctorate to prove it. But his greatest legacy may be the devilishly clever logic puzzles that he devised, presenting them in numerous books or just in casual conversation. Sometimes they were   and sometimes they were embedded in longer narratives to explain mathematical concepts, such as Boolean logic, as he did in \u201cThe Magic Garden of George B and Other Logic Puzzles\u201d in 2015 or retrograde analysis, as he explored in the \u201cThe Chess Mysteries of the Arabian Knights\u201d in 1981. He was also a character. With his long white hair and beard, Professor Smullyan resembled Ian McKellen\u2019s wizard, Gandalf, from the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d film series. He was lanky, hated exercise and loved steak and eggs. He studied Eastern religion. He told corny jokes and performed   magic to anyone near him. He played the piano with passion and talent into his 90s. (A career in music had been derailed by tendinitis when he was a young man.) And he was fond of his philosophical, if silly, sayings, such as, \u201cWhy should I worry about dying? It\u2019s not going to happen in my lifetime!\u201d Melvin Fitting, a retired professor of mathematics, philosophy and computer science at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, recalled Professor Smullyan\u2019s demeanor as his teacher at Yeshiva University in the 1960s while Professor Fitting was pursuing his doctorate. \u201cHe\u2019d be smiling in anticipation of the many beautiful things he was going to show you,\u201d the professor said in an interview. Professor Smullyan saw beauty in the puzzles that he created, seemingly nonstop, over the decades, and viewed them as tools to spread the gospel of mathematics. In his 1982 book \u201cThe Lady or the Tiger? And Other Logic Puzzles,\u201d he wrote about the greater popularity that Euclid\u2019s \u201cElements\u201d would have achieved had the Greek mathematician framed it as a puzzle book. He wrote: \u201cProblem: Given a triangle with two equal sides, are two of the angles necessarily equal? Why, or why not?\u201d His puzzles were so much a part of his identity that he posed one on his first date with his future wife, Blanche de Grab. What he posed to her was a statement that, in the way he framed it, could only result in a kiss from her. Reminiscing about it, he wrote that it was a \u201cpretty sneaky way of winning a kiss, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Jason Rosenhouse, a mathematics professor at James Madison University, who edited a book in 2015 celebrating Mr. Smullyan, said the clarity of his puzzles could unveil the beauty of math to those who could not previously grasp it. \u201cIt was like fooling a kid into eating his vegetables,\u201d Professor Rosenhouse said in a telephone interview, adding, \u201cRaymond took something like G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems and used a string of logic puzzles as a device for presenting them. \u201d Martin Gardner, himself a renowned math puzzler, compared Professor Smullyan to the Oxford logician Charles Dodgson, who also was an author better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll. Professor Smullyan paid tribute to Carroll in his 1982 book \u201cAlice in  : A Carrollian Tale for Children Under Eighty. \u201d In one chapter, Professor Smullyan wrote, Alice thinks to herself about how confusing, yet remarkably logical, Humpty Dumpty is. \u201cI wonder,\u201d she says, \u201chow he manages to be both confusing and logical?\u201d There was, it would seem, some confusing logic in the zigzagging path of Mr. Smullyan\u2019s life. Raymond Merrill Smullyan was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, on May 25, 1919. His father, Isidore, was a businessman his mother, the former Rosina Freeman, a homemaker. His education was peripatetic and eclectic. He attended both Pacific University and Reed College in Oregon, then studied mathematics and logic on his own. He learned magic. He created chess puzzles that were more concerned about moves that had been made than the ones that should be made. He put together a magic act, and performed under the stage name   Merrill at nightclubs like the Pump Room in Chicago, where he worked for tips. He went on to get his bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago and a Ph. D. from Princeton. He taught at Princeton, Yeshiva, Lehman College of the City University of New York and Indiana University. His philosophy of teaching was a little puzzling. \u201cMy policy is to teach the student as much as possible and to require from him or her as little as possible,\u201d he told Donald Albers and Gerald Alexanderson, the authors of \u201cMathematical People: Profiles and Interviews\u201d in 2008. But, he added, the impact of his apparent lenience was that many of his students worked harder in his course than in any other. Professor Smullyan is survived by his stepson, Jack Kotik six   and 16   . His wife Blanche, a   pianist and music educator, died in 2006. His first marriage ended in divorce. Mr. Kotik recalled being with his wife at the Smullyans\u2019 house in Elka Park, N. Y. and listening to a radio report about the high salaries of professional athletes. His mother, Blanche, said they were excessive. Professor Smullyan said that to be paid so much was unfair. \u201cI said, \u2018Raymond, isn\u2019t it true that you\u2019re more intelligent than most people?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kotik said during a phone interview. \u201c \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said. So I said, \u2018I think that\u2019s unfair. We should take out part of your brain and distribute it to people who could use it.\u2019 \u201cHe was silent for a minute, and finally he said, \u2018I can\u2019t give you any reason, but I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u2019 \u201d Puzzles were an essential part of Mr. Smullyan\u2019s patois  \u2014   a logician\u2019s way of greeting and testing people. When he met his most recent editor, Rochelle Kronzek, he asked her to solve some problems. \u201cIt intimidated me at first, but I came up with creative answers,\u201d Ms. Kronzek, the executive editor of World Scientific Publishing, said in an interview, \u201cand more than once he smiled because he liked the way I was thinking. He got a lot of joy out of seeing how other people thought. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563463.2170784}
