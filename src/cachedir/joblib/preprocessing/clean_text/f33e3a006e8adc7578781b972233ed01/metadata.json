Trump boasting about sexually accosting women to the chuckling encouragement of Mr. Bush, an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host at the time, it just might have stifled the celebrity billionaire. A body of psychological research shows that even mild pushback against offensive remarks can have an instant effect  \u2014   as difficult as that can be, especially with a boss, a friend or a celebrity. It is research worth considering in a political season when ethnic, racist and sexual slurs, not to mention general insults, seem to have become part of everyday chatter. Polls show that people are increasingly unhappy with the tenor of the national debate but unsure what to do about the decline in civility. Researchers have detailed the difficulty of confronting prejudice, but they have also found that even the politest of objections  \u2014   or subtle corrections to loaded words  \u2014   can almost instantly curb a speaker\u2019s behavior. With a clearer understanding of the dynamics of such confrontation, psychologists say, people can develop tactics that can shut down the unsavory talk without ruining relationships, even when the offender has more status or power: a fraternity president, say, or a team captain or employer. The alternative is passive complicity, psychologists say. \u201cWhen we hear this egregious, uncomfortable talk and we don\u2019t speak up, what\u2019s actually happening is that the person speaking is getting a green light,\u201d said Sharyn J. Potter,   of the Prevention Innovations Research Center, at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cIt encourages them. \u201d It hardly takes a psychologist to explain the difficulty inherent in any such confrontation. \u201cSimply saying, \u2018I don\u2019t appreciate that comment,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s not cool\u2019  \u2014   well, people aren\u2019t going to like you very much after that,\u201d said Linda Tropp, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \u201cBut they do get defensive, and change their behavior quickly. \u201d It is important to realize that you don\u2019t have to make a dramatic, principled stand. \u201cWe don\u2019t want bystanders to think they have to fly in with their Superman cape,\u201d said Dr. Potter, who is also an associate professor of sociology. There are many approaches people can use to stop talk they find noxious, say experts in what is known as bystander education. Among them: distraction, such as abruptly changing the subject. \u201cEven in the locker room, guys can change the conversation, they can spray people with water, or crank up the music,\u201d Dr. Potter said. Rather than calling out the speaker and shaming him or her publicly, which can carry the risk of retaliation, you could make it about you. \u201cYou could say: \u2018This is bothering me. One of my good friends was raped. \u2019\u201d Dr. Potter said. \u201cIf you put it on yourself, that might feel safer. \u201d Or you can try humor. Gail Stern, an educator and a   of Catharsis Productions, which gives sexual violence prevention training on college campuses and in the military, said that one deft approach might be to assume that the speaker is being outrageous on purpose, and to respond with something like this: \u201cI love satire. It\u2019s so weird that people believe that for real and it\u2019s so cool you called that out. \u201d She calls that tactic \u201cverbal aikido,\u201d after the Japanese martial art whose practitioners defend themselves by redirecting an opponent\u2019s attack. An essential component of bystander intervention training is to get participants to imagine their own responses to scenarios. The goal is to get people to arm themselves with approaches that feel natural and innate, rather than outfitting them with model scripts. \u201cIf you have a plan in your head, then you can use it,\u201d Dr. Potter said. Psychologists who study the effects of such confrontation divide offensive behavior into two loose categories. One includes strangers acting out  \u2014   a mother who slaps a toddler, a boy who punches his girlfriend  \u2014   and bystanders, when they react, tend to do so viscerally and quickly. The other category includes offensive jokes or references among people who know one another, like friends or  . In those cases, there are more gray areas, as well as personality factors to consider and often a relationship at stake. Objections, if they come, often take a little longer than bystander intervention does. Deborah Cameron, a professor of language and communication at the University of Oxford, said that sexual banter often takes place among men who are friends, and that \u201cthe function of it is to promote bonding. \u201d Men may feel that if they challenge conversation they find tasteless, or simply don\u2019t join in, \u201cthey\u2019re spoiling the mood at a minimum and possibly putting their relationship to the group at risk,\u201d she said. And sometimes they worry that \u201cit will raise doubts about their masculinity or heterosexuality,\u201d or that they will become targets of bullying, said Ms. Cameron, author of \u201cThe Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages?\u201d Yet subtle objections can stop people in midsentence, in some cases prompting later reflection, psychologists have found. In one type of experiment, for example, study participants guess the occupations of people based on a photograph and limited information, like \u201cspends most of his days walking the streets\u201d or \u201cdoes regular housework. \u201d Most of these profiles are ethnically neutral. But some are ringers. The photo of a black man who \u201cwalks the streets\u201d often prompts guesses of \u201chomeless\u201d rather than mail carrier and a black woman who depends on money from the government gets identified as a welfare mom instead of a government employee or a student with loans. Then the researchers, under the guise of fellow participants, push back. \u201cWe confront them in a variety of ways, sometimes harshly  \u2014   \u2018That\u2019s racist!\u2019  \u2014   and sometimes much less so, appealing to equality: \u2018Shouldn\u2019t everyone be treated the same? \u2019\u201d said Alexander Czopp, director of the Center for   Research at Western Washington University. \u201cDepending on how the confrontation is done, the participants might show different levels of defensiveness and anger right away but they usually show less   attitudes on tests we do later. \u201d David Fleischer, director of the Los Angeles LGBT Center\u2019s Leadership Lab, often sends gay and transgender people into socially conservative districts to do    canvassing. \u201cWe have to handle these situations all the time,\u201d said Mr. Fleischer, now canvassing in Cleveland. \u201cWe are seeking out people who are prejudiced, and they\u2019re using offensive language. And if you correct that language, just use different words yourself, and your tone and demeanor are kind, people are very responsive, and you don\u2019t have to get into a screaming match. \u201d In a recent study, Mr. Fleischer and other researchers found that this kind of canvassing can soften the views of some 10 percent of voters  \u2014   a large shift when it comes to political behavior, and one that has prompted wider training in such cordial, respectful \u201ccorrecting\u201d of language. Of course, most people never get any training they make judgments on the fly, about costs, tactics and personal integrity. And some are more likely to speak up than others, new research suggests. Aneeta Rattan, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the London Business School and Carol Dweck of Stanford found in a recent study that people who are optimistic and believe that others can change  \u2014   that a bigot, with time, can change stripes  \u2014   are more likely than the pessimists to say something. \u201cIn that sense,\u201d Dr. Rattan said, \u201cthis work suggests that your belief system about others can either be a barrier or a staircase where you can take that first step  \u2014   even if it\u2019s just saying, \u2018I disagree. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564617.1687715}
