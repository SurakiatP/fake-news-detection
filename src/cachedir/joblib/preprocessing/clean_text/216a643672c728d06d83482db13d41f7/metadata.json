Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nSome are interpreting radio host Joe Walsh\u2019s Wednesday afternoon tweet as a literal call to violence following the election, while it seems the majority are electing to point and laugh instead. At least gun control crusader Piers Morgan should be OK with it, seeing as Walsh\u2019s weapon of choice is a musket, just as the founders envisioned when they drew up the Bill of Rights. On November 8th, I\\'m voting for Trump. \\nOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I\\'m grabbing my musket. \\nYou in? \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 @WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean? \\n\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 26, 2016 \\nGood question. There\u2019s no need to alert the authorities, as plenty of people have already; it\u2019ll be up to the powers that be to determine if \u201cgrabbing my musket\u201d constitutes a threat, or if it\u2019s meant symbolically. (The odds that Twitter will suspend Walsh\u2019s account look pretty good.) @WalshFreedom Didn\\'t you get in trouble for this once before? \\n\u2014 Meredith D. (@YankeeBeatCheck) October 26, 2016 \\nAt least once before. Grab your musket and meet me in North Carolina. \\nTime to fight the Feds. \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) May 9, 2016 I\\'M GRABBING MY MUSKET is the perfect thing to scream into an old fashioned phone that isn\\'t plugged in It\\'s not a great thing to tweet \\n\u2014 Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) October 26, 2016 \\nIn the meantime, plenty of people aren\u2019t exactly quivering at the image of Walsh wielding a musket \u2014 or, as the cable networks would likely call it, an assault musket. @WalshFreedom Bless your heart. \\n\u2014 Swami Buttload (@MetricButtload) October 26, 2016 \"When you\\'re an ex-congressman, they let you do it.

Awkward. \\n\u2014 Robert Bingaman (@robertjosiah) October 26, 2016 @WalshFreedom girl, you don\\'t have a musket. \\n\u2014 Christoph Fitzgerald (@kifferfitz) October 26, 2016 . @WalshFreedom Good thinking, you\\'ll go far with a smoothbore black-powder muzzleloader \\n\u2014 Adam Weinstein (@AdamWeinstein) October 26, 2016 @WalshFreedom and what are you going to do with said musket? Really? A musket? Not a carbine?
