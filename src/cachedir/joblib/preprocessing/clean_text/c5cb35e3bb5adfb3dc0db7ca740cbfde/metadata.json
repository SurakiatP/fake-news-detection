Many fans believe the current team\u2019s wearing of the three lions shows a lack of respect to those who had gone before them and managed to pass a ball ten yards. England supporter Wayne Hayes said: \u201cIs this what Terry Butcher ran around with his head pissing blood for? Is this why Gazza cried? Is this why Geoff Thomas shanked that shot against France? \u201cTo see the crest besmirched by Wayne Rooney wearing it while wandering around the pitch like he\u2019s in IKEA is a disgrace.\u201d England manager Gareth Southgate said: \u201cThe decision whether to wear the three lions should be a personal one, unless you fuck up a vital penalty you\u2019re inexplicably taking in a major tournament, in which case you should be allowed nowhere near them.\u201d Funds raised by the sale of England shirts with the crest help to fund various causes, such as firing managers and staging doomed bids to host the world cup. \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564412.6521206}
