This is a serious military presence.\u201d \\nCold War-style tensions between Moscow and Washington took a further dip this week after the US revealed plans to station marines in Norway \u2013 just a few hundred miles from the border with Russia. \\nOfficials in Norway and the US said they were considering a deal for extra equipment and training for the Scandinavian country. \\nRussia has reacted angrily to the plans, saying there was \u201cthe absence of threat from Russia to Norway\u201d. \\nMr Putin made a similar show of force last month, when he orchestrated a military evacuation drill including a staggering 40 million people. \\nThe huge four-day \u201ccivil defence\u201d drill set alarm bells ringing in Washington and London, with tensions already high over disagreements in Syria. \\nRussia\u2019s Ministry for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disaster revealed 40 million civilians, 200,000 emergency rescuers and 50,000 units of equipment were involved in the war game, which ran from October 4 to October 7. \\nAnd last month two RAF jets were scrambled to intercept Russian bombers which had flown threateningly close to British airspace. \\nWhile the two Russian Blackjack bombers did not enter British airspace, authorities were alarmed when they passed to the west of the Shetland Islands. \\nThe Ministry of Defence revealed jets from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Coningsby were eventually launched as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d. \\nThe Russian planes, which had travelled from the direction of Norway, then continued their route away from Britain. \\nA similar incident occurred again last, when the RAF were twice forced to scramble jets to intercept Russian bombers. \\nPutin\u2019s aircrafts flew in an \u201carea of interest\u201d off the coast of Scotland on October 12 and October 16, the MoD revealed. This latest development comes amid a massive break-down in communication between America and Russia over their operations in Syria. \\nA spokesman for the US State Department said earlier this month: \u201cExtremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations. \\nA spokesman for the US State Department said earlier this month: \u201cExtremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations. \\n\u201cThis could include attacks against Russian interests, perhaps even Russian cities. \\n\u201cRussia will continue to send troops home in body bags, and will continue to lose resources, perhaps even aircraft.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563105.508249}
