After finally leaving the hostile Westeros countryside behind, she was on a boat to Braavos, exploring a new world with dreams of a vengeful, exciting life as a highly trained assassin. Sunday\u2019s Season 6 premiere illustrated how badly Arya miscalculated her prospects. After running afoul in last season\u2019s finale of the rules of the Faceless Men, the religious order training her, she is now freshly blind, and spent Sunday\u2019s episode begging in the streets when she wasn\u2019t being whacked with a stick by a girl called the Waif (Faye Marsay). [ Recap: \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 6 premiere ] \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t learn to fight without her eyes, she\u2019s getting hit,\u201d Ms. Williams said recently. \u201cThe Waif, she\u2019s evil. \u201d Ms. Williams discussed fighting blind, impatient Arya fans and what Season 6 holds for the youngest Stark daughter. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Q. Where do things stand with Arya now? A. You can\u2019t comprehend being without your eyes, and you have to put your faith and trust in the people around you, who are also the ones who put you in that position. She has no other choice. So that\u2019s a really interesting position to see her in, because she\u2019s never had to trust someone. It\u2019s a very vulnerable place for her to be at the beginning of the series, but things will turn around. How does this fit into her overall evolution? Because she\u2019s gonna use it all again  \u2014   these are all skills that she\u2019s gonna take with her. A lot of people found Arya\u2019s Season 5 really boring. They were like, \u201cWhy is she sweeping floors? Why is she getting hit on the hands?\u201d But this is about a process that she\u2019s going through and its ultimately going to be the best weapon. And when that day comes, when she uses all of this, everyone\u2019s gonna be like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s so cool!\u201d Which is great, but it wouldn\u2019t have been as cool if you hadn\u2019t seen her go through that process. No one becomes a [warrior] overnight, guys. Give her a break. Is it hard to act blind? For a lot of the   I had contact lenses that were opaque, so I couldn\u2019t see anything anyway. For the fight scenes, I had contact lenses I could see through. But that was more of a health and safety thing, because I was wielding a stick and poor Faye didn\u2019t want to get hit in the face. But she still did. Did she really? Not in the face. We just clipped each other a couple of times. So that was you in the fight scene in the premiere, not a stunt double? That one was all me. There\u2019s stuff later on that we had girls help us with. There\u2019s a shot in the trailer of you taking a flying leap. Yeah that gets a lot more technical. There were two wonderful stunt doubles. How has Arya\u2019s perspective changed since last season? Arya was quite shallow. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a sick killer and then have my list, and I\u2019m gonna go back and avenge my family. \u201d It was such a childish way of thinking about it. Then she got there and realized this isn\u2019t a joke this isn\u2019t like a holiday camp your parents send you off to. I know you can\u2019t get into plot details  \u2026     I\u2019m giving you really good hints. [Laughs.] I feel like I\u2019m selling this season really well. But can you speak more broadly about what Season 6 is about for her? It\u2019s her second chance. She\u2019s learning to fight blind, and at the beginning people are going to have that same opinion of, \u201cGod, this is so boring. Why isn\u2019t Arya the [warrior] she used to be?\u201d O. K. let\u2019s take away your sight and see how you do without it. There are episodes when it\u2019s going to be really difficult to watch. Arya, who we\u2019ve always loved, is getting pulled apart. But she will ultimately use it to her advantage, just as she always does. She takes every negative and uses it as a positive, and that happens in a big way this year.'"}, "time": 1742563813.5229158}
