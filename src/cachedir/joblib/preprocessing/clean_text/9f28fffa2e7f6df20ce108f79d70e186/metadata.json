However, to those in the know, this is yet another telling symptom of MK programming, from someone who has already displayed many other symptoms. \\nThere\u2019s a difference between speaking with a funny accent as a joke and speaking with a completely different speech pattern in all seriousness. One is the result of goofing around and the other is the result an alter-persona. - Advertisement - \\nLohan\u2019s new accent was noticed while giving an interview to a reporter in Greece. Here\u2019s the video. \\nLindsay, who is mainly based in England and Greece and was recently in a relationship with a Russian billionaire (MK handler?), was explaining to the journalist about why she has opened up a Nightclub in Athens called Lohan. After a Daily Mail article on the subject, Lohan \u201cjoked\u201d and gave her accent (and alter-persona) a name: Lilohan. \\nAs stated in previous articles, victims of Mind Control are programmed with alter personas that have their own history, identity and accent (read my full article on Monarch Programming here ). The programming is so pervasive that the same person can speak different languages with different accents effortlessly \u2013 while the core persona cannot. For this reason, the spontaneous yet constant usage of a different accent is one of the main tell-tale signs of MK programming. And Lindsay Lohan has been identified her, on Vigilant Citizen, to be a Beta Kitten slave a long time ago. The entertainment industry has been very keen on proving this fact through symbolic pictures. Lindsay posed countless times as Marilyn Monroe who is the prototype of Beta Kitten Programming. In this photo by Tyler Shields, Lindsay lays on a bed while men get undressed. One cannot come up with a more graphic way of portraying the life of Beta Kitten slaves. Industry slaves must work with creepy photographers such as Terry Richardson. Bonus industry slave sign: One Eye sign. In another shoot with Terry Richardson, Lohan appears genuinely traumatized. \\nIn past years, Lohan has floated in and out of rehab (aka re-programming) while increasingly appearing to be \u201cout of it\u201d. \\nAnother famous person who has been displaying the same Beta Kitten symptoms is Britney Spears. Here\u2019s an article about her speaking with a different accent in 2008 \u2013 around the time of her infamous head-shaving meltdown. Britney Spears Lapses Into a British Accent \\nBritney Spears has a new accessory to go with her pink wig: a British accent. \\nIn the last several weeks, Spears, 26, has been videotaped numerous times trading her Louisiana twang for U.K. inflections. \\n\u201cShe had the English accent thing going the whole time\u201d while shopping at Kitson last Thursday, according to a source. \u201cIt didn\u2019t stop.\u201d \\nEven when angry, the accent appears. On an L.A. shopping trip to Macy\u2019s on Jan. 13, she screamed at the paparazzi, \u201cGet out of my G\u2014\u2014 face!\u201d \u2013 in a British accent. \\nSo is it all in fun or has she flipped her pink wig? \\n\u201cWhen someone has dissociative identity disorder\u201d \u2013 formerly known as multiple personality disorder \u2013 \u201ceach identity is split off from the other,\u201d says L.A. psychologist Renee A. Cohen, who is not treating Spears. \u201cEach identity would have its own name, memories, behavioral traits and emotional characteristics.\u201d \\nCohen says the critical question is: \u201cWhen Britney uses the British accent, or appears to take on another identity, does she know she\u2019s Britney Spears?\u201d \\n\u201cOtherwise, she could simply be behaving this way for attention, for sympathy, or any other reason,\u201d adds Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s foolish to attempt to diagnose her without a formal evaluation.\u201d \\nOne possible influence could be Spears\u2019s maternal grandmother, Lilian Bridges, who was originally from England. \\nAlso, Spears\u2019s new beau, photographer Adnan Ghalib, grew up in Birmingham, England. \\nAccording to paparazzi who trail the singer around the clock, one thing is for sure: the pink wig means something\u2019s changing. \\n\u201cWhen she puts on the pink wig, you just know something crazy is about to happen,\u201d said one paparazzo. \\n\u2013 Source: People.com \\nWhile media is wondering what kind of accent Lindsay was speaking with (sounds Greek to me), we should rather wonder: Why would a 30 year old woman speak, in all seriousness, with a strange accent and a completely different speech pattern? Most of the time it is the result of a multiple-personality disorder (MPD) \u2013 which is a symptom of Monarch mind control. It is there, right in our face, but very few are actually seeing it.
