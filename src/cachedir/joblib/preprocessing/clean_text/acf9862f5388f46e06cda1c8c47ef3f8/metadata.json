In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. \\nTake for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : \u201cPeople are going to march on the capitols. They\u2019re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. \u201cIf push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.\u201d \\nRoger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: \u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do, but I\u2019m scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I\u2019ve never seen the country so divided, just black and white \u2014 there\u2019s no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there\u2019s no together. The country has never been so divided. I\u2019m looking at revolution right now.\u201d \\nAs Trump continues to talk of the election being \u201crigged,\u201d his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: \u201cIf she comes after the guns, it\u2019s going to be a rough, bumpy road. I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won\u2019t hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.\u201d \\nRetired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he\u2019s ready to do whatever is necessary: \u201cI am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.\u201d \\nSee if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be \u201cheroes\u201d in their own minds. The year was 1995 and Bill Clinton was President. Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck loaded with explosives outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 innocent Americans, including children. Words can have consequences. \\nFeatured Image Via PBS About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
