Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Thursday said Hillary Clinton\u2019s exposing sensitive information to potentially multiple hacks from foreign actors amounts to treason. \\n\u201cThis is why you have security protocols \u2014 to protect classified information,\u201d Mr. McCaul said on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cShe exposed it to our enemies, and now \u2026 our adversaries have this very sensitive information that not only jeopardizes her and national security at home, but the men and women serving overseas.\u201d \\n\u201cIn my opinion, quite frankly, it\u2019s treason,\u201d said Mr. McCaul, Texas Republican. \\nThis needs to end. \\nOur system is rotten to the core. \\nThe ONLY way to fix it, is to vote for Trump and #DrainTheSwamp.
