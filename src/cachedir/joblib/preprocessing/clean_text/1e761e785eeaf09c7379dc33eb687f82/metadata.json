Yet, the GOP bill \u2014  which has been panned by many conservatives and dubbed \u201cObamacare 2. 0\u201d \u2014  keeps key elements of Obamacare in place.  When asked about this at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon by the Washington Examiner\u2019s Sarah Westwood, Spicer inaccurately stated that if this bill were to be signed into law it would constitute a repeal of Obamacare. Repealing Obamacare was a top campaign promise made by President Donald Trump in 2016. \u201cIf this is the policy that passes, is President Trump confident in the future that he can say that he fully repealed Obamacare?\u201d Westwood asked Spicer. \u201cYeah, absolutely, as I mentioned, I mean, the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it,\u201d Spicer replied. \u201cThere are three things, I mean, each phase that we\u2019ve talked about \u2014  phase one, phase two, and phase three \u2014  there\u2019s a repeal and replace aspect with each one. \u201d Yet, the bill proposed on Monday night certainly does not represent a full repeal of Obamacare. It has been called by conservative critics Obamacare 2. 0 because the bill keeps in place the Obamacare requirements that insurers allow for coverage of   conditions and allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health care until they\u2019re   . It shifts the individual mandate from being a tax paid to the government to a penalty paid to insurance companies, does not even address the Medicaid issue in states effectively, helps illegal aliens access healthcare in the system, and it does not allow for purchasing of insurance across state lines as Republicans have promised for years \u2014  among many, many other problems. Specifically on the Medicaid front, the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) says that the bill \u201cmisses the mark\u201d in terms of rolling back the entitlement. FGA said in a release: Freezing enrollment in ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is critical to protecting taxpayers and freeing up resources for the truly needy. This is a politically popular solution that would save taxpayers more than $600 billion over the next decade. Unfortunately, the current draft does not stop new states from expanding ObamaCare and does not freeze enrollment in existing expansions. The draft does not even give states the statutory authority to implement their own enrollment freezes. Spicer, reached by phone on Tuesday afternoon, told Breitbart News, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d when told this bill does not constitute a full Obamacare repeal.  \u201cI don\u2019t care. Again, that\u2019s your \u2014  that\u2019s not what the president thinks. That\u2019s not what Tom Price thinks. That\u2019s not what Mick Mulvaney thinks. So, say what you will, but that\u2019s the reality of this,\u201d Spicer said. When told that Tom Price, the Health and Human Services Secretary, actually did say the bill was not final \u2014  and described it as a \u201cwork in progress\u201d and not a final full repeal of Obamacare \u2014  Spicer agreed with Secretary Price. \u201cRight, it\u2019s going through the process. It goes through regular order,\u201d Spicer said. Spicer added, too, that the issues of things like dealing with Medicaid, the purchasing of insurance across state lines, and more will happen in future phases. \u201cThere are three phases to this,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThere are certain things we can do in phase one and certain things we can do in phase two and certain things we can do in phase three. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628474.008845}
