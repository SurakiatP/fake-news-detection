Whitlock acknowledged that many people have been cord cutting over the years, but said some of the \u201canimosity\u201d towards ESPN is \u201ctheir lurch to the left and injecting progressive victimology into the sports conversation,\u201d which he noted is not a mentality taught in sports. Carlson then asked how the company\u2019s employees feel about ESPN\u2019s move to the left. According to Whitlock, conservative and moderate employees are \u201cafraid\u201d to express their traditional values. \u201cI think a lot of them are just now starting to figure out the ramifications of this, and I think there\u2019s been some complaints from some of their employees like, \u2018Hey, look, we\u2019re afraid to express that we have traditional sports culture, traditional values,\u201d Whitlock responded. He continued, \u201cTheir ombudsman has written about a culture within ESPN where if you\u2019re slightly conservative or moderate, you\u2019re afraid to express an opinion inside there. It\u2019s a real problem at ESPN and within all of major corporations and everything has gone PC. Everything. Everybody\u2019s afraid, \u2018Oh, my God, we can\u2019t upset anybody.\u2019 You\u2019re silencing people  \u2014   it\u2019s a very dangerous thing. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563258.1962094}
