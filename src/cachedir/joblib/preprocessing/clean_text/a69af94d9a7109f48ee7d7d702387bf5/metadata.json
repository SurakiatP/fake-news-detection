It\u2019ll only do 95,\u201d Randle responds, referring to a governor capping his truck\u2019s speed, as he later explained to THV11 in an unrecorded interview. \\nAfter a few more laughs, the officer tells Randle he measured the truck\u2019s speed over 90 miles an hour \u2014 and the chief was still pulling away at the time. \\nDespite the obvious dangers of such high speeds on the narrow, curvy road, both the trooper and Brinkley officer simply walk away from the truck, as the officer says dismissively, \u201cSee you later, Chief.\u201d \\nVideo captures the last exchange between the two cops as Randle pulls away \u2014 the state trooper notes he clocked the chief doing \u201c71 at the curve.\u201d \\nIn two phone interviews with THV11 \u2014 which were not recorded, by request \u2014 Randle disputes he ever came close to the truck\u2019s alleged top possible speed of 95, as well as the trooper\u2019s claim in dashcam footage he had been rounding the curve at 71 mph. \\nAdditionally, \u201cThough the state trooper claimed that the officer had been pursuing Randle for miles, Randle told THV11 that the officer was on his way to Clarendon to get fingerprints from someone at the county jail.\u201d \\nTHV11 spoke with local business owner, Benjamin Martin, who first noticed the stop by a Brinkley officer inside Clarendon city limits. \\n\u201cI find it, you know, very disheartening, that anyone, public official or not, would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit, and put the lives of innocent others at risk,\u201d Martin told the station in a video interview. \\n\u201cI just feel that no one\u2019s above the law, and you know, if it was me, I would\u2019ve gotten a ticket.\u201d \\nIndeed, the public might be lucky the off-duty Brinkley police chief didn\u2019t lose control of his vehicle while traveling at such a high rate of speed \u2014 simply to make it to a football game. \\nNeither the Brinkley officer nor the state trooper are being investigated for wrongdoing \u2014 despite giving the chief a free pass. Arkansas State Police told THV11 the incident fell under control of the Brinkley Police Department as soon as the officer arrived on scene, even though the trooper affected the stop. \\n\u201cAs a chief of police, and as a law enforcement officer, you\u2019re sworn to protect and serve,\u201d Martin asserted, \u201cwhich is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk.\u201d \\nAlthough nothing serious resulted from Randle\u2019s excessive speeds, it was notorious blue privilege that allowed him to drive away without even a warning. \\nThese seemingly small favors afforded to police by police on a constant basis highlight the divide civilians feel in their encounters with law enforcement. Indeed, the idea police belong to an exclusive club of impunity \u2014 simply because of their chosen occupation \u2014 only increases tension and resentment in their communities. \\nIf police don\u2019t uphold and enforce the laws they enforce against civilians, the law becomes an arbitrary, exploitive method for generating revenue \u2014 and nothing more.
