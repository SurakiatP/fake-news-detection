Mr. Duterte rejected calls last week from international human rights groups to observe due process in the war he has declared on both sellers and users of illicit drugs, after a photograph of a drug user shot and killed by vigilantes made it to the front pages and became a symbol for the bloody antidrug campaign. \u201cI ordered the listing. I ordered the validation,\u201d he said Sunday in a nationally televised speech at a naval base, referring to the roughly 150 people he mentioned by name. \u201cI\u2019m the one reading it, and I am the sole person responsible for these all. \u201d He said the accused \u201care hereby ordered relieved\u201d of their duties, and he indicated that he was only fulfilling a campaign promise to be harsh. Some of those on his list are local politicians whom he said he knew personally. He also said the officials and others on his list should no longer be allowed to have permits for guns and other weapons. \u201cI\u2019m ordering the national police chief to lift police supervision and cancel any and all private arms that are licensed to these mayors I mentioned,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all canceled. Go out naked to the world and show how crooked you are. \u201d \u201cAll of you judges or whatever, you report to the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Duterte added. \u201cPolicemen, you report to the police chief. And army, to the chief of staff. \u201d \u201cYou do not do that, I will order the armed forces of the Philippines and the entire P. N. P. to hunt for you,\u201d he said, using the initials of the Philippine National Police. He did not say what evidence he had used as a basis for his accusations, acknowledging that \u201cit might be true, it might not be true. \u201d But in response to groups that had cautioned him not to trample on individuals\u2019 rights, he said that if those he named were charged in court, they would receive due process. \u201cDue process has nothing to do with my mouth,\u201d Mr. Duterte said. \u201cThere are no proceedings here, no lawyers. \u201d He said he wanted the Philippine people, especially those who voted for him in May, to know what was happening in the country. And he insisted that he did not care what the people would say, daring politicians critical of him to remove him from office. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to know the state of things or conditions in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my sworn duty. \u201d The president contended, as he had before, that drug abuse and the drug trade were \u201cpandemic\u201d in the Philippines. He said the nation\u2019s Drug Enforcement Agency had estimated that 3 percent of the population, or three million of the 100 million Filipinos, were addicted to drugs and that 92 percent of villages in metropolitan Manila had been \u201ccontaminated with drug use. \u201d He also claimed that as many as 600, 000 people were both using and selling drugs. Mr. Duterte promised police officers that he would have their back if they faced human rights charges in connection with carrying out his antidrug campaign. He recalled that when he was mayor of the southern city of Davao, his standing order to the police was to be quick on the draw and shoot suspects on sight. \u201cI told police then that I will kick them if they are writhing in pain if I see them get shot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy were you beaten to the draw? That ain\u2019t the way. Illegal? No, of course not. \u201d In the month since Mr. Duterte took office, more than 400 people suspected of dealing drugs have been killed, either by the police or by vigilantes. About 600, 000 people have surrendered to the police. In a statement issued after Mr. Duterte\u2019s speech, Franklin M. Drilon, the president pro tempore of the Senate, said, \u201cI strongly support President Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign, but due process and the rule of law must be dutifully upheld. \u201d \u201cI urged the president that if there is evidence that these officials were involved in the drug trade, he should immediately charge them administratively or in court,\u201d Mr. Drilon said. \u201cThere should be no shortcuts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561825.0625353}
