Haupt Conservatory at the New York Botanical Garden  \u2014   all among the greatest New York City landmarks  \u2014   look better today than they have since their earliest years. Many hands were responsible. John Belle was the common denominator. Mr. Belle, the retired founding partner of Beyer Blinder Belle, an architectural and planning firm that has specialized in preservation, restoration and contextual design, died last week at 84. With his death, the city has lost an architect who conveyed a genial joy in resuscitating the masterworks of his predecessors. That made him an appealingly modest figure in a room full of big architectural egos, since he was at his best when his own interventions were least obvious. New York has also lost a link to the intellectual crucible of the 1960s, when Jane Jacobs and others demanded that architects stop obliterating the past and, instead, take time to understand the many ways in which people were well served by older buildings and neighborhoods. \u201cPreservation is one of the highest forms of good citizenship,\u201d Mr. Belle said on his firm\u2019s website. \u201cAs a witness to the aftermath of the urban renewal movement in New York, I was determined to find a different way. \u201d For her part, Ms. Jacobs held Beyer Blinder Belle in high regard. \u201cThey were looking at the fabric of the community,\u201d she said in an interview in 1998. \u201cThat was very welcome and very exciting, that there were professionals who were, at last, doing that. \u201d She added: \u201cA community can\u2019t just come by waving a wand. It has history. History was, to the modernists, an enemy. So this was a very radical realization. And an important one. \u201d John Belle was born on June 30, 1932, in Cardiff, Wales. His father, Arthur, was a clerk at a Lyons tea shop in Cardiff. His mother, Gladys, was a housewife. Mr. Belle received diplomas from the Portsmouth School of Architecture in England and the Architectural Association in London before moving to the United States in 1959. Once in America, Mr. Belle worked for Josep Llu\u00eds Sert and Victor Gruen before starting his own firm in 1968 with Richard L. Blinder and John H. Beyer. Mr. Blinder died in 2006. Mr. Beyer is still active. Mr. Belle\u2019s early work included community planning projects in Manhattan. With the addition of James Marston Fitch to the practice in 1979, Beyer Blinder Belle began moving to the forefront of   architecture. The firm attracted wide attention in 1990 with its renovation and restoration of the abandoned Ellis Island immigration station into the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration. The vaulted ceiling in the former Registry Room, made of 28, 258 Guastavino tiles, was cleaned until it looked  \u2014   as Mr. Belle aptly put it  \u2014   like   . Where modern interventions were needed, they were made as inconspicuous and respectful as possible. When the Haupt Conservatory at the botanical garden in the Bronx was restored in 1997, Herbert Muschamp, who was then the architecture critic at The New York Times, said it could \u201conce again hold its sparkling glass head up high amid the great architectural symbols of New York. \u201d Though critics have faulted Beyer Blinder Belle\u2019s conservatism, it is worth recalling that the firm was associated in 1998 with the daring architect Santiago Calatrava in what proved to be a losing bid to redesign the James A. Farley Building, also known as the General Post Office, as a Pennsylvania Station annex. Penn Station was not where Mr. Belle was to win his greatest renown. That was at Grand Central. You almost had to have been there in the 1970s and \u201980s to believe how far the   terminal had fallen into decrepitude, even after its status as a landmark was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1978. Travelers shared Grand Central with a large homeless population. \u201cThe building was divided into turf claimed by different drug dealers,\u201d Mr. Belle and Maxinne R. Leighton wrote in \u201cGrand Central: Gateway to a Million Lives. \u201d \u201cCommuters were scared to take trains there at night. Parents warned their children not to use the dangerous bathrooms. \u201d In 1990, a design and engineering consortium led by Beyer Blinder Belle began work. Their strategic first strike was to demolish a billboard called the Kodak Colorama, which had blocked daylight into the main concourse for 40 years. \u201cIt was as if life were being breathed back into the building,\u201d Mr. Belle and Ms. Leighton wrote. \u201cMany commuters stopped in their tracks, speechless and amazed at the change that had so instantly brought back the majesty of the space. \u201d Their astonishment increased as the concourse ceiling was cleaned by workers on a scaffold that was rolled slowly through the room over a   period. The mud brown sky turned a startling teal, with stars, constellations and zodiac signs popping out in   contrast. Besides restoring the past, Beyer Blinder Belle made fundamental changes, too, starting with the construction of an entirely new marble staircase to the east balcony. It echoed, but did not replicate, the ornate western staircase. Some preservationists hated the idea. But the firm prevailed before city and state preservation agencies after it uncovered a plan by the original architects, Warren  Wetmore, that showed a staircase to the east balcony. That proved, Mr. Belle and Ms. Leighton wrote, that the idea \u201cwas not an   ploy to have our personal imprint on the building, but that in fact our goal was to complete the original design. \u201d Mr. Muschamp, the architecture critic, approved. \u201cThe new eastern staircase, which threatened to diminish the room\u2019s amplitude, has the opposite effect of magnifying it,\u201d he wrote in 1998, as the $425 million renovation neared completion. He continued, \u201cEven more impressive is the uncovering of the ramps, located just behind the ticket windows, that lead down to the lower level and its fabled Oyster Bar. \u201d \u201cBeyer Blinder Belle\u2019s greatest accomplishment,\u201d Mr. Muschamp said, \u201chas been to reveal that Grand Central is above all a monument to movement. \u201d Mr. Belle\u2019s first wife, Wendy Adams Belle, an artist and teacher, died in 1974. His second wife, Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker, died in 2003. He died on Thursday in Remsenburg, N. Y. where he had a home. He also lived in Manhattan. The cause was Lewy body disease, said his son David Belle, who survives him, along with another son, Sebastian three daughters, Amelia, Fenella and Antonia Chapman and eight grandchildren. Mr. Belle knew his work would never fully be done. \u201cThe act of restoring a building to its original state is only half the battle,\u201d he and Ms. Leighton wrote. \u201cThe other half is to guard against its denigration throughout its future existence. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562123.745748}
