According to Fish\u2019s email, these Fastwalkers came from unknown locations in distant space :\\nOne of these times, a member of that group was really excited \u2013 said they\u2019d just picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day). He described how it entered our atmosphere from \u201cdeep space\u201d (origin actually unknown, of course, but from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to earth.\\nFish\u2019s email is pure hearsay, no doubt, but Fish seems to recognize that such anecdotal evidence, blurred photographs, and crop circles will never win over the minds of the general public. In another email dated March 5, 2015, Fish wrote Podesta again, this time to stress the need for hard scientific proof of extraterrestrial intelligence :\\nWhat needs to be collected and publicly disseminated is hard scientific data collected from instruments that are known to be accurate and reliable. Within the US, this information has existed for many years and is still available today, if one knows \u201cwhere to look\u201d and \u201cwhat to look for.\\nSome of these emails were forwarded to Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist and noted UFO researcher who co-founded the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFi), an \u201cindependent alliance advocating for greater government openness on information about UFOs.\u201d Kean has been known to accuse the government of UFO coverups in the past, so her presence in these email chains adds some credibility to the theories that the Obama administration might be close to announcing the government\u2019s knowledge of UFOs . Fingers crossed, and eyes to the skies.\\nSource: Mysterious Universe \\n'"}, "time": 1742563305.1058884}
