Al Franken said, \u201cWe should look at that\u201d when asked during a Tuesday CBS This Morning interview if Senior Adviser to the President Jared Kushner\u2019s security clearance should be revoked. [\u201cThis is a pretty bad breach,\u201d added Franken. \u201cThese guys, this, the Administration, they\u2019re not acting like people who have nothing to hide,\u201d he claimed in the interview. He said they have a special prosecutor and House and Senate intelligence committees looking into the matter. \u201cWe have to see where the facts lead us, of course,\u201d said Franken, who agreed when the host said, \u201cBut we don\u2019t know yet?\u201d  Franken said that Kushner didn\u2019t disclose some of his contacts with Russians during the initial process of obtaining White House security clearance. The senator claimed that this is \u201cagainst the law. \u201d Last Friday the Washington Post reported the claim of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that Kushner sought a secret communications channel between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin. The Post report stated that U. S. officials reviewed intercepted communications from December 1 or 2 at Trump Tower and that those communications included an offer from Kushner to Kislyak to set up a secret communications channel between the transition team and the Kremlin. The report also cited unnamed officials that said the U. S. was not surveilling the meeting or those involved. The report added that Russia sometimes feeds false information \u201cas a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U. S. analysts. \u201d In a Tuesday morning interview with Fox News, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway cited weekend comments from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and National Security Advisor Gen. H. R. McMaster in which each expressed a lack of concern about the issue and, Conway stated, \u201cbackchannels like this are the regular course of business. \u201d Recently the Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
