Bush tagged the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, as an equivocator with no core principles after Mr. Kerry inexplicably (but accurately) noted that he had actually voted for an Iraq war appropriation \u201cbefore I voted against it. \u201d One particularly devastating ad showed Mr. Kerry windsurfing, reversing course with the breeze. He never recovered. Donald J. Trump\u2019s own proposals have often been vague, his prepared statements often contradicted by his own    remarks in speeches and interviews. Yet he has so far avoided much harm, despite reversing himself  \u2014   sometimes within hours  \u2014   on   campaign issues like immigration, abortion and economic policy. Here, we count some of the ways Mr. Trump has vacillated. Mr. Trump said in September that he was willing to let some Syrian refugees enter the United States despite the security risks. \u201cSomething has to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable humanitarian problem. \u201d In December, after the Islamic   attack in San Bernardino, Calif. Mr. Trump shocked even many Republicans by proposing a religious test. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\u201d he read aloud from a written statement. A day later, he elaborated, saying that customs agents would be directed to ask incoming travelers if they are Muslim, and that those who said yes would be turned away. In May, with the Republican nomination his, Mr. Trump retreated slightly, now calling the ban merely an idea, not a proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary ban, it hasn\u2019t been called for yet,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis is just a suggestion until we find out what\u2019s going on. \u201d On June 13, Mr. Trump offered a slightly new formulation: The ban would be geographical, not religious, applying to \u201careas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies. \u201d But not just any kind of terrorism, he clarified on Twitter two hours later: The ban was only for nations \u201ctied to Islamic terror. \u201d Then, in Scotland last weekend, Mr. Trump said he would allow Muslims from allies like the United Kingdom to enter the United States. Mr. Trump, who supported abortion rights until 2011, has struggled to articulate his evolution to the   camp and has shown a lack of fluency on the details. Pressed by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews in March, he said that abortion should be banned and then said that women violating the ban should face \u201csome sort of punishment. \u201d He recanted within hours, saying that doctors who perform abortions should be held legally responsible women, he said, were the victims. On Monday, when the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that would have restricted access to abortions, many Republicans said the ruling was further evidence that a Republican president was needed to restore the court\u2019s conservative majority. But Mr. Trump, perhaps out of caution, remained silent. At a Republican presidential debate in November, Mr. Trump said that \u201cwages are too high,\u201d and that American workers will need to \u201cwork really hard\u201d if they want their incomes to rise. \u201cI hate to say it, but we have to leave it where it is,\u201d he said. Interviewed on CNN in May, Mr. Trump said he was \u201copen\u201d to raising the minimum wage, though he remained concerned about the ability of American companies to compete globally. \u201cI\u2019m very different from most Republicans,\u201d he said, acknowledging that the federal minimum wage of $7. 25 was too low. \u201cYou have to have something that you can live on. \u201d Mr. Trump was long known for his warmth toward gays, including Elton John, whose civil union he publicly applauded. But since he became a candidate, his views have meandered. He has consistently opposed   marriage, speaking out last year against the Supreme Court decision that legalized it, and pledging to work to overturn that ruling. In April, he thrilled some gay rights supporters when he weighed in on a transgender bathroom bill in North Carolina, saying that people should be allowed to use whatever restroom they felt comfortable in. But hours later, he said that states should make their own decisions. Then, after the June 12 massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Trump railed against the gunman for trying to hinder people\u2019s ability to \u201clove who they want and express their identity\u201d  \u2014   language lifted right out of the gay marriage movement. Mr. Trump rose to prominence by describing the United States\u2019 response to terrorism as flaccid. During a debate in February, he inched toward endorsing torture as a way to counteract the Islamic State\u2019s barbarism. \u201cNot since medieval times have people seen what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Trump said of hostages decapitated by the Islamic State. \u201cI would bring back waterboarding, and I\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. \u201d Later, he declared that \u201ctorture works,\u201d and called for killing the families of terrorists, a violation of international law. In March, he released a statement acknowledging the limitations imposed by laws and treaties and saying that he would not \u201corder our military or other officials to violate those laws. \u201d But just a day later, he told a crowd that he would seek to change the laws barring torture. \u201cWe\u2019re like a bunch of babies  \u2014   but we\u2019re going to stay within the laws,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to have those laws broadened. Because we\u2019re playing with two sets of rules  \u2014   their rules and our rules. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562865.3577046}
