Bias substituting for legitimate journalism is bad enough, disgracefully worse by featuring misinformation, distortions and lies about one candidate, while effusively praising the other undeservedly \u2013 highlighting nonexistent virtues for Hillary, suppressing negatives disqualifying her for any public office. \\nWhy haven\u2019t other major media reported the news Fox News anchor Bret Baier broke Wednesday night about likely indictment(s) from the FBI\u2019s Clinton Foundation probe \u2013 though not before it\u2019s completed weeks or months from now? The New York Times and Washington Post continue as lead Trump antagonists, one-sidedly promoting Hillary\u2019s candidacy, acting as virtual press agents. Times columnist Charles Blow calls him \u201can existential threat\u201d \u2013 based solely on his rhetoric. As a businessman, he has no public record \u2013 unlike clear evidence of Hillary\u2019s war crimes, racketeering and perjury. Lately, he\u2019s been staying on point in the campaign\u2019s late stages, diverging from his earlier bombast, apparently gaining support as November 8 approaches \u2013 likely why intense bashing persists along with drowning out negatives about Hillary, especially multiple FBI probes of her email scandal and racketeering foundation. Focusing solely on Trump, Blow writes as follows: Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a demagogue. Donald Trump is a sexist, misogynist, chauvinist pig. Donald Trump is a bully. Donald Trump is a cheat. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Donald Trump is a nativist. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign (attracts) anti-Semites, Nazis and white nationalists\u2026 Donald Trump (is a sexual molester), an unrepentant predator. \u2026Donald Trump is a lowlife degenerate\u2026\u201d Phew! \\nBlow apparently believes Hillary is America\u2019s sweetheart, saying she\u2019s \u201ctolerant.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cintoleran(t).\u201d She\u2019s \u201crespect(ful).\u201d He\u2019s \u201cdisrespect(ful).\u201d She\u2019s \u201ca politician with some flaws.\u201d He\u2019s \u201ca flaw threatening our politics\u2026America\u2019s existential threat.\u201d No legitimate editor would touch Blow\u2019s rubbish. Times editors featured it. \\nWaPo editors claim \u201cthe only way Trump can win\u201d is if voters forget or ignore what he\u2019s said. Despite lots of bombast earlier in the campaign, he\u2019s toned down his rhetoric, staying disciplined late in the campaign, and presented ideas on how he\u2019ll govern if elected, agree or disagree with him. \\nNo duopoly power aspirants for congressional seats and the nation\u2019s highest office represent popular interests \u2013 no matter what they say. With rare exceptions proving the rule, they all represent dirty business as usual. Voters have to decide from a deplorable array of unpalatable choices, especially for president. \\nTrump\u2019s main virtue is he\u2019s not Hillary. She threatens humanity with possible nuclear war. He\u2019d rather profit from planet earth than destroy it \u2013 and his business enterprises along with it. What type leader do you prefer at the most perilous time in world history? A simple choice for anyone valuing life over possible mass annihilation.
