He snapped a cellphone photo and added it to his collection of   propaganda popping up around the city. Canada is a remarkably open society, a legacy of liberal politicians who set the thinly populated country on the path of aggressive multiculturalism decades ago. Last week, Statistics Canada reported that by 2036, nearly half of all Canadians would be immigrants or the children of immigrants  \u2014   most of them what the country calls \u201cvisible minorities,\u201d which means nonwhite. That rapid transformation is stirring the most conservative elements of the white Canadian population, who see the country as their own, despite the fact that Europeans took the land from a patchwork of indigenous peoples who had long existed there. Few people believe that this stirring, which is moderate by United States standards, contributed directly the shooting Sunday inside Quebec City\u2019s largest mosque, in which six worshipers were killed and eight injured. And no evidence yet has emerged that the accused assailant, a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois university student, had ties to specific groups. But the attack has put many on guard that Canada\u2019s embrace of Muslim immigration is raising tensions. Even the most radical groups seem to sense that expressing extreme views can be dangerous. There are at least 100   extremist groups in Canada, according to two Canadian studies published last year, with most of them active in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. While their targets include gays and lesbians, Jews and other minorities, Muslims have faced a sizable amount of the hostility. In 2014, the last year for which statistics are available, Canadian police forces recorded 99 religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims  \u2014   up from 45 in 2012, according to Statistics Canada. Some critics have blamed Donald J. Trump\u2019s nationalistic language, but   extremism has long thrived in Canada among skinheads, white supremacists and others, said Barbara Perry, a global hate crime expert at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, Ontario, and the lead author of a report published last year in the journal Studies in Conflict  Terrorism. \u201cA lot of that sentiment has been there,\u201d said Ms. Perry, who said the internet has helped spread the ideology. Canada has witnessed a flurry of nationalist groups proliferating in recent years, including the Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist group that began in Finland. While the Canadian group has denied racist beliefs and members have participated in community foot patrols in cities like Edmonton and Vancouver, its main Canada Facebook page has   screeds and derogatory references to immigrants. The Canadian authorities have recorded thousands of   crimes in recent years, but Ms. Perry said Canadian law enforcement officials have played down the threat of   extremists, preferring instead to focus on Islamic terrorism. \u201cThat\u2019s where all the money and attention goes,\u201d she said. \u201cLaw enforcement officers in communities with a fairly well known   presence, they either denied they were there or that it was an issue. \u201d The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service declined to comment on actions they have taken to monitor and stop the spread of white nationalist groups, though the intelligence service has in the past minimized the movement\u2019s influence, telling the Canadian news media that \u201c  extremist circles appear to be fragmented and primarily pose a threat to public order and not to national security. \u201d   activists and others opposed to such views say the government has not done enough to protect vulnerable groups. In 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government repealed hate speech provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act, which supporters said hindered free speech. A federal court ruled that the provisions did not violate freedom of expression, but they have not been reinstated. Daniel Gallant, a former white supremacist from Vancouver who changed his views 15 years ago and is now a social worker and a law student, said widespread Canadian denial about the prevalence of   extremism was a major problem. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d he said. A 2016 telephone survey by the Canadian polling firm Forum Research found that in a random sampling of 1, 304 Canadians, Muslims were the focus of the most animosity in Quebec, where 48 percent of respondents expressed dislike of the religion. \u201cIt is clear from these findings that respondents in Quebec are the most likely to hold unfavorable feelings towards Jewish and Muslim people,\u201d said the firm\u2019s president, Lorne Bozinoff. Nowhere have those elements been as vocal as Quebec City. Handbills, posters and occasional demonstrations by such groups as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche (which translates roughly as \u201cpeople of original Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois stock\u201d) have proliferated in the city. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche\u2019s slogan is \u201cI exist, so I act,\u201d but as with fringe movements everywhere, it and other groups are most active behind the anonymity of the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to know their numbers,\u201d said St\u00e9phane   a sociology professor at Laval University who studies Quebec\u2019s far right, adding that there is a small core to each group and that the followers are less active. He said the movement has fragmented and   and groups have changed names for the past 20 years, although the recent surge in immigration has strengthened their cause. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing,\u201d he said. La Meute, a group that includes many Afghanistan war veterans, has gathered about 43, 000 followers since it started a closed Facebook page last year. The name means \u201cwolf pack\u201d in French, and its members are not politically virulent by United States standards but focus on concerns about Muslim immigration. At the other end of the scale are followers of L\u00e9gitime Violence, a proudly fascist heavy metal band that announces its concerts to a vetted list of fans and performs songs like \u201cFinal Solution,\u201d which is as subtle as it sounds. Other extremist groups in Quebec include Atalante Qu\u00e9bec Pegida Qu\u00e9bec, which is an offshoot of a German group and Soldiers of Odin. Calling these groups \u201cfar right\u201d may be a misnomer. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche says its members include people with different political beliefs, including socialists and libertarians. The common denominator is an opposition to immigration, particularly by Muslims. \u201cOur objective is not to shrink to a minority,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Tremblay, spokesman for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche. He says groups like his have helped to start a debate about immigration and multiculturalism that was \u201cunthinkable\u201d when the group formed 10 years ago. \u201cWe want to free the tongues of the people so they start thinking about this without the constraints of political correctness,\u201d he said. That conversation among largely anonymous   extremists exists in the broader context of a   talk radio culture in Quebec that has been critical of Muslim immigration and what it sees as a failure by Muslims to assimilate into Canadian culture. Talk radio of this stripe is rare elsewhere in Canada and is reminiscent, albeit far more mild, of the raucous   shows in the United States. The radio stations Radio X and FM93 are among those cited as giving voice to   activists. While their own commentary may be muted, they give a platform to   voices from sites like Point de Bascule, which means Tipping Point, and Poste de Veille, which translates roughly as \u201cWatchtower\u201d and whose website shows a pirate ship with a jihadist flag as its sail approaching Quebec City. One popular conspiracy theory links Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Muslim Brotherhood, a   group that supports the application of Islamic law in Muslim communities. Even Quebec City\u2019s mayor, R\u00e9gis Labeaume, who was visibly moved at a news conference on Monday while showing support for the Muslim community, has expressed frustration with some orthodox Muslim customs. In 2014, during interviews about the appearance of the \u201cburkini\u201d at community pools, he recalled one extremely hot summer day seeing a man dressed in shorts and sandals while his wife was wearing a full niqab  \u2014      covering including black gloves. Mayor Labeaume said his own wife had to hold him back from insulting the man and \u201cripping his head off. \u201d Many people have called for toning down the talk in the wake of Sunday\u2019s mosque shooting in a suburb of Quebec City by a professed immigration opponent. \u201cThe tone should definitely be more respectful on all sides,\u201d said Dominic Maurais, who hosts a show on Radio X and is a leading voice of Quebec\u2019s conservative talk shows. Mr. Maurais noted that he was  . \u201cHowever, we should all be careful about letting political correctness win over crucial, frank and essential discussions about radical Islam and Islamic values in our democracies,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche and Atalante Qu\u00e9bec issued a joint statement deploring the violence and calling the gunman deranged.'"}, "time": 1742563641.0320163}
