Deia, describe what happened to you. \\nDEIA SCHLOSBERG: Well, on October 11th, I was working as a climate reporter, as I\u2019ve done for years and years and years, as Josh and I were doing, and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team, when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand, people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So, there were\u2014there were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site, outside of Walhalla, as you said. I was\u2014I was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it\u2019s essential for journalists to\u2014journalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there\u2019s a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. \\nAMY GOODMAN: So when did the police come? \\nDEIA SCHLOSBERG: The police came after\u2014well, the activist that was doing the action, Michael, had called the company ahead of time to say that he was\u2014he was going to shut off the valve, so they could\u2014to give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile, the company notified the local police. So, after the valve was closed, they came in probably about 15 minutes. I had my camera set up on a tripod on the public road. And they told me I was arrested for being an accessory to a crime, at which point I was brought to the local jail . I figured it would\u2014things would just have to clear up once they realized what was\u2014 \\nAMY GOODMAN: So, they charged you with three felonies? \\nDEIA SCHLOSBERG: \u2014that I was just, you know, exercising my First Amendment\u2014 \\nAMY GOODMAN: What were the felonies? \\nDEIA SCHLOSBERG: Conspiracy\u2014they were all conspiracy charges: conspiracy to theft of public\u2014theft of property, conspiracy to theft of service and conspiracy of interfering with a public\u2014a critical public infrastructure. \\nAMY GOODMAN: And you face 45 years in jail? What is your comment on this? \\nDEIA SCHLOSBERG: What is my what? Sorry, the connection is\u2014 \\nAMY GOODMAN: What do say about this? \\nDEIA SCHLOSBERG: It\u2019s absolutely outrageous. Yeah, I mean, this is what I\u2014this is what I do for my living. This is what I\u2019ve done for years and years. There\u2019s absolutely no grounds for these charges. \\nRead more at: DemocracyNow.org Share: Rate:'"}, "time": 1742562285.9226282}
