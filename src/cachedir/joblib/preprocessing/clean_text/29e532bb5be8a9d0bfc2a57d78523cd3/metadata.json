And so, despite the crushing California results that rolled in for him on Tuesday night, despite the insurmountable delegate math and the growing pleas that he end his quest for the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the stage in Santa Monica and basked, bragged and vowed to fight on. In a speech of striking stubbornness, he ignored the   achievement of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who became the first woman in American history to clinch the presidential nomination of a major political party. Mr. Sanders waited until 15 minutes into his speech to utter Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name. He referred, almost in passing, to a telephone conversation in which he had congratulated her on her victories. At that, the crowd of more than 3, 000 inside an aging airport hangar booed loudly. Mr. Sanders did little to discourage them. Tuesday was, undeniably, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s night, a milestone for women in politics and civic life 95 years after the 19th Amendment guaranteed their right to vote. But by Wednesday morning, all eyes were on Mr. Sanders. Would he be generous or petulant? Would he let go or keep battling? At almost every turn, he was grudging toward Mrs. Clinton, passing up a chance to issue the kind of lengthy salute that many, in and out of the Democratic Party, had expected and craved. \u201cIt\u2019s a blown opportunity to build bridges that are going to be extremely important in the fall,\u201d said David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents, both Democratic and Republican. He worried that Mr. Sanders was becoming \u201ca grumpy old man. \u201d The raw math is brutal and indisputable: Mrs. Clinton has not just crossed the threshold of 2, 383 delegates needed to secure the nomination. As of Tuesday night, she had succeeded in winning a majority of pledged delegates, a majority of the states that have held primaries, and the popular vote. This would be the time, under normal circumstances, for a primary rival to acknowledge insurmountable odds, pay tribute to a prevailing opponent and begin the work of stitching together a divided political party. That was the conciliatory message that a vanquished Mrs. Clinton delivered eight years ago to the day, on June 7, 2008, four days after Barack Obama had sealed his party\u2019s nomination  \u2014   a contest that was mathematically closer than the one with Mr. Sanders now. \u201cWe all know this has been a tough fight,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at the time. \u201cBut the Democratic Party is a family. And now, it\u2019s time to restore the ties that bind us together. \u201d On Tuesday, she was effusive in her praise of Mr. Sanders and in her outreach to his supporters, mentioning him by name three times in her victory address in Brooklyn. \u201cLet there be no mistake,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSenator Sanders, his campaign, and the vigorous debate that we\u2019ve had about how to raise incomes, reduce inequality, increase upward mobility have been very good for the Democratic Party and for America. \u2019\u2019 But Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a revolutionary, is openly skeptical of the traditions and expectations that govern the party whose nomination he covets. Throughout his campaign, he has regarded the Democratic Party itself with suspicion and distrust. Party unity, it seems, is the farthest thing from his mind at the moment. Far from backing down, Mr. Sanders promised to take his campaign to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summer, raising the possibility that he could remain in the race, without ever conceding defeat, until July. \u201cWe will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get,\u201d Mr. Sanders thundered. Declaring that the movement he has begun is \u201cmore than Bernie,\u201d Mr. Sanders sounded at times messianic. \u201cOur vision,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be the future of America. \u201d Inside the airport hangar in Santa Monica, anger at Mrs. Clinton, and at the establishment she exemplifies, was visceral and abundant, overshadowing her electoral advantage and   night. Freddie Paull, a    filmmaker from Glendale, Calif. was not interested in milestones. He said he thought Mrs. Clinton was a crook. \u201cShe could be indicted literally tomorrow if the system is not corrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to see a woman in office,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I do not want to see Hillary Clinton in office, because she has no honor. \u201d Should Mr. Sanders drop out, he said, he was prepared to vote for Mr. Trump. Amid chants of \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d and loud boos as election results rolled in, Alison Bacon, an actress living in Los Angeles, assailed Mrs. Clinton for having proclaimed victory before the Democratic Party had formally bestowed it on her at the convention. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely unjust, undemocratic, \u201d she said. \u201cWhat kind of example is that setting?\u201d Of course, ending a campaign is always painful, especially one that so consistently defied expectations and openly challenged the political order. From its humble start in April 2015 outside the Capitol in Washington, in a sparsely attended and hurried announcement speech (\u201cWe don\u2019t have an endless amount of time,\u201d he warned the gathered reporters, \u201cI have to get back\u201d) Mr. Sanders built a rollicking national movement whose crowds,   and devotion upended the Democratic race. And Mr. Sanders was not merely a candidate to his supporters. With his Everyman appearance and unvarnished anger, he embodied the message that thrilled his followers: that it was time for working Americans to rise up and reclaim a country that was being corrupted by elites and their wealth. \u201cWhen we began this campaign a little over a year ago, we were considered to be a fringe campaign,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sanders said on Tuesday, adding wryly: \u201cI think that has changed, just a little bit. \u201d But even as he acknowledged a \u201cvery, very steep fight\u201d to winning his party\u2019s nomination, he did not signal an end for now  \u2014   still electrified, it seemed, by the crowds chanting his name. Howard Dean, a Democrat and a former governor of Vermont, can sympathize. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to concede,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are tired. You are cranky. You\u2019ve worked your butt off for two years. \u201d Nobody, Mr. Dean said, resisted ending a presidential campaign more than he did. Once a     he had a string of setbacks that left him feeling, by February 2004, much as Mr. Sanders does today: furious at an unfair system and determined to fight on. Then Al Gore called. Mr. Dean fulminated, uninterrupted, for 10 minutes, \u201cranting and raving,\u201d he recalled. But Mr. Gore, schooled in the art of painful concessions, was blunt. \u201cYou know, Howard,\u201d he said, \u201cThis is not really about you. This is about the country. \u201d Mr. Dean, taking the advice to heart, quit the campaign a few days later. \u201cThe minute he said it,\u201d Mr. Dean recalled, \u201cI looked like an idiot to myself. \u201d He said he wonders whether Mr. Sanders will heed the warning. \u201cBernie has changed politics, but his changes are not going to be realized unless he leads  \u2014   and leading is not going to mean tilting at windmills at the convention,\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cHe has to switch into the mode of a statesman. \u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t get any points for carrying on or complaining about it,\u201d Mr. Dean added. \u201cYou get points for sucking it up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563709.511954}
