Even the Prime Minister is said to have been abused during University initiations, Coalition negotiations and once at a dinner party by Rebekah Brooks \u2018high on horse tranquilisers\u2019. \\nOne MP, who did not want to be identified but who is the Right Honourable Member for Tatton, said: \u2018Looking back at 44yrs of being a Tory, I\u2019ve realised that it\u2019s been non-stop bullying and preppy haircuts. I was emotionally abused by the hired help. Verbally abused by the electorate. And Vince Cable once put me in a headlock\u2019. \\nIronically many severed animal parts may also have been on the receiving end of Tory hectoring or unwelcome coitus. Injury lawyers are anticipating a plethora of claims to be made by family members of animals forced into participating in Bullingdon Club rituals or photo opportunities. One spurious claim is that Boris Johnson, in 1989, may have swallowed half a dozen goldfish without \u2018prior consent\u2019, mistaking them for \u2018salty table mints\u2019. \\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \u2018Grant Shapps has been forced to resign, which is ironically an example of when bullying works to everyone\u2019s benefit. However if you think you may have been mis-sold a PPI experience (or Porcum Penetratio Interrumpere as it is known) then please phone a lawyer or Lord Ashcroft \u2013 as he likes that sort of thing.\u2019   8th, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe   From The Archives 0'"}, "time": 1742563313.111135}
