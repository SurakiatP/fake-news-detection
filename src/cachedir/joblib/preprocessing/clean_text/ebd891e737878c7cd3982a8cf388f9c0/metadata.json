Recipient Name Recipient Email => \\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime,\u201d says Donald Trump. \\nHerewith, a dissent. Whatever happens Tuesday, Trump has made history and has forever changed American politics. \\nThough a novice in politics, he captured the Party of Lincoln with the largest turnout of primary voters ever, and he has inflicted wounds on the nation\u2019s ruling class from which it may not soon recover. \\nBush I and II, Mitt Romney, the neocons and the GOP commentariat all denounced Trump as morally and temperamentally unfit. Yet, seven of eight Republicans are voting for Trump, and he drew the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of any GOP nominee. \\nNot only did he rout the Republican elites, he ash-canned their agenda and repudiated the wars into which they plunged the country. \\nTrump did not create the forces that propelled his candidacy. But he recognized them, tapped into them, and unleashed a gusher of nationalism and populism that will not soon dissipate. \\nWhatever happens Tuesday, there is no going back now. \\nHow could the Republican establishment advance anew the trade and immigration policies that their base has so thunderously rejected? \\nHow can the GOP establishment credibly claim to speak for a party that spent the last year cheering a candidate who repudiated the last two Republican presidents and the last two Republican nominees? \\nDo mainstream Republicans think that should Trump lose a Bush Restoration lies ahead? The dynasty is as dead as the Romanovs. \\nThe media, whose reputation has sunk to Congressional depths, has also suffered a blow to its credibility. \\nIts hatred of Trump has been almost manic, and WikiLeaks revelations of the collusion between major media and Clintonites have convinced skeptics that the system is rigged and the referees of democracy are in the tank. \\nBut it is the national establishment that has suffered most. \\nThe Trump candidacy exposed what seems an unbridgeable gulf between this political class and the nation in whose name it purports to speak. \\nConsider the litany of horrors it has charged Trump with. \\nHe said John McCain was no hero, that some Mexican illegals are \u201crapists.\u201d He mocked a handicapped reporter. He called some women \u201cpigs.\u201d He wants a temporary ban to Muslim immigration. He fought with a Gold Star mother and father. He once engaged in \u201cfat-shaming\u201d a Miss Universe, calling her \u201cMiss Piggy,\u201d and telling her to stay out of Burger King. He allegedly made crude advances on a dozen women and starred in the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape with Billy Bush. \\nWhile such \u201cgaffes\u201d are normally fatal for candidates, Trump\u2019s followers stood by him through them all. \\nWhy? asks an alarmed establishment. Why, in spite of all this, did Trump\u2019s support endure? Why did the American people not react as they once would have? Why do these accusations not have the bite they once did? \\nAnswer. We are another country now, an us-or-them country. \\nMiddle America believes the establishment is not looking out for the nation but for retention of its power. And in attacking Trump it is not upholding some objective moral standard but seeking to destroy a leader who represents a grave threat to that power. \\nTrump\u2019s followers see an American Spring as crucial, and they are not going to let past boorish behavior cause them to abandon the last best chance to preserve the country they grew up in. \\nThese are the Middle American Radicals, the MARs of whom my late friend Sam Francis wrote. \\nThey recoil from the future the elites have mapped out for them and, realizing the stakes, will overlook the faults and failings of a candidate who holds out the real promise of avoiding that future. \\nThey believe Trump alone will secure the borders and rid us of a trade regime that has led to the loss of 70,000 factories and 5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. They believe Trump is the best hope for keeping us out of the wars the Beltway think tanks are already planning for the sons of the \u201cdeplorables\u201d to fight. \\nMoreover, they see the establishment as the quintessence of hypocrisy. Trump is instructed to stop using such toxic phrases as \u201cAmerica First\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by elites who think 55 million abortions since Roe is a milestone of moral progress. \\nAnd what do they have in common with a woman who thinks partial-birth abortion, which her predecessor in the Senate, Pat Moynihan, called \u201cinfanticide,\u201d is among the cherished \u201creproductive rights\u201d of women? \\nWhile a Trump victory would create the possibility of a coalition of conservatives, populists, patriots and nationalists governing America, should he lose, America\u2019s future appears disunited and grim. \\nBut, would the followers of Donald Trump, whom Hillary Clinton has called \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2026 bigots,\u201d to the cheers of her media retainers, unite behind her should she win? \\nNo. Win or lose, as Sen. Edward Kennedy said at the Democratic Convention of 1980, \u201cThe work goes on, the cause endures.\u201d \\nPatrick J. Buchanan is the author of the new book \u201cThe Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority.\u201d \\nCopyight 2016 Creators.com.\""}, "time": 1742563563.8484342}
