No? Neither is your Prime Minster. Today Theresa May did what every true leader does in a crisis \u2013 which is to turn everyone\u2019s attention to meaningless ephemera; like poppies, Grammar Schools and who should present the new \u2018Bake-off\u2019? \\nTaking a break from quashing the Orgreave Inquiry, Mrs May said FIFA\u2019s stance of not politicizing sport was \u2018outrageous\u2019. A spokeswoman explained: \u2018In these times of austerity, we need cheap, meaningless gestures accompanied by hollow outrage. If over-paid under-achieving footballers are not allowed to wear a poppy \u2013 then the terrorists have won. It\u2019s a known fact that Afghan jihadists fear the poppy\u2026although admittedly 80% of their income is based on the opium trade\u2026um\u2026er\u2026I may not have thought this through\u2026\u2019 \\nArmed police are expected to patrol our streets, opening fire on anyone not wearing a poppy or failing to whistle the tune from \u2018The Dambusters\u2019. A Police Inspector remarked: \u2018We may be perpetuating a mawkishly sentimental view of war but don\u2019t think for a second you can get away with recycling last year\u2019s poppy \u2013 we\u2019re wise to that dodge!\u2019 \\nWithout a doubt this is the most important issue of 2016 \u2013 whether 22 footballers can wear poppies for 90 minutes in a stadium filled with 60,000 people wearing poppies. Some cynics have suggested Theresa May\u2019s use of misdirection in these troubled times, is the political equivalent of David Copperfield pulling an elephant out his arse. Her spokeswoman countered: \u2018The important thing is to remember those who sacrificed their lives in war\u2013 rather than the reasons behind it or making sure it never happens again\u2019.
