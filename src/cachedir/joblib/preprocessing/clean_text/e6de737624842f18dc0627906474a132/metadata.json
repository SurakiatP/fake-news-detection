Members of the opposition Labour Party are wondering if their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will save them or plunge the party into irrelevancy. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening in today\u2019s Brexit news: \u2022 Among the Conservatives, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, has decided not to run to replace David Cameron as party leader (and therefore prime minister). That leaves the favorite as Home Secretary Theresa May, but Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has also thrown his hat in the ring. A leaked email showed Mr. Gove\u2019s wife to be no fan of Mr. Johnson, and both candidates criticized him while announcing their candidacy. Plenty of others plan to run as well. \u2022 On the opposition side, Labour is not happy with its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who appears more concerned with remaking the party into a revolutionary socialist movement than achieving power. Members of Parliament, including Mr. Corbyn\u2019s predecessor as party leader, want him to resign. He has refused. The party is also awaiting the release of an internal investigation into claims of  . \u2022 Where could it all lead? Steven Erlanger, the London bureau chief for The New York Times, says there could be an early general election in Britain. \u2022 The Bank of England may be forced to cut a key interest rate this summer as it grapples with economic uncertainty created by Brexit, Mark Carney, the central bank\u2019s governor, said on Thursday. \u201cIt now seems plausible that uncertainty could remain elevated for some time, with a greater drag on activity than we had previously projected,\u201d Mr. Carney said. He added that, in his view, \u201cthe economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u201d though he was careful to say he was not prescribing what other members of the bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee would eventually decide. \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,\u201d he said. \u2022 A new runway at Heathrow Airport in London won\u2019t be decided on until a new prime minister is in place, the BBC reports. The Financial Times has published a \u201cbusiness tracker\u201d on how companies are responding to the vote. \u2022 A series of tweets by the Economist Intelligence Unit outlines the negative possibilities for the British economy. \u2022 In the markets, the pound was mostly flat in morning trading in London. British stocks, which had fallen sharply after the referendum result on Friday morning, closed above their   levels on Wednesday. The same goes for share prices in Continental Europe. \u2022 Internet search patterns indicate many people are still looking up what \u201cBrexit\u201d is and what it means to leave the European Union. Plenty is still unknown, but we have an article that explains the basics. \u2022 Tony Blair\u2019s former chief of staff wrote in The Guardian that Britain\u2019s withdrawal can still be reversed, but that it will take courage. An academic wrote on Medium that most English and Welsh lawmakers would have to go against the wishes of their constituents. \u2022 Is the European Union \u201cdemocratic\u201d? Campaigners who sought to leave the bloc said it was not, but my colleague Amanda Taub argues it is  \u2014   it just doesn\u2019t feel that way. Philip Stephens, looking at another European country that had an   portmanteau, worries in The Financial Times that Britain is behaving more like Greece. \u2022 Could Britain\u2019s influence in Hong Kong wane? The Guardian\u2019s Beijing correspondent asks if Britain\u2019s fledgling \u201cgolden relationship\u201d with China could be in jeopardy. And in China, a censorship notice has told editors not to \u201chype the story, speculate or comment\u201d on the exit. There will be plenty more to come throughout the day.'"}, "time": 1742561746.5959744}
