And don\u2019t get me started on that adorable thing you do, pretending people living in squalor openly on the streets and down lanes just don\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Mackey added, full of effusive praise. \\nAs dictated by the \u2018America is better than us\u2019 provision in the constitution, the Irish media are obligated to report en masse when an American is praising Ireland in any shape or form, which has resulted in huge coverage of Mr. Mackey\u2019s thoughts on the unique charm of Dublin city\u2019s degradation and poverty. However, there is no obligation to mention the fact Mr. Mackey has been robbed three times during his visit. \\nTourism Ireland has yet to confirm if they will fine the American for straying outside the designated tourist zones. Each street thought to contain anything unpalatable which approaches conveying the reality of Dublin in 2016 is marked by a no tourist sign which consists of a large X through an image of an overweight American clutching money. \\n\u201cWe have no idea what Mr. Mackey is talking about, has he visited the Leprechaun Museum yet?\u201d A Dublin tourism spokesperson confirmed.'"}, "time": 1742562260.3478022}
