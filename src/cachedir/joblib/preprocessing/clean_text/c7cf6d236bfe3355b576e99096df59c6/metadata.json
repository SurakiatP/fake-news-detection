[Playing for Chino Hills High School, LaMelo Ball went on a tear with a drive to score nearly two thirds of all the points his team earned in its February 7   win over Los Osos, according to the Kansas City Star.  The player\u2019s father said LaMelo \u201cwent crazy\u201d with a spree of baskets after having already scored 29 points by halftime. @MELOD1P drops 92!! (That\u2019s a Ball Family record) in the @basketball_chhs win over Lososos   final @latsondheimer @SGVNSports pic. twitter.   \u2014   Tommy Kiss (@TomKiss64) February 8, 2017,  Ball\u2019s father also noted that LaMelo\u2019s brother, LiAngelo, is usually the top scoring member of the family but LiAngelo wasn\u2019t playing that night. Still, some folks in the district are unhappy with the amazing feat saying that the Ball brothers are ruining team efforts and turning games into star vehicles. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d Los Osos coach Dave Smith said. \u201cIt goes against everything CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) stands for. The Ball boys are very talented and great players, but it\u2019s embarrassing to high school athletics. I\u2019ve been coaching for 35 years, and we\u2019ve turned high school athletics into individualism. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to watch a kid score that many points. But it\u2019s tough to say that\u2019s what CIF athletics is about,\u201d Smith concluded. There is still a   record to beat, though. The high school scoring record is still held by Danny Heater of Burnsville (W. Va.) High School, who scored 135 points in one game back in 1960.
