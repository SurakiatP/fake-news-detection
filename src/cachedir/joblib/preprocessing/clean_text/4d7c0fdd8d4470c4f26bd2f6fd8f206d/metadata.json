This technique would make female patients little uncomfortable. Rene Laennec was a very shy person. Once he was examining an overweight woman. He found it difficult to hear her hear sounds. To hear heartbeats of that lady, he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest. This inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope. \\nGoogle Doodle For Rene Laennec \u2013 On February 17th, 2016, Rene Laennec would have celebrated his 235th birthday.
