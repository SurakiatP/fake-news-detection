Since the June referendum, many who voted for withdrawal from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, have brushed off concerns that a recession was possible or that car manufacturers and banks based in the country might leave. They have even celebrated the pound\u2019s recent fall to a   low, arguing that a weaker currency is good for exporters. But they probably never thought it would come to this. Fears that Marmite and other British classics, like the PG Tips brand of tea, might disappear from store shelves had gripped Britons after reports that the supermarket chain Tesco and the owner of those brands, the   consumer goods company Unilever, were locked in a price dispute over who should bear the cost of the weakening pound. Marmite was briefly unavailable in Tesco\u2019s online market, and store supplies dwindled. The pound has fallen drastically against other major currencies since the vote to leave the bloc, and as worries have increased that Britain would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d  \u2014   shorthand for a strict break with the European Union  \u2014   which could limit its   access to the region\u2019s single market for goods and services. But after the markets closed on Thursday, Tesco reassured the public that the crisis had been averted. In a statement, Tesco said, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased this situation has been resolved to our satisfaction. \u201d In reality, consumers will most likely have to dig deeper into their pocketbooks. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, said during an earnings call on Thursday that \u201cprices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling. \u201d Still, the concerns over the beloved consumer goods led to a political uproar. \u201cWho would have thought that the first casualty of a hard Brexit would be the nation\u2019s supplies of Marmite?\u201d asked Pete Wishart, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party, which campaigned to remain in the European Union. On Twitter, Britons wryly noted that store shelves were emptied of Marmite jars, and one used jar was put up for sale on eBay for 100, 000 pounds, or about $122, 000. News bulletins on the BBC led with the possible Marmite shortage. \u201cThis is a concrete case of Brexit affecting people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International. \u201cTalk of Brexit had been more political, financial and a bit abstract\u201d before, she added. \u201cThis touches their lives. \u201d Among the affected brands is Colman\u2019s Mustard, which, like Marmite, is produced in Britain. Analysts noted that although Marmite and some of the other affected brands were made in Britain, Unilever published its company results in euros, meaning that those products were still affected by a weaker pound. Imported household goods like Dove soap and Ben  Jerry\u2019s ice cream are also under the Unilever umbrella. In 2011, Tesco refused to stock Branston Pickle after another supplier, Premier Foods, tried to pass on cost increases. Analysts have predicted that food prices will start to rise across the board in the coming months as supermarkets struggle to absorb the extra cost of imported goods, which are more expensive when a currency weakens. Stores have already stopped promotions and discounts on their products, Ms. Hosafci said. But \u201cprice increases will start happening in the next four to five months, when they will need to renew their stocks. \u201d \u201cEventually, they\u2019ll need to increase prices,\u201d she added. \u201cOtherwise, their businesses will no longer be profitable. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628520.428517}
