You need Nathan Carter,\u201d RT\u00c9 insisted with a crazed look in its eyes, as it was surrounded in a supportive and safe environment by those who care about it the most. \\nRT\u00c9 confirmed plans to launch a third channel, RT\u00c9 Nathan Carter, later this year in a misguided attempt to cater for the Carter mad public that only exists as a figment of the national broadcaster\u2019s mind. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been told, but we didn\u2019t ask for this,\u201d a confused and slightly irritated Nation explained to RT\u00c9 as it tried to wriggle free from its restraints, unwilling to engage in the intervention. \\n\u201cIf we let you go, you have to promise not to commission a ten-part series called Nathan Carter\u2019s Favourite Days of The Week or some shite like that,\u201d the Nation added, still weary of the Carter obsessed broadcaster. \\nBREAKING: RT\u00c9 have commissioned a four hour documentary called Nathan Carter\u2019s Wagon Wheel, which will just involve the country singer singing Wagon Wheel for 240 minutes uninterrupted.'"}, "time": 1742563527.4889128}
