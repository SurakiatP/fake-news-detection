[Obama made his remarks in the context of a discussion of race relations and whether or not they had gotten better or worse during his presidency.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to say that race relations have gotten worse,\u201d he said, blaming social media, smart phones, and the internet for \u201csurfacing\u201d more incidents of racial violence. \u201cWhat we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\u201d he said in an interview with local Chicago station CBS 2. \u201cWhether it\u2019s tensions between police and communities, hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook. \u201d The suspects, Jordan Hill, 18 Tesfaye Cooper, 18 Brittany Covington, 18 and Tanishia Covington, 24 were charged with criminal hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping as well as other felony charges, according to NBC News.  Obama also discussed the horrifying incident in an interview with Chicago\u2019s ABC7. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so part of technology allows us to see now is the terrible toll that racism and discrimination and hate takes on families and communities. But that\u2019s part of how we learn and how we get better. \u201d Obama argued that it was alarming to see the new images on social media, but that it would help society root out the scourge of racism. \u201cWe don\u2019t benefit from pretending that racism doesn\u2019t exist and hate doesn\u2019t exist, we don\u2019t benefit from not talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them. \u201d Obama remained convinced that race relations were getting better, citing the Council Wars in Chicago when he first arrived in 1985. \u201cI promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562833.8977509}
