After three days his remains were discovered to be missing and Jesus was said to have appeared over a span of 40 days before ascending into heaven.\\nThe discovery was made by a team of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens (NTU) who were making restorations to the Edicule (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153little house\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d), a structure which had been built around the tomb.\\nThe tomb was found underneath this Crypt at the Sepulchre Church. Throughout the years there have been many conspiracies about the location of Jesus\u2019s tomb but the Christian Orthodox Church has always maintained that the tomb is underneath Sepulchre Church.\\nResearchers now hope to study the original surface to better understand the original tomb and how it evolved to become one of the most sacred sites in Christendom.\\n\u201cWe are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the Edicule,\u201d Chief Scientific Supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou told National Geographic. \u201cThe techniques we\u2019re using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of Christ.\u201d\\nThe newly-uncovered surface was described as having a grey-beige stone surface.\\nAlso known as the Church of the Resurrection, its custody is shared between six Christian denominations including the Greek Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church, whom together invited the NTU to undertake the restoration.\\nAt a cost of US$4 million, (\u00e2\u201a\u01793.7 million) the restoration was not cheap, with major donors including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and Mica Ertegun, widow of Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun.\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742563185.6024733}
