Sawing the air with his tiny hands in a unmistakeably Hitlerian manner, he spat out a series of undeniably hateful anti-Semitic code words \u2026 like \u201cpolitical establishment,\u201d \u201cglobal elites\u201d and, yes, \u201cinternational banks.\u201d He even went so far as to claim that \u201ccorporations\u201d and their (ahem) \u201clobbyists\u201d have millions of dollars at stake in this election, and are trying to pass the TTP, not to benefit the American people, but simply to enrich themselves. He then went on to accuse the media of collaborating with \u201cthe Clinton machine,\u201d presumably to benefit these \u201cglobal elites\u201d and \u201cinternational banks\u201d and \u201clobbyists.\u201d \\nNow, a lot of folks didn\u2019t immediately recognize the secret meanings of these fascistic code words, and so mistakenly assumed that \u201cglobal elites\u201d referred to the transnational capitalist ruling classes, and that \u201clobbyists\u201d referred to actual lobbyists, and that \u201cbanks\u201d meant \u2026 well \u2026 you know, banks. As it turned out, this was completely wrong. None of these words actually meant what they meant, not in anti-Semitic CodeSpeak. So the mainstream media translated for us. \u201cPolitical establishment\u201d meant \u201cthe Jews.\u201d \u201cGlobal elites\u201d also meant \u201cthe Jews.\u201d \u201cBanks\u201d meant \u201cJews.\u201d \u201cLobbyists\u201d meant \u201cJews.\u201d Even \u201ccorporate media,\u201d meant \u201cJews.\u201d Apparently, Trump\u2019s entire speech was a series of secret dog-whistle signals to his legions of neo-Nazi goons, who, immediately following Clinton\u2019s victory, are going to storm out of their hidey holes, frontally attack the US military, overthrow the US government, and, yes, you guessed it \u2026 \u201ckill the Jews.\u201d \\nOK, maybe I\u2019m exaggerating the mainstream media\u2019s reaction just a little bit. Or maybe Trump\u2019s speech really was that fascistic. Judge for yourself. Read the transcript. ( NPR offers a complete version of it here. ) Then compare the reactions of The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , Washington Post , The Inquirer , The Guardian , and other leading broadsheets, and magazines and blogs like Mother Jones , Forward , Slate , Salon , Vox , Alternet , and a host of others, most of which rely on Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League and former Special Assistant to the President, as their authoritative source on Trumpian cryptology. (Mr. Greenblatt, incidentally, should know better, given the treatment he has received from hard-line Zionist publications for refusing to demonize Black Lives Matter, and for \u201ctaking sides against\u201d the State of Israel.) \\nLook, I\u2019m not defending Donald Trump, who I consider a self-aggrandizing idiot and a soulless huckster of the lowest order, and whose supporters include a lot of real anti-Semites, and racists, and misogynists, and other such creeps. I\u2019m simply trying to point out how the corporate media have, for months, been playing the same hysterical tune like an enormous Goebbelsian keyboard instrument, and how millions of Americans are singing along (as they were before the invasion of Iraq, which posed no threat to the USA , but which according to the media had WMDs), and how terribly fucking disturbing that is. In case you didn\u2019t instantly recognize it, the name of the tune is \u201cThis guy is Hitler!\u201d and it isn\u2019t the short vulgarian fingers of Donald Trump that are tickling the ivories. And no, it isn\u2019t \u201cthe Jews\u201d either. It\u2019s the corporate media, and the corporations that own them, and the rest of the global capitalist ruling classes \u2026 in other words, those \u201cglobal elites.\u201d \\nThe thing I find particularly disturbing is how these rather mundane observations \u2014 i.e., (a) that a global ruling class exists, (b) that it\u2019s primarily corporate in character, (c) that this class is pursuing its interests and not the interests of sovereign states \u2014 how such observations are being stigmatized as the ravings of unhinged anti-Semites. This stigmatization is not limited to Trumpists. Anyone to the left of Clinton is now, apparently, an anti-Semite. For example, Roger Cohen, in The New York Times , riding the tsunami of condemnation of the insidious verbiage of Trump\u2019s West Palm speech, executed an extended smear-job on Jeremy Corbyn and his \u201cCorbynistas\u201d (they\u2019re fond of coining these epithets, the media), denouncing their virulent \u201canti-Americanism,\u201d \u201canti-Capitalism,\u201d \u201canti-globalism,\u201d and \u201canti-Semitic anti-Zionism.\u201d \\nWhich, let me hasten to add, and stress, and underscore, and repeatedly emphasize, is not to imply that the Labour Party, or the British Left, or the American Left, or any other Left, is anti-Semitism-free. Of course not. There are anti-Semites everywhere. That isn\u2019t the point. Or it isn\u2019t my point. \\nMy point is that this stigmatization campaign is part of a much larger ideological project, one that has little to do with Trump, or Jeremy Corbyn, or their respective parties. Smearing one\u2019s political opponents is nothing new, of course, it\u2019s as old as the hills. But what we\u2019re witnessing is more than smears. As I proposed in these pages back in July , political dissent is being gradually pathologized (i.e., stigmatized as aberrant or \u201cabnormal\u201d behavior, as opposed to a position meriting discussion). Consider the abnormalization of Sanders, back when he was talking about \u201cbanks,\u201d \u201cglobal elites,\u201d and other things that matter, or the media\u2019s portrayal of British voters as racists in the wake of the Brexit referendum. And, yes, the charges being leveled against Trump, much as we might despise the man. Anti-Semitism, inciting violence, paranoid conspiracy theorizing, insurrection, treason, et cetera \u2014 these are not legitimate arguments one needs to counter with superior arguments; they are symptoms of deviations from a norm, signs of criminality or pathology, which is increasingly how the corporate ruling classes are dismissing anyone who attempts to challenge them. \\nA line is being drawn in the ideological sand. On one side of it are the decent people, the normal people, in their business wear, with their university degrees, and prescriptions, and debts. On the other side are \u2026 well, the deplorables, the ignorant, racist, anti-Semitic, neo-nationalist, populist extremists. This line cuts through both the Left and the Right \u2026 supersedes both Left and Right, making bedfellows of supposed adversaries like Obama, Clinton, Kagan, Wolfowitz, Scowcroft, and their ilk on the Normal team, and a motley crew of Trumpists, Putinists, European populists, Corbynistas, Sandernistas, socialists, anarchists, Wikileakers, anti-Zionists, anti-capitalists, neo-Nazis, Black Lives Matterers, angry Greek pensioners, environmental activists, religious zealots, the Klu Klux Klan, David Graeber, most of the contributors to CounterPunch, and various other \u201cextremist\u201d types, many of whom detest each other, in the Deplorables\u2019 current starting line-up. \\nThe corporate media is sending a message \u2026 a message aimed at a much broader audience than undecided American voters (assuming such creatures really exist). The message is, \u201cget with the fucking program, or get stigmatized as an anti-Semite, or a racist, or a Russian spy, or whatever.\u201d The message is, \u201cdrop the populist rhetoric, shut the hell up about the Wall Street banks, and the corporations, and the \u2018one percent,\u2019 and \u2026 actually \u2026 forget about politics completely, except for identity politics, of course. Go ahead and knock yourself out with that.\u201d The message is, \u201cyou\u2019re either with us or against us \u2026 and it doesn\u2019t matter why you\u2019re against us, or what it is you think you\u2019re for. Right, Left \u2026 who gives a shit? It\u2019s one big Basket of Deplorables to us.\u201d \\nThis message, of course, displays many of the hallmarks of the classic authoritarian mentality, the need for nearly total conformity, mindless allegiance to one\u2019s so-called superiors, delegitimization of all opposing viewpoints, and the infantile type of hero-worship figures like Obama and Clinton inspire \u2026 not the old-fashioned authoritarianism that would-be despots like Trump represent, but, rather, a more attractive version, a hopey, changey, lovey version, where there are no frightening Hitlerian leaders barking out anti-Semitic code words, and no one is exterminating thousands of people in faraway countries they want to destabilize in order to entirely dominate the region. No, this is the version where Obama sells the TPP on the Jimmy Fallon show, and wars of aggression are not wars of aggression, but \u201chumanitarian interventions.\u201d It\u2019s also the version where universal healthcare is, regrettably, \u201cunrealistic,\u201d but $38 billion for the State of Israel so it can operate its Apartheid State, and weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, so they can bomb the shit out of farmers in Yemen, and cut off people\u2019s heads for blasphemy, is somehow in \u201cAmerica\u2019s vital interests.\u201d \\nBut what do I know? I\u2019m just a satirist. I should probably leave all this complex stuff, like what is and isn\u2019t in my interest, and what words really mean and all that, to the experts in the mainstream media. Since they did so well decoding Trump\u2019s speech, maybe they could translate some of these other code words I\u2019ve been having trouble with, like the ones I put in scare quotes above, or other such code words, like \u201cenemy combatant,\u201d \u201cfree trade agreement,\u201d \u201csecurity barrier,\u201d \u201cindefinite detention,\u201d \u201ctargeted killing,\u201d or \u201ctroubled asset relief program.\u201d \\nI could go on, but I probably shouldn\u2019t. Odds are, I\u2019m already on the list of Putin-worshiping, anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, neo-nationalist, non-standing up for the National Anthem, conspiracy theorizing America-haters. The last thing I need to do at this point is start jabbering about how the United States is an authoritarian corporatist dystopia ruled by a global capitalist elite that couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about Americans (or any other actual people living in any other actual countries), where the corporate media can whip up mass fanatical support for wars of aggression, or corporate puppets, by pointing their fingers at yet another bogeyman and shouting \u201cHitler\u201d at the top of their lungs. Next thing you know I\u2019d be writing about \u201cbanks,\u201d and \u201cglobal corporations,\u201d and \u201cnational sovereignty,\u201d and we all know what that\u2019s about, don\u2019t we? \\nC.
