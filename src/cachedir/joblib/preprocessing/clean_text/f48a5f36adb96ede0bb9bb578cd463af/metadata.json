Readler of Jones Day wrote in a legal filing in Ohio earlier this week. \\n\u201cThis case is one of four coordinated attacks across the country that are clearly long-planned efforts to sow chaos in the Defendants\u2019 political efforts, while garnering maximum publicity for Plaintiff\u2019s unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims on the eve of the Presidential Election,\u201d Readler added. \\nAccording to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Friday, Trump\u2019s support has increased in 24 states and decreased in 11 over the past week. In comparison, support for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has grown in 13 states and lessened in 22. Related Posts: Afraid of What?
