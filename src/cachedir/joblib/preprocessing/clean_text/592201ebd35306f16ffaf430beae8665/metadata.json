What\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem? Chris London Dear Chris, My dad\u2019s had a great idea for Channel 4\u2019s new direction with Bake-Off. Instead of all this old lady nonsense about Victoria sponges and gingham and witty lesbians, the new version should be called \u2018The Great British Man-Off\u2019 and it\u2019ll be a load of competitive middle aged blokes being bawdy and doing manly stuff like re-sealing the bath and shouting at the radio and getting frustrated with tools. Everyone on the show will be worried about going bald and every episode will end with an embarrassing scuffle in a pub car park. Hope that helps,\""}, "time": 1742561648.1850533}
