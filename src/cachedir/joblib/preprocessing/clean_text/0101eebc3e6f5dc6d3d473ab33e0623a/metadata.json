FOX NEWS: TUCKER CARLSON TO MOVE TO 8PM SLOT, THE FIVE SHIFTS TO 9PM pic. twitter.   \u2014   Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) April 19, 2017,  *** The Murdoch family has reportedly decided to pull The O\u2019Reilly Factor off air amid allegations of sexual harassment against   host Bill O\u2019Reilly, and will soon be officially announcing his departure, according to sources close to Gabriel Sherman in New York magazine. According to Sherman, the decision was primarily driven by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan, after The New York Times reported earlier this month that $13 million has been paid out from either Fox News or O\u2019Reilly to five women to settle their sexual harassment claims against the host in lieu of litigation, despite O\u2019Reilly\u2019s denying the veracity of their claims. Fox News executives are reportedly meeting on Wednesday to discuss how to contain any damage from an O\u2019Reilly dismissal. O\u2019Reilly, who is currently on vacation, has hosted the network\u2019s most popular show  \u2014   The O\u2019Reilly Factor  \u2014   since the network\u2019s inception in 1996 and remains the country\u2019s   cable news host. Sherman reports that \u201cthe board of Fox News\u2019 parent company, 21st Century Fox, is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the matter. \u201d Decisions are now being made as to whether O\u2019Reilly will be allowed a final show to bid farewell to his audience. They are also discussing the terms of his release, with O\u2019Reilly recently having signed a new   $20 million a year contract. Executives within the company are also discussing who will fill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s primetime 8 pm slot, with hosts such as Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Tucker Carlson currently under consideration. Over 90 companies dropped advertising on The O\u2019Reilly Factor over the allegations, while a small group of feminist protesters gathered outside the Fox News headquarters in New York calling on the network to fire O\u2019Reilly. Last year, Fox News\u2019 longtime chairman Roger Ailes resigned over claims of sexual harassment against several female staff members, including former hosts Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly.
