(Image via intoday.in) \\nThe former IBN7 editor described his emotional experience to The UnReal Times , but not before asking \u201cThe Modi\u201d to answer for his own emotional outburst. \u201cThere is the Youtube video of the deff babie who is able to hear the human voices, including his own, for the first time, after being fitted with the hereing aide. The babie\u2019s joy is just prizeless !!! That is exactly how I felt when I was able to hear my own voice on the Newshour for the first time !!! Not only that, I was also able to fully complite my sentence without any interruptions !!! It\u2019s an unbelivable feeling !!! My wife told me that the Mogu and the Chhotu also started crying on seeing me crying on the TV !!!\u201d The Ashutosh exclaimed. \\nRecounting his earlier experiences on the Arnab era Newshour, the AAP spokesperson said, \u201cWith the Arnab, I could not hear my own voice and I still used to talk. Once in a while, the audiance wud laugh after I said something and I used to realize that way that I had said something stupid, like filibusting or simply \u2018the\u2019ing random people or things. Also, I figured out that I would never really be able to complete any sentence, so I started shortening my sentences to 2-3 words, like in the bank-e-scam episoade. Of course, soon later, AAP boycoatted the Arnab. Now, thank the God, there is no need for all these struggles !!! The journalism is back in the Times Now !!!\u201d \\nWhile being strong opponents in every other topic under the sun, in this regard, however, The Ashutosh found strong consonance from rival spokesperson, the BJP\u2019s Sambit Patra. \u201cI can fully understand what The Ashu went through and how he must\u2019ve also finally felt yesterday. I too, could often never hear what I myself used to squeal but soon enough, even though the topic would be in our favor, the hot seat would somehow shift to mine and I would often be blasted for something the Congress or the AAP did. Even though I haven\u2019t gone to the post-Arnab Newshour, I can fully feel what The Ashu feels,\u201d Patra added. \\nAccording to sources, the Congress party too, is mulling a return to The Newshour. \u201cBoy, I can\u2019t wait to return to the Newshour and finally be able to talk about 2002 at length,\u201d a thrilled Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha exclaimed.
