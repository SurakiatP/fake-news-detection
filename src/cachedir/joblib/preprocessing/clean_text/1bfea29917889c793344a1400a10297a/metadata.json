There was a lot to talk about. But instead, Ms. Keys spent most of her time talking about makeup (and not wearing it) with the anchors Tamron Hall, Billy Bush and Al Roker, who were doggedly wiping the pancake off their faces. \u201cYou\u2019re all crazy,\u201d said Ms. Keys, swabbing Ms. Hall\u2019s cheeks. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even what it\u2019s about!\u201d \u201cIt\u201d is #nomakeup  \u2014   a meme, a movement, a cri de coeur  \u2014   that has been roiling social media for months. If you missed the kerfuffle, it started in May, when Ms. Keys wrote an essay for Lenny, Lena Dunham\u2019s online magazine, about the insecurities she felt being a woman in the public eye, and the roles (and makeup) she put on over the years to armor herself. She wrote about the anxiety she endured if she left her house unadorned: \u201cWhat if someone wanted a picture? What if someone posted it?\u201d And then, when she went without makeup or styling for an album portrait, she felt liberated, and the act became a metaphor. \u201cI hope to God it\u2019s a revolution,\u201d she wrote. In the months that followed, Ms. Keys was seemingly everywhere  \u2014   always without makeup, always beautiful  \u2014   performing at the Democratic National Convention, on \u201cThe Voice\u201d and the MTV Video Music Awards, at the Tom Ford show during New York Fashion Week. That\u2019s a nice story, right? Inspiring and kind of sweet? Feh. \u201c  2016,\u201d as The New York Post and others called it, has grown only weirder and louder, as Twitter was at first ignited with Alicia Keys supporters, and then flooded with a backlash against her. And then with the backlash to the backlash. #Nomakeup was empowering and brave. No, it was annoying, incendiary and invasive. Ms. Keys\u2019s (mostly female) detractors howled at her disingenuousness (surely she had spent thousands on skin care?) and her deceit (surely she was wearing tinted moisturizer?) some slammed her for not looking pretty enough (though they used coarser words than those). Late last month, Swizz Beatz, Ms. Keys\u2019s husband, took to Instagram with a video defending his wife: \u201cThis is deep,\u201d he said, clearly incredulous. \u201cSomebody\u2019s sitting home mad, because somebody didn\u2019t wear makeup on their face?\u201d Don\u2019t be surprised that this is news, said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the   feminist activist and author. \u201cIt\u2019s all so familiar,\u201d she said. \u201cAlicia Keys could be taking a page from the   orthodoxy of the women\u2019s movement 40 years ago. I\u2019d never heard of her before this brouhaha, but now I\u2019ll follow her anywhere. What she\u2019s doing is   . She\u2019s not just talking about the tyranny of makeup. She\u2019s talking about female authenticity. She\u2019s challenging the culture\u2019s relentless standards of feminine conformity and the beauty industry\u2019s incessant product hype. \u201d (Ms. Pogrebin said that while she was reading Ms. Keys\u2019s essay, an ad popped up for some kind of skin cream.) Why is it, wondered Linda Wells, founding editor of Allure magazine, that fashion is considered   and makeup is  ? Or something more pernicious? Ms. Wells recalled \u201cThe Beauty Myth,\u201d Naomi Wolf\u2019s 1991 book in which she argued that contemporary ideals of beauty, proposed in large part by a   cosmetics industry, were enslaving women and holding them in thrall to all manner of restrictive practices, from makeup to surgery to eating disorders. \u201cI get the argument, but I don\u2019t agree with it,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cTo me, we\u2019re not all passive victims. Make your choice, like Alicia Keys. Decide what makes you feel confident and enjoy it. \u201d Furthermore, Ms. Wells said, Ms. Keys\u2019s gesture is coming at a particular moment, when the internet is flooded with YouTube videos on how to best present yourself   \u2026     on the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s tutorials about contouring and highlighting, except now it\u2019s called strobing, and there\u2019s something else called baking, which is basically a thick coat of powder,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very extreme look  \u2014   we haven\u2019t had highlighting since the \u201980s. It\u2019s this sort of extreme grooming geared for the selfie culture, and then someone like Alicia Keys comes out and says, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do it,\u2019 and people are losing their minds. \u201d Whose makeup is it anyway? In the late 1980s, Andrea Robinson, then the president of Ultima II, recalled the response of her male bosses at Revlon when she proposed an extension of her brand called the Nakeds,   makeup designed for women who didn\u2019t want to look as if they were wearing any. As Ms. Robinson remembered: \u201cThey said: \u2018Why would a woman want to wear mud on her face? Makeup is about fantasy, it\u2019s about color.\u2019 What they didn\u2019t say was that it was about their fantasy, their sense of color. The idea that women would want to look like themselves, and wear makeup for themselves, was crazy to them. \u201d Once introduced, the Nakeds broke all sorts of sales records, she said, and sold out over and over again. Hundreds of women wrote her in gratitude, Ms. Robinson said, including Jean Harris, who wrote her from prison: \u201cShe thought we had the right idea, that women should not overpaint themselves, and use their simple beauty. \u201d For the record, cosmetics executives aren\u2019t worried that #nomakeup will have women hurling their lipsticks into the Dumpster. \u201cIt\u2019s a makeup moment,\u201d said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, group president of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, adding that her industry is experiencing \u201cexplosive growth,\u201d with \u201cprestige\u201d makeup sales up 13 percent last year, according to the NPD Group (sales driven in large part by concealers, as it happens). Sales of all beauty products reached $16 billion in this country in 2015. Nude colors are consistent best sellers, Ms. Hudis said. Just ask Bobbi Brown, the makeup artist turned cosmetics mogul who built a company, as Ms. Robinson did, around nude makeup, and whose corporate manifesto right now is #bewhoyouare. \u201cIt takes a lot of guts to face HDTV without makeup,\u201d Ms. Brown said of Ms. Keys. \u201cBut I get it. It\u2019s all fine. Choose who you want to be. Personally, I like to have a little concealer. But obviously it\u2019s more than about makeup. I don\u2019t think people understand how difficult it is for women like Alicia Keys to worry about the way you look every second. It is the ugly internet we live in. Let\u2019s be nice to people, and not be so judgey. \u201d There is a sense you just can\u2019t win. When Kim Novak appeared on the Academy Awards in 2014, there was much snark regarding her clearly augmented face. Laura Lippman, the crime novelist who was then 55, was appalled: Who were these internet trolls who would weigh in so viciously on an   \u2019s appearance? In solidarity with Ms. Novak, she posted a selfie of her face \u201cas is\u201d and invited others to do the same. It was a different sort of #nomakeup moment. \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t, is how I felt,\u201d she said. The response, she said, was overwhelming: thousands of \u201cas is\u201d photos from all sorts of people, including one man, she said, who photographed himself on a hospital gurney the day he had a minor heart attack. It\u2019s just complicated, said Sheila Bridges, the interior designer. Given an alopecia diagnosis years ago, she decided to shave her head rather than contend with wigs or weaves, a private act that has subjected her to constant, uninvited public commentary. Also, people have been moved to pat her head. \u201cHistorically, beauty has been our currency as women,\u201d Ms. Bridges said, \u201cand when you do something that is inconsistent with societal norms, people get upset. It reminds me of when Gabby Douglas won her gold medals at the London Olympics. \u201d It was 2012, and the    was taking home two gold medals for her performances, but much of the conversation around that historic event  \u2014   Ms. Douglas was the first   woman to earn the Olympic   title  \u2014   was about how her hair was pulled into a ponytail and secured with clips. \u201cThere was a tremendous backlash,\u201d Ms. Bridges recalled, \u201cand all these terrible tweets, and what was so disturbing for me was that the majority seemed to come from other black women. I\u2019m like: \u2018Are you kidding? She\u2019s one of the world\u2019s best athletes, and we\u2019re talking about her hair? \u2019\u201d Gail O\u2019Neill, a journalist and former model, said that for some, Ms. Keys has become a Rorschach test, and the disapprobation for the singer\u2019s personal choice comes from women who are measuring themselves against it. \u201cWhen women start applying makeup as preteenagers,\u201d she said, \u201cby adulthood, that mindless habit can result in a mask we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re wearing until someone like Alicia decides to remove hers in public. \u201d People who do things outside the herd scare people who are in the herd, said Anne Kreamer, a journalist who stopped coloring her hair at 49, and wrote about her experience in her 2007 book, \u201cGoing Gray: What I Learned About Beauty, Sex, Work, Motherhood, Authenticity and Everything Else That Matters. \u201d \u201cIt was the women who were the most critical,\u201d Ms. Kreamer recalled, as if by doing without herself, she was taking something away from them. In her book, Ms. Kreamer noted that in the 1950s, fewer than 10 percent of women dyed their hair, as compared with 40 to 75 percent in the   she also surveyed some 400 women, of which 15 percent said they\u2019d had some sort of plastic surgery. As she wrote, darkly, \u201cExtrapolate the trend line, double the available technologies, and imagine the choices and pressures our   may face. \u201d In 1983, Ms. Pogrebin wrote an article called \u201cThe Power of Beauty\u201d for Ms. the magazine she helped found. She was galvanized to do so when a friend had a chin augmentation, and then blossomed, emotionally, as a result. What\u2019s the proper feminist response, Ms. Pogrebin asked herself, to such an extreme renovation: to offer congratulations, or wincing disapproval? If a feature distracts people from what they feel is their true selves, how can you argue with their alteration of that feature? But then again, as Ms. Pogrebin pointed out, whose notion of attractiveness motivated the change? \u201cWe can argue about what is attractive, but not that we wish to attract,\u201d she wrote. The solution to not making ourselves crazy, she suggested, is to propose a broader definition of beauty, one that celebrates its impact but reduces its tyranny. Meanwhile, the churn about women\u2019s looks continues. Last week, after Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance on NBC, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took to Twitter to chastise the former secretary of state   \u2026     for not smiling.'"}, "time": 1742562251.3057125}
