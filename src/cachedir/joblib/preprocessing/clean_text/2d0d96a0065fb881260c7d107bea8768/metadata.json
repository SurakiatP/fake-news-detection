A decade later, he is one of the most exciting,   singers in the world  \u2014   but the fatalistic warning was still ringing in my ears a few Sundays ago when Mr. Fabiano, who likes to pilot planes on his days off, took me for a flight. As we buckled into a small Piper Archer at Essex County Airport in New Jersey, near his childhood home, Mr. Fabiano rattled off a battery of safety instructions that went well beyond the usual flight attendant script: where to find the fire extinguisher, how to brace yourself over the instrument panel if necessary, how to unlatch the door in case of a crash landing. He cried \u201cClear prop!\u201d then started the propeller, and up we went. I found myself wondering if I would have felt safer flown by a singer who was not quite as   for    \u2014   or perhaps by a baritone, or anyone other than an impassioned tenor. \u201cSafe never wins,\u201d Mr. Fabiano, 32, said in an interview, explaining the philosophy that has guided everything from his choice of roles to his decision to act on a lifelong dream and get his pilot\u2019s license, despite the dangers. \u201cI\u2019m very, very big on preparation. I take prepared gambles. \u201d These are heady days for Mr. Fabiano, whose voice abounds in the     pinging quality opera buffs sometimes call \u201csquillo. \u201d He is currently singing in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d at the Met opposite the soprano Sonya Yoncheva, a production that will be simulcast to cinemas around the world on March 11. This summer he will sing his first Don Jos\u00e9 in Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in a new staging at the    Festival in France. And, in a sign of his arrival as an international star, he will open the   season at the Royal Opera House in London, in a production to be announced next month. But at nearly every step, Mr. Fabiano has been dogged by questions like the ones that the National Council judges raised a decade ago  \u2014   about whether he was biting off too much, too soon. It is a dilemma many young singers face: Push hard and risk damaging your voice, or err on the side of caution and chance missing your moment. I witnessed one of his more remarkable gambles two years ago. The Met phoned him one afternoon while he was home in Philadelphia and asked if he would step in for an ailing tenor in Donizetti\u2019s \u201cLucia di Lammermoor\u201d six and a half hours later, in a staging he had never seen, let alone rehearsed. I happened to be at the opera house that day reporting another article. Despite the pressure he was facing  \u2014   he had zipped up on Amtrak  \u2014   he let me tag along as he got hastily fitted for costumes and raced through a battery of   rehearsals. By 11:05 p. m. he was basking in a standing ovation, and nursing a head wound from a cut he got exiting the stage. His exploit made international news. Reminded of the old \u201cfantastic or dead\u201d paths suggested by the National Council judges (in a scene captured in \u201cThe Audition,\u201d a documentary about the competition) Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, said, \u201cHe seems to have gone towards the fantastic. \u201d Mr. Gelb\u2019s plans include mounting a revival of Verdi\u2019s \u201cI Lombardi,\u201d which Mr. Fabiano has sung to tumultuous acclaim, for him in the   season. \u201cEveryone wants to be the next Domingo,\u201d Mr. Gelb said. \u201cThe question for him is being careful and selective, and not blowing his voice out by taking on roles that are too much for him. \u201d As the plane floated above New Jersey, the Willowbrook Mall visible down below, Mr. Fabiano turned toward Lincoln Park, where he lived as a child. \u201cDo you see that red roof?\u201d he asked, gesturing down below. \u201cThat was my home. \u201d Opera was not always in the cards for Mr. Fabiano, whose family moved to Minnesota when he was 11, but whose accent is still more Jersey than Twin Cities. He comes from a musical family  \u2014   an aunt was an opera singer  \u2014   and he sang in high school, but as a teenager he was more interested in debate, mock trial and being a baseball umpire. (Mr. Fabiano, who cuts a trim, muscular figure now, took to umpiring rather than playing in part because he was overweight in his youth he shed 80 pounds the year he turned 20.) It was not until he got into the University of Michigan and began studying with George Shirley, a tenor who was one of the first   men to sing leading roles at the Met in the 1960s, that he became serious about singing. Mr. Shirley said that Mr. Fabiano was on a fast track from the start. \u201cHe sings with such passion  \u2014   that\u2019s one of the things that makes people concerned,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cBecause whatever Michael does, it\u2019s 3, 000 percent. There\u2019s no backing off. That\u2019s his personality. But so far, so good. He walks to the beat of his own drummer, and so far, the beat is solid. \u201d Some of Mr. Fabiano\u2019s advisers warned him against taking on the taxing title role in Verdi\u2019s \u201cDon Carlo\u201d last season at the San Francisco Opera, one of his main artistic homes in recent years. But he studied the role for three and a half years and nailed it. During the run last June, we got together at the Presidio, at a favorite spot of his overlooking the Pacific Ocean. \u201cI always think that the great performances are the performances where you think a singer is going right to the edge,\u201d said Mr. Fabiano, who will return to San Francisco next season to star in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon,\u201d opposite Nadine Sierra. \u201cWhen a singer has gone right to the edge, either they just make it or they break slightly and you think, that\u2019s it. \u201d A dramatic fog rolled in off the ocean as we spoke. Then we headed back to the War Memorial Opera House in his black BMW Mr. Fabiano, who is on the road 11 months a year, had it shipped across country as a taste of home. As the traffic thickened, he began aggressively weaving in and out, explaining that he did not believe in defensive driving. \u201cThere are a lot of defensive singers,\u201d he said, a dismissive edge in his voice, \u201cwho pursue their careers defensively. \u201d These are tricky times for an    opera star. Many companies are struggling financially singers\u2019 fees have been cut in many places the recording industry is not what it was. Mr. Fabiano said that when he decided to make opera his career, he carefully mapped out the steps he needed to succeed. \u201cI felt like a businessman, not like an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI know so many people don\u2019t want to hear that. I\u2019m a businessman at the core. \u201d Some gambles paid off, some did not  \u2014   looking back, he said, it was a mistake to sing at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan at 23, saying he was \u201ctoo green\u201d to make it a success. But he is constantly trying new things: Last fall, he and some friends started a foundation, ArtSmart, to give free voice lessons to teenagers who lack access. Its pilot program, at Newark East Side High School in New Jersey, reaches about a dozen students, and he plans to expand the program to Philadelphia and San Francisco. \u201cWe teach the kids any genre of music that they want to focus on,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do give them a base curriculum  \u2014   stretching, breathing, vocal exercises, how to read music. \u201d We began our descent, the runway getting closer and closer. \u201cGet down, honey,\u201d he said, and a few seconds later the plane\u2019s tires hit the tarmac.  \u201cIf I only listened to my elders and did exactly what they prescribed, I wouldn\u2019t be who I am today,\u201d he said, after the plane had taxied to a stop. \u201cI might not be flying a plane, because most people told me it\u2019s too dangerous to do, and you shouldn\u2019t do it, and blah, blah, blah. Well, I love to fly. I will never take the careful route. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live a kind of cloistered life,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are singers that can sing for 50 years, and there are singers that sing for 30. I\u2019ll fall somewhere in between that. Maybe not at the high end, maybe not at the low. But somewhere. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562871.6991255}
