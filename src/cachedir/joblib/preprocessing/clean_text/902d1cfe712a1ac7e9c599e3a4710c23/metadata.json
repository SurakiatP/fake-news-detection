The bus, which was carrying 14 people, most of them parishioners in their 50s or older from First Baptist Church in New Braunfels, was traveling south on Route 83, about 100 miles west of San Antonio, when it collided with a Dodge pickup just before 12:30 p. m. according to Lt. Johnny Hernandez, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, and Barron Casteel, the mayor of New Braunfels. The driver of the pickup, the truck\u2019s only occupant, and one other were injured, Lieutenant Hernandez said. It was not yet clear how the crash occurred, he said. Mr. Casteel called the church a \u201cpillar\u201d of the community that has long been involved in youth programs. \u201cIt\u2019s just awfully sad,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us will be affected because we\u2019re a small town and we\u2019re going to be part of those families who lost loved ones. \u201d The families were working to recover the bodies of the deceased, he said. In a statement posted on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon, the church said that the bus was carrying a group of older adults who were on their way home from a   retreat at Alto Frio Baptist Encampment, which is about 130 miles from New Braunfels. \u201cWe are ministering to family members to help them deal with this tragedy,\u201d the statement read. \u201cCounselors will be on hand at the church tomorrow. If you\u2019re a Christian, you can pray for those who lost their loved ones and for the church family. \u201d Gov. Greg Abbott and his wife, Cecilia, offered their condolences to the victims and their families. \u201cWe are saddened by the loss of life and our hearts go out to all those affected,\u201d Governor Abbott said in a statement. \u201cWe thank the first responders working on the scene in the wake of this unimaginable tragedy, and ask that all Texans join us in offering their thoughts and prayers. \u201d The church is well known in New Braunfels for the youth activities it hosts, particularly Upward Basketball, a program that it runs out of its own gym, said Mayor Casteel, who grew up in the city and took office in May 2014. Even though he attended a different church growing up, Mr. Casteel said, he would sometimes attend Sunday school at First Baptist with his friends. He also went to summer camp with the church. \u201cWe still have that very   feel we all know each other,\u201d he said. The church, whose former minister also served as mayor, has long been a fixture in the city, which has about 75, 000 residents. \u201cIt\u2019s been there forever,\u201d Mayor Casteel said.'"}, "time": 1742563886.9296124}
