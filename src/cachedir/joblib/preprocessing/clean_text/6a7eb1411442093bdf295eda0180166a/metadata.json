Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Wednesday that the United States is \u201cconsidering every option that\u2019s on the table\u201d in response to North Korea\u2019s provocative launch of ballistic missiles at Japan on Monday. [\u201cWe\u2019re not ruling anything out,\u201d said Haley at a press conference on North Korea attended by Japanese Ambassador Koro Bessho and South Korean Ambassador Cho  .  ABC News quotes Haley urging all U. N. members to \u201cincrease their strengths\u201d to compel \u201cthe attention of North Korea as we go forward,\u201d and warned the outlaw state\u2019s actions put the entire \u201cglobal community\u201d in danger. She dealt with Chinese and Russian criticism of America\u2019s decision to deploy a THAAD missile system to South Korea by asking, \u201cTell me why we wouldn\u2019t do the THAAD in light of   ballistic missiles? In light of two nuclear tests?\u201d \u201cWe are not going to leave South Korea standing there with the threat of North Korea facing them and not help. The reason for THAAD is because of the actions of North Korea,\u201d she declared. Haley seemed tentatively willing to consider China\u2019s offer to broker a deal in which North Korea suspends its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for the U. S. and South Korea canceling regular military exercises that offend Pyongyang. However, she said the United States would need to see \u201csome sort of positive action taken by North Korea before we can ever take them seriously. \u201d Interestingly, ABC News notes that South Korean Ambassador   strongly rejected the Chinese proposal, insisting that South Korea\u2019s military exercises with the United States are \u201cdefensive in nature,\u201d and it was \u201cinappropriate and unacceptable\u201d to link them to North Korea\u2019s banned weapons research. A senior Trump administration official who spoke to the Washington Post was also \u201cunderwhelmed\u201d by the Chinese plan. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a new proposal in any way. This is what the Chinese have wanted for a long time,\u201d the official stated, ruling out the possibility of using it as a starting point for negotiations with North Korea. This official also said China\u2019s ostensibly serious sanctions against North Korea, such as banning coal imports, are \u201cinadequate to change the regime\u2019s behavior,\u201d and the Trump administration is looking for \u201cgenuine signs the Chinese are willing to get serious about North Korea. \u201d The U. N. Security Council condemned North Korea\u2019s missile launches on Tuesday, saying that \u201csuch activities contribute to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s development of nuclear weapons delivery systems and increase tension in the region and beyond as well as the risk of a regional arms race. \u201d \u201cThe members of the Security Council further regretted that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is diverting resources to the pursuit of ballistic missiles while Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea citizens have great unmet needs,\u201d the U. N. statement added. More pressure on North Korea is coming from humanitarian groups such as Human Rights Watch, which organized panel discussions in Geneva this week to review Pyongyang\u2019s abuses, in conjunction with a session of the U. N. Human Rights Council. Human Rights Watch wants additional investigators and legal experts for the HRC\u2019s office in Seoul to help \u201cset out a prosecution strategy for alleged crimes against humanity in North Korea. \u201d United Nations inspectors already have their hands full with North Korea\u2019s provocations. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that investigators have discovered North Korea \u201cattempted to sell a form of lithium metal, a key material for developing miniaturized nuclear weapons, to unidentified international buyers last year. \u201d \u201cThe U. N. Panel of Expert\u2019s report on North Korea provides further evidence that North Korea will stop at nothing to advance its illicit nuclear and missile programs,\u201d declared Senator Cory Gardner ( ) after reading this report. The Wall Street Journal explains that enriched lithium is a sign that North Korea is making progress on its drive for miniaturized nuclear warheads that can fit on ballistic missiles.'"}, "time": 1742563207.542547}
