[Representatives from Breitbart News were present for the event.  The event was billed as a reception, as White House aides and members of the press office mingled with about   individuals from conservative media outlets to discuss Trump\u2019s first 100 days and issues of importance. But the event turned into an impromptu press conference after the president entered the room flanked by senior advisers Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner. At one point economic advisor Gary Cohn peered in the door to view the event. White House press secretary Sean Spicer was also present, as Trump held a discussion, which the White House press staff put on the record afterwards. Conservative journalists asked Trump policy questions  \u2014   particularly about trade foreign affairs in North Korea, Iran, and Syria and social policy. Trump announced that he wanted to levy a 20 percent tax on Canadian soft lumber and suggested he wanted to address milk imports as well. \u201cIt means we\u2019re going to start doing lumber in our country, it\u2019s going to mean that farmers are going to start selling milk in our country,\u201d Trump said. A senior administration trade official said that the issue was a \u201clong simmering problem\u201d with Canada, accusing them of charging lumber companies low subsidized rates. \u201cWe love Canada, wonderful people, wonderful country, but they have been very good about taking advantage of us through NAFTA,\u201d Trump said. Trump said that he would explore allowing more logging on federal lands with the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWe\u2019re actually having some of those horrific fires because this stuff is sitting there, virgin stuff for so long, and it\u2019s in very bad shape,\u201d he said. Trump seemed to think that Syrian dictator Bashar   would not use chemical weapons again. \u201cWait and see if he uses them again, OK?\u201d he said, adding that the Obama administration was wrong about Syria getting rid of their chemical weapons. \u201cThat turned out to be false,\u201d he said. \u201cThey duped the Obama administration. \u201d Trump continued to highlight the problems with North Korea but remained elusive about what he was planning to do in the country. He mused that North Korea\u2019s dictator Kim   was probably not as strong militarily as he appeared. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s so strong like he says he is I\u2019m not so sure at all,\u201d he said. Trump criticized modern presidents for not acting decisively on the North Korea threat. \u201cThis should have been done by Obama and it should have been done by every president since, really, Clinton,\u201d he said, referring to the former president\u2019s memoirs. He also discussed the ongoing crisis of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. \u201cNobody\u2019s been treated worse, it seems to me, than Christians in the Middle East,\u201d he said, arguing that it was easier for Muslims to come into the United States as refugees than Christians, although it was far more dangerous there for Christians. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be helping the Christians big league,\u201d he said. Trump defended his plan to spend big on infrastructure, pointing out that the United States spent $6 trillion in the Middle East with little to show for it. \u201cI tell you what we got, it\u2019s 20 times worse than it first was when we first started bombing the hell out of Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIraq was thrown in the hornets nest and it\u2019s a disaster, far worse than anybody understands. \u201d Trump said he wanted to spend $1 trillion on building new infrastructure and repairing existing infrastructure projects like bridges, roads, and airports. When asked if he still believed DACA was illegal, Trump demurred, instead focusing on his efforts to crack down on   gang members. \u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of people, and people in towns, they\u2019re cheering. These are rough people,\u201d Trump said, saying that DHS Secretary Gen. John Kelly called   members as bad as  . \u201cWe have people that came into this country that should have never ever in a million years been allowed into this country. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562957.4738348}
