At the newly sharia-compliant University of Southern Maine, moronic school officials say \u201cDeus Vult\u201d Graffiti of Crusades\u2019 rallying cry is being referred to the state Attorney General\u2019s office after the Latin phrase used by Christians was written on a desk and wall in a student government office. Press Herald The phrase was used as a rallying cry for Christians during the Crusades in medieval times, and more recently has now is being called an anti-Muslim insult. In an email to the campus community, USM President Glenn Cummings condemned the \u201canti-Muslim graffiti\u201d found in the office in the Woodbury Campus Center. \u201cI want you to know that addressing this is our highest priority. Our campus security is fully investigating what we believe to be a hate crime,\u201d Cummings wrote. \u201cA team from our Dean of Students is working hard to uncover the facts while providing opportunities for intergroup dialogue and supporting students directly and indirectly affected by this reprehensible act. (It\u2019s free speech, you idiot, and Muslims use the exact same phrase everyday, especially when trying to impose their death cult on non-muslims) British member of ISIS Mostly, to our Muslim students I want to express how sorry I am this has happened. Please know that such actions affect all of us. This is not who USM is or wants to be.\u201d (USM is a school of politically correct asswipes who should be fired) According to USM\u2019s student body president (a Muslim, of course) , Muhammad \u201cHumza\u201d Khan, a male student who is not part of student government drew the graffiti Tuesday afternoon, while two student Senate members were in the office. Khan, who declined to identify the student because of the investigation, said the two witnesses have said they didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the phrase \u2013 which was written in small letters on an electrical wire cover on a wall, and on a wooden desk. USM officials also have not released the student\u2019s name. In a Facebook post, USM student body Vice President Matt Raymond condemned the graffiti. \u201cI just wanted to say that all this happened a day after five Muslim students asked for applications to Student Government to become Senators. I believe this act of \u201ccriminal intimidation\u201d (Seriously? You should be taken away in a straitjacket) to be linked to that fact,\u201d Raymond wrote, adding that student government is open to all students of any race, gender, religion, sexuality, economic background or nationality.\u201d (It is, but you can\u2019t blame students for hating Muslims, the biggest threat to America) Southwest Airlines knows what it means and acted accordingly Humza Khan, myself, and our Cabinet under the Executive branch condemn in the harshest terms this crime of bias and intimidation. Let\u2019s show folks that USM is a diverse and inclusive university for all moving forward!\u201d A group of about 40 students rallied in support of Muslim students at lunchtime Thursday. Raymond said he plans to ask the student Senate to vote out two members who he believes did not respond appropriately to the incident. Khan said he believes the person who wrote the graffiti intended to intimidate Muslim students who have expressed interest in joining the student Senate. \u201cThe way Muslims see (that Latin phrase,) we see it indirectly as \u2018Let\u2019s kill Muslims,\u2019 \u201d said Khan, who is Muslim. (But Muslim students who keep saying Death to Israel/Death to America are said to be exercising their freedom of speech) \u201cIt\u2019s not immediately seen as racist, it\u2019s not a racial epithet, but it\u2019s still there to intimidate a specific group of people,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cAnd it served its purpose, even though it was coded language.\u201d (One can only hope. Muslims should be banned from holding office anywhere America. Look at the mess the Muslim in the White House has made)'"}, "time": 1742563428.5457659}
