[\u201cI don\u2019t know what people are talking. I watch these shows, and the pundits in the morning. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. The wall gets built, 100 percent,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday.  Reporters asked Trump if he would sign a continuing budget resolution if it didn\u2019t include funding for the wall. \u201cThe wall\u2019s going to get built, folks. In case anybody has any questions, the wall is going to get built,\u201d Trump replied. He added that construction for the wall would start \u201csoon. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already preparing. We\u2019re doing plans, we\u2019re doing specifications, we\u2019re doing a lot of work on the wall, and the wall is going to get built,\u201d he added. Democrats seized on reports that Trump said during a meeting with conservative media on Monday that he could get funding this week or in September budget negotiations for FY2018, as a sign that he was caving on his priorities. Senate Democrats insist that they will not support any budget that includes wall funding. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted that nothing had changed in the president\u2019s priorities. \u201cNo one said \u2018delayed,\u2019\u201d Spicer said, when asked if the president was willing to delay wall funding. Behind the scenes, White House aides are reluctant to play \u201cshutdown theater\u201d with Democrats, telling reporters that they are not going to negotiate budget deals with the Democrats through the media. Spicer did not say whether funding for the wall was a firm requirement for the president\u2019s budget, suggesting to his opponents that it was open to interpretation. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has changed,\u201d Spicer said, adding that discussions were ongoing with both houses of Congress. The wall, he insisted, would be built, but he did not offer a construction timetable. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of wait until the fall. I think that there\u2019s a lot of things that have to happen,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cIt\u2019s like any construction   \u2026     we will take the first steps now and we will continue to seek funding through the FY2018 and further budget to make sure that it\u2019s completed. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562214.4224484}
