Londoners will be paid their salaries in the new currency without any increase to reflect the lower value, then be expected to still somehow pay their rent and bills. A Royal Mint spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s past time London had its own currency which reflects the remarkably poor value and hellish nature of the city.\u201d Restaurants and cafes have already prepared for the new coin by removing the \u2018\u00a3\u2019 signs from menus to make prices seem less extortionate. Londoner Norman Steele said: \u201cAccording to this menu a bacon butty is \u20187\u2019. I knew there was no way that would be in normal pounds because it\u2019s a bit of bacon jammed between two slices of bread. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know the precise terms on which I am being totally fucked.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564212.5875392}
