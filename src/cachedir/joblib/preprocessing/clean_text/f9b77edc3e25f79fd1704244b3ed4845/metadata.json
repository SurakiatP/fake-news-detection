However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. \\nSubsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. \\nKSAT 12 reports : \\nBulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County\u2019s election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. \\nJaqua said the offense of electioneering isn\u2019t limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. \\n\u201cIt can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cAnything related to the voting, the party, the candidate.\u201d \\nJaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe\u2019s arrest. \\nJaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : \\nIt\u2019s in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,\u201d she said. \\nMost people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. \\n\u201cEvery election we have to advise people. Even if it\u2019s a school bond issue. They wear candidates\u2019 shirts and we just have to remind them. \u2018Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.\u2019 This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,\u201d she said, during two decades working at the county election office. \\n\u201cA gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,\u201d she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. \\nSo, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. \\nMy question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn\u2019t the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. \\nOther voters agree with me. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,\u201d Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. \u201cI\u2019m kind of shocked, because I think that\u2019s part of the freedoms that we\u2019re voting for.\u201d \\nJose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It\u2019s not inflammatory. It isn\u2019t a lie. It isn\u2019t slander. What\u2019s illegal about it? \\nI\u2019ll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don\u2019t hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. \\nMauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. \\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don\u2019t want to give you any comment,\u201d he said . \\nThe charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor. \\nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \\nTim Brown is an author and Editor at FreedomOutpost.com , SonsOfLibertyMedia.com , GunsInTheNews.com and TheWashingtonStandard.com .
