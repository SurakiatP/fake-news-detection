{"duration": 0.08179283142089844, "input_args": {"text": "'Yesterday I asked of lying liar climate \u2018scientist\u2019 Michael Mann: \u201cDoes anyone take this guy seriously any more? \u201d[But the question was a purely rhetorical one. I already knew the depressing true answer having just sat, fuming, in my car listening to Mann being given the red carpet treatment on a BBC Radio 4 science programme.  \u201cOh Professor Doctor Mann, Sir, may it please your eminence to descend from your radiant cloud for a few precious moments and explain to us mere mortals why your amazing and unquestionably brilliant new paper on global warming demonstrates you to be even more right about climate change than you were even in the days when you won your Nobel prize?\u201d fawned and grovelled the BBC\u2019s interviewer from his prostrate position on the studio floor. Perhaps I exaggerate slightly. But it would be fair to say that the BBC\u2019s interviewer, Adam Rutherford, sought to leave the listener in no doubt that when it came to climate science the \u201cDistinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science\u201d Michael Mann was a respected expert of great insight whose opinions one could totally trust. Mann isn\u2019t though, is he? Maybe in 2001, when Mann\u2019s Hockey Stick was promoted heavily in the IPCC\u2019s Third Assessment Report, it would have been legitimate enough for the BBC to quote him as a climate scientist of note. But that was 16 years ago, since when the Hockey Stock has been discredited to the point where not even the IPCC quotes it in its reports. And where Mann\u2019s reputation has become so tarnished that Mark Steyn was able to compile and edit a   book called A Disgrace To The Profession, consisting largely of distinguished scientists from around the world explaining in lavish detail how utterly flawed, bankrupt and worthless Michael Mann\u2019s climate science was. \u201cMisleading\u201d \u201cJust bad science\u201d \u201cVery erroneous conclusions\u201d \u201cA crock of shit\u201d \u201cExcuse me while I puke. \u201d   \u2026    . just a few of things scientists had to say about Mann and his work. But as we were reminded yet again on the BBC\u2019s Inside Science programme this week, the BBC continues to treat this tainted and controversial figure with uncritical reverence. On the programme, his interviewer Adam Rutherford allowed Mann space to give a version of this week\u2019s Congressional hearing on climate science so ludicrously biased towards the alarmist narrative it might have been scripted by Greenpeace. \u201cWe have currently as the chair of the House of Representatives Science Committee an individual  \u2014   Lamar Smith  \u2014   whose funding mostly comes from fossil fuel interests who rejects the overwhelming consensus of the world\u2019s scientists that climate change is real and human caused and represents a threat. The hearing was intended to provide cover to Congressional Republicans and the current Trump administration who are trying to cut funding for climate science and who are trying to roll back the policy successes over the last several years in dealing with climate change and dealing with carbon emissions. \u201d \u201cAs the hearing went on every time the topic was about the substance, what the science has to say, my feeling was that the Congressional Republicans realised that they were on the defensive, that they were losing the argument because, after all, they are denying the overwhelming consensus of the world\u2019s scientists. And eventually it got into the gutter where they were trying to discredit me personally and to talk about squabbles between scientists in a sense it was a confirmation that they knew they had lost the actual scientific argument at that hearing. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult period right now for anybody who cares about science. We\u2019re about to see an unprecedented event next month here in DC where scientists are going to be marching in the streets  \u2026    .I think it\u2019s a recognition from the typically quite reticent and conservative scientific community that they have to speak out now, that there\u2019s a threat to science and to scientists unlike anything that we have, in my view, faced in the past. \u201d None of this weapons grade bilge went even slightly challenged by Rutherford, who flagged his own concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s approach to climate science at the beginning of the interview by describing it as \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d. [Says who? Why? ?] Let\u2019s not forget, also, that there were three other scientists with at least as much knowledge and experience as Mann who were speaking at the same Congressional hearings, only from a sceptical point of view. Might it not have been useful for the purposes of balance to get at least one of them  \u2014   John Christy, Judith Curry or Roger Pielke Jr  \u2014   for the BBC to hear from one of them too? In theory, this is one of the BBC\u2019s statutory obligations. According to the terms of its revised Charter 2006: \u2018The BBC must do all it can to ensure that controversial subjects are treated with due accuracy and impartiality in all relevant output.\u2019 As Christopher Booker detailed in his thorough report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation The BBC And Climate Change: A Triple Betrayal  \u2014   the BBC has consistently failed to do this in its woefully   treatment of environmental issues. Indeed, the BBC hasn\u2019t just failed to remain impartial on the issue it has actively proselytised on behalf of the climate change scare lobby across a range of programmes from the hysterical reportage of its     Roger Harrabin on BBC Radio 4 news, to the doddery laments of its house Malthusian Sir David Attenborough, to the     of Chris Packham, to the rampant global warming alarmism promoted by its entire celebrity science team from Adam Rutherford (see above) to   pouty boy physicist Brian Cox and its     lefty comics Robin Ince and Daragh O\u2019Briaiaiaan. All this would be absolutely totally fine if the BBC were a private subscription channel whose sole purpose was to reinforce the   prejudices of the liberal elite. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s supposed to be for everyone. Even deplorables like you and me. In this regard it fails. And always will fail. Scrap the licence fee, I say. That\u2019ll teach it.'"}, "time": 1742563811.8217716}
