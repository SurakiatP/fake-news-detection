[The objection goes to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose   panel includes ten judges nominated by Democratic presidents and only five nominated by GOP presidents. It will likely be sent to the Supreme Court later this year.  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Muslim ban has fared miserably in the courts, and for good reason  \u2014   it violates fundamental provisions of our Constitution,\u201d said a response from the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cWe look forward to defending this careful and   decision in the appeals court. \u201d The Maryland decision targeted Trump\u2019s March 6 E. O. 13780, titled \u201cProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. \u201d Much of the judge\u2019s   decision is a complaint about the President\u2019s political statements and promised policies, for which he was elected to implement. The judge declares: [Plaintiff] John Doe No. 1 has stated that the travel ban has \u201ccreated significant fear, anxiety, and insecurity\u201d for him and his wife and that the \u201c  views\u201d underlying the Executive Orders have caused him \u201csignificant stress and anxiety\u201d to the point that he \u201cworr( ies] that I may not be safe in this country. \u201d   \u2026     John Doe NO. 3 has stated that the \u201c  attitudes that are driving\u201d the Executive Orders cause him \u201cstress and anxiety\u201d and lead him to \u201cquestion whether I even belong in this country. \u201d The judge developed his claim that Trump\u2019s policy is an illicit restraint on the religious freedom of Muslims in the United States to get visas for their foreign  . \u201cPlaintiffs, comprised of six individuals and three organizations, assert that they will be harmed by the implementation of the Second Executive Order. Collectively, they assert that because the Individual Plaintiffs are Muslim and the Organizational Plaintiffs serve or represent Muslim clients or members, the   animus underlying the Second Executive Order inflicts stigmatizing injuries on them all. The Individual Plaintiffs, who each have one or more relatives who are nationals of one of the Designated Countries and are currently in the process of seeking permission to enter the United States, also claim that if the Second Executive Order is allowed to go into effect, their separation from their loved ones, many of whom live in dangerous conditions, will be unnecessarily prolonged   \u2026     The judge cited Trump\u2019s campaign promise, plus cited leaks from the Department of Homeland Security, and claims from officials who were in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, to justify his claim that: In this highly unique case, the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban  \u2026     even if the Second Executive Order has a national security purpose, it is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban. Accordingly, there is a likelihood that the travel ban violates the Establishment Clause. The judge also revealed his proposal to reverse Trump\u2019s reduction of refugee inflow, via a footnote in his March 15 decision where he denounced Trump\u2019s reformist Executive Orders. Trump\u2019s E. O. cited Section 212( f) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which gives the President   power over who gets into the United States, according to a January 2017 report by Congress\u2019 Congressional Research Service. The critical language declares, at 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182 (f)  that: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate, Federal law also allows the president to exclude   threats, including communists and people who wish to overthrow the U. S. Constitution. For example, 212( f) section of the law says the president and his deputies can exclude: Read the decision here.  '"}, "time": 1742564376.073251}
