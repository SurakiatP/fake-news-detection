October 16th, 2016 \\nIt sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with Russia. As I write this, we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in U.S. history, and Barack Obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the Russians. As I wrote about on Friday , Reuters is reporting that Obama is contemplating \u201cdirect U.S. military action\u201d against Syrian military targets, and the Russians have already indicated that any assault on Syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves. The rapidly deteriorating crisis in Syria has already caused tensions with Russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the Cold War, but now Obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering \u201can unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia\u201d. Apparently Obama believes that Russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback. The following comes from an NBC News article entitled \u201c CIA Prepping for Possible Cyber Strike Against Russia \u201c\u2026 \\nThe Obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the American presidential election , U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News. \\nCurrent and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the CIA has been asked to deliver options to the White House for a wide-ranging \u201cclandestine\u201d cyber operation designed to harass and \u201cembarrass\u201d the Kremlin leadership. \\nThe sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the CIA was considering, but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors, selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation . \\nSomebody should tell Obama that he is not playing a video game. A cyber attack is considered to be an act of war, and the Russians would inevitably retaliate. And considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is, I don\u2019t know if that is something that we want to invite. \\nAt the end of last week, Vice President Joe Biden also publicly threatened the Russians \u2026 \\nOn Friday, Vice President Joe Biden met \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in Russia. \\nWithout bothering to question the authenticity of the claims, Todd took the allegations of Russian hacking at face value, opening his interview with a loaded question: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we sent a message yet to Putin?\u201d \\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, Biden responded, \u201cWe\u2019re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact.\u201d \\nWhen Todd asked if the public will know a message was sent, Biden replied, \u201cHope not.\u201d \\nThe Russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking, and so far the Obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the Russians were behind it. \\nPerhaps the Obama administration privately has some evidence, but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the American public. \\nSo for Joe Biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing. The Russians are taking these threats very seriously, and they are preparing to protect their interests \u2026 \\n\u2018The threats directed against Moscow and our state\u2019s leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the US vice president. \\n\u2018To the backdrop of this aggressive, unpredictable line, we must take measures to protect (our) interests, to hedge risks,\u2019 a Kremlin spokesman said, according to RIA Novosti news agency. \\nHere in the United States, most people don\u2019t even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with Russia. \\nBut over in Russia things are completely different. Talk of war is everywhere, and the potential for war is the number one topic in the Russian media right now. Just check out some of the recent Russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations\u2026 \\n-\u201c In Contrast to Clinton, Trump Has No Appetite for War With Russia \u201d \\nAnd one Russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the United States and Russia suddenly erupts\u2026 \\nA terrifying Russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war. \\nOne apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on Moscow\u2019s state-owned TV channel NTV: \u201cIf it should one day happen, every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is. It\u2019s best to find out now.\u201d \\nI don\u2019t believe that the Russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming. \\nTo me, it almost seems as though Obama wants one. \\nCould it be possible that a conflict with Russia will be used to alter, change or influence the upcoming election in November? \\nThe truth is that it isn\u2019t going to take much for the shooting to begin. If Obama orders airstrikes against Syrian forces, the Russians have said that they will shoot back \u2026 \\nAsh Carter has threatened Russia with \u201cconsequences\u201d. After blowing up the ceasefire, the Pentagon \u2013 supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff \u2014 now is peddling \u201cpotential strikes\u201d on Syria\u2019s air force to \u201cpunish the regime\u201d for what the Pentagon actually did; blow up the ceasefire. One can\u2019t make this stuff up. \\nMajor-General Igor Konashenkov, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesman, sent a swift message to \u201cour colleagues in Washington\u201d; think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a \u201cshadow\u201d hot war against Russia. Russia will target any stealth/unidentified aircraft attacking Syrian government targets \u2013 and they will be shot down. \\nThe only serious question then is whether an out of control Pentagon will force the Russian Air Force \u2013 false flag and otherwise \u2014 to knock out US Air Force fighter jets, and whether Moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them. \\nI discussed the potential for war with Russia in my latest video . Hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with Russia will be put off\u2026 \\nBut without a doubt the crisis in Syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess. Most people don\u2019t realize that the Syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between Sunni Islam and Shia Islam from the very beginning. Jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by Saudi Arabia and Turkey are fighting Hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by Iran. And now Turkish forces have invaded northern Syria, and this threatens to cause a full-blown war to erupt between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds. Of course ISIS is right in the middle of everything causing havoc, blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesn\u2019t believe in their radical version of Sunni Islam. \\nIt is absolutely insane that the United States and Russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict. Both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are, and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery. \\nThe American people very foolishly elected Barack Obama twice, but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting. \\nHowever, right here at the end of his second term Obama is facing a moment of truth. If he ends up dragging us into a war with Russia, the American people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the White House. Drowning In Debt: 35 Percent Of All Americans Have Debt That Is At Least 180 Days Past Due \u00bb Guest \\n\u201cIf he [Obama] ends up dragging us into a war with Russia, the American people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the White House.\u201d \\nOh, I doubt it. Most Americans just lap up the propaganda fed to them by the mainstream media that has incessantly demonized Putin and other foreign leaders. Where is the outrage over what this administration has done in destabilizing Libya and other sovereign nations in the Middle East? Where is the outrage over what the Bush administration did in Iraq and Afghanistan? \\nThere is a video on Youtube with General Wesley Clark discussing how the Pentagon planned to attack 7 countries in 5 years. Google it. JC Teecher \\nThe reality of the general public putting an atheistic/muzzy, into the white house, will not strike home, until their sons and daughters are coming home in body bags. Guest \\nNo, when their sons and daughters come back in body bags, their parents will wave that American flag and say that their children died to defend the \u201cfreedoms\u201d of this country. Good grief. JC Teecher \\nOh yea. plenty of those folks as well. watchmannonthewall \\nGod help us! You are both right! But there will be far fewer of the first than the second! Paul Patriot \\nNothing liked a lame duck traitor to recklessly stick his nose in the affairs of others, and then leave office in a few months. \\nThis traitor should have been impeached after one year of his first term\u2026..but the American sheeple demanded the \u201cchange you could believe in\u201d. So, the way I see it, we are bearing the fruits of allowing a traitor to occupy the white house, and a apethetic population that is not united and sat back and did nothing to protest. If Hitlery gets in, she will gladly continued the change that Obama (global elite masters) has been determined to accomplish, and will transform this nation into a nation unrecognizable to most who call this nation home. \\nI predict if hitlery gets in she will be even more addicted to executive orders than the invader obummer. df NJ \\nI\u2019m not sure Obama is really in control of the military at this point. gfmucci \\nSheesh, I hope you\u2019re right.

And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; \u2026 Lester Holt \\nWe knew you were an idiot.

Which, would prevent Trump from becoming potus, and keep the NWO wheels turning. \\nEven with a liberal win, it could be the one thing that prevents a psychopath from actually taking the reins, and continuing a program that is soon to take a hold of the whole world, anyway. \\nFolks that are awake and seeking truth, should pay attention and make changes in their lives accordingly. df NJ \\nOn the one hand you say government is completely incompetent and a waste of money.

JFK was having an ongoing affair with Marilyn Monroe and I\u2019m sure his Secret Service Agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions. But you know what? Neither JFK\u2019s Secret Service Agents nor the Mainstream Media said anything about the affair, much less JFK\u2019s private conversations about it because they had dignity, respect for the office of POTUS, and respect for JFK. Any ONE of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the Mainstream Media from happening around the whole institution of the POTUS, including the potential POTUS candidates. However, we see that neither the democrats nor the Mainstream Media have any honor, truth, or journalistic integrity remaining. \\nGeneral George S. Patton and Prime Minister Winston Churchill were both as crude as they come in private, and often in public, but they got the job done when they were called upon. Maybe you don\u2019t consider Donald Trump in the same ranks as the above three men. Maybe you don\u2019t think Donald Trump can get the job done. Either way, I couldn\u2019t care less. What I do care about is the poor state of our country, the damage that Barack Obama & the democrats have done, and the damage that Hillary Clinton is sure to do. For Pete\u2019s sake! Look at the shell of a city that used to be Detroit, MI. Look at Chicago with double-digit murders just about every week.

All modern perversions go by texts found much later in Alexandria, Egypt, so all those are corrupt. Hope that helps you. By the way, you should study the book of Esther in original Hebrew using acrostics since that book was almost not included in the canon because God\u2019s name (God of Abraham) was not written (technically, not written on the textual level). May the God of the Holy Bible lead you to the Truth. Abba Father. Amen. Donna \\nThey are all true, the old testament was written before Jesus\u2019s birth, after Jesus was born and died for us on the cross a lot of things changed because we are forgiven through his blood on the cross. All we have to do is sincerely ask for his forgiveness and obey the commandments, and live an obidient life. Study his word and apply it to our daily lives. Don\u2019t just take someone\u2019s word, go to church and even then back it up with his word and prayer. gfmucci \\nThe huge difference you choose to ignore, Ali, is that the founder of Islam, Muhammad, unlike the founder of Christianity, Jesus, practiced jihad, violence, intolerance, supremacism, and conquest as written in his book, Qur\u2019an. Christ was opposite. So of course faithful Muslims attempt to emulate the life of Muhammad as Christians attempt to emulate Christ. So, naturally, good Islamic leaders want their followers to emulate Muhammad in all his violent and conquering overt jihad and stealth jihad ways as well. \\nEven the ratio of Jews today shooting, beheading, igniting and terrorizing people in the name of their \u2018Old Testament\u201d religion, compared to Muslims, is 1 to 1 million. \\nNope, the \u201cmoral equivalency\u201d argument you attempt is BS \u2013 it is a \u2018uuuge stretch, aka \u201clie\u201d, obfuscation, distraction, vain attempt, etc. But I know you will persist because Islam promotes illogic to attempt to prevail and conquer. ali \\nI am not here to argue. But if you go into historical facts, you will see that all the battles fought by Muhammad were in Self defense. I love Jesus as I consider him also Prophet of God. But then again you can choose to believe in what you want to believe in. \\nI do agree that concept of Jihad has been demolished by retarded extremists but I am not here to defend Islam or Muslims. Jihad means to struggle. Remember Muhammad also said Jihad of Pen and Jihad of Self control over desires and bad virtues is much bigger than Jihad of sword GSOB \\nJesus is God.

I am with Putin on this one. tacoma \\nThe American War Machine, consisting of POTUS (of both parties), the Pentagon, the CIA/NSA, the neo-con politicians, who have been fighting some kind of war non-stop around the world since WW2, is today mad as hell. See, they are not doing what they want with expected impunity all over the Middle East, the Russian front and the Chinese front. They expected to go in and simply take over the regions. With Pentagon massive Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, these were initial success of conquest and plunder. U.S. forces are today running these countries, ensuring there are daily suicide bombers for entertainment in American TV. But projects to take over Libya, Ukraine, Georgia, Syria, even Egypt ran into resistance. All such resistance can be traced to the strategy and actions of Russian president Putin. \\nMr. Putin said he opposes American military conquest of countries on Russia\u2019s border. Perhaps he feels this encirclement is not to Russia benefit? Perhaps Washington would feel the same way if Russia took over Mexico and Canada? Well, why do you think the American War Machine spent so much effort, blood and treasure, the latter two items come not from the Machine, but from ordinary citizen mass of fools. \\nTime again Mr Putin played a superior hand. The War Machine is not used to being out-played. It is used to American Impunity, American Exceptionsim, American Power, American Superiority. \\nAnd so, with only a few months left in the current regime of war, this gang of devils is talking big war. Not the kind of \u2018routine\u2019 war America fight every single year since the founding of this military state. But Vietnam War II, even global nuclear war. \\nThe Syrian government is winning its country back from the rebels and terrorists. This is bad news for the American War Machine. The Machine is deciding that the only way to stop their project of conquest and hell is to declare war on Russia and Syria. This will drag China in on Russia\u2019s side, meaning a war will break out in the South China Sea. \\nBut you know what if war is what the American War Machine wants then war is what it will get. History will record who comes out alive. \\nThe Russian military already stated publicly that if Russia is attacked then the next war will not be fought on Russia soil alone as it was when Napoleon and Hitler attacked. Russia have lost dozens of million of people in these attacks from the West. It has proven it can survive, win, even prosper. It will do so again. \\nThe only question is if America is wiling to put up the cost of attacking Syrian/Russian forces. On its own soil. Big time.

Putin and Obama may just be putting on a show. \\nOr perhaps this just another way of rigging the election. If Trump somehow pulls out a win, Obama might say Russia hacked the election, declare the election invalid and go on to serve another six months or so. Or perhaps, Obama wants Russia to make an aggressive move that would make Trump look bad. \\nIt is too simple to say that this is between Sunni and Shia. Saudi Arabia would not be assisting ISIS without the USG approval. The USG has been saying for years that \u201cAssad must go\u201d\u2013 something that will be painful to back away from even if a referendum supports Assad after Syria is retaken. Bashar Assad is not a Shia either. He is a secular Alawite married to a Sunni. Most Sunnis in Syria have supported him. \\nOr this could be just another case of imperial hubris. Given that NATO\u2019s population is 6 times Russia\u2019s and its GDP nearly 20 times Russia\u2019s, these guys may just think they have checkmate on Russia, not believing that Russia would dare resort to the unthinkable. Problem is, conventional war might be worse for Russia, once its air defenses are gone and NATO bombers have a free sky from which to carpet-bomb Russian cities. If this is the case, then we should all be asking ourselves where to go to be safe from nukes.

Lazarovic \\nJesus still wouldn\u2019t win a Republican primary, he\u2019s way too liberal\u2026 df NJ \\nPeople who seek God through the Bible are doing it out of fear and not because of love. Fear is the driving motivation behind the Bible. Nobody has proven eternal damnation exists. It\u2019s all based on imaginary fears. Why would an omnipotent God who needs absolutely nothing from us care if we are sinners or not. It makes absolutely no sense. God needs nothing from us. There is no cosmic scoreboard. God is omnipotent whether we choose to have faith in God or not. \\nIf God truly loves us then he would use his omnipotent powers of forgiveness to allow everything through the gates of heaven to experience eternal bliss. What difference does it make to God? It\u2019s not like it will diminish God\u2019s omnipotent powers to forgive Hitler. God loves Hitler because other than Hitler\u2019s mother, God is all Hitler has! \\nNot accepting God\u2019s omnipotent powers of forgiveness will be given to everyone no matter what indicates you have a lack of faith in an all-powerful all-loving God. What sins you\u2019ve committed or how you practice your religion makes no difference to an all-powerful all-loving God. Are you willing to risk eternal damnation by putting all your faith in an all-power all-forgiving God? Is your faith strong enough? Are you brave enough? Now that\u2019s a real test of faith! \\nIt think a better way to be is to worship a loving God not out of fear but just out of faith. So rather than be afraid I choose to believe God will allow me through the gates of heaven no matter what sins I commit or how I practice my religion during my time on earth. You may think I\u2019m wrong and crazy. But I would rather put my faith in all-loving all-forgiving God as opposed to your dark twisted idea of a hateful vengeful God. Your vengeful angry petty God is based on your twisted ideas of right and wrong. What is a sin and what is not sin is constantly changing. The big ones don\u2019t change much. But there are thousands that are constantly being debated as being right or wrong. \\nThere is only one true God and that God is God. The Bible is not God. Your twisted ideas about Jesus are not God. Or the twisted ideas about Jesus written by men in the Bible are not above God. The disciples are not above God. The disciples are men and nothing more. The disciples are not Gods. You can\u2019t tell me that each disciple did not describe the teachings of Jesus based on their own world view and interpretation of Jesus\u2019s teachings. What is written in the Bible is the ghost of teachings of Jesus as seen through the eyes of each disciple. \\nThere is only one true God and his name is God. My faith is in God above all other words of men that were written in the Bible. \\nIf you are not talking about God then you are NOT talking about God. It\u2019s so obvious yet most of you are so twisted with ideas about God that your ideas about God eventually have nothing to do with God. \\nFor example, talking about Jesus is not talking about God. Jesus was a Jewish rabbi who was talking about God. But when you are talking about Jesus you are not talking about God. \\nIf you want to seek God where do you look? You don\u2019t need to look in the Bible to find God. I don\u2019t need a disciple to tell me where God is or how to look. God is everywhere around us. God is infinite. God does exist outside the Bible. You don\u2019t need a Bible to find God. You just have to have faith in God while you are looking.

Neither one. mtntrek3 \\nI will add\u2026\u2026.. those that think Putin is our friend are mistaken. Seriously? C\u2019mon,please.

If you say another country other the so-called good old US of A; you\u2019re an idiot. mtntrek3 \\nYou neglected to reflect both sides of the political aisle. Just saying.

I get carried away with my rant sessions at times. My bad. Anyway\u2026. hey Bill, how\u2019re you? I\u2019m going to be looking into Independents more in the future. Sick of this crap that is politically. I voted for who I thought was the \u201cbest\u201d out of the ones I could think of. Maybe you and others say I threw my vote away\u2026\u2026 or I actually voted for one or the other of these two clowns by default. I disagree. We need to get away from the status quo however possible. Hard to vote Independent often time as their aren\u2019t many (if any) on the ballot / no space for a write-in. I\u2019m going to try more in that direction in the future however. Also, I\u2019m going to be contacting the elected officials more often as well. And, abortion\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ve already stated my views on the matter. Take care Bill. mtntrek3 \\nMy heart goes out to our people and Russia\u2019s. We\u2019re being led by ones in control of each. Which is worse?\u2026. . I\u2019d like to think which ones are worse. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. I have to say, I want to stay here in America that we\u2019ve fought and died for. I\u2019m sad for the state we\u2019re in. Troubled indeed. We have to be on our guard for further declines as a nation. Improvements?\u2026.. with these two as a choice, not seeing it. Think about it. df NJ \\nI stopped thinking after George W Bush got elected\u2026chosen to be president in 2000. mtntrek3 \\nRigged? I wonder. Trump cries that out now of course. He states several of these things that I personally have questioned for some years. He has tapped into the concerns of many of us in America. Now\u2026.. if only he was sane/credible and had some sort of viable plan. He\u2019s been a part of the problem in our corporates. Now he says he\u2019s not. To me, he\u2019s a rabble-rouser with alternate objectives. df NJ \\n2000 was an historic election: \\n\u201cTHE COURT STEPS IN The Supreme Court actually interposed itself into the election contest three times. Only the last two are known as Bush v. Gore. In the first of these cases, Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, the Court hoped to end the election crisis by putting a stop to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision to extend the time for certifying the vote past the period set by state law. But by the time the Court began hearing arguments in the appeal on December 1, the certification had already occurred. The embarrassed justices sent the case back down to the Florida Supreme Court, instructing the lower court to rewrite its opinion so that it would not create a conflict between state and federal law. \\nA week later, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide recount of ballots. Unlike its earlier decision, however, this one was not unanimous. With the Florida justices split 4-3, the U.S. Supreme Court once again exercised its discretionary appellate review jurisdiction and granted certiorari, or review, to Bush v. Gore. The day after the Florida Supreme Court had ordered a recount, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a temporary stay, or delay, in enforcing the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s order. The U.S. Supreme Court justices, too, were narrowly divided, 5-4. The five justices voting in favor of the stay were the same five conservatives who had been moving the Rehnquist Court to the right for more than a decade. The first hearing of Bush v. Gore telegraphed to the nation what would happen if the Court took further action in the case. \\nThe Court\u2019s third and final intervention in the 2000 presidential election came just days later. In its unsigned opinion, the Court explained that it had voted 5-4 to put a stop to the Florida recount. Allowing the recount to go forward, the Court said, would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court sent the case back down to the Florida Supreme Court, which had no alternative but to dismiss it. The presidential election of 2000 had been decided, in essence, by the vote of one Supreme Court justice. \u201c mtntrek3 \\nYep, I remember that election\u2026\u2026 counting and recounting, hanging chads, confusing ballots, etc. Some say that this election will be a landslide one way or the other. I\u2019m not sure about that. To me it\u2019ll probably be close. Whether it\u2019s by a few hundred votes again or not, time will tell.

That would help? Maybe. To me it would just raise the prices on several things. Tax breaks for the corporations? Well\u2026. another maybe. Seems as though it really doesn\u2019t translate to that many more jobs. Guess the corp\u2019s suck up the savings at the top w/o creating all that many new jobs. The border wall he touts is fantasy land fodder, as is renegotiating all trade deals. He\u2019ll just wave his magic wand and do these things I suppose. It\u2019d take probably 10-15 years to build a wall , not accounting for snafus along the way (illegals have been tunneling underground more all the time anyway)\u2026\u2026 and I guess other world leaders will cave in to his wishes in trade deals just because \u201cThe Donald\u201d is across the table from them.

I would like to know the REAL reason we have invaded that country and what is behind it. df NJ \\nOur ME foreign policy is determined by the Council of Foreign Relations. The centerpiece to our foreign policy is the balkanization of the Middle East and the Arab World using groups like ISIS. ISIS is a CIA black ops organization. The goal is not to have any strong states or regional powers remaining. This is accomplished by bombing certain Arab countries back to the stone age. ISIS is needed to have a legal and moral justification for excessively bombing of the ragheads. The result will be no credible threats to the USA\u2019s most important interest in the ME.
