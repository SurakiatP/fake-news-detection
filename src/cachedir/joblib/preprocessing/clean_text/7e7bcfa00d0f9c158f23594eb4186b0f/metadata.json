He now has a lifetime to savor it, while Djokovic can ponder the Grand Slam that got away. Querrey, a    Californian with a thunderclap serve and forehand, handled the mounting pressure and a total of four rain delays with surprising aplomb to close out his stunning   (6)       (5) victory in the third round on Saturday. Above all, he handled the   Djokovic, who has been in the deepest of grooves, having won 30 straight Grand Slam singles matches and four straight Grand Slam tournaments, including, last month, the French Open for the first time. \u201cDefinitely the biggest win I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Querrey said. \u201cBut there\u2019s another match after this, so hopefully I can keep it going, make a quarterfinal of a Slam, which I\u2019ve never done before. \u201d And yet this was not the same   Djokovic who has deflected power and cruised through many a draw in the past two seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling, obviously, to be able to hold four Grand Slams at the same time,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cComing into Wimbledon, obviously, here I knew that mentally it\u2019s not going to be easy to kind of remotivate myself. But the importance of this tournament is so immense that you always find ways to really get inspired and prepare and try to give your best. Obviously, my best wasn\u2019t good enough this year. \u201d Last year, Djokovic dodged a similar sort of danger in the fourth round at Wimbledon when he rallied from a   deficit over two days to win against another tall,   and   opponent: Kevin Anderson of South Africa. But the   Querrey, relaxed enough between big points to keep flipping his racket in the air and catching it by the grip, was able to slam the escape hatch that Anderson had left ajar. Querrey finished with 31 aces against Djokovic, the world\u2019s premier returner, and dominated in the short rallies, winning 124 points out of 220 in exchanges of fewer than five strokes. \u201cI think Sam has got a really, really tricky game for anybody to play against,\u201d said his coach, Craig Boynton. \u201cHe serves huge, and when he\u2019s taking his full cuts at the ball, he\u2019s not going to give you any rhythm. \u201d Boynton\u2019s other pupil, Steve Johnson, also reached the fourth round, earning a shot at a major upset of his own against Roger Federer. Querrey is scheduled to face the unseeded Frenchman Nicolas Mahut. \u201cIt seemed to me Novak was a little bit off, a little edgy,\u201d Boynton said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand how hard it is for these top guys. What they have to do, day in and day out, is incredible, but look: Novak is going to lose at some point. He\u2019s human. \u201d Djokovic looked particularly mortal in the early and closing stages of this match, which stretched over two days because of the rain that has continued to rewrite the Wimbledon schedule. Djokovic had not lost before the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament since the 2009 French Open, where Philipp Kohlschreiber beat him in the third round. But on Friday, Djokovic appeared listless and tactically adrift in the second set before play was called off. Though he came back stronger on Saturday, jumping out to a   lead in the third set before play was again stopped because of rain, he faltered with a fifth set in plain view. Djokovic served for the fourth set at   and was unable to close it out. He then lost a   lead in the tiebreaker with a series of uncharacteristic errors as Querrey reeled off six of the next eight points, including the one that mattered most when Djokovic made an unforced forehand error on Querrey\u2019s second match point. Querrey, hardly the most demonstrative of men, celebrated with a leaping scissor kick and a fist pump and then hustled to the net to shake the hand of Djokovic, the champion who had beaten him in eight of their nine previous matches and had blown past him,       in the third round of the 2014 United States Open. Djokovic classily flashed him a   before the handshake. \u201cWhat makes him so good is he wins those matches where he isn\u2019t playing his best,\u201d Querrey said of Djokovic. \u201cDefinitely, yesterday in the second, he lost some momentum. He wasn\u2019t playing like he usually does. Today, I mean, he made me earn it. He\u2019s not a guy that goes away. He made me come out and win those big points. Probably not the best he\u2019s ever played, but not the worst he\u2019s ever played. \u201d Wimbledon used to be a garden party away from home for the American men. John McEnroe won three titles here in the 1980s, and Pete Sampras won seven in the 1990s and 2000. Andy Roddick reached three finals in the 2000s. But the current generation of American men, led by John Isner and Querrey, has not had nearly that sort of success at Wimbledon  \u2014   or at any other major tournament. The    Querrey, for all his big weapons, was only   in Grand Slam singles matches before his match with Djokovic on Court 1 on Saturday and had to rally from a   deficit in the first round here before beating Lukas Rosol,   in the fifth set. But he has a winning record now, along with a victory for the time capsule. \u201cIt\u2019s not career defining, but it\u2019s really exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ll always get to have, which is great. \u201d Djokovic had played no official tournaments on grass this season before arriving at Wimbledon, but then he had played no official tournaments on grass before he won the titles in 2011, 2014 and 2015. But winning a   title like the French Open can be draining in an unexpected way, and there is clearly a cumulative effect on any great champion from all the pressure resisted and upset bids thwarted. In this case, there was also the pressure of a potential Grand Slam  \u2014   winning all four major titles in the same season  \u2014   which no man has done since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic won the first two legs, at the Australian Open and the French Open, but the suspense did not last past the first week at Wimbledon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it played as big of a factor, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cComing into this match, I knew that it\u2019s going to be very close, not easy to break his serve. If he\u2019s on a roll, as he was, it\u2019s really hard to read his serve. He hits his spots really well. And whenever he had a chance from the rally, he was going for the shots. \u201d But Djokovic has snuffed out many a huge server in his career. The problem against Querrey was that he was not effective enough on his own serve. His   and   speeds are down significantly from a year ago. His winning percentage on his second serve  \u2014   54. 3 percent for the tournament  \u2014   was his lowest at Wimbledon since 2008, and he was able to win only 65 percent of the points on his first serves against Querrey. He finished with 34 winners to 31 unforced errors and a drawn face that perhaps reflected deeper concerns. Asked if he was 100 percent healthy, Djokovic answered: \u201cNot really, but you know, it\u2019s not the place and time to talk about it. Again, the opponent was playing on a very high level, and he deserved to win. \u201d Acknowledging that you are not 100 percent healthy is not quite giving full credit to the man who just ended your Wimbledon hopes. Querrey, a mellow man in a fraught microcosm, did not complain. He has had his own share of injuries and missed opportunities. At age 19, he reached the third round in his first Australian Open in 2007. Bigger Grand Slam success seemed only a matter of time. But the path has been more arduous than he might have suspected, and there have been major roadblocks in the form of Djokovic, Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. \u201cThose guys are just   really good,\u201d Boynton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that our guys aren\u2019t good, but you\u2019re talking to me right now because Novak lost, and it doesn\u2019t happen that often. And there\u2019s a reason it doesn\u2019t happen. To get through that bubble has been very difficult, but Sam got through it today. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564592.0633245}
