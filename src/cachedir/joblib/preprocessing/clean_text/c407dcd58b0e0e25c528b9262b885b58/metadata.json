Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and aides, Clinton family members and outside donors all angling for position and power within Mrs. Clinton\u2019s   campaign. Last week, a set of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails were disclosed that included potentially damaging excerpts from private paid speeches Mrs. Clinton delivered to Wall Street executives in which she praised \u201copen trade and open borders\u201d and lamented that her personal wealth made her \u201ckind of far removed\u201d from the struggles of the middle class. The latest leaked emails show Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides trying to grapple with that reality, and establish a campaign message that could position her, a career politician and Washington insider, as an appealing agent of change. The authenticity of the emails, which were from Mr. Podesta\u2019s account, was not challenged by Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. Here are the highlights: Despite statements by Mrs. Clinton and her allies insisting she had not made up her mind about seeking the presidency in 2016, the emails reveal that her advisers had begun to test messages and contemplate a campaign strategy at least two years before she officially declared her candidacy in April 2015. Mr. Podesta, who would become campaign chairman, and Robby Mook, the eventual campaign manager, grappled with how to best position Mrs. Clinton, a career politician, as a change agent, how much to play up the   potential of her candidacy and how to address anger over income inequality. \u201cGender will be a big field and volunteer motivator, but it won\u2019t close the deal,\u201d Mr. Mook wrote to Mr. Podesta and Cheryl D. Mills, another Clinton adviser, in March 2014. \u201cThe real challenge,\u201d Ms. Mills wrote, \u201cis that this likely will be when people want experience and we got so burned by that narrative\u201d in the 2008 campaign against Barack Obama that \u201cwe won\u2019t go back to it, even though it might be right for now. \u201d The emails reveal the excruciating   behind every step related to how Mrs. Clinton handled everything from her splashy campaign rollout speech on Roosevelt Island in June 2015 to a single Twitter post. In one email chain from March 2015, four aides debated a Twitter post in which Mrs. Clinton would address for the first time revelations that she had used a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. \u201cI want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,\u201d the post eventually read. \u201cShe smacked down POTUS on trade and kept kicking for a little bit,\u201d Huma Abedin, a close aide, wrote on June 14, 2015, using an acronym for the president. \u201cWorth looking at the transcript but this seemed to really work for this crowd. \u201d At the time, Mrs. Clinton was trying to craft herself as more of a populist, pointing to differences between her and Mr. Obama. The aides also liked the personal details she shared. \u201cShe inserted some new applause lines and talked about Dorothy,\u201d her mother, \u201cin a more personal way that I\u2019ve only heard talk about privately,\u201d Ms. Abedin wrote. Aides discussed leaking it after a meeting with labor leaders  \u2014   so as not to undermine her \u201cprincipled stand about not   the president in public. \u201d Mr. Mook suggested that Mrs. Clinton time her announcement to \u201chelp distract\u201d from the barrage of criticism surrounding her use of a private email server. The emails show heightened awareness of her vulnerability to charges of   and political maneuvering. \u201cShe risks looking very political, especially on this,\u201d wrote Joel Benenson, the chief strategist on the campaign. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Brian Fallon, felt that leaking her new position on Keystone \u201cmight achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. \u201d We take a closer look at how the debate over the unveiling evolved. In 2015, the Clinton campaign had to deal with escalating chatter about a potential run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Donors phoned in reports on Mr. Biden\u2019s    maneuvers to advisers like Neera Tanden, who relayed them back to Mr. Podesta. Steve Elmendorf, a longtime Clinton supporter, emailed her campaign manager to grouse about one supporter in particular: Linda Lipsen, head of the trial lawyers association. \u201cI get multiple   calls every morning and I try to talk everyone off the ledge and not bug u all,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf wrote. \u201cBut Linda is in a different category. \u201d Ms. Lipsen had complained about not getting enough care from the campaign at a time when she was working members of her trade association and trying to keep them from considering Mr. Biden. For all the planning, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides appeared blindsided by the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s populist message in the Democratic primary. Concern over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic message seemed to reach a breaking point after Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Sanders by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary. \u201cMessage needs to be more positive, upbeat, hopeful,\u201d an adviser wrote to Mr. Podesta. \u201cBernie is saying we can change the world. Her msg is \u2018No, we can\u2019t\u2019 because   \u2026    \u201d The adviser expressed particular concern about young voters gravitating to Mr. Sanders\u2019s promise for revolution. \u201cBernie\u2019s ads feature young ppl saying why they are voting   supporting him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHillary\u2019s ads need to be young people  \u2014   all under 45 and a smattering of older ones  \u2014   validating her. \u201d In January, Donna Brazile, a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, passed on an email from Mr. Sanders\u2019s   outreach team about how it was planning to host a   event. \u201cThank you for the heads up on this, Donna,\u201d responded Adrienne Elrod, one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides. Ms. Brazile, a longtime party operative, later replaced Debbie Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis as D. N. C. chairwoman on the eve of the party\u2019s national convention, a change that came after leaked emails revealed that Democratic officials had conspired to harm Mr. Sanders\u2019s bid for the party\u2019s nomination. Her aides decided in January that she should avoid talking about Wall Street at an event in Nevada during her primary fight with Mr. Sanders. \u201cDon\u2019t know that it is most effective contrast for her,\u201d wrote Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s communications director. \u201cSeems like we are picking the fight he wants to have. \u201d In the fall and winter of 2011, an increasingly bitter dispute was breaking out between a top Clinton aide, Douglas J. Band, and Chelsea Clinton, over the blurred lines between the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Band\u2019s consulting company, Teneo. Ms. Clinton had sought to reorganize and professionalize the foundation, angering Mr. Band and a fellow longtime Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, who resisted. \u201cDoug apparently kept telling my dad I was trying to push him out, take over,\u201d Ms. Clinton told Mr. Podesta in a November 2011 email. But the next month, Ms. Clinton was less understanding. In December, she emailed Mr. Podesta and several aides to Mrs. Clinton regarding a Clinton Foundation aide who worked for former President Bill Clinton. The aide, Ilya Aspis, had been calling members of Parliament in Britain \u201con behalf of President Clinton\u201d for Teneo clients, including the chief executive of Dow Chemical. She also mentions that another former White House aide, Sara Latham, had begun working for Teneo but then quit \u201cbecause she was so upset, partly because of what Doug and Declan asked her to   was happening for their clients at Davos. \u201d The reference appears to be to Declan Kelly, a   of Teneo, though what Ms. Latham was asked to do remains unclear.'"}, "time": 1742562032.990138}
