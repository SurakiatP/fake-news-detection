The statement, published on the Vatican website, claimed that the deaths were needed to shake-up a flagging variety line-up currently dominated by tambourine-heavy U2 tribute acts and weak parable-based comedy sketches. \\n\u2018Have you any fucking idea how boring Christians are?\u2019 said one Archangel,who asked to remain anonymous. \u2018Sure, they mean well but they don\u2019t half know how to suck the life out of everything. Bowie, on the other hand, has already released a version of \u2018Kum Ba Yah\u2019 that sent shivers down my spine, and Prince\u2019s rendition of \u2018All Things Bright and Beautiful\u2019 had the cherubs dry-humping their harps.\u2019 \\nSpeaking directly to reporters outside the Pearly Gates, God acknowledged that the deaths had compounded the misery of one of the worst years in decades but called it a \u2018necessary evil\u2019. \u2018I appreciate it sucks for you guys but, seriously, have you any idea how good our nativity play is going to be this year?\u2019 He said. \\n\u2018We\u2019ve already got Alan Rickman signed up to play Herod, naturally, and I almost shat myself laughing when Gene Wilder started doing his Archangel Gabriel. There was a bit of a bun fight over whether Mary would be played by Victoria Wood or Caroline Aherne, but that\u2019s the price you pay for having so much talent available. Leonard Cohen and Robert Vaughn are sadly now joining the cast to beef up the wise men. You\u2019re lucky we don\u2019t have any wildlife up here,\u2019 he added, \u2018otherwise Attenborough would have been underneath a bus months ago.\u2019 Charlie Stuart'"}, "time": 1742564139.1321325}
