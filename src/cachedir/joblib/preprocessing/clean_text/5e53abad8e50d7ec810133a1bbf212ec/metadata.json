An Oklahoma man\u2019s animosity toward the   family living next door, according to court records, took a fatal turn this month when he shot one of the sons on the porch of their house in Tulsa. The man, Vernon Majors, 61, was charged Tuesday with   murder in the killing of his neighbor, Khalid Jabara, 37, on Aug. 12, according to a statement by the district attorney, Steve Kunzweiler. Mr. Majors, who had recently been released on bond after being suspected of hitting Mr. Jabara\u2019s mother with a car, was also charged with possession of a firearm by a felon, threatening an act of violence and malicious intimidation or harassment  \u2014   the last count a misdemeanor reflecting the years of racism and violence that the authorities say has pervaded the stretch of grass connecting their yards. Rebecca   a friend who is serving as a spokeswoman for the Jabara family, said Mr. Jabara\u2019s death had devastated the   Lebanese community in Tulsa. \u201cFrom a larger community\u2019s perspective, what they see is a    man shot and killed by a man who called them \u2018dirty Arab,\u2019\u201d Ms.   said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere is no nuance. When people are using ethnic and racial slurs, this isn\u2019t just people being sensitive about it, but that they should be taken seriously. \u201d Marvin Lizama, Mr. Majors\u2019s lawyer for the earlier case, said in an email on Tuesday that he had no comment on the new charges. St. Antony Orthodox Christian Church, where Mr. Jabara\u2019s funeral was held last Thursday, posted a smiling photograph of him  on its website, mourning the \u201ctragedy\u201d of his killing. \u201cThose of us at St. Antony will always remember the young man who grew up in our parish,\u201d the announcement said. \u201cKhalid had a huge heart. \u201d The     Committee said that Mr. Jabara was clearly targeted because of his ethnicity. \u201cThe unfortunate murder of Jabara is a reflection of the impact and power of hateful rhetoric in politics and the society at large,\u201d the group said, adding that allowing such to continue \u201cwill lead to additional hate crimes against minority and immigrant communities. \u201d News of Mr. Jabara\u2019s death found a home on social media with the trending #justice4khalid, where it was given broader context within the national discussion on race and violence. Nearly 3. 6 million Americans trace their roots to an Arab country, many with ancestral ties to Lebanon, according to the Arab American Institute. While Oklahoma is not among the states with large   populations, it does have a     community in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Ms.   a lawyer and former employee of the institute, said. Like others in Tulsa, the Jabara family, who are Orthodox Christians, can trace their roots back to a village in southern Lebanon called Marjayoun, which families fled to escape war. Mr. Jabara\u2019s parents moved with Khalid and his older sister Victoria in 1983 and settled in the United States, where his younger brother Rami was born, Ms.   said. While his siblings have moved away, Mr. Jabara had stayed to help with his parents\u2019 catering business and medical care. \u201cKhalid\u2019s heart was big,\u201d his sister Victoria Jabara Williams said in a Facebook post. \u201cHe cared for our entire family, our friends and people he didn\u2019t even know. \u201d Mr. Majors, also known as Stanley Vernon Majors, moved next door to the Jabara family in 2011, Ms.   said. While it was not immediately clear when the troubles started, family and court records document a history of animosity and of calls to the police to report racial slurs, harassment and threats by Mr. Majors. In 2013, Mr. Jabara\u2019s mother, Haifa, took out a protective order against Mr. Majors, which court records show that he violated. In September 2015, Mr. Majors rammed Ms. Jabara with his car, and he was charged with assault and battery, according to the documents. Ms. Jabara had broken bones and a collapsed lung, the family said. In May 2016, the district attorney\u2019s office tried to keep Mr. Majors in jail to await trial, citing his \u201cwanton disregard for the life of the victim and the safety of the public. \u201d Mr. Majors, however, was able to make bail and was released. According to the police and Ms.   Mr. Jabara was home with his father on Aug. 12 when he called the police out of fear of Mr. Majors. Officer Leland Ashley said the police received a call from the Jabara house saying that Mr. Majors had banged on a window. Ms. Williams said her brother had called the police to report that Mr. Majors had a gun. The police responded but left without taking any action. Then, just before 7 p. m. Officer Ashley said, a neighbor reported that there had been a shooting. Mr. Jabara was taken to the hospital, where he died of his wounds. Mr. Majors was arrested, hiding near a library, about 11 p. m. the officer said. Mr. Kunzweiler, the district attorney, said in an emailed statement before announcing the charges that the family \u201cdid everything they were supposed to do and the system failed them. \u201d Ms. Williams said her family had lived \u201cin fear of this man and his hatred for years. \u201d \u201cHe should not have been released without monitoring,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYet he was released and put back next door to us, the family he assaulted just months before. This is troubling at any time, but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564555.741892}
