Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, said Tuesday that Russian intelligence officials intent on swaying the election to Donald J. Trump had been responsible for the illegal breach into his account. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in politics for nearly five decades,\u201d Mr. Podesta told reporters aboard the Clinton campaign plane. \u201cThis definitely is the first campaign that I\u2019ve been involved with in which I\u2019ve had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies,\u201d he added, \u201cwho seem to be doing everything that they can on behalf of our opponent. \u201d Without verifying the authenticity of the emails, Mr. Podesta said that he had spoken with the F. B. I. \u201cas a victim\u201d of hacking. The Obama administration, like Mr. Podesta, believes the Russian government has been trying to help Mr. Trump with its hacking, including the theft of emails of the Democratic National Committee this year. Mr. Podesta said Mr. Trump had \u201cessentially adopted lock, stock and barrel\u201d a foreign policy that would favor the interests of President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Podesta also cast blame on Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks and an avowed critic of Mrs. Clinton. He said WikiLeaks had strategically released the first batch of his emails Friday afternoon to distract attention from the damaging video that had just emerged of Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any coincidence, I think, that within minutes of the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape coming out, they decided that this was their countermove,\u201d Mr. Podesta said. The hacked emails have not done much to help Mr. Trump in the polls, but they have proved to be a persistent distraction. Earlier on Tuesday, some newly released emails suggested that a senior Clinton campaign aide had been in touch with government officials about the release of her State Department emails, exchanges that prompted accusations of collusion from Republicans on Tuesday. The timing of the release of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s State Department emails was critical information for her aides, who were devising strategy on how to respond to any story lines that could emerge. But the communication between the campaign and the Justice Department appeared to have simply been updates on a court case related to the emails, information that was publicly available. Brian Fallon, the campaign\u2019s press secretary, told other campaign aides in May 2015 that he had just received information about a case from someone at the department. \u201cDOJ just filed a briefing saying the gov\u2019t proposes releasing HRC\u2019s cache of   emails in January 2016,\u201d Mr. Fallon wrote. \u201cGet out! ???\u201d replied Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer and longtime adviser to Mrs. Clinton. The correspondence came months before the F. B. I. which is part of the Justice Department, opened an investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of classified emails at the State Department. In July, the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said Mrs. Clinton had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d but recommended no charges, which the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, accepted. Though the information Mr. Fallon passed on reflected no internal Justice Department thinking, the connection between a senior Clinton aide and the department stoked accusations that the Obama administration had conspired with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s camp. The correspondence released Tuesday showed \u201ca level of collusion which calls into question the entire investigation into her private server,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, also brought it up at two events in Iowa. The day after Mr. Fallon\u2019s exchange on the Justice Department\u2019s court filing, he provided additional information to other campaign aides on the case. \u201cDOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo we could have a window into the judge\u2019s thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today. \u201d Mr. Fallon declined to comment on the exchanges. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.'"}, "time": 1742562084.874284}
