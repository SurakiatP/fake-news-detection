And like mom, it isn\u2019t asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos. \\nWhile millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there\u2019s something devious afoot are trying to block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data. \\nAs advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world\u2019s largest social network and search engine have sold users\u2019 viewing histories for advertising. The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn\u2019t against the law, even without your permission. \\nIf judges agree with Facebook and Google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person\u2019s image is used without permission \u2014 big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions. A loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada. \\nFacebook declined to comment on its court fight. Google hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment (Scroll down for a closer look at the court cases) . \\nCourts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users\u2019 personal information from e-mails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed. \\nThis year, the U.S. Supreme Court set a \u201cconcrete injury\u201d standard for privacy suits, a ruling that both sides are using to argue their case ahead of a hearing Thursday in San Francisco over Facebook\u2019s bid to dismiss the biometrics case. \\nGoogle is fending off suits in Chicago, arguing that the Illinois statute can\u2019t apply outside the state under the Constitution\u2019s interstate commerce rules. Google also contends the Illinois law doesn\u2019t regulate photos. \\nFacebook encourages users to \u201ctag\u201d people in photographs they upload in their personal posts and the social network stores the collected information. The company uses a program it calls DeepFace to match other photos of a person. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s cloud-based Google Photos service uses similar technology. \\nThe billions of images Facebook is thought to be collecting could be even more valuable to identity thieves than the names, addresses, and credit card numbers now targeted by hackers, according to privacy advocates and legal experts. \\nWhile those types of information are mutable\u2014even Social Security numbers can be changed\u2014biometric data for retinas, fingerprints, hands, face geometry and blood samples, are unique identifiers. \\n\u201cBiometric identifiers are a key way to link together information about people,\u201d such as discrete financial, medical and educational records, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who isn\u2019t involved in the case. Facebook has \u201ccleverly got its users to improve the accuracy of its own database,\u201d he said. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742562124.0930061}
