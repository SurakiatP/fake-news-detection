That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it is a long way from the -15 bps it yielded a couple of months ago. Meanwhile, world equity markets more or less looked the other way, although they were slightly lower. The early going here saw the market modestly weaker as well, and acting funky enough that I put on a few shorts\u2026 IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world \u2013 CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \\nAround midday the leakage accelerated somewhat and the market was 0.5% lower by early afternoon. With a couple of hours to go, when I had to leave, the decline was about 0.75% (but it felt like it might accelerate, so check the box scores). Away from stocks, green paper was a bit weaker, led by a bounce in the euro, oil lost 1%, fixed income was a bit lower, and the metals came to life, led by silver, which popped 3% to gold\u2019s 1%. The miners similarly had a pretty strong day, just as they did yesterday. I didn\u2019t note Monday\u2019s action because I was suspicious it might have something to do with end-of-the-month tape painting, but obviously that was not the case. \\nGold Dog, New Tricks Given the fact that the Bank of Japan did nothing new and the Fed is expected to make hawkish comments tomorrow regarding a December rate hike, it was an interesting time for the metals to pop. I\u2019m sure today\u2019s action has a number of people scratching their head as to how this could be. And I have to admit, I thought there was little chance for gold to start moving until we got past tomorrow\u2019s promise from Fed heads to hike rates, assuming the data continues to be, in their words, \u201cstrong enough\u201d (a phrase that is naturally open to subjective interpretation on their part). Having said that, I don\u2019t feel there is going to be a hike because I don\u2019t think the stock market or the economy are going to cooperate. \\nMake It Stop There is also the wild card of the election next week and despite the mainstream media and the polls suggesting that Trump is a long shot, I think the tally will be much closer and his chance of winning is nontrivial, although certainly not expected. I mention that because, were Trump to win, I think a lot of markets would be put in motion. \\nThe stock market has been an accident waiting to happen, and considering how much Wall Street seems to be enamored of a Clinton victory, an upset would probably be enough of a catalyst to send the indices tumbling, which by extension would be a positive for gold \u2014 and take a rate hike off the table. On the other hand, in the event Hillary wins, I don\u2019t think the stock market could really go up much. \\nIn any event, I don\u2019t want to get into too much of a discussion about what is liable to happen, as we will have the data in a few days and can decide exactly what to do in the wake of it from a stock market perspective. Besides, a precious metals position can do well under any number of potential scenarios we may see, and they may have already discounted a rate hike, which we probably won\u2019t get. Included below are three questions and answers from the Q&A\u2019s with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: If the bond market has \u201ctopped\u201d, isn\u2019t it irrelevant who wins the Presidency. In other words the bond market will be in full control and politicians will be late and simply be responding with desperate measures? Answer from Fleck: \u201c Yes, the President is irrelevant to a large degree versus the bond market.\u201d Question: Dear Bill, Happy Halloween! If you were going to dress as something scary for Halloween would it be\u2013 a) deflation, b) a creepy clown, or c) one of the presidential candidates. Of course b) and c) aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, since clowns can be either gender\u2026 Answer from Fleck: \u201c If I was going out to a party, I would dress as Mr. Politically Incorrect, and I\u2019d try to wear a small bit of any/every costume that is deemed to be \u201coffensive,\u201d (i.e. part Chinese, Japanese, black, Arab, gay, trans, Indian, Mexican, angry clown, Hitler, etc.) I am so sick of microagression and related censorship. We have a right to free speech in this country, but there is no right to \u201cnot be offended.\u201d People need to get over themselves. We have far bigger problems in this country than being offended.\u201d Question: Yesterday you wrote \u201cas the belief that the central planners have accomplished what they set out to, nothing can go wrong, and the election will go whichever way it needs to for us to live happily ever after.\u201d I think the S&P 500 being flat for 22 months with fits and starts says something doesn\u2019t it? Frustrating for bulls and bears alike. Answer from Fleck: \u201c Yeah, it does say something, which is, \u201cwithout QE, the stock market can\u2019t go up.\u201d *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein\u2019s fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE. \\n***KWN has now released the remarkable audio interview with Nomi Prins CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n***ALSO RELEASED: Today\u2019s Upside Move In Gold Is Nothing Compared To What Is Coming CLICK HERE. \\n***KWN has also released Rick Rule\u2019s timely audio interview CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n\u00a9 2015 by King World News\u00ae.
