Cleveland.com reports : \\nThe order entered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge James Gwin in Cleveland says the defendants\u2019 response must include any objections to an order \u201climiting voter intimidation\u201d or \u201climiting people at polling locations who are not authorized poll watchers or outside the polling stations.\u201d \\nThe speed in which Gwin ordered the response, while not necessarily signaling how he feels about the case, shows that the judge is taking the accusations of voter intimidation seriously before Nov. 8 Election Day. \\nThe candidate may use a wink and a nod, but that doesn\u2019t allow anyone to circumvent the federal laws governing elections. The US Constitution places all federal elections under the realm of congressional control, and the Voting Rights Act makes it illegal to intimidate or pressure anyone seeking to exercise their right to vote. \\nAs the lawsuit indicates, even Ohio Republicans are reporting Trump supporters using illegal intimidation tactics in Cuyahoga County, the home of Cleveland\u2019s large minority population: \\nAccording to Pat McDonald, the Republican Director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, Trump supporters have already visited the county elections board identifying themselves as poll observers, even though they did not appear to be credentialed as poll observers as required under Ohio law. Indeed, Trump\u2019s fearmongering has caused Cuyahoga County election officials to express concerns of instability on Election Day and to raise the prospect of deploying law-enforcement officials to the polls if necessary to address polling place issues. \\nDemocrats filed suit late Sunday night to enjoin Republicans from efforts which have included fake poll watcher badges and verbal conduct by the Trump campaign and nominee, plus efforts by Roger Stone\u2019s Super PAC to exit-poll minority polling places, when in fact Stone doesn\u2019t run a polling operation and hasn\u2019t during this year\u2019s campaign: \\nThe lawsuit cites several examples of such comments by Trump made in Ohio, including a statement made at an Aug. 22 rally in Akron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get everybody to go out and watch, and go out and vote,\u201d Trump said at the rally. \u201cAnd when I say \u2018watch,\u2019 you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d It also references an unnamed senior Trump campaign official who told Bloomberg News that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way.\u201d \\nIt also takes aim at Stone and a group he controls, Stop the Steal Inc., and seeks to stop them from conducting \u201cexit polling\u201d in nine cities that historically vote Democrat. These include Cleveland, Philadelphia and Las Vegas. Stone said in an emailed statement that the polls his organizations will conduct will be scientific. \u201cWe seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that is not the case,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cI assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter-fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.\u201d \\nStone did not provide any evidence to back up his fraud claim. \\nOhio isn\u2019t the only battleground state in the fight against Republican dirty tricks at the polls. Lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona are also being fought over the same issues , but with each local problem, such as the 94 vigilante poll watchers Roger Stone has signed up in Arizona for his Super PAC. \\nThe Democratic National Committee is also suing its national counterpart, and just received extensive information about the RNC\u2019s poll watching plans and geographic targeting which is still being held under seal by the federal court. A federal judge is hearing that case in Newark, N.J. tomorrow at 10am and a decision is expected sometime later in the day. \\nIronically, the multi-state litigation is happening because the national Republican Party successfully separated state level parties from the 1982 court monitoring agreement , so now the Democratic Party must file new lawsuits in multiple states in addition to the national case. However, two state party chairmen that are also RNC members have become embroiled in the national case, as well as some of the Ohio issues have been cited in the national case against the RNC. \\nThe Ohio federal court has greatly expedited this case, so expect more news before election day about rulings meant to protect the general public from vigilante \u201cballot security\u201d operations.'"}, "time": 1742563696.1420631}
