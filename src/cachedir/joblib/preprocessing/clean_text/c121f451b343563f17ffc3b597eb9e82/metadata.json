Well, prepare to engage in battle yet again folks with this viral picture that\u2019s totes dividing the internets. \\nUploaded to numerous social media channels yesterday morning, this picture of a Syrian man has gone viral after users struggled to figure out whether or not he was covered in white rubble from an airstrike \u2013 or if he was just all shiny and covered in some kind of silly oil. \\n\u201cOnce you see it, you just can\u2019t see anything else,\u201d posted one absolute genius, who pretty much summed up the whole picture with one epic tweet containing just 40 characters. \\n\\nWhilst many internet players were quick to point out that the Aleppo man was shiny or covered in plastic, others corrected them by pointing out that the man was actually covered in concrete dust from an Assad led airstrike which launched an illegal barrel bomb that killed at least 15 people, many of whom were women and children. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how your eyes deceive you like that,\u201d pointed out another user of the internet web, \u201cI\u2019d say the guy didn\u2019t know what hit him after his picture went viral\u201d. \\nIn fact, on closer inspection, it becomes obvious that the man is covered head to toe in chalk like material, probably from exploding concrete and falling rubble, as well as what appears to be ketchup on his forearm. Instagram user @reuters, who originally posted the snap, confirmed the red residue was in fact blood, sending the internet into yet another meltdown.'"}, "time": 1742564033.02033}
