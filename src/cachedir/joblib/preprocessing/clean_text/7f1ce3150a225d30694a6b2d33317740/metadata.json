A monstrous and pervasive movement is putting the First Amendment and your free speech, the most basic and fundamental tenets of our nation at risk and in danger of extinction. And whether you are on the left or right, free speech is essential to our democracy, the reason the country was found, the reason people risk so much, even die to come here. Yet, as you sit there, you are watching a silencing in  . Where people are not allowed to express their opinion if it does not align with the thinking of others. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s putting us on the course where we are in danger of becoming a fascist totalitarian society where there is only one accepted point of view no other will be tolerated, and it\u2019s time to fight back,\u201d she added.
