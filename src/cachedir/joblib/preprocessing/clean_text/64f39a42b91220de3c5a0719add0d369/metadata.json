{"duration": 0.1845846176147461, "input_args": {"text": "'The printers buzzed to life in every firehouse in New York City last week, and each spit out an identical bulletin. It bore the worst sort of news the Fire Department must relay to its members, the Code    . A death in the line of duty. \u201cWith regret, the department announces the death of Battalion Chief Lawrence T. Stack,\u201d the note read, \u201cas a result of injuries sustained while operating at Manhattan Box   . \u201d That box number was grimly familiar to all firefighters. It was followed by the time of the call from that box  \u2014   8:47 a. m.  \u2014   and the date: \u201cSeptember 11, 2001. \u201d The announcement and the \u201cfour fives,\u201d as the code is known, had not, until now, been made for Chief Stack for an important reason: His remains had not been found. For his family, this is the end of a frustrating and ultimately fruitless wait of nearly 15 years. Chief Stack, 58, had served almost 33 years. His funeral will be held Friday at SS. Philip and James Church in St. James on Long Island, with the expansive pageantry and huge turnout of firefighters and officers that accompany all departmental ceremonies. Its timing this week, alongside the first funerals of the shooting victims in Orlando, Fla. is accidental, but weighted, bringing an added poignancy. As the country mourns the latest victims of a terrorist attack on its soil, a funeral in New York lays to rest another. Chief Stack\u2019s family came to learn where and how he perished that day. But they put off the funeral, hoping that some trace of him would be identified from what was recovered at ground zero. \u201cWeeks turned into months,\u201d said Lt. Michael Stack, 46, one of Chief Stack\u2019s two sons, both firefighters. \u201cMonths turned into years. Two years turned into five, turned into 10. Now it\u2019s 15. \u201d The Catholic funeral Mass requires the presence of remains of the deceased. This requirement was satisfied, unknowingly, by Chief Stack, in an act of generosity 18 months before his death. \u201cMom came home and said: \u2018There\u2019s a little boy in East Islip and he has cancer. I\u2019m going to donate blood. He needs it,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack recalled. Chief Stack joined his wife, Theresa. He added his name to the bone marrow registry as a possible donor on March 6, 2000, and, in doing so, gave a blood sample for type matching. Chief Stack\u2019s marrow was not a match for an immediate transplant, and the blood sample was put into cold storage. On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Chief Stack was in his office in Brooklyn near the waterfront, filling out a report on a recent fatal fire that brought three Code     transmissions. That fire, in an Astoria warehouse on June 17, 2001, became known for the day it happened: the Father\u2019s Day fire. Word arrived at the office immediately after the first plane hit the north tower of the World Trade Center. Chief Stack and others hurried to the roof with binoculars. They saw the second plane strike the south tower. \u201cHe lowered his binoculars and said, \u2018Guys, I think they\u2019re going to need us,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack said, recalling what he has been told of that day. Chief Stack and others hurried to the scene. He wound up in the lobby of the Marriott World Trade Center, which was being evacuated. Wreckage collapsed into the lobby, nearly striking Chief Stack and leaving him momentarily trapped, his coat stuck. He wiggled free and left the coat behind. It would be recovered three months later. \u201cA lieutenant came up to him and said, \u2018Can you help me? I was with someone, and I can\u2019t find him,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. \u201cThey go back to this collapsed mess and start calling his name out. \u201d They heard a faint voice in the rubble  \u2014   the missing man, a firefighter. The lieutenant grabbed his ankles, and Chief Stack grabbed the lieutenant\u2019s, and they pulled the firefighter out. \u201cMy dad is like, \u2018It\u2019s time to leave, we\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. They stepped outside. \u201cYou can see bodies jumping, falling. My dad said, \u2018There\u2019s the command post. Go there. \u2019\u201d Those firefighters, who lived to tell this to Lieutenant Stack, did so. Chief Stack stopped. He had come across a fallen businessman from Iowa, injured. The firefighters looked back as the north tower fell. \u201cThe last thing they remember seeing is my dad on one knee with this man,\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. \u201cStaying with him. \u201d Lieutenant Stack hurried to the World Trade Center site that day. \u201cI came up, and I go, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just so vast. So big. \u201d He knew from the accounts of others that his father was dead, and he returned to the pit, day after day. \u201cDig and look, search, hope,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I had in mind. I\u2019m going to find him. \u201d Nothing. \u201cI always wanted that department phone call,\u201d saying remains had been found, he said. The family visited a memorial site in Hauppauge, N. Y. on his birthday and sang to him. But it wasn\u2019t like visiting a grave. Finally, last year, Mrs. Stack said enough. \u201cShe drew a line in the sand where she said, \u2018We\u2019re not doing it past 15 years,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. The Office of Chief Medical Examiner has identified 65 percent of remains recovered from the World Trade Center. The rest is damaged enough that current identification technology is of no use, and remains in storage. The New York Blood Center examined its list of donors after Sept. 11, and discovered that 143 firefighters who died that day had signed up to be marrow donors, most of them while still in training as rookies. The center notified the families, and set aside their blood samples over the years, it has given the small vials of blood to some relatives. Some put the vials in their freezers at home. Some bury them at funerals, as with Firefighter Michael Paul Ragusa in 2003. Mrs. Stack and her sons visited the blood center last year. The center located Chief Stack\u2019s blood in a storage facility in Minnesota. The vial will be buried on Friday at Calverton National Cemetery in recognition of Chief Stack\u2019s service in the United States Navy. \u201cWe will have someplace to go,\u201d Mrs. Stack, 71, said on Thursday. The family chose June 17 because it would have been the Stacks\u2019 49th wedding anniversary. Coincidentally, it is the 15th anniversary of the Father\u2019s Day fire, the event front and center on Chief Stack\u2019s mind before the first plane hit. It is the first funeral for a firefighter killed that day in 10 years. \u201cMy mother, she just wanted a nice, small Catholic Mass,\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. He and his brother, Brian, took this idea to Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro in May. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re doing it the right way,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to have a funeral. \u2019\u201d There would be full departmental honors. \u201cBrian and I looked at each other like, \u2018Mom\u2019s not going to like this,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Stack said. \u201cBut in the weeks since, it feels right. \u201d He noted the timing of the Orlando massacre. \u201cWho knew the war was going to come to us on Sept. 11?\u201d he said. \u201cNo one knew the war was coming. And then we wake up June 12 and find out the war is still here. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563895.560168}
