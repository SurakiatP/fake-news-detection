[The mission, which is being launched next year, \u201cwill gather data about the sun\u2019s outermost atmosphere known as the corona where temperatures can reach up to 500, 000C, much higher than those in the sun\u2019s core,\u201d according to The Telegraph, and is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker.  \u201cThis is the first time NASA has named a spacecraft for a living individual,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the importance of his body of work, founding a new field of science that also inspired my own research and many important science questions NASA continues to study and further understand every day. I\u2019m very excited to be personally involved honoring a great man and his unprecedented legacy. \u201d Eugene Parker himself also expressed excitement about the mission, declaring, \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some surprises. There always are. \u201d \u201cThe solar probe is going to a region of space that has never been explored before,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting that we\u2019ll finally get a look. One would like to have some more detailed measurements of what\u2019s going on in the solar wind. \u201d Nicola Fox, a scientist involved with the Parker Solar Probe project, claimed that the probe \u201cis going to answer questions about solar physics that we\u2019ve puzzled over for more than six decades. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star, including finding out why the sun\u2019s corona is so much hotter than its surface,\u201d she claimed. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very proud to be able to carry Gene\u2019s name with us on this amazing voyage of discovery. \u201d According to NASA\u2019s official website, \u201cNASA missions are most often renamed after launch and certification. \u201d \u201cIn this case, given Parker\u2019s accomplishments within the field, and how closely aligned this mission is with his research, the decision was made to honor him prior to launch, in order to draw attention to his important contributions to heliophysics and space science,\u201d they declared.
