Although Nance admitted that it is not known if the Russians \u201cpenetrated\u201d the White House, he said we have to assume they have. \u201cWe should be taking this seriously,\u201d Nance told host Joy Reid. \u201cIt sounds amusing when we\u2019re talking on the panel, but I feel that we\u2019re standing to danger right now with this situation. Everyone needs clearances pulled in that office right now. We do not know if the Russians have penetrated the oval office and we have to assume that they have because right now the Russians could have flooded the zone from December 1st until now, trying to pick up on all of the other people in the office who may have worked with Jared Kushner who may be amenable to recruitment. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742628499.5639927}
