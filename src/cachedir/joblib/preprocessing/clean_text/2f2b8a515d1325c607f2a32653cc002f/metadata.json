It\u2019s a very important issue that isn\u2019t getting the attention it deserves. \\nFor example, as I highlighted in the recent post, Half of American Adults Exist in a Government Accessible Facial Recognition Network : \\nHalf of all American adults are already in some sort of facial recognition network accessible to law enforcement, according to a comprehensive new study. \\nConducted over a year and relying in part on Freedom of Information and public record requests to 106 law enforcement agencies, the study , conducted by Georgetown Law\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology, found American police use of facial recognition technology is a scattered, hodgepodge network of laws and regulations. \\n\u201cLooking at the sum total of what we found, there have been no laws that comprehensively regulate face recognition technology, and there\u2019s really no case law either,\u201d Clare Garvie, an associate at the CPT, told Vocativ. \u201cSo we find ourselves having to rely on the agencies that are using that technology to rein it in. But what we found is that not every system \u2014 by a long shot \u2014 has a use policy.\u201d \\nWith that in mind, Bloomberg published an interesting article yesterday covering a couple of lawsuits against Facebook and Google regarding their facial recognition practices.
