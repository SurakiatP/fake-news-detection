The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers, \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey\u2019s representatives and producers of ABC\u2019s \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve With Ryan Seacrest,\u201d on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey\u2019s manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the show\u2019s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  \u2014   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey\u2019s messy performance \u201cto get ratings. \u201d \u201cI will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production,\u201d Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year\u2019s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have their\u201d act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey\u2019s performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company \u201cwould ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. \u201d \u201cIn very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television,\u201d the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company \u201chad no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve performance. \u201d A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. \u201cEvery monitor and   device worked perfectly,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201c I can\u2019t comment beyond that and don\u2019t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. \u201d A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. \u201cUnfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,\u201d the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final   act on ABC\u2019s \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve With Ryan Seacrest. \u201d She had just finished \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d when her star turn began to spiral out of control. \u201cWe can\u2019t hear,\u201d she said in the opening seconds of \u201cEmotions\u201d after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll just sing,\u201d and noted proudly of her song, \u201cIt went to No. 1. \u201d But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. \u201cWe\u2019re missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cLet the audience sing. \u201d ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a good sport here,\u201d she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. \u201cThat was  \u2014   \u201d she said, pausing for effect, \u201camazing. \u201d She seemed to recover at first with \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. \u201cIt just don\u2019t get any better,\u201d she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an \u201cupset\u201d emoji, then wrote: \u201cHave a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here\u2019s to making more headlines in 2017. \u201d An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Carey\u2019s performance.'"}, "time": 1742628443.0556922}
