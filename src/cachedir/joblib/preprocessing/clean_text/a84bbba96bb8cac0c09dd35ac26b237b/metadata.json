That dark art seems to emanate from other, even more opaque branches of the Russian government. Rather, Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, unveiled a new section on its website meant to highlight articles that it considers to be fake news, including one by The New York Times. Just in case anybody missed the point, each article on the Foreign Ministry website carried a big red label reading \u201cFAKE\u201d in English and a line saying that the information in the article \u201cdoes not correspond to reality. \u201d Russia actually announced something of a fake news double whammy, since the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Parliament on Wednesday that the military had created a special task force assigned to wage information warfare, although he did not provide any details. That was no surprise to officials in the United States and Europe, who have been grappling with the Kremlin\u2019s information warfare for at least the last two years. The Foreign Ministry\u2019s new venture in singling out fake news seemed to fit a pattern identified by many analysts of creating alternative realities meant to sow confusion in people\u2019s minds, in that way discrediting all news sources. It was hard for some critics to take the ministry\u2019s fake news detector seriously, and some suggested that inclusion there was something of a badge of honor, an indication that the article had hit close to home. The Foreign Ministry has become a propaganda wing serving the Kremlin rather than a diplomatic service that establishes foreign policy, said Alexei A. Venediktov, the longtime editor of the respected Echo of Moscow radio station. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry at all,\u201d he said, but should instead consider being singled out by the Foreign Ministry to be an honor \u201clike a medal. \u201d Ms. Zakharova introduced the fake news section during her weekly, nationally televised briefing. \u201cWe will publish examples of propaganda hoaxes from various media outlets and give links to sources,\u201d she said. \u201cThe aim is to demonstrate the main trends in fake news publications about our country and do everything to stop their dissemination. \u201d It was not immediately clear what criteria the ministry would apply in its effort to identify what it considered to be fake news, and Ms. Zakharova declined to answer questions beyond what she said at her briefing. The spokeswoman emphasized that the Foreign Ministry would consider the news fake when it failed to include Russian reaction or the Russian position on the issue. News published from unidentified sources that constituted opinion or unverified fact also qualified, according to Ms. Zakharova. The initiative appeared to be a reaction to widespread reporting over the past year focused on fake news emanating from Russia. Ms. Zakharova outlined an appeal process, noting that news organizations could ask to have their work removed. \u201cRussia is being accused of doing this, but how can you accuse us of disseminating untrue information by government agencies and the media while you are doing the same against Russia?\u201d Ms. Zakharova said. \u201cWhile publishing information about Russia, the world media is doing the same thing  \u2014   they never cite concrete facts  \u2014   this is a sad paradox. \u201d There is a rather distinct gap between what Russia is accused of disseminating and what it labeled \u201cfake news. \u201d After Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 civilians on board, for example, local rebel commanders at first bragged about shooting down an aircraft at the very spot. When the extent of the tragedy emerged, Russia went into overdrive pumping out alternative versions, most of them fanciful and most blaming Ukraine. One such version suggested that it was a failed attempt to shoot down President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s jet, which was aloft at the same time. A   investigation concluded that the powerful    missile system that took down the airliner had been trucked in from Russia at the request of   separatists and returned over the border the same night. As tensions with Europe escalated over the past several years, all sorts of false news stories emerged. State news media and Russian officials falsely claimed that a    Russian immigrant in Germany had been kidnapped and raped, for example, and websites linked to Russia spread rumors, like one that Sweden had been approached to sell weapons to female fighters for the Islamic State. The stories that Russia labeled \u201cfake news\u201d were certainly more mainstream fare. The initial offerings included five articles from various large organizations including The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Daily Telegraph and NBC News. Indicating that its reach would be wide, however, one article was included from the Santa Monica Observer in California, about the sudden deaths of a number of Russian diplomats in recent months. Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes. The one from Bloomberg, for example, quoted Richard Ferrand, the chief of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidential campaign in France, as accusing Russia of carrying out cyberattacks against the campaign. It quoted Dmitri S. Peskov, Russia\u2019s presidential spokesman, as denying any link. The New York Times article, by a veteran national security reporter and former Moscow correspondent, Michael R. Gordon, detailed concerns in the American administration about Russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty. The story quoted unidentified officials as well as experts in the field, and it noted Russian criticism of some aspects of the treaty. A spokeswoman for The Times strongly defended the article and criticized the practice of simply labeling news reports fake without any substantiating evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous and troubling situation for governments or individuals to simply assign the label of fake news to a story they don\u2019t like, instead of challenging specific facts or offering counter evidence,\u201d said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman. \u201cWe stand by our reporting. \u201d Russian social media erupted with a certain amount of derision about the whole enterprise, particularly since the link in Russian to the page translated as \u201cpublications and refutations. \u201d \u201cSo to slap a red stamp and grandly say that something is \u2018fake\u2019  \u2014   this is what they call refutation these days?\u201d wrote one Russian man on Facebook. A reporter for the   Moscow Times asked via Twitter whether he could borrow the big red stamp. Ms. Zakharova said that the ministry would not be assessing Russian news media for fake news. It deals with foreign relations, she noted.'"}, "time": 1742563236.7462695}
