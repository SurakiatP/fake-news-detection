But here\u2019s a number you don\u2019t hear enough: 41 percent of voters are still supporting him. Four out of every 10 people. Who are they, exactly? In the latest episode of The   we spoke with a man who may be better qualified than anyone to answer that question: J. D. Vance, who grew up in the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s America, Appalachia, where stubborn poverty, economic decay and class resentment were as firmly rooted as the coal mines. His new book, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d now No. 6 on the New York Times best seller list, may be the best explanation yet of Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise. It is a deeply personal memoir about growing up poor in Rust Belt Ohio that doubles as a cultural anthropology of the white underclass that has flocked to the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s candidacy. In our interview, Mr. Vance explains who these voters are, what animates them and why they have responded so powerfully to Mr. Trump\u2019s message. \u201cThese people feel ignored in a very substantive way,\u201d he said, especially by the Republican Party, with which they have long identified. \u201cThey\u2019re not addressing the sense of crisis that I think a lot of these people feel in their own lives and that they see in their own communities,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cSo along comes Donald Trump,\u201d he continued, \u201ctalking the way that they talk and simultaneously speaking to their concerns over trade and over the economy, so it\u2019s not super surprising that they\u2019ve gravitated towards him. \u201d Mr. Vance mixes compassion for the plight of his family, friends and neighbors with cleareyed judgments about what he says are the personal failings and flawed thinking that have made it impossible for many of them to escape those circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst possible way,\u201d he writes in the book. \u201cIt\u2019s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. \u201d In the episode, I\u2019m joined by my colleagues Nick Confessore and Nate Cohn, who discuss the   in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, which seems to confirm his almost singular focus on white, economically insecure voters. We also discuss whether that segment of the electorate can really put him in the White House. Please let us know what you think of the show.
