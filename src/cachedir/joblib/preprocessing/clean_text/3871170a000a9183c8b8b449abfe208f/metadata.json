Dennis Hastert struggled to explain why he had not aggressively investigated allegations that a Florida lawmaker had sent flirtatious messages to a teenage boy who had served as a House page. At that perilous moment, an impassioned group of supporters stepped forward to speak up on Mr. Hastert\u2019s behalf: wrestling coaches. \u201cDenny Hastert is a good and honorable man  \u2014   and one of wrestling\u2019s own,\u201d Leo Kocher, the wrestling coach at the University of Chicago, wrote in late 2006 in a letter distributed to high school and college coaches. \u201cThe wrestling community must reach as many people as it can through calling talk radio, letters to the editor, and any other way in which public opinion can be moved,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDenny Hastert is one of the finest people to ever hold membership in the wrestling community. \u201d Wrestling gave Mr. Hastert stature in his hometown, Yorkville, Ill. and propelled a political career that culminated in one of the most powerful jobs in Washington. But the sport he loved also gave him proximity and opportunity for what prosecutors say was a pattern of sexual abuse of boys while serving as their high school coach. Now, as a federal judge prepares to sentence Mr. Hastert next week on charges that he illegally made secret payments to cover up the misconduct  \u2014   a former wrestler who said Mr. Hastert abused him decades ago is expected to speak at the hearing  \u2014   the weight of his transgressions is falling hard on former colleagues and constituents. But it is the   wrestling community that is struggling most to come to terms with its sense of betrayal. \u201cIt is just hard to find the words it is just such an awful thing,\u201d said Mike Moyer, executive director of the National Wrestling Coaches Association, who has known Mr. Hastert for nearly 20 years. \u201cIt runs so contrary to the dedicated support that Denny gave to the wrestling community over so many years. \u201d On Capitol Hill, Mr. Hastert was known as \u201cCoach,\u201d and one Republican aide attributed his rise to speaker in 1998 to an ability to \u201cbring the team together in the locker room and motivate them to get things done. \u201d Mr. Hastert hired former wrestlers as top aides. For more than a decade, he used clout in Congress to fight Title IX, the landmark federal law that requires equitable opportunities for men and women to participate in college sports, arguing that it was hurting wrestling by forcing cutbacks. He used campaign funds to support wrestling causes. He intervened in a dozen cases to try to save college wrestling programs. \u201cWho would have guessed that a wrestling coach from Kendall County in Illinois would be the   Republican speaker of the House of Representatives in all our nation\u2019s history?\u201d Mr. Hastert said, announcing his retirement from Congress in 2007 in front of the county courthouse in his hometown, where three decades earlier he and his state championship wrestling team had been honored with a parade. Mr. Hastert, who is 74 and suffered a stroke in November, has pleaded guilty to violating bank reporting requirements, but was not charged with abuse, for which statutes of limitation would have prohibited criminal charges. Prosecutors for the first time this month provided details of the abuse of at least four wrestling team members, one as young as 14, that they said occurred on training tables, in a locker room and in a hotel room. One of the wrestlers recalled how Mr. Hastert put a reclining chair in view of the showers in the locker room, where Mr. Hastert sat \u201cwhile the boys showered. \u201d The \u201cknown acts,\u201d the prosecutors said, consisted of \u201cintentional touching of minors\u2019 groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor. \u201d His lawyer, Thomas Green, said Mr. Hastert acknowledged committing \u201ctransgressions\u201d decades ago, for which, the lawyer said, Mr. Hastert was \u201cprofoundly sorry. \u201d Mr. Hastert first took up wrestling in high school, bulking up while carrying   feed bags from the farm supply business his father operated in rural Illinois. After graduating from Wheaton College, a nearby Christian liberal arts school where he was on the wrestling team, Mr. Hastert became a teacher and wrestling coach at Yorkville High School. He built the Yorkville Foxes into a powerhouse program that won 11 straight conference titles, produced eight Illinois state champion wrestlers and, in 1976, the Illinois team championship  \u2014   an accomplishment Mr. Hastert has described as \u201camong the finest moments of my life. \u201d \u201cI love this sport and the kids I coached,\u201d Mr. Hastert told a congressional committee years later. Local power brokers saw political appeal in his coaching success, encouraging him to run for the state legislature, and then Congress. Sometime after his arrival in Washington, Mr. Hastert named Bryan L. Harbin, one of his former wrestlers, to his staff. Mr. Harbin, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment, continued to serve as an aide to Hastert for most of his congressional tenure. As Mr. Hastert rose through the House Republican leadership, he also amassed substantial campaign funds, and he used some of that money to support the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and the wrestling program at Manchester College in Indiana, run by a longtime friend and fellow wrestler, Thomas S. Jarman, whom Mr. Hastert also later hired onto his congressional staff. Mr. Jarman did not respond to messages seeking comment. When the Republicans took control of the House in 1994, Mr. Hastert was named chief deputy whip. From his new position of power, he began a yearslong campaign against Title IX. Mr. Hastert wrote letters to the Department of Education, called for an investigation by the Government Accountability Office, and repeatedly introduced legislation to curb cutbacks to wrestling. \u201cIt really disturbs me when people claim that it is fine to cut opportunities for men to eradicate discrimination,\u201d Mr. Hastert testified in May 1995 at a House hearing that he had helped set up to examine the impact of the 1972 law. The National Collegiate Athletic Association called Mr. Hastert\u2019s 1998 legislative proposal an \u201cunparalleled federal intrusion into the   and budgetary process of the nation\u2019s colleges and universities. \u201d The provision, which would have required colleges to report annually if they had any plans to cut funding for any athletic team, was ultimately cut from the education bill. But Mr. Hastert did not give up. He joined an effort organized by the National Wrestling Coaches Association to challenge universities or colleges that cut funding for the sport, even appearing before the Pennsylvania state legislature in 2007 to push for more funding for wrestling programs there. By this point, Mr. Hastert, a hero to the sport, had been inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. While in Congress, Mr. Hastert also was an outspoken advocate for severe punishment of anyone convicted of abusing minors. He helped push legislation in 2006 that required states to expand sex offender registers, as he declared that \u201cprotecting our children from Internet predators and child exploitation enterprises are just as high a priority as securing our border from terrorists. \u201d The ties to wrestling continued even after Mr. Hastert left Congress. Two of his three staff members in the House Office of the Former Speaker  \u2014   an office he set up in Yorkville funded by the federal government  \u2014   were former wrestlers. Wheaton College opened the J. Dennis Hastert Center for Economics, Government, and Public Policy. Its director, starting in 2010, was Seth Norton, the former head wrestling coach at Wheaton College. Mr. Hastert also set up a consulting firm working with an Illinois businessman, David John, a former Wheaton College wrestler who had worked with Mr. Hastert to pressure the college president to reverse a plan to eliminate funding for the school\u2019s wrestling program. The former speaker frequently attended a wrestling tournament that Mr. John ran at Wheaton College, and Mr. John also saw him at the national collegiate wrestling championship every March. \u201cHe absolutely loved being in that environment,\u201d Mr. John said. In 2013, Mr. Hastert returned to the State Capitol in Springfield, delivering a valedictory on his career on the State House floor, where he also urged legislators there to pass a resolution condemning the decision by International Olympic Committee to drop wrestling as an Olympic sport after the 2016 games. \u201cI can only look at the opportunity I had when I was a young man,\u201d Mr. Hastert said, just before the Illinois House voted to pass the Olympic resolution. \u201cI had a coach and an opportunity to perform. \u201d Since the allegations of abuse became public last year, former wrestling champions, coaches and parents of student wrestlers are still trying to reconcile the painful new images now associated with Mr. Hastert\u2019s name. The Denny Hastert Yorkville Invitational annual wrestling tournament has already been renamed, as has the center at Wheaton College that was named after him. A campaign has started to have Mr. Hastert removed from the Wrestling Hall of Fame. Mr. Kocher, the University of Chicago coach, declined to comment when asked about his letter defending Mr. Hastert from a decade ago. But other coaches said the turn of events had caused tremendous sadness and confusion. Tony Houle, who was Mr. Hastert\u2019s assistant wrestling coach at Yorkville High from 1975 until Mr. Hastert moved on to politics, said the entire situation was \u201cmystifying\u201d to him, in part because of how devoted to and focused on the sport Mr. Hastert always seemed to be. Larry Kristoff, a   Olympic wrestler and a former Southern Illinois University wrestling coach, who worked closely with Mr. Hastert for decades on wrestling causes, said he was similarly confused, and hurt, by what had happened. \u201cI haven\u2019t come to terms with it  \u2014   I am not sure there is a way I ever can, really,\u201d said Mr. Kristoff, 73. \u201cWrestling can get over a lot of things. One issue won\u2019t tumble it. It is more the man himself  \u2014   wrestling has been a part of his whole life. \u201d Federal prosecutors had a somewhat different take on the matter, saying that Mr. Hastert\u2019s career is \u201cmarred by stunning hypocrisy. \u201d \u201cWhile defendant achieved great success, reaping all the benefits that went with it,\u201d Zachary T. Fardon, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, wrote in a court filing this month, \u201cthese boys struggled, and all are still struggling now with what defendant did to them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564322.6258867}
