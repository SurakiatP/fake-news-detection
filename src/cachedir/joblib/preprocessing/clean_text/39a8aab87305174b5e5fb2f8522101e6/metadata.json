Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nIn an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Thursday, Donald Trump was again asked about the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape in which the Republican nominee was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women. This time, though, he put up a new defense strategy, at least when it comes to this particular issue \u2013 blame the microphone. \\nWhen asked by O\u2019Reilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video, Trump once again repeated that it was only \u201clocker room talk,\u201d and then started complaining that a microphone shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to capture his comments. \\nShockingly, he did not express any regrets for his language. \\nVideo: \\n\u2014 Sean Colarossi (@SeanColarossi) October 28, 2016 \\n\u201cIt was locker room talk. The microphone was not supposed to be on \u2026 it was an illegal act that was NBC. It was not supposed to be on\u2026 that was a private dressing room.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidate\u2019s troubles. \\nIt should also be noted that Trump\u2019s complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants, some as young as 15 years old. \\nWhen asked by O\u2019Reilly if he would take legal action against NBC\u2019s role in uncovering and releasing the tape, Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d \\nAll of this comes after Trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him. \\nTrump also spent an absurd amount of time in the interview complaining that the media is rigged (not true), voter fraud is widespread (false), and the polls are dirty (they\u2019re not). \\nEven in the right-wing safe haven that is Fox News, Donald Trump still managed to prove himself as dangerously unfit to be president.\""}, "time": 1742562327.5588148}
