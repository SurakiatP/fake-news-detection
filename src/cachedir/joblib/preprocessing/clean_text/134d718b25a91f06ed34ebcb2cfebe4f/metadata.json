The unknown victim, nicknamed \u00d6tzi, has literally been in cold storage in her museum for a  . Often called the Iceman, he is the world\u2019s most perfectly preserved mummy, a Copper  Age fellow who had been frozen inside a glacier along the northern Italian border with Austria until warming global temperatures melted the ice and two hikers discovered him in 1991. The cause of death remained uncertain until 10 years later, when an   of the mummy pointed to foul play in the form of a flint arrowhead embedded in his back, just under his shoulder. But now, armed with a wealth of new scientific information that researchers have compiled, Inspector Horn has managed to piece together a remarkably detailed picture of what befell the Iceman on that fateful day around 3300 B. C. near the crest of the \u00d6tztal Alps. \u201cWhen I was first contacted with the idea, I thought it was too difficult, too much time has passed,\u201d said Inspector Horn, a noted profiler. \u201cBut actually he\u2019s in better condition than recent homicide victims I\u2019ve worked on who have been found out in the open. \u201d There are a few mummies in the world as old as \u00d6tzi, but none so well preserved. Most were ritually prepared, which usually meant removal of internal organs, preservation with chemicals or exposure to destructive desert conditions. The glacier not only froze \u00d6tzi where he had died, but the high humidity of the ice also kept his organs and skin largely intact. \u201cImagine, we know the stomach contents of a person 5, 000 years ago,\u201d Inspector Horn said. \u201cIn a lot of cases we are not able to do that even now. \u201d Those contents, as it turned out, were critical in determining with surprising precision what happened to \u00d6tzi and even helped shed light on the possible motive of his killer. The more scientists learn, the more recognizable the Iceman becomes. He was 5 feet 5 inches tall (about average height for his time) weighed 110 pounds, had brown eyes and   dark brown hair, and a size 7\u00bd foot. He was about 45, give or take six years, respectably old for the late Neolithic age  \u2014   but still in his prime. \u00d6tzi had the physique of a man who did a lot of strenuous walking but little   work there was hardly any fat on his body. He had all of his teeth, and between his two upper front teeth was a   gap, an inherited condition known as diastema, which Madonna and Elton John also have. When viewed through the window of the museum\u2019s freezer, where he is kept now, his hands not only appear unusually small, but they also show little sign of hard use, suggesting that \u00d6tzi was no manual laborer. Every modern murder investigation relies heavily on forensic science, but in \u00d6tzi\u2019s case, the techniques have been particularly high tech, involving exotic specialties like archaeobotany and paleometallurgy. From examining traces of pollen in his digestive tract, scientists were able to place the date of \u00d6tzi\u2019s death at sometime in late spring or early summer. In his last two days, they found, he consumed three distinct meals and walked from an elevation of about 6, 500 feet, down to the valley floor and then up into the mountains again, where he was found at the crime site, 10, 500 feet up. On his body was one prominent wound, other than the one from the arrowhead: a deep cut in his right hand between the thumb and forefinger, down to the bone and potentially disabling. By the degree of healing seen on the wound, it was one to two days old. From this, Inspector Horn surmises that \u00d6tzi may have come down to his village and become embroiled in a violent altercation. \u201cIt was a very active defensive wound, and interesting in the context that no other injuries are found on the body, no major bruises or stab wounds, so probably he was the winner of that fight, even possibly he killed the person who tried to attack him,\u201d he said. Then he left, fully provisioned with food, the embers of a fire preserved in maple leaf wrappings inside a   cylinder, and quite a lot of other equipment, most of it probably carried in a backpack with a wooden frame. For weapons he had only a flint dagger so small it seemed to be the Copper Age equivalent of a derringer, a    stave for a bow that had not yet been completed and a beautifully crafted deerskin quiver with a dozen arrows, only two of them with arrowheads attached. Inspector Horn reckons \u00d6tzi was in no hurry. At 10, 500 feet, he made what appeared to be a camp in a protected gully on the mountain saddle, spreading his belongings around and sitting down to his last meal. \u201cRoughly half an hour before his death he was having a proper meal, even a heavy meal,\u201d Inspector Horn said. The Copper Age menu was well balanced, consisting of ibex meat, smoked or raw einkorn wheat (an early domesticated variety) possibly in the form of bread some sort of fat, which might have been from bacon or cheese and bracken, a common fern. There is even evidence that some of his food was recently cooked. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a rush and the first thing is to get away from someone trying to kill you, that\u2019s not what you do,\u201d he said. \u00d6tzi\u2019s longbow was only half a day\u2019s work from completion, he added, but there was no sign that he was working on it at the time. Half an hour after \u00d6tzi dined, the killer came along and shot him in the back from a distance of almost 100 feet. The arrow went under his left armpit and ripped through a roughly   section of his subclavian artery, a wound that would have been quickly fatal and probably not treatable even in modern times, especially where it happened. By the angle of the wound, he was either shot from below and behind, or he had been bent forward when he was hit from above and behind. \u201cThe aim of the offender was to kill him, and he decides to take a   shot  \u2014   could be a learning effect from what happened one or two days before,\u201d Inspector Horn said. \u201cWhich is pretty much what you see all the time nowadays. Most homicides are personal, and follow violence and an escalation of violence. I want to follow him, find him and kill him. All the emotions we have in homicide, these things have not died out in all these years. \u201d Robbery can certainly be ruled out, he said. \u00d6tzi had a copper ax, a valuable artifact only rarely seen in burials of the period. His clothing and kit were a match for the harsh alpine climate, and probably valuable, made from the leather and fur of at least 10 animals of six species. \u201cThis was not a robbery gone bad or something,\u201d Inspector Horn said clearly, the killer was trying to cover up his act. \u201cYou go back to your village with this unusual ax, it would be pretty obvious what had happened. \u201d \u00d6tzi\u2019s cold case continues to yield surprises to scientists in many disciplines who still are studying his remains. Last year, for example, they discovered that he was infected with an unusual strain of H. pylori, the bacteria believed responsible for ulcers today. There is one thing they are unlikely to discover, as Inspector Horn noted with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic we\u2019ll find the offender in \u00d6tzi\u2019s case. \u201d Both in life and in death, the Iceman seems uncannily familiar to his modern descendants, said the museum\u2019s deputy director, Katharina Hersel. \u201cHe is so close to us. He uses the same equipment as we do when he goes to the mountain, just the materials are different,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we are still killing each other, so maybe there hasn\u2019t been so much evolution after all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563261.6915762}
