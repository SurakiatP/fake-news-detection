[\u201cScientists have transformed mature cells into primordial blood cells that regenerate themselves and the components of blood. The work, described today in Nature, offers hope to people with leukemia and other blood disorders who need   transplants but can\u2019t find a compatible donor,\u201d reported Nature on Wednesday. \u201cIf the findings translate into the clinic, these patients could receive   versions of their own healthy cells. \u201d  \u201cOne team, led by   biologist George Daley of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts, created human cells that act like blood stem cells, although they are not identical to those found in nature,\u201d Nature explained. \u201cA second team, led by   biologist Shahin Rafii of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, turned mature cells from mice into fully fledged blood stem cells. \u201d Mick Bhatia, a   researcher at McMaster University, praised the two teams\u2019 accomplishments, likening it to the \u201choly grail. \u201d \u201cFor many years, people have figured out parts of this recipe, but they\u2019ve never quite gotten there,\u201d said Bhatia. \u201cThis is the first time researchers have checked all the boxes and made blood stem cells. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty convincing that George has figured out how to cook up human hemopoietic stem cells,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is the holy grail. \u201d \u201cA lot of people have become jaded, saying that these cells don\u2019t exist in nature and you can\u2019t just push them into becoming anything else,\u201d Bhatia concluded. \u201cI hoped the critics were wrong, and now I know they were. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
