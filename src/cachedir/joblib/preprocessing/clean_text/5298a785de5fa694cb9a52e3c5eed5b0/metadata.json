[\u201cMilo is a tool of Trump\u2019s fascist government: He has no right to speak at Cal or anywhere else! Shut Him Down,\u201d declared the protest announcement email, which was forwarded to Breitbart Tech.  \u201cMilo Yiannopoulos, mouthpiece of   is coming to Cal this Wednesday as part of his \u2018Dangerous Faggot\u2019 campus tour. Milo rose to fame voicing disdain for human rights, vicious nationalism, xenophobia, misogyny, and unapologetic support for Donald Trump, which he claims he is allowed to spew in public because of \u2018free speech\u2019,\u201d they continued. \u201cHe claims to be \u2018dangerous\u2019 to a \u2018stifling liberal culture\u2019 of \u2018political correctness.\u2019 He tries to leverage his identity (that he is gay and has a Black boyfriend) as some kind of excuse. In fact he is a fascist, and students at campuses along his tour have righteously fought, and sometimes succeeded, in shutting down his speaking gigs. \u201d \u201cAt UC Berkeley professors, and students and professors at campuses across the country, have raised that what Milo is doing is hate speech, which causes direct harm to students and campus life, and that is not \u2018free speech\u2019 and should not be allowed,\u201d claimed the student  . \u201cThe UC Berkeley administration has not fully responded to this, and is letting Milo\u2019s speech go forward. This is wrong. But there are even larger issues at stake:\u201d 1. People who protest Milo are not opposing free speech, they are opposing a fascist America, which is the actual, real, and gravely serious threat to basic rights of speech, assembly, and intellectual life. Milo Yiannopoulos is an editor for Breitbart. He is a tool of a government that accuses the press of being \u201cfake news\u201d when they deviate from or criticize the Trump lies that has already begun criminalizing protest, demonizing dissent, and attacking science. Trump has advocated severe penalties for flag burning, which is protected speech. What Milo is working for is not free speech, but to normalize, legitimize, and help consolidate the   regime  \u2014   which is already marching down the path of crushing all dissent and all ideas that oppose it. 2. Students who oppose Milo are strengthening the role of universities as places where dissent, critical thinking and the search for truth can flourish. Milo\u2019s bad boy attack on \u2018political correctness\u2019 is a ruse. In fact, Milo  the government he serves don\u2019t like the \u2018political correctness\u2019 that has some currency in universities today because they want to replace it with their own, fascist,   \u2018political correctness.\u2019 This is a government that opposes science, and openly discards facts and then defends its lies as \u2018alternative facts.\u2019 In under a week, they\u2019ve moved to wipe out all mention of climate science  climate data from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s website! Legitimizing Milo\u2019s tour is part of changing universities and intellectual life and science to serve fascist order. Students who fight to shut down Milo strengthen the struggle against this order and strengthen dissent, critical thinking and genuine intellectual inquiry. Think of what is going on in the world  \u2014   just this past week, this government has banned refugees, attacked Muslim immigrants, greenlighted the destructive Dakota Access Pipeline, slammed shut access to abortion for women all over the world, and threatened both the press and the UN to fall into line or face consequences. \u201cThink of what would go on inside that room February 1 at UC Berkeley, if it is allowed to go down,\u201d the leftists pleaded. \u201cUCB, birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, tolerates a fascist rally, held in the name of \u2018free speech.\u2019 Inside that room, racists and   will be screaming \u2018Build that wall! ,\u2019 laughing at rape statistics and sharing ICE phone numbers to aid the government with deportations. \u201d \u201cMilo is seeking to use the campuses to serve a larger fascist transformation of America and its entire culture,\u201d they concluded. \u201cStudents are right to SHUT IT DOWN because yes, it\u2019s dangerous. Fascism is dangerous to humanity. And you, if you oppose this with everything you\u2019ve got, will have the honor of being dangerous to fascism. \u201d The group, who operate under the name \u201cRefuse Fascism,\u201d plan to meet at the MLK Student Union on campus at 5pm, February 1. On their official Twitter account, messages declaring that fascists \u201cwill not be tolerated,\u201d and violent retweeted pictures of President Trump bleeding can be seen.  UC Berkeley   previously doxed the private information of several student organizers for the event, even posting one student\u2019s workplace address while falsely accusing him of being a \u201cwhite nationalist. \u201d Despite the \u201c \u201d attempt at directing harassment towards the College Republicans and MILO event organizers, it was revealed that several of the affected students were not even associated with the group or event \u2014   despite having their personal information posted online by the   group while being branded \u201cwhite nationalists. \u201d The   did not issue an apology. Following a demand by dozens of UC Berkeley professors to have MILO banned from the campus based on his political views, a group of Berkeley Free Speech Movement veterans defended the Breitbart senior editor, criticizing those professors and students who sought to use fascist tactics in an attempt to block his speech. \u201cUnder the terms of [the free speech] resolution, even the worst kind of bigot, including Yiannopoulos, must be allowed to speak on campus. So the UC administration was acting in accord with those principles when it refused to ban Yiannopoulos,\u201d the group of veterans declared. \u201cWe were thus disappointed that so many Berkeley faculty signed an open letter supporting such a ban and criticizing the UC administration for refusing to ban Yiannopoulos. \u201d MILO and the David Horowitz Freedom Center have partnered to launch a campaign against \u201csanctuary campuses\u201d that shelter illegal immigrants from being deported. The campaign will be launched with a speech from MILO at UC Berkeley. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
