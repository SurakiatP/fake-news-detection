Where we could say, you know what, crazy people are claiming that Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate is forged, but we\u2019re not going to write about that, that\u2019s crazy. \u201d He continued that this era doesn\u2019t exist, and that while they had reporters trying to confirm or deny specific details, the dossier was \u201cin play,\u201d and \u201chaving consequences for the way our elected leaders are acting. The  \u2014   you do have to ask the question of, why should I suppress that? There are then good reasons, right? Once though, it emerges, as it did last night in the public conversation that there is this secret document floating around, full of dark allegations that we will not repeat to you. That I feel like in this era, you really have to share [with] your readers what that is in an appropriate context. And our original report, I mean, if you read what we wrote, it stressed that there were real solid reasons to distrust this. It noted two specific errors. \u201d Todd then asked if BuzzFeed had a responsibility to not spread false information. Smith responded that, like with the Obama birth certificate issue, it\u2019s a \u201cdifficult balance that everybody in our business navigates every day. \u201d Todd then asked if BuzzFeed would publish a false birth certificate. Smith answered, \u201cWe certainly quoted the   of the United States making false claims about it, and years ago we debated whether we should quote regular citizens in Iowa saying, I don\u2019t believe his birth certificate. And I remember us thinking at first, we probably shouldn\u2019t. That we we shouldn\u2019t pass that on and then saying, you know what, this has become a force that is impacting the conversation. \u201d Todd countered, \u201cI know this was not your intent. I\u2019ve known you a long time, but you just published fake news. \u201d Smith countered that people throw the term \u201cfake news\u201d around to diminish things they don\u2019t like, and that \u201cthis was a real story about a real document that was really being passed around between the very top officials of this country. And then the question you say is, okay, it\u2019s okay for you  \u2014   to Chuck Todd see this document. It\u2019s okay for me to see it. Okay for Senator John McCain ( ). Okay for the CIA. What\u2019s  \u2014   why is it not okay for your audience?\u201d Todd then countered that BuzzFeed could have published a redacted version of the document. Smith answered that there was fair disagreement, but didn\u2019t think you could defend acknowledging the dossier\u2019s existence but then not say what was in it and that this was saying it was okay to summarize false claims. Smith further stated that if there wasn\u2019t a \u201cpublic conversation\u201d about the dossier, they would have just continued to report the story out.
