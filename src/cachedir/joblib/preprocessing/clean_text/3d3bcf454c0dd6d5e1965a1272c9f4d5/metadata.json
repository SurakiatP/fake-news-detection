Ms. Pauley\u2019s first day in the role will be Oct. 9, and she will become only the third anchor of the show, which started in 1979. For Ms. Pauley, 65, a return to the anchor role for a morning television show represents an unexpected   comeback. And by selecting her instead of a younger    CBS is clearly trying to ease the transition from Mr. Osgood, 83, whose folksy delivery has been a mainstay on the show for more than two decades. In a statement, the president of CBS News, David Rhodes, said, \u201cCharles Osgood is a television news legend  \u2014   and so is Jane Pauley. \u201d Ms. Pauley first catapulted to fame at age 25 when she replaced Barbara Walters as an anchor of the \u201cToday\u201d show 40 years ago. She remained with \u201cToday\u201d through the late 1980s until the notoriously messy handoff in 1989, when Ms. Pauley left the show and was replaced by Deborah Norville. Ms. Pauley later was a host of NBC\u2019s newsmagazine \u201cDateline\u201d from 1992 to 2003. But for much of the next decade,   television opportunities dwindled for Ms. Pauley, though she had a daytime talk show that lasted a season and she made appearances on \u201cToday. \u201d She became a CBS contributor two years ago and has filled in for Mr. Osgood on \u201cSunday Morning\u201d and for Scott Pelley on the \u201cCBS Evening News. \u201d She has reported stories for the Sunday morning show, including the only television interview with David Letterman in the   to his retirement last year. The transition is an important one for the network. \u201cSunday Morning\u201d is a powerful ratings machine: It attracts nearly six million viewers and is by far the   Sunday morning news show. Its big viewership has helped the show that follows it, \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d remain the   Sunday morning public affairs show. (\u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC attracts the most viewers in the   to    bracket coveted by advertisers.) And this is the second consecutive year that CBS has had a peaceful Sunday morning handoff, something that can be rare for morning shows. (Recall the departures of Ms. Pauley or Ann Curry from \u201cToday,\u201d or David Gregory\u2019s firing from \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d) Last year, Bob Schieffer introduced John Dickerson on the air as the new anchor of \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d just as Mr. Osgood did with Ms. Pauley on Sunday. \u201cCharles Osgood set the standard for \u2018CBS Sunday Morning,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pauley said in a statement. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a great honor to be given the chance to further our show\u2019s legacy of excellence. I look forward to bringing loyal viewers the kind of engaging, original reporting that has made the broadcast so irresistible for so long. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562676.8324277}
