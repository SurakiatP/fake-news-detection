But the play has generated controversy over the Caesar character\u2019s close resemblance to Trump. Some critics have said that the mock assassination of the Trump    \u2014   in a graphic scene filmed and published by Inside Edition last week  \u2014   crossed the line, particularly after another \u201cartwork\u201d depicting Trump\u2019s death, a \u201cbeheading\u201d photograph featuring comedian Kathy Griffin, stirred outrage last month. In response to the controversy, Public Theater sponsors Bank of America and Delta Air Lines pulled their support, while American Express clarified that its funding did not go directly toward Shakespeare in the Park and that it did not \u201ccondone\u201d the theater\u2019s interpretation of Julius Caesar. Ironically, the companies\u2019 withdrawal of support set off another round of outrage, this time from some celebrities and theater figures, including from Kushner, the   Angels in America playwright. \u201cIt\u2019s an upsetting play, but if there\u2019s a production of Julius Caesar that doesn\u2019t upset you, you\u2019re sitting through a very bad production,\u201d Kushner told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the corporate sponsors who pulled out are just being cowardly and caving in to a lot of cranky   people because Breitbart and Fox News told them to. \u201d Kushner wasn\u2019t the only person to blame Breitbart and other conservative media for the sponsors\u2019 withdrawal in their article for the New York Times about the timeline of the controversy, writers Michael Paulson and Sopan Deb accused Breitbart of having \u201cdriven a campaign on social media against the Public [Theater]\u201d that prompted the sponsors to make their decision. Of course, Breitbart News had simply reported on the controversy, and never led a \u201ccampaign on social media\u201d against the play. Early stories about the play centered on one theatergoers\u2019s reaction to the graphic assassination scene, while stories about the corporate sponsors pulling out simply reported on the statements that each had made. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Times failed to accurately report on what appeared to be the real reason for the backlash over the play that the level of vitriol against Trump has reached a heightened new level in recent weeks, and that it has now become acceptable to make jokes or art about the assassination of President Trump, and to be celebrated for doing so by theater critics, celebrities and the media.'"}, "time": 1742628486.2166705}
