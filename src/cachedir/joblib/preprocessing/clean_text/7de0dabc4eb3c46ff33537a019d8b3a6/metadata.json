Nicknamed Tabby\u2019s star, the celestial object features an odd dimming pattern. While some early potential explanations included comets, distortion, and space debris, none have provided a completely satisfactory solution. Astronomers Launch Search for Extraterrestrials in Potential \\'Alien Megastructure\\' \\nThe more fanciful answer is that KIC 8462852 is surrounded by a Dyson sphere, an alien megastructure built by an advanced civilization to harness the sun\u2019s energy. The Breakthrough Listen initiative, founded by Russian tycoon Yuri Milner, plans to spend over $100 million to investigate the star over the next ten years. \\n\"The Green Bank Telescope is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on the planet, and it\u2019s the largest, most sensitive telescope that\u2019s capable of looking at Tabby\u2019s Star given its position in the sky,\" Breakthrough Listen co-director Andrew Siemion said in a statement, according to Space.com . \\n\"We\u2019ve deployed a fantastic new SETI instrument that connects to that telescope, that can look at many gigahertz of bandwidth simultaneously and many, many billions of different radio channels all at the same time so we can explore the radio spectrum very, very quickly.\" \\nThe telescope\u2019s observations began Wednesday night, and will continue for eight hours each night, for three nights over the next two-month period. \\nOther organizations have launched independent investigations into Tabby\u2019s Star, including a Kickstarter campaign launched by the Yale astronomer Tabby Boyajian, who penned an initial study into the strange celestial object. Having raised over $100,000, that project plans to spend a year analyzing the star\u2019s luminosity with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. NASA Earth-Like, Water-Rich Planets Could Be Common to Red Dwarfs \\nAs to whether new observations will uncover aliens, most scientists remain skeptical. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely \u2013 a one-in-a-billion chance or something like that \u2013 but nevertheless, we\u2019re going to check it out,\" Dan Werthimer, chief scientists at Berkeley SETI, said in the same statement. \\n\"But I think that ET, if it\u2019s ever discovered, it might be something like that. It\u2019ll be some bizarre thing that somebody finds by accident\u2026that nobody expected, and then we look more carefully and we say, \\'Hey, that\u2019s a civilization.\\'\" \\nOf course, even if the Dyson sphere theory turns out to be true, that does not necessarily indicate life. Given the distance of the star, it will have taken 1,500 years for its light to reach Earth, meaning that we can only observe the star as it was 1,500 years ago. \\nThe civilization could be long gone. ...'"}, "time": 1742561796.6389523}
