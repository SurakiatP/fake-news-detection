[The PAC is not intended to be something that the former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee will use to run for office herself one day, but it will help congressional candidates in the 2018 election, Axios reported Wednesday.  A source told Axios that the PAC will primarily work with groups that began after President Trump\u2019s election, but it will also work with existing groups that have risen in prominence as a result of the election. Clinton has already begun meeting with some of these groups, the source added. Clinton is also back on the speaking circuit, represented by the Harry Walker Agency. Although it is unknown what her speaking fees are as of May 2017, Clinton fetched up to $225, 000 a speech for a series of speeches to Goldman Sachs, and charged UCLA up to $300, 000 for a speech in 2014, When UCLA officials tried to negotiate a reduced rate as a public university, Clinton\u2019s representatives from the Harry Walker Agency told them that $300, 000 is the \u201cspecial university rate. \u201d Clinton is also writing a book that is set to be released in September 2017. Although it does not yet have a title, it is already available to   on Amazon. Clinton said she took responsibility for her election loss in 2016 Tuesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. \u201cIf the election had been on Oct. 27, I would be your president,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a perfect campaign  \u2014   there is no such thing  \u2014   but I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey\u2019s letter on Oct. 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off. \u201d Clinton also mentioned that she is now an \u201cactivist\u201d and part of \u201cthe resistance. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m now back to being an activist citizen, and part of the resistance,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628517.7392204}
