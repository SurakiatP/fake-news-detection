It\u2019s as if a huge rock has been turned over, exposing the swarming, slithering underside of America\u2019s political system. \\nFor those who admire America, like this writer, this week is a time to weep for the republic. \\nWe see two candidates who are utterly unfit for the highest office: Hilary Clinton, engulfed by scandals, and blustering TV mogul Donald Trump, a man of profound shallowness who advocates Islamophobia, torture and environmental ignorance. \\nHillary Clinton\u2019s core supporters are black food stamp and welfare recipients, and legions of women who are voting simply by gender. Trump\u2019s core supporters are tax-paying workers who have watched Wall Street loot America\u2019s economy and send their jobs abroad. \\nLike many people, I\u2019ve been tearing my hair trying to decide for whom to vote. I now favor Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson who gained worldwide fame as a dolt when asked about the destruction of Aleppo, Syria. \u2018What\u2019s Aleppo?\u2019 asked this New Mexico Bismarck. \\nNow that\u2019s the kind of president I\u2019d like to see. No more regime-changers and empire-builders. No more Imperial America. No more crusaders or world super power bullying. No more mucking around the world and acting as the globe\u2019s enforcer. Let\u2019s forget Aleppo, Beirut, Gaza, Tehran, Islamabad, the South China Sea and North Korea. \\nWe can no longer afford to play \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019 We\u2019ve got to rebuild bridges and airports, and clean the Augean Stables of Congress, America\u2019s most corrupt institution. We just spent $2.8 billion on roads in remote Afghanistan while our own highways are crumbling. \\nSuch is the folly of imperialism. The old Soviet Union did something similar, allowing its domestic infrastructure and industry to fall apart while adventuring in Afghanistan, and deploying 55,000 tanks in the Red Army. These tanks were useful in putting down the heroic Hungarian Revolution of 1956 \u2013 60 years ago this week \u2013 but for nothing else. \\nBut I fear that whoever wins the US election will very quickly face major problems for which they are woefully unprepared. Most obvious is the bloody mess the US has created across the Mideast. \\nI just learned that Trump recently named, as Mideast advisor, a notorious Muslim-hating fanatic, who is a Lebanese Maronite Christian fascist. His advice will likely be to invade Lebanon and Syria and kill more Muslims. \\nFor her part, Hilary Clinton has long been a wholly-financed subsidiary of Wall Street and the mighty Israel lobby. Just have a look at the list of her largest donors. Her pro-Israel supporters are urging her to create a so-called \u2018no-fly\u2019 zone over Syria, which is code for full-scale war against Syrian government and Russian forces. Guess who will benefit from Syria\u2019s destruction and disintegration? \\nThis supreme idiocy could lead directly to nuclear war with Russia, something I\u2019ve been warning against for years. \\nThere has been no mention in the campaign of rebuilding the Arab world, ravaged by western imperial interventions. Little mention of some 12 million Syrian refugees created by the Saudis and US. Nor of five million Palestinian refugees, and who knows how many in Iraq, Libya, Somalia and now war-ravaged Yemen. And not a word about America\u2019s stalemated war in Afghanistan. Nothing about a shaky Europe. Nor how to accommodate China\u2019s rise. \\nInstead, we\u2019ve heard tirades against the phony ISIS, which is funded by the Saudis, and Hilary Clinton\u2019s absurd claims that wicked Vlad Putin is somehow behind America\u2019s foreign disasters. It\u2019s stupid and shameful demagoguery. \\nAt least Trump has the good sense to urge that we end our pointless confrontation with Russia and scale back the unaffordable American Empire. Few Americans know that almost half their government\u2019s budget is spent on the military. \\nBesides disgusting many Americans, the presidential campaign has made the US an object of derision and embarrassment around the globe. Many analysts claim that this grand fiasco marks the beginning of the end of US global hegemony. It\u2019s certainly the beginning of the beginning. \\nThis week alone, the Philippines and Malaysia, two staunch American allies, edged closer to China\u2019s camp. Neither Trump no Clinton had a care for America\u2019s reputation during their ugly debates. \\nMy fear is that the election vitriol will not end America\u2019 shame and misery but continue on, like an acid eating into the national fabric.
