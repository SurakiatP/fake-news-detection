Menendez said, \u201cI\u2019m for an independent commission. And I think we have the master of misdirection in the White House, evident  \u2014   the suggestion that President Obama wiretapped him, and then, takes off the attention on what was happening with Russia and the attorney general and others. So, I\u2019m for an independent commission. I think that\u2019s the only way, across the entire spectrum. I respect the Intelligence Committee and our leadership on a bipartisan basis. but that\u2019s one element of a much broader set of circumstances. I want to make sure that when President Trump is acting, he\u2019s acting in the interests of the American people, not in any interests he might have. And that\u2019s broader than the intelligence elements, broader than the whole issue of our elections. It\u2019s a whole host of issues. And I think a   independent type commission should do it. \u201d Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562074.0656135}
