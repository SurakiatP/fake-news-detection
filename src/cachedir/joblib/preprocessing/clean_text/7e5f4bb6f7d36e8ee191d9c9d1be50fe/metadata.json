From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. Now, all of the parties involved\u2014including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes\u2014need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it\u2019s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators\u2019 rights to protest peacefully, and workers\u2019 rights to do their jobs safely.\\n\u201cWhat a crock,\u201d said Ruth Hopkins, a Dakota-Lakota Sioux writer for Indian Country Today Media Network .\\n\u201cHillary Clinton managed to make a statement about the Dakota Pipeline that literally says nothing. Literally,\u201d 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben tweeted in response.\\n\u201cKind of a BS statement by the Clinton camp on #NoDAPL, frankly,\u201d wrote MSNBC host Joy Reid. \u201cThe outrage taking place out there cries out for outrage.\u201d\\nOthers noted that the statement \u201cis the most Clinton thing of all times,\u201d as Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting journalist Adam Johnson put it .\\nIn a lengthy Twitter thread , anonymous commentator @ActualFlatticus breaks down what they say is the campaign\u2019s \u201ctriangulation\u201d of the protest.\\nIn other words, you're going to protest by our rules. You're going to do it as we tell you. Or you can't protest.\\n\u2014 Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016\\nNo part of this statement is concerned with the safety of the water protectors in any way. But the workers are in danger? How, exactly.\\n\u2014 Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016\\nThe corporations (her donors) have a right to push their pipeline through sacred land (never mentioned). Despite the treaties we made.\\n\u2014 Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016\\nAnd what makes it all so unbelievably offensive? Is we all know Hillary Clinton didn't write this. Not a word. She approves, that's it.\\n\u2014 Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016\""}, "time": 1742563317.5954604}
