She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright, and if she did, she\u2019s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it.\u201d \\ndiGenova continued: \u201cAnd why this letter was sent today was very simple: the agents came to Comey yesterday, they told him about the evidence, and he said oh \u2018S\u2019, and realized that his goose was cooked, that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent, and he knew that the agents running the Weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve also been told something very significant, it\u2019s been reported that those laptops [belonging to Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson] were destroyed, they were not, and the reason is the FBI agents refused to do it.\u201d \\ndiGenova went on to say he believes \u201cthere is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now.\u201d \\n\u201cHe sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau,\u201d he said. \u201cComey sent this letter today because he had to. He has no moral authority inside the agency right now, he\u2019s a joke, he\u2019s a laughingstock of the agency, and among former FBI agents, he has become an anathema.\u201d \\nListen to the full interview courtesy of WMAL: \\nCourtesy of Information Liberation Don't forget to follow the D.C.
