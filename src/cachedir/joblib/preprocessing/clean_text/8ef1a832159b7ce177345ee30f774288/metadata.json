[The ADL reportedly received a   seed donation from the Omidyar Network to help finance the center.  The Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, also funds the International   Network (IFCN) hosted by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. IFCN has partnered with Facebook to help determine whether certain stories should be flagged as \u201cdisputed. \u201d Poynter\u2019s IFCN is also funded by Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, as well as by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy.  The ADL announced its new center via a press release:   ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt announced Sunday that ADL has secured seed funding from Omidyar Network to build a     command center in Silicon Valley to combat the growing threat posed by hate online. The center will employ the best technology and seasoned experts to monitor, track, analyze and mitigate hate speech and harassment across the Internet, in support of the Jewish community and other minority groups. ADL\u2019s center on cyberhate, technology, and society will pioneer new strategies in the fight against online abuse, drawing from ADL\u2019s three decades of expertise monitoring, tracking, and combating hate on the public and private web. It will author reports and data provide insights to government and policy makers and expose and stop specific cases of online harassment and cyberbullying. According to the release, the ADL will work with tech sector leaders to look into   options for reducing \u201conline harassment,\u201d including \u201cartificial intelligence, big data,   reality, and other technologies. \u201d \u201cNow more than ever, as   Islamophobia, racism, and other hatreds have exploded online, it\u2019s critical that we are bringing    technology and resources to this fight. That\u2019s why we will build this center in Silicon Valley, and why we are so grateful to Omidyar Network for providing seed funding for this effort,\u201d Greenblatt stated. \u201cThis is a natural extension of the   work ADL has been doing for decades and builds on the new presence we established last year in the Valley to collaborate even closer on the threat with the tech industry,\u201d Greenblatt added. In November, the ADL released a statement announcing that the organization \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the appointment of former Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon as White House Chief Strategist for the Trump administration. Greenblatt  \u2014   formerly an aide to President Barack Obama  \u2014   claimed Bannon is \u201ca man who presided over the premier website of the Alt Right, a   group of white nationalists and unabashed   and racists. \u201d Greenblatt\u2019s statement is entirely false. Breitbart News is not \u201cthe premier website of the Alt Right\u201d and has no associations with the    . Indeed, Greenblatt appeared to back off the \u201cpremier website\u201d claim during a brief interview in November by Breitbart News\u2019 Adelle Nazarian, while still claiming Breitbart was a \u201cplatform\u201d for the  .  Following publicity over Greenblatt\u2019s claims about Breitbart and Bannon, the ADL issued a press release conceding, \u201cWe are not aware of any   statements from Bannon. \u201d That statement appeared at the bottom of a larger ADL piece titled \u201cStephen Bannon: Five Things to Know. \u201d  The piece also claimed that under Bannon, Breitbart News \u201cpublished inflammatory pieces about women, Muslims, and other groups. \u201d The Omidyar Network funding the ADL\u2019s online command center, meanwhile, has partnered with Soros\u2019s Open Society on numerous projects and has given grants to third parties using the   Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to   causes in the U. S. The   IFCN recently drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook announced it will work with \u201c  fact checking organizations\u201d that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the \u201cfact checking organizations\u201d determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, \u201cthere will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
