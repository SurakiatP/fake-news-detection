The neighbors think they\u2019re painters  \u2014   a cover story to explain the chemical smell. In fact, the friends are members of a Jewish resistance cell. They\u2019re operating a clandestine laboratory to make false passports for children and families about to be deported to concentration camps. The youngest member of the group, the lab\u2019s technical director, is practically a child himself: Adolfo Kaminsky, age 18. If you\u2019re doubting whether you\u2019ve done enough with your life, don\u2019t compare yourself to Mr. Kaminsky. By his 19th birthday, he had helped save the lives of thousands of people by making false documents to get them into hiding or out of the country. He went on to forge papers for people in practically every major conflict of the   century. Now 91, Mr. Kaminsky is a small man with a long white beard and tweed jacket, who shuffles around his neighborhood with a cane. He lives in a modest apartment for people with low incomes, not far from his former laboratory. When I followed him around with a film crew one day, neighbors kept asking me who he was. I told them he was a hero of World War II, though his story goes on long after that. It remains painfully relevant today, when children are being bombed in Syria or boarding shabby boats to escape by sea. Like most Westerners, I usually ignore their suffering, and assume that someone else will step in to help. But Mr. Kaminsky  \u2014   a poor, hunted teenager  \u2014   stepped in himself, during the war and then for many different causes afterward. Why did he do it? It wasn\u2019t for the glory. He worked in secret and only spoke about it years later. His daughter Sarah learned her father\u2019s whole story only while writing a book about him, \u201cAdolfo Kaminsky: A Forger\u2019s Life. \u201d The English translation comes out this week. It wasn\u2019t for the money, either. Mr. Kaminsky says he never accepted payment for forgeries, so that he could keep his motives clear and work only for causes he believed in. He was perpetually broke, and scraped together a living as a commercial photographer, he said. The wartime work put such a strain on his vision that he eventually went blind in one eye. Though he was a skilled forger  \u2014   creating passports from scratch and improvising a device to make them look older  \u2014   there was little joy in it. \u201cThe smallest error and you send someone to prison or death,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a great responsibility. It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s not at all a pleasure. \u201d Years later he\u2019s still haunted by the work, explaining: \u201cI think mostly of the people that I couldn\u2019t save. \u201d Mr. Kaminsky empathized with refugees partly because he was one himself. He was born in Argentina to Russian Jews who\u2019d first fled Russia to Paris, and then been kicked out of France. When Adolfo was 7, the family, by then with Argentine passports, was allowed to rejoin relatives in France. \u201cIt was then that I realized the significance of the word \u2018papers,\u2019 \u201d he explained. After dropping out of school at 13 to help support his family, he was apprenticed to a clothes dyer, a precursor to the modern dry cleaner. He spent hours figuring out how to remove stains, then read chemistry textbooks and did experiments at home. \u201cMy boss was a chemical engineer, and would answer all of my questions,\u201d he said. On weekends he helped a chemist at a local dairy, in exchange for butter. In the summer of 1943, he and his family were arrested and sent to Drancy, the internment camp for Jews near Paris that was the last stop before the death camps. This time, their passports saved them. Argentina\u2019s government protested the family\u2019s detention, so they stayed at Drancy for three months, while thousands of others were swiftly sent on to die. Mr. Kaminsky remembered a math professor who had agreed to tutor him in the camp. \u201cOne day, when it was time for our classes, he wasn\u2019t there. He hadn\u2019t wanted to tell me beforehand that his name was on the list. \u201d The Kaminskys were eventually freed, but they weren\u2019t safe in Paris, where Jews were under constant threat of arrest. Soon Argentines were being deported, too. To survive they would have to go underground. Adolfo\u2019s father arranged to get false papers from a Jewish resistance group, and sent Adolfo to pick them up. When the agent told Adolfo that they were struggling to erase a certain blue ink from the documents, he advised using lactic acid, a trick he\u2019d learned at the dairy. It worked, and he was invited to join the resistance. Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s cell was one of many. His would get tips on who was about to be arrested, then warn the families, assembling new papers for them on the spot. The group focused on the most urgent cases: children who were about to be sent to Drancy. They placed the kids in rural homes or convents, or smuggled them into Switzerland or Spain. In one scene from the book, Mr. Kaminsky stays awake for two nights straight to fill an enormous rush order. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple calculation: In one hour I can make 30 blank documents if I sleep for an hour, 30 people will die. \u201d Historians estimate that France\u2019s Jewish resistance networks together saved 7, 000 to 10, 000 children. Some 11, 400 children were deported and killed. After the war, Mr. Kaminsky didn\u2019t plan to keep working as a forger. But through his wartime networks, other movements got in touch. He continued forging papers for 30 more years, playing a small role in conflicts ranging from the Algerian war of independence to the   struggle in South Africa to the Vietnam War, making documents for American draft dodgers. He estimates that in 1967 alone, he supplied forged papers to people in 15 countries. I can\u2019t vouch for every cause. Some of the rebel groups he supported used violence. And at close range, his stubborn idealism was no doubt maddening. He had two kids soon after World War II, but couldn\u2019t tell them or his   about his underground work, so they didn\u2019t know why he rarely visited. Girlfriends assumed he was absent because he\u2019d been cheating. He was supposed to follow one woman to America, but never showed up, because he\u2019d joined the Algerian resistance. \u201cI saved lives because I can\u2019t deal with unnecessary deaths  \u2014   I just can\u2019t,\u201d he told me. \u201cAll humans are equal, whatever their origins, their beliefs, their skin color,\u201d he later added. \u201cThere are no superiors, no inferiors. That is not acceptable for me. \u201d In 1971, convinced that too many different groups knew his identity, and that he\u2019d soon be caught and imprisoned, Mr. Kaminsky quit forging for good, and mostly made a living teaching photography. On a visit to Algiers he met a young law student, of Tuareg ancestry, who was the daughter of a liberal Algerian imam. They\u2019re still married, and have three children. The last time I saw Mr. Kaminsky, he showed me a photograph he took just after the liberation of Paris. It shows about 30 children who\u2019d come out of hiding, and were hoping to be reunited with their parents. He knows there are children in similar peril today, and that having the wrong passport can still cost your life. \u201cI did all I could when I could. Now, I can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. Surely, though, the rest of us can.'"}, "time": 1742561680.620245}
