C.  \u2014   Under mounting pressure from politicians, community leaders and boisterous protesters who have brought this city\u2019s main business district to a near standstill, the Charlotte police chief on Saturday released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black resident here. While they do not show everything that happened at the scene, the two released videos appear to show Mr. Scott exiting a white sport utility vehicle and backing away from it with his hands at his sides. He did not appear to be acting in a threatening or erratic manner, although officers could be heard shouting, \u201cDrop the gun!\u201d The police said that they had recovered a loaded gun with Mr. Scott\u2019s DNA on it, and that he was wearing an ankle holster. They did not reveal where they had found the gun. It appeared from the two angles that he had nothing in his right hand. It was unclear what, if anything, Mr. Scott, who was   had in his left hand. After Mr. Scott was shot multiple times and fell to the ground, his moans could be heard as officers handcuffed him. The police also revealed for the first time that officers had decided to confront Mr. Scott, 43, in the parking lot of his apartment complex on Tuesday because they noticed, as they were preparing to serve a warrant on another person, that he was rolling a marijuana cigarette inside his S. U. V.  \u2014   and had observed him \u201chold a gun up,\u201d according to a news release. Mr. Scott was parked in a visitor\u2019s parking space at his apartment complex, where he often waited for a school bus bringing one of his children home from school. Chief Kerr Putney of the   Police Department said that, since Mr. Scott was believed to be in possession of marijuana and a handgun, it raised a safety issue officers felt compelled to confront. \u201cWhat we are releasing are the objective facts,\u201d Chief Putney said at a news conference. Still, he added that neither the videos, nor other evidence he intended to make public provided a definitive answer to all the questions in the case. \u201cI stand behind the truth,\u201d Chief Putney said. \u201cPeople can interpret anything they want based on one piece of evidence, and I can tell you, I suspect they will based on the video footage. But what I say is, you have to put all pieces together. \u201d At a news conference about an hour after the videos were released, lawyers for the Scott family said his relatives were pleased with that decision, but also said the videos raised more questions than they answered. One of the lawyers, Justin Bamberg, said the family stood by its assertion that Mr. Scott was not armed and that he had not acted in a threatening manner. \u201cWhen I look at the dashcam footage, I don\u2019t see anything there, in my opinion, that would lead to him losing his life,\u201d Mr. Bamberg said. Protesters on Saturday were skeptical that marijuana possession, which has been decriminalized in many places, should have led to a fatal encounter. The officer who shot Mr. Scott, Brentley Vinson, was also black, police officials have said. Greg Farmer, 25, who has been protesting since Mr. Scott\u2019s death, said on Saturday that even if Mr. Scott did have marijuana and a gun, the police should not have killed him. \u201cEven if they thought he was smoking weed, why in any world would that warrant him being gunned down?\u201d said Mr. Farmer, who owns a food truck and a handyman business in Charlotte. The protesters, who have taken to the streets since Tuesday in large numbers  \u2014   sometimes peacefully and sometimes not  \u2014   have made \u201cRelease the Tapes\u201d a signature chant and most pointed demand, and have accused Chief Putney of obscuring the details of the shooting. And yet, for a number of reasons, it seems likely that the release of the two videos, and the new information about the case, will do little to quell what has become a roiling national debate over whether it was necessary to fatally shoot Mr. Scott, one of a number of   men who have died at the hands of police officers in recent months. The frustration and anger was evident before Chief Putney had finished his news conference, which protesters were listening to on a loudspeaker at a park in the Uptown area of Charlotte. Around 4:30 p. m. a protester announced to some cheers that there had been an update about the release of the police videos. But that cautious optimism turned to anger about 10 minutes later as protesters learned the police would not be releasing all of the video footage. Chief Putney said that while the information being released constituted \u201cthe most complete puzzle that we can without trying the case out in public,\u201d he said that some unreleased videos showed only people driving to the scene. He also said that more footage would be released upon completion of an independent inquiry being conducted by the State Bureau of Investigation \u201cand there has been a definitive decision on the part of the prosecutor. \u201d The mood among the protesters fell. \u201cEverybody take a deep breath. So basically Chief Putney is saying that they are not releasing the full videos of Keith L. Scott,\u201d Tamika Lewis, 27, one of the protest organizers, said as many others booed and shook their heads. \u201cOur demand clearly states to release the full video, the names and the reports that are related to the shooting. This is a slap in the face. He\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to give them a little bit of what they want, and then they\u2019re going to go away.\u2019 No. We will occupy the streets of Charlotte until they release the full videos. \u201d The chief, as well as other officials in North Carolina, had previously resisted demands to release the footage because they said it could undercut the investigation by the state, which is reviewing the shooting at the request of Mr. Scott\u2019s family. But by Saturday afternoon, word had begun to spread through Charlotte that the chief had agreed to release the footage. During a news conference at a West Charlotte police station, as   members of the National Guard stood outside, the chief insisted that his decision had not been influenced by political pressure, nor by the release on Friday of a video recorded by Mr. Scott\u2019s wife. The chief said he believed that disclosing some of the state\u2019s evidence would not \u201ctaint\u201d the state\u2019s inquiry. \u201cThe footage itself will not create, in anyone\u2019s mind, absolute certainty as to what this case represents, and what the outcome should be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe footage only supports all of the other information  \u2014   physical evidence, the statements from witnesses and officers and all of the other information, scientific and physical  \u2014   that create an entire picture. \u201d The matter of whether the police should disclose its footage had been fiercely debated for days here. The authorities repeatedly pledged transparency, but warned that a premature release of any evidence could compromise the case. But protesters marched through the streets of Charlotte and demanded the videos\u2019 release. The debate even reached the presidential campaign on Friday, when Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said the city should distribute its footage \u201cwithout delay. \u201d Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, a former Charlotte mayor who had expressed reservations as recently as Friday about releasing any evidence, said he supported Chief Putney\u2019s decision announced on Saturday. He said he was convinced the \u201crelease will have no material impact on the independent investigation since most of the known witnesses have been interviewed. \u201d The anger and suspicion in Charlotte have been fueled in part by memories of the September 2013 police slaying of Jonathan Ferrell, a    black man who was shot 10 times by a white officer in a Charlotte subdivision. Mr. Ferrell had been in a car wreck, and had walked to a nearby home and knocked on the door. A white woman, fearing Mr. Ferrell was a robber, called 911. One officer, upon arrival, immediately aimed a Taser at Mr. Ferrell. Another officer, Randall Kerrick, fired his gun, believing that Mr. Ferrell was trying to take the gun away. Mr. Kerrick was charged with voluntary manslaughter, but the case ended in a hung jury and a mistrial in August 2015. Prosecutors decided not to retry Officer Kerrick, and the case was dismissed. At Saturday\u2019s news conference held by the Scott family\u2019s lawyers, one of them, Charles G. Monnett III, said he was surprised that North Carolina was again talking about the killing of a black man by the police. \u201cQuite frankly, I\u2019m shocked that less than two years after the conclusion of the Jonathan Ferrell case, that we are standing back before you again to talk about whether the shooting of another a black man was justified,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here. We\u2019ve got to learn. We\u2019ve got to change our police approach. One of the things that really disturbs me about what I see on the video is the failure of the police to use all of the resources that they had at their disposal to avoid killing Keith. \u201d After Chief Putney\u2019s news conference, the department released a detailed report of the police\u2019s version of events. It said that Mr. Scott got out of his S. U. V. \u201cwith the gun\u201d and \u201cbacked away from the vehicle while continuing to ignore officers\u2019 repeated loud verbal commands to drop the gun. \u201d The release said that Officer Vinson perceived Mr. Scott\u2019s \u201cactions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and other officers\u201d before he fired. Later, the release said, homicide detectives interviewed \u201cmultiple\u201d civilian witnesses who said Mr. Scott had ignored repeated commands to drop the gun. A lab analysis of a gun recovered at the scene, the release said, revealed the presence of Mr. Scott\u2019s DNA and fingerprints on the weapon. The dispute about the footage reached its climax one week before North Carolina was scheduled to restrict access to police recordings. A state law signed by Mr. McCrory that has long been scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1 will prohibit police recordings from being deemed public records. A court order will be required to release any footage, and judges will be allowed to consider whether \u201crelease is necessary to advance a compelling public interest,\u201d as well as whether publication \u201cwould create a serious threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice. \u201d William Barber II, the president of the North Carolina chapter of the N. A. A. C. P. said in an interview on Saturday that the release of the two videos was not sufficient. He called for the full release of all police videos of the incident, and demanded a federal investigation. He noted that neither he nor anyone else in the public was in possession of all of the facts in the case. But he also said that neither the possession of marijuana nor the possession of a gun should warrant \u201ca death sentence. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562267.138833}
