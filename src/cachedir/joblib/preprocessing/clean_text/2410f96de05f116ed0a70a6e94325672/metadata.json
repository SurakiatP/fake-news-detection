When the event was over, a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium, and Kislyak was among them, the Justice Department official said. Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors, including Kislyak, the official said. In the informal exchanges, the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring, said the official, citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the event. Sessions said he also met the Russian ambassador in September, with two of his senior staff. The meeting became \u201ctesty\u201d when the subject of Ukraine was broached, he said at a March 2 press conference.    '"}, "time": 1742562190.6241753}
