Is this what the New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall was thinking of when he wrote that the film\u2019s humor is \u201cfrequently harsh\u201d? Probably not. That\u2019s because in the version of \u201cThe Front Page\u201d that New York papers likely reviewed back in 1931, that hack keeps his middle finger in check and instead   the mayor and the sheriff. As it turns out, the film seen in the United States for decades isn\u2019t the same version that American audiences guffawed through back in the day. The one that Michael Pogorzelski and Heather Linville took out of old film cans in 2014 was surprisingly different from the familiar one. Mr. Pogorzelski, 44, is the director of the Academy Film Archive, which is part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organization behind the Oscars Ms. Linville, 38, is one of its film preservationists. In 2014, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, deposited the Howard Hughes film collection with the academy archive, and the preservationists zeroed in on \u201cThe Front Page. \u201d Archives are designed to store film under proper conditions, which is why collections like this sometimes land there. Other titles are piling up at the academy archive because people are dumping their films. The industry shift from film to digital has been swift and dramatic and  \u2014   despite the activist efforts of the   likes of Christopher Nolan and the patron saint of preservation, Martin Scorsese  \u2014   film on film has almost disappeared from theaters. Even features shot on film are digitally projected. (Almost all theaters worldwide are now digital.) Last year, I started following after Mr. Pogorzelski and Ms. Linville to understand the complexities of film restoration, largely because the medium is fast becoming a relic. More than 50 years ago, Andr\u00e9 Bazin asked \u201cWhat is cinema?\u201d But what is film? It\u2019s a question worth asking, because for most of its history, cinema was    \u2014   it was shot, processed and distributed on film. The movies we watch today, by contrast, are rarely made through mechanical and photochemical processes, but with computer code, with strings of zeros and ones: bits. Each medium has its advantages, although for many lovers of film the crucial difference is its vivid, alive look. Much of the cinema I love  \u2014   Buster Keaton comedies,    musicals, Stan Brakhage   landmarks, Charles Burnett\u2019s masterpiece \u201cKiller of Sheep\u201d  \u2014   was made with film. What happens to an art when its foundational medium disappears? We don\u2019t yet know, because it\u2019s happening right now. If you care about movies, you should be wondering. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur\u2019s play \u201cThe Front Page\u201d first opened on Broadway in 1928. The writers were former journalists, and the story they whipped up hinges on a   Chicago reporter, Hildy Johnson, who\u2019s planning to leave the city and the newspaper racket, only to be reeled back into action by a jailbreak and his conniving editor, Walter Burns. Profane and funny, the play was a hit, and it\u2019s returned to Broadway several times since a new production opens in October. Howard Hawks redefined it by casting Cary Grant as Walter and Rosalind Russell as his   Hildy, in the 1940 dazzler \u201cHis Girl Friday. \u201d Hawks\u2019s brilliant   has helped eclipse the 1931 film, but the older one has charm, snap and great performances, as well as intelligent, fluid direction from Lewis Milestone, all of which can be hard to appreciate when watching battered copies of copies. The print from the University of Nevada was, by contrast, in fine shape by the time Mr. Pogorzelski and Ms. Linville started work. (The George Lucas Family Foundation footed the bill.) Yet while this restoration didn\u2019t involve visually dramatic differences, it produced its own aha moments when, while comparing the University of Nevada copy with the Library of Congress print, they saw variations like the middle finger. In one version, a character quips about Pocahontas, while in the other the wisecrack involves Lady Godiva. Other changes involve camerawork, staging and performances. Some of the differences seemed intentional, others accidental. Ms. Linville did some sleuthing and discovered that the production files for \u201cThe Front Page\u201d include references to several versions of the film: \u201cScene Take 5  \u2014   OK  \u2014   English Version Print\u201d reads one line, \u201cScene Take 6  \u2014   OK  \u2014   Amer. Version Print\u201d reads another. And while the budget includes costs like wardrobe ($2, 858. 53) and railroad fares ($1, 438. 28) it also refers to an American negative, a British negative and a \u201cgeneral foreign\u201d negative. It was common practice to shoot multiple versions in the silent era, one for the domestic market and the rest for export. Talking pictures complicated matters, and, with subtitling and dubbing not yet a workable solution, companies shot   versions. In the case of \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d the multiples may have been shot more for cultural and censorship reasons, which may be why the middle finger isn\u2019t in the American version. The best takes were reserved for the American version: That\u2019s the one in which the camera crew keeps pace with a   Adolphe Menjou, as Burns in another version, he slips out of frame. The other version is good, yes, but the American is the film at its greatest. The academy archive restores 40 to 70 movies a year, which means that the staff is usually handling several titles at once. When Mr. Pogorzelski and Ms. Linville started on \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d she was already several years into restoring \u201cCock of the Air,\u201d another Hughes title. Directed by Tom Buckingham, this delightful 1932 sex comedy is largely a vehicle for its female star, Billie Dove, who was Hughes\u2019s lover back in an especially frenetic time in his movie career. She plays a French actress partial to   gowns, Champagne and conquests, and the film is one long teasing encounter between her and a pilot and Lothario (Chester Morris). More frothy than scandalous, the film is best explained by the scene in which Dove runs around in a metal suit of armor while chased by Morris, who\u2019s holding a can opener. Hughes managed to get \u201cCock of the Air\u201d into theaters for its initial release despite the objections of the Production Code\u2019s bluenoses (one deemed it \u201cobscene and immoral\u201d) but eventually it was heavily censored. The film\u2019s history of censorship woes help explain how the academy preservationists ended up dealing with an uncensored yet silent master and a separate, censored audio source. Preservationists seek out both the   prints and elements from different film copies, and often work with outside technicians. (Some handle the visuals, others the audio some work with photochemical elements, others with digital.) It\u2019s like assembling a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from many copies of that puzzle  \u2014   pieces that sometimes need to be shipped from France and spruced up in Los Angeles. Flaws remain because, Mr. Pogorzelski said, he has \u201cto stretch dollars as far as they can go. \u201d Carrying out a \u201c100 percent    cleaning\u201d and focusing all of the archive\u2019s resources on one film might mean ignoring dozens of others. To help with the sound for \u201cCock of the Air,\u201d the preservationists looked to John Polito, an engineer and the owner of Audio Mechanics. Together they worked on the sound using assorted elements they had gathered. After years of vainly searching for prints with the censored dialogue intact, they took the unusual step of hiring actors like Hamish Linklater to record the excised lines, using an onscreen icon to indicate what had been censored. (Mr. Polito played some piano music that had gone missing in a butchered seduction scene.) The results are probably close to what viewers saw and heard when they caught a show in 1932 at the Rialto in New York. All movies are time machines, and restoration helps bring the   present together with a past that is always  \u2014   as prints decay, labs close and money ebbs  \u2014   moving further away. \u201cWe want to preserve films for future generations,\u201d Ms. Linville said. \u201cSo we try to think ahead and think about what future audiences may be interested in. \u201d Some restorations play at festivals, museums and other   places. They\u2019re available for research, and the preservationists hope that a museum the academy has proposed will be yet another place to see them. \u201cEven if every cinema in the world can only show digital,\u201d Mr. Pogorzelski said, \u201cwe know there are going to be at least four theaters that the academy runs that are still going to be showing film. \u201d In 2011, the historian David Pierce gave a talk on silent films at an annual event in Los Angeles called the Reel Thing. At one point, he showed a 1925 photo of a few dozen Universal Pictures stars next to a stack of crates holding that season\u2019s negatives. He asked if anyone recognized these stars and was met with mostly bafflement. We soon found out why. Twenty years after this photo was taken, Universal sent a letter to its East Coast lab ordering the destruction of all but 17 of its   negatives. The studio had already lost numerous older titles in fires, and now it was junking the rest of its silent features  \u2014   hundreds  \u2014   having decided that most were not worth keeping. It\u2019s no wonder that those stars were unfamiliar: Their own studio destroyed their legacy. Some legacies may be lost forever others   or gain new luster when films that went missing resurface in a barn or an archive. In 2015, \u201cSeven Sinners,\u201d Milestone\u2019s   feature directorial debut, turned up in Australia and was passed on to the archive, which is restoring the film. Such rescue stories come wreathed in romance as a film is plucked from the brink, like a   heroine pulled from train tracks at the last minute. These stories are heartening if misleading, given the industry\u2019s habit of destroying its history, which, of course, is our history, too. What wonders existed in the 70 percent of silent features that are lost? And the problem isn\u2019t just the past or preserving it. It\u2019s also about access. Film prints of recent releases are now hard to see, and the big studios keep a lot of titles in the vault. Many films have never made it onto VHS, DVD or   and the dream that the internet would turn into a comprehensive cinematic library remains a dream. The upbeat platitudes that have often accompanied the shift to digital tend to obscure pragmatic considerations, including that film is easier and less expensive to preserve than digital and isn\u2019t plagued by the same obsolescence issues. That\u2019s why, even as major studios have stopped distributing film prints, they make film copies of the elements of their new releases, including those shot on digital. Studios like 20th Century Fox may maintain digital archives of their current releases, but the \u201canalog solution,\u201d in the words of Schawn Belston, its executive vice president, media and library services, \u201cis still the most trusted and has   archival longevity. \u201d The studios can afford to safeguard their new and old titles, but an estimated 75 percent of movies in American theaters are made by independents. A few years ago, the Library of Congress and the academy released \u201cDigital Dilemma 2,\u201d a report on the digital preservation issues facing independent filmmakers and nonprofit audiovisual archives. \u201cMost of the filmmakers surveyed for this report have given little thought to what happens to their work once it is completed,\u201d the study found. Most were also not aware of \u201cthe perishable nature of digital content. \u201d Preservation may not be foremost in the minds of these directors  \u2014   or most moviegoers  \u2014   but imagine 50 years from now when another archivist asks another audience to name the stars of our digital cinema present, like our own era\u2019s screwball beauty, Greta Gerwig. \u201cWho?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563505.0259337}
