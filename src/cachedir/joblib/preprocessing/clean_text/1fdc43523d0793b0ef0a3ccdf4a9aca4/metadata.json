She shares of the many people that have contacted her with dreams they have had as well. The claims of prophetic messages range from declaring Donald J. Trump as the next commander-in-chief to Obama not handing over the keys to the White House. The visions of chaotic turmoil disrupting in the streets of America have also been very vividly shared. LeClaire like many of us admits that she has never seen such prophetic whirlwind over an election in her lifetime. \\nThe night before Election Day she had a dream about the number of prophetic voices and among them she saw some with selfish agendas either for monetary gain or seeking accolades from man. During LeClarie\u2019s time of reflection after this powerful dream she assures to have heard these words clearly: \u201cToday, a kingdom will be toppled\u201d. Although she is still praying over what she believes to have been divinely revealed, the urgency to share the dream was clear. \\nIn an interview with TRUNEWS last week LeClaire clearly shared her position as one with a focus on intense prayer. She talked about the importance for the Church to be lead by the spirit and keep their faith on Christ. \\nOriginal article by Charisma News / TRUNEWS analysis. \\nArticle by , Correspondent for TRUNEWS Got a news tip?
