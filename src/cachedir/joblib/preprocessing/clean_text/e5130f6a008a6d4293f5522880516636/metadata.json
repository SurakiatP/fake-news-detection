Comey refused to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, despite \u201cevidence\u201d she violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, jeopardizing U.S. national security. These breaches occurred during her term as Secretary of State. \u201cThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton\u2019s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,\u201d Comey acknowledged.\\nAdditionally, Comey noted that other individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, and would probably face penalties. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re deciding now,\u201d he glibly fed us, the sheeple. \u201cWe are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case.\u201d\\n\u201cJustice,\u201d of course, is U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the tarmac meeting fame. Addressing the people of the United States, the FBI director actually said that \u201cno outside influence of any kind was brought to bear\u201d on the investigation. He neglected to mention the inappropriate meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch aboard a private jet.\\nHillary Clinton is free to run for the U.S. Presidency, guaranteeing Obama\u2019s third term.\\nHere in Arizona, we have what clearly appears to be a personal vendetta carried out by a federal judge timed to coincide with the General Election in which popular Sheriff Joe Arpaio is on the ballot running for a seventh term. He was formally charged Tuesday with criminal contempt of court for ignoring U.S. District Judge Murray Snow\u2019s order in a three-year old racial-profiling case. Arpaio acknowledged violating Snow\u2019s order but insists the breach wasn\u2019t intentional\\nArpaio\u2019s challenger in the race is once again rough \u2018er up Democrat Paul Penzone, funded by multi-billionaire Socialist George Soros, who is contemptuous of national borders. Soros also funds Hillary Clinton and John McCain .\\nIf convicted, Sheriff Arpaio could face up to six months in jail. A misdemeanor conviction would not bar Arpaio from serving as sheriff.\\nSheriff Arpaio\u2019s interview with Lou Dobbs is worth your time:\""}, "time": 1742628553.610816}
