Top Republican leaders in Congress are setting up a stark confrontation with   Donald Trump by backing an investigation into Russian hacking during the election. \u201cThe Russians are not our friends,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, above. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign called for all information about the meddling to be declassified. Mr. Trump is expected to announce on Tuesday that he has chosen Exxon Mobil chief Rex. W. Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, rejecting bipartisan concern that he has forged a   relationship with Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia. _____ 2. China returned fire at Mr. Trump over his questioning of the   U. S. policy to recognize to Taiwan as part of \u201cone China. \u201d A   tabloid said his grasp of foreign policy was \u201clike a child. \u201d Our reporter analyzed five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration. _____ 3. One effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is playing out in abortion politics. In Ohio, an emboldened Republican statehouse passed two abortion bills  \u2014   including one that could ban the procedure as early as six weeks, which is before many women even know they are pregnant. And people on both sides of the debate agree that there\u2019s a possibility Roe v. Wade could be overturned during the Trump presidency. _____ 4. In Syria, Aleppo is falling. The forces of President Bashar   are within days, if not hours, of capturing the last corners of the country\u2019s largest city. The seizure would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government rule in all major cities and forcing the opposition to reckon with whether the armed rebellion has failed. _____ 5. Some of the world\u2019s richest men  \u2014   Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, above, Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos  \u2014   joined other global business leaders to launch a fund that would invest more than $1 billion in \u201cnext generation energy technologies. \u201d And investors who control more than $5 trillion in assets have agreed to drop some or all of their fossil fuel stocks. The divestment movement has doubled in size in 15 months. _____ 6. In courts across the U. S.   offenders can get a chance to avoid the devastating consequences of a criminal record, taking classes and doing community service through a program called diversion. But our   examination found that in many places, only people with money could afford the fees to secure that second chance. Above, Marcy Willis, who struggled but is now just $25 from a clean record. _____ 7. About one in six American adults reported taking psychiatric drugs, according to a new analysis. And researchers say an increasing number of infants in the rural U. S. are born   largely to mothers on opioids. Some good news: a new study shows that simple lifestyle changes can have a major impact on lowering the risk of the No. 1 killer in the U. S. heart disease. _____ 8. The musical \u201cLa La Land,\u201d above, snagged the most Golden Globe nominations this year, including best director, screenplay and lead actor and actress. Our critic said the movie could make \u201cmusicals matter again. \u201d Nominees for the best television drama include \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and \u201cWestworld. \u201d _____ 9. It\u2019s an auctioneer\u2019s dream: a man walks in off the street with a jumble of drawings and mixed in is a   work by Leonardo da Vinci. The dream has come true for an auction house in Paris. Among a set of sketches collected by the father of a retired doctor was one experts believe is worth $15. 8 million. \u201cMy eyes jumped out of their sockets,\u201d the authenticator said. _____ 10. Finally, when it comes to giving gifts, it turns out that nobody really cares how much thought you put into it. Here\u2019s more advice from scientists who studied   rituals: Don\u2019t aim for the \u201cbig reveal,\u201d don\u2019t be ashamed to regift, and if someone has asked for something, skip the surprise and buy it for them. And don\u2019t give your spouse cash. Happy holidays. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help.
