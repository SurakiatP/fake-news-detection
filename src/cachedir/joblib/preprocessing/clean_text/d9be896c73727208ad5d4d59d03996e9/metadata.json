Tell us what you\u2019d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com We like to think of California as the center of the tech universe. But, apparently, all that   has not helped us figure out how to run more efficient elections. Three weeks after the state\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, half a million votes remain uncounted. The final tallies, whenever they come in, are not expected to change the result. Hillary Clinton declared victory the night of the June 7 primary, when she was up by more than 10 points. In videos, in blog posts and on social media, some supporters of Bernie Sanders are pointing to the uncounted ballots as evidence that Mr. Sanders was robbed. Long waits for final totals are not rare in California. Most of the 2. 5 million votes that were not counted by June 7 were   ballots that were not returned until Election Day, or even a few days after. But the vote also exposed \u201cmechanical problems\u201d in the electoral system, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data, a consulting firm based in Norwalk, Calif. A flood of voters registered right before the election. Many did not receive   ballots until after Election Day, when they were useless. Independents voting by mail also had a hard time getting the right ballots. Both groups were more likely to support Mr. Sanders. Many cast provisional ballots, which take a long time to count because each has to be verified. Since June 7, Mr. Sanders has slightly cut into Ms. Clinton\u2019s lead. She was ahead by roughly 440, 000 votes on election night. Now, it\u2019s 414, 500, or about eight percentage points. Still, it\u2019s a sizable margin. \u201cThe Bernie folks have legitimate gripes,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all going to be resolved when these provisional ballots are counted. \u201d \u2022 Hillary Clinton released her technology policy initiative, which targets young entrepreneurs.

[Boom] Mission Dolores in San Francisco is turning 240 years old today. The mission is older than our republic itself: the first Mass was held on June 29, 1776, a few days before the Declaration of Independence was signed, and nearly 75 years before California statehood. The adobe church, which the congregation moved into in 1791, is the oldest building still standing in San Francisco. It survived the 1906 earthquake, and the fires that followed. Of the nine missions founded under the Rev. Junipero Serra in California, it is the only one whose original chapel is intact. So what is Mission Dolores  \u2014   as it has long been known, though the official name is Misi\u00f3n San Francisco de Asis  \u2014   doing to celebrate its anniversary? Not much. Though the mission\u2019s website proudly proclaims its founding in June, anniversary ceremonies will not be held until October, the date when official \u201cpaperwork was sent from Mexico,\u201d said Gustavo Torres, the mission\u2019s director of development. In the meantime, if you\u2019re in the area, you can still visit the old mission, its cemetery and its gardens, as roughly 300, 000 people do each year.
