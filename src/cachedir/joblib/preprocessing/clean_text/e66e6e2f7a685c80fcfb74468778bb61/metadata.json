Way more skill, you can win a hand with nothing if you play it right. But the lads just couldn\u2019t get to grips with the fingers\u201d. \\nKennelan later went online to see if there were any culchies in the area who were looking to play 25, and is considering setting up a club or something where they can go and drink Smithwicks and play cards and complain about Dublin.'"}, "time": 1742564445.3328798}
