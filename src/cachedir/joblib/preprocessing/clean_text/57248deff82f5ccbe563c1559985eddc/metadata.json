The lineup is determined after much debate on the merit of each and how individual galleries contribute to the overall balance of the show. The New York Times asked Noah Horowitz, the fair\u2019s director, to highlight several newcomers. The sprawling fair is divided into multiple sectors, which can help visitors make sense of its size. Galleries is the main event, intended for top dealers from around the world. Nova is for works done in the last three years. Positions displays   projects and is intended to be an incubator for new talent. Survey tackles historical projects, while Public stages outdoor sculptures and installations in Collins Park. Owned by Mara McCarthy, the daughter of the noted contemporary artist Paul McCarthy, this is one of the galleries fueling the rapid ascension of the Los Angeles art scene. Its program, strong in artists of the 1960s and \u201970s, is part of a trend, Mr. Horowitz said: \u201cYounger galleries looking at the past. \u201d The Box is focusing on Barbara T. Smith, 85, an important feminist figure on the West Coast who pioneered   and sexuality related performance art. The collective gallery she and her fellow artists founded in the early 1970s,   was the site of \u201cShoot,\u201d the notorious Chris Burden performance piece in which he had himself shot in the arm with a rifle. \u201cBarbara Smith is a legend, and her work has great resonance,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said, though he added that she perhaps was not a household name for collectors. \u201cThis is what Survey does so well, provide a place for rediscovery. \u201d The gallery will show video and sculptures related to her work \u201cField Piece\u201d ( ). For the original installation, a field of tall resin forms, Ms. Smith asked participants to experience the work naked. Founded by Emmanuel Di Donna, a former Sotheby\u2019s executive, the Upper East Side dealer specializes in Surrealist and Modern art, as well as other postwar works. Not only is this Di Donna\u2019s first showing at Art Basel Miami Beach, it is the gallery\u2019s first art fair. \u201cHe\u2019s a great example of a young but superserious,   dealer,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said, using the industry term for works that have been previously bought and sold. \u201cHe does formidable research on these shows. He\u2019s someone we think will be on the scene for many years to come. \u201d The mix of works includes \u201cLa Joconde\u201d (1967) an    bronze by the Belgian Surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, and \u201cFemme, oiseau, \u00e9toiles\u201d (1942) a work in gouache, charcoal and pastel by the Catalan Surrealist Joan Mir\u00f3. Also on hand is a sculpture by the   Italian Fausto Melotti, \u201cLa rivoluzione dogmatica\u201d (1969) made of brass and fabric.   art is always a strong component of Art Basel Miami Beach, given the fair\u2019s proximity to Central and South America and Miami\u2019s distinct Latin flavor. \u201cWe try to emphasize great projects coming from the region,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said, and there are 31   galleries exhibiting this year. Sim\u00f5es de Assis Galeria de Arte was founded in 1984 by the architect Waldir Sim\u00f5es de Assis Filho, who has an unusual family connection to the fair: His son, Guilherme S. de Assis, participated in the Positions sector last year with his SIM Galeria. The father\u2019s gallery, participating in its first international art fair, has made a specialty of secondary market work by South American artists, and this year will feature 16 works made from the 1930s to the 1950s by the Uruguayan artist Carmelo Arden Quin ( ). Quin, who lived in Paris for much of his life, made geometric works, often on irregularly shaped canvases, and is considered an influential modern painter of the type Survey highlights. Vigo is a    gallery in London\u2019s West End, founded by Toby Clarke and Thomas Williams, that shows a variety of contemporary artists, including Derrick Adams and Leonardo Drew. For the Miami Beach fair, the gallery is exhibiting more than two dozen drawings and paintings by the Sudanese artist Ibrahim   including the ink on paper \u201cStudy of a Boy\u2019s Head\u201d (1960) and \u201cIllustration no. 2 for Tayeb Salih\u2019s novel Maryoud\u201d (1977). Mr.   known for a gestural approach to works often done in a limited palette of black and white, is a former politician and diplomat who was imprisoned without charges in Sudan in 1975 and has taken inspiration from his time in jail. Two years ago, Mr.   became the first African artist to have a retrospective at Tate Modern in London, a show that featured more than 100 works. \u201cHe\u2019s having an amazing moment of discovery,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cNow he\u2019s really in the international consciousness. \u201d And the   match of dealer and painter is significant, he said. \u201cA London gallery showing an African artist demonstrates that Survey is quite the global program. \u201d The city of Bologna does not have a big presence on the international fair scene  \u2014   that tends to be a role filled by Milan or Rome  \u2014   but Galleria d\u2019Arte Maggiore has developed a strong reputation for showing   masterworks across a wide spectrum, from Paul Klee to   Basquiat. It was founded in 1978 by Franco and Roberta Calarota and it is now being run by their daughter, Alessia. \u201cIt\u2019s a real family affair,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. For its first Miami Beach appearance, the gallery is focusing exclusively on the Italian painter Giorgio Morandi (1890 \u2014  1964) who became an icon largely after his death for his paintings of deceptively simple tabletop scenes. He imbued clusters of vases and bottles with metaphysical heft. A solo show of his work was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008. \u201cAnything to do with the Morandi estate, it starts and ends with Maggiore,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cThey have access to an extraordinary cache of material. \u201d Given the sometimes cacophonous nature of   contemporary art, the Maggiore booth may provide a respite for visitors to the fair. Four of the paintings in the booth have the title \u201cNatura morta\u201d (\u201cstill life\u201d) and were done between 1940 and 1960. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a beautiful slow presentation in a hectic fair,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. This is a young gallery showing new works. The show\u2019s title, \u201cShanghai: A New Ballardian Vision,\u201d has a literary slant and refers to the dystopian urban vision of English novelist J. G. Ballard (  \u201cEmpire of the Sun\u201d) who grew up in the Chinese city. The installation will include works by Aaajiao (the nom d\u2019art of the new media artist Xu Wenkai) the painter Cui Jie, and Liu Shiyuan, who works in photography among other media. Ms. Cui\u2019s fantastical oil paintings of imagined buildings, including \u201cBuilding of Eagles\u201d (2014) are among the works on display. Mr. Horowitz said the gallery\u2019s founder, Leo Xu, a curator and writer, had\u201crisen to the fore of the next generation of Chinese gallerists,\u201d noting that he had exhibited at Art Basel Hong Kong show since it began. (Leo Xu Projects has also participated in Frieze New York and other international fairs.) \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful example of how our presence in Hong Kong has helped us cultivate relations with these Asian galleries,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take them for geographic reasons  \u2014   it\u2019s just that great things are being done in China right now. \u201d Hong Kong is known for being a hub of the art trade, but not so much its production or display. Edouard Malingue Gallery has been participating in Art Basel Hong Kong, and for its first Miami Beach outing is mounting a show of the video artist Wong Ping. Mr. Wong is known for   animations that touch on what the gallery\u2019s website calls \u201crepressed sexuality, personal sentiments and political limitations. \u201d Mr. Wong is also a Hong Kong native. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a Hong Kong artist,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s not an infinite pool of them. A local scene is developing there that goes beyond merely the commercial aspect of a market center. \u201d Of \u201cJungle of Desire\u201d (2015) the main work in this solo presentation, Mr. Horowitz said, \u201cOur committee totally loved this video. \u201d The gallery is also exhibiting a work in the Public sector, which is displayed outdoors in Collins Park, in front of the Bass Museum of Art. Eric Baudart\u2019s \u201cAtmosph\u00e8re\u201d (2016) is a tank filled with peanut oil that, powered by a fan, will ripple and move. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see a new gallery not only do a booth, but contribute an ambitious project to another sector, too,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said.'"}, "time": 1742561766.7689233}
