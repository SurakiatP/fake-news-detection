Gingrich said, \u201cNot voting on Friday was really good. The Democrats lost their majority for the first time in 40 years after they tried to push through Hillarycare. The Democrats lost the majority again in 2010 after they pushed through Obamacare. If we had all the House Republicans line up and vote yes on a bill that was at 17 percent approval  \u2014   that means four out of five Americans were not approving  \u2014    I will guarantee you the Democrats would have had a field day. \u201d \u201cSo I think the Freedom Caucus whether they intended to or not may have saved House Republican from a vote that would have been potentially very destructive,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow everybody ought to just get over it. Look at the future. Let\u2019s learn the lessons and recognize it took Reagan eight months to pass a tax cut. It took us 18 months to pass welfare reform. It took Pelosi and Obama eight months to pass Obamacare. We\u2019re not in a rush here. We don\u2019t have to get everything done by Easter. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563240.0855043}
