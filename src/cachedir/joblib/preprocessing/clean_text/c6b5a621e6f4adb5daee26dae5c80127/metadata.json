Trump in a series of interviews on Sunday television shows and said that \u201cpeople just don\u2019t care\u201d about recent negative reports about his tax returns and his treatment of women. During an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Priebus defended Mr. Trump after an article in The New York Times on Saturday in which dozens of women who encountered Mr. Trump over his career told of unsettling conduct. Asked by Chris Wallace, the host, if he was bothered by the accusations in the article, Mr. Priebus at first said that \u201cWell, you know, a lot of things bother me, Chris, and obviously I\u2019m the wrong person to be asking that particular question,\u201d but when asked again, Mr. Priebus said that voters were focused on other things. \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump in his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019m surprised that he has had girlfriends in the past.\u2019 That\u2019s not what people look at Donald Trump for,\u201d he said. When pressed by Mr. Wallace, Mr. Priebus said, \u201cyes, everything bothers me, Chris, but I don\u2019t know the truth of these things, I don\u2019t know other than reading an article whether or not these things are true. I think it\u2019s something that Donald Trump is going to have to answer questions in regard to. \u201d But, the Trump campaign, Mr. Priebus added, \u201crepresents something much different than the traditional analysis of individual candidates\u201d and that while such concerns were \u201clegitimate,\u201d he did not think they were \u201cgoing to affect people\u2019s view of who and what Donald Trump represents to them, given this election and the electorate. \u201d On CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Priebus said that whatever concerns Republicans might have, the party should rally behind Mr. Trump and he called efforts to draft a conservative for a   campaign a \u201csuicide mission. \u201d \u201cYou are not only changing and throwing out eight years of the White House, but you are also throwing out, potentially, generations on the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. He was responding to an article in The Washington Post that outlined efforts among some Republican leaders, dissatisfied with Mr. Trump as the party\u2019s   to recruit a third candidate to wage an independent bid. \u201cLook, we could have up to three justices change over in the next eight years, and this is a suicide mission,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cIt is not right. \u201d He repeated the argument on his Fox News appearance: \u201cIt\u2019s a suicide mission for our country, because what it means is that you\u2019re throwing down not just eight years of the White House but potentially 100 years on the Supreme Court, and wrecking this country for many generations,\u201d he said. Mr. Priebus, who also appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d defended Mr. Trump\u2019s resistance to releasing his tax returns. Asked on \u201cThis Week\u201d if Mr. Trump should release his tax returns  \u2014   an issue that dogged Mitt Romney in 2012, even after he eventually released them  \u2014   Mr. Priebus repeated his argument that Mr. Trump operated under different political norms. \u201cI don\u2019t think the traditional playbook applies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been down this road for a year. And it doesn\u2019t apply. He\u2019s rewritten the playbook. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628540.176467}
