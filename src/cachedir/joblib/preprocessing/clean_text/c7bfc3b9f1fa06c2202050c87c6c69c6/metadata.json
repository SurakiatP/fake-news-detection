C.  \u2014   A jury signaled here on Friday that it was within a single vote of convicting a white former police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man. But confusion reigned in the courtroom as the jury wavered about whether it was hopelessly deadlocked about the killing, which was recorded on video and became a symbol of the nation\u2019s heated debate about race and policing. Over the misgivings of a defense lawyer, Judge Clifton B. Newman, who presided over a   trial, did not declare a mistrial in the case of the former officer, Michael T. Slager, who shot and killed Walter L. Scott in North Charleston, S. C. on April 4, 2015. Jurors had been deliberating for about 48 hours and, by day\u2019s end, had decided to resume their discussions on Monday. Yet Friday\u2019s proceedings, before a crowded courtroom that alternated between focused and flummoxed, were a remarkable display of the divisions in one of the country\u2019s most closely watched cases. It has been seen as a bellwether for whether video evidence could lead to a rare conviction of a law enforcement officer in an   killing. \u201cI cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict,\u201d an unidentified juror wrote in a letter to Judge Newman, who read it aloud in court. The juror added that the panel \u201cmay never reach a unanimous decision. \u201d In a separate note, the jury\u2019s foreman, the sole black member of the panel, appeared curt, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s just one juror that has the issues. \u201d It was not clear whether the panel favored a conviction for murder, which could lead to a sentence of life in prison, or voluntary manslaughter, which carries a sentence of two to 30 years. Mr. Slager was indicted on a murder charge, and Judge Newman allowed jurors this week to consider the lesser offense of manslaughter. But the dueling messages  \u2014   and the shifting positions from jurors about whether additional talks or instructions might yield a verdict  \u2014   were a stunning turn in a case that began nearly 20 months ago, when Mr. Scott was shot and killed after fleeing from a traffic stop for a broken taillight. Mr. Slager, whom North Charleston fired after the shooting, testified that he had become involved in a physical struggle with Mr. Scott over his Taser device, leaving him in \u201ctotal fear\u201d and causing him to open fire in a lot behind a pawnshop in the city of about 108, 000. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shoot him because of the brake light,\u201d Andrew J. Savage III, Mr. Slager\u2019s lead defense lawyer, said of the former officer during his closing argument. \u201cHe shot him in fear of his life. \u201d It was an account that, at first, local officials believed. But within days, a pedestrian\u2019s cellphone video became public and showed a gruesome shooting that shook this region and reverberated around the world: Mr. Slager firing eight rounds toward Mr. Scott, who was running away and was at least 17 feet from Mr. Slager. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Slager had \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d when he shot Mr. Scott, and that he had staged evidence in a frantic effort to justify the shooting, the first time he had fired his service weapon while on patrol. \u201cThe badge is supposed to be a shield, not a sword,\u201d Scarlett A. Wilson, the chief prosecutor for Charleston County, said during her final presentation to the jury, when she argued that jurors could not acquit Mr. Slager \u201cknowing these facts and South Carolina law. \u201d For a time on Friday, the proceedings appeared poised to end in a mistrial, an outcome that would have been similar to the results of other cases involving accusations of police misconduct. A judge in Baltimore declared a mistrial in December when a jury could not reach a decision in the case of an officer charged in connection with the death of Freddie Gray, and a Cincinnati jury deadlocked last month during its deliberations about a police officer who had shot and killed an unarmed black motorist. Shortly after lunch on Friday, the jury sent a note indicating it was at an impasse, prompting Judge Newman to deliver what is known as an Allen charge, a set of legal instructions intended to break deadlocks during deliberations. \u201cYou have a duty to make every reasonable effort to reach a unanimous verdict,\u201d the judge told the jury of seven men and five women as he read the Allen charge, named for the 1896 Supreme Court case that enshrined such guidance. \u201cThe majority should consider the minority\u2019s position, and the minority should consider the majority\u2019s position,\u201d Judge Newman told the jurors before ordering them to resume their deliberations in hopes that they would come to one of three conclusions: a conviction for murder, a conviction for manslaughter or an acquittal. The outward orderliness of the trial collapsed within hours, when the jury sent more notes that revealed details about the deliberations. The jurors veered from hopelessly deadlocked to willing to talk more, rattling the courtroom, which was filled with members of the Scott and Slager families, as well as onlookers who had gathered, they thought, to see an end to the trial. But Judge Newman was reluctant to end the proceedings, even as Mr. Savage protested that continued deliberations could be \u201cextremely coercive. \u201d The jury, after sending another note announcing that it was exhausted, left the courthouse after nightfall. And Mr. Savage, a longtime defense lawyer in Charleston, seemed bewildered as he walked through a crowd of cameras after the court adjourned. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait till Monday, see what happens Monday and then we\u2019ll come in after that,\u201d he said. A lawyer for Mr. Scott\u2019s family, L. Chris Stewart, offered a similar reflection as he left the courthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cWe kept hearing: \u2018It\u2019s over. It\u2019s over.\u2019 It\u2019s not over. Justice is still coming. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562718.8541064}
