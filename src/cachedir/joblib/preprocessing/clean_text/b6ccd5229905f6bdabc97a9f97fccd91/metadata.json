[Ryan Lovelace of the Examiner reported Saturday:  Forlorn liberals took refuge at the American Constitution Society\u2019s national convention in Washington this week, discussing whether to encourage the growth of the \u201cdeep state\u201d resistance inside the government or fight President Trump from outside.   \u2026     UCLA law professor Jon Michaels said he favors filling the Trump administration with liberals opposed to Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe hear a lot of language about draining the swamp and this idea about a deep state that somehow was going to thwart the intentions or the political mandate of the president,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI kind of embrace this notion of the \u2018deep state. \u2019\u201d Michaels listed his ideas for how to ensure the success of the \u201cdeep state. \u201d Act as a group  \u2014   a department, across agency lines, as a community  \u2014   rather than as an individual when pushing back against Trump from the inside, he said. Once such a coalition is formed, he suggested \u201crogue tweeting\u201d or \u201cleaking to the media\u201d as options for fighting the president. Some present also discussed the possibility of using federalism to oppose Trump. For more than a century, liberals have opposed federalism, preferring rule by the federal government over allowing states to govern their own affairs. However,   states like California have newfound enthusiasm for federalism  \u2014   although their version has more to do with ignoring federal law altogether, rather than exercising state powers and prerogatives.
