You merely despise children\u2019s joyful faces when they eat ice-cream. I hate the little shits with every essence of my being. They\u2019re clumsy, careless, they\u2019re a cod, a fraud,\u201d Dunphy barked at Hook after the Newstalk radio host and rugby pundit suggested children were just the worst. \\nIn a desperate bid to one up his contrary counterpart, Hook\u2019s eyes frantically searched the street around him for something to give out about. \\n\u201cCars, too noisy. Roads! Some have potholes. The sky, too bloody high for my liking. Dunphy, I bloody hate that crevasse-faced tosser,\u201d Hook bellowed as he commented on one thing after another, trying to cement his reputation as a controversial champion of Ireland. \\nThe pair were then forcibly removed from the street by passers by who couldn\u2019t take much more of their droning, placing them in a room together, which has been rented especially for the broadcasters for the next month. \\nWith the stalemate continuing into its 12th hour both men are aware they could secure victory by mentioning how Hitler made the trains run on time, but neither seem ready to share the opinion just yet.'"}, "time": 1742564331.7084818}
