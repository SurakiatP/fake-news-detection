[Moore worked at NASA \u201cas an advanced aircraft engineer and basically kickstarted the current interest in vertical   and landing craft for   urban flight with a 2010 paper on the feasibility of the   vehicles. \u201d  \u201cThe engineer was impressed by Uber\u2019s work on the subject, and saw a chance to make the vision he\u2019d originally articulated years ago into something real, in a reasonable time scale,\u201d according to TechCrunch. \u201cMoore said that key to his decision to join Uber was that the company seemed to have a practical business case for making a flying commuter transit service real  \u2014   and nothing would ever get done without market motivation behind the vision. \u201d Uber\u2019s plans for a flying service were first hinted at in September 2016 by Uber\u2019s Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden. In an interview, Holden shared his interest in \u201cvertical takeoff and landing\u201d vehicles (VTOL) claiming, \u201cIt could change cities and how we work and live. \u201d Holden added that he wanted to offer his customers \u201cas many options as possible to move around,\u201d and that passenger drone technology could be a fully functioning norm within a decade. \u201cVTOL is another way to do that,\u201d said Holden, after talking about ways to decrease city traffic. Uber\u2019s Head of Product for Advanced Programs, Nikhil Goel, confirmed in a statement that Moore would be working on VTOL vehicles. \u201cUber continues to see its role as an catalyst to the growing developing VTOL ecosystem,\u201d said Goel in the statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Mark join us to work with companies and stakeholders as we continue to explore the use case described in our white paper. \u201d In 2015, rapper   and other   individuals, including members of the Saudi Arabian royal family, invested $20 million in JetSmarter, which has been billed as \u201cthe Uber for flying,\u201d while an Israeli tech firm is also prepared to launch their   drone service in 2020, following 15 years of development.
