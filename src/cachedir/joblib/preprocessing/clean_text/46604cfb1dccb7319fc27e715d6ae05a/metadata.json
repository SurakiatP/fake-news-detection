What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump\u2019s just after the debate officially ended. \\nThis led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. \\nWell, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it\u2019s very possible. Why? \\nBecause apparently Hillary can\u2019t give long speeches without a podium. \\nIn fact, these emails (and this isn\u2019t even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept \u201cshort and sweet\u201d unless Hillary has a podium. \\nSo how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? \\nEspecially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.
