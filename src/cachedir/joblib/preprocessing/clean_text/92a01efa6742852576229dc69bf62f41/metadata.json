Which isn\u2019t healthcare at all.  \u2014   Sherry (@staylorwrite4) May 15, 2017,  @Nimz105 @staylorwrite4 Outstanding.  Like selling aborted baby parts like a chop shop. We\u2019ve seen the hidden cameras revealing the truth. Can\u2019t change facts.  \u2014   John Porter (@John_Porter601) May 15, 2017,  @Nimz105 @staylorwrite4 I would love to visit your local PP Abortion factory. Can I bring state medical inspectors? Auditors? It would be a blast!  \u2014   Josey Wales (@josephwales911) May 15, 2017,  Late last week, the Kardashian sisters also visited Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinic in West Los Angeles: My sisters  I visited Planned Parenthood  learned so much! They are such an amazing place that provides so much to so many! #istandwithpp pic. twitter.   \u2014   Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 13, 2017,    organization Live Action has produced a video that utilizes Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual reports to show the actual decline in its healthcare services, while abortions have increased. \u201cOver the last six years, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual clientele has dropped half a million clients,\u201d Live Action reports in the video. \u201cAnd over the last ten years reported, Planned Parenthood has shut down over 200 facilities. \u201d The video adds that over the last ten years, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual breast exams have declined 60 percent, leaving the group with less than two percent of breast exams performed in the United States. Additionally, the group\u2019s annual Pap tests have decreased 77 percent, resulting in a current market share of less than one percent of these procedures. Similarly, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual cancer screenings have reportedly decreased 68 percent, an outcome that leaves the group with less than two percent of U. S. cancer screenings performed for women. \u201cHowever, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual abortions have increased 27 percent,\u201d observes Live Action, noting the group performs 34. 9 percent of abortions in the nation. Despite the stark decline in services other than abortions, Planned Parenthood\u2019s government funding has more than doubled, from $272 million to $553 million, with the group claiming taxpayer funding is not used to pay for abortions.
