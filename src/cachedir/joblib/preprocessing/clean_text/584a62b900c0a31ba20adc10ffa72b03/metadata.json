S. immigration law. The festival is scheduled to run from March   in Austin. [Felix Walworth, a drummer from Brooklyn, New   Told Slant, dragged the SXSW festival into the middle of the national immigration debate when he tweeted to his approximately 6, 000 followers he is canceling the band\u2019s appearance at the upcoming festival. The band\u2019s Facebook page describes itself as a \u201cbedroom punk band from New York, the music of Felix Walworth. \u201d  Walworth\u2019s complaint revolves around a provision in the festival\u2019s participation contract that states the organization will contact U. S. immigration authorities if international artists violate the conditions of their immigration visas that prohibit working in the U. S. After looking through this contract sent to me by sxsw I have decided to cancel Told Slant\u2019s performance at the festival pic. twitter.   \u2014   Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017,  According to Walworth, the agreement states, \u201cInternational Artists entering the country through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP,) B visa, or any   visa may not perform at any public, or   SXSW Music Festival DAY OR NIGHT shows  \u2026    \u201d The photo of the alleged contract wording cuts off at this point. He claims the contract states that artists violating this provision of the agreement will be removed from their \u201cofficial showcase,\u201d and possibly replaced. It further claims SXSW will cancel the artist\u2019s hotels booked through their housing service and cancel their credentials. Most notably, the agreement allegedly states SXSW \u201cwill notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities of the above actions. \u201d Shortly after his initial tweet, Walworth added, \u201cCan our first step toward coalition as artists with radical politics be to cancel all our official showcases at sxsw? I\u2019m serious just do it. \u201d Can our first step toward coalition as artists with radical politics be to cancel all our official showcases at sxsw? I\u2019m serious just do it,  \u2014   Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017,  SXSW officials responded in a statement published by Austin360. com that the wording in the contract has been in place for many years and is not a response to the current status of immigration issues that followed the election of President Donald Trump. \u201cIn the   era, it looks different than how it was intended, and how it was received in the past,\u201d SXSW managing director Roland Swenson told the local music news outlet. \u201cBut we\u2019ve come out strongly against the travel ban, and we\u2019ve really been going the extra mile to make sure these bands don\u2019t get screwed over when they enter the country. \u201d \u201cMost South by Southwest acts are able to perform here on the condition that they\u2019re not getting paid and they\u2019re not doing any other shows than ours, \u201cSwenson explained. \u201cThat keeps them from having to go through getting a work visa and all that, which is time consuming and expensive. \u201d He said the wording in the agreement is an attempt to warn international performers what could possibly happen to them if they violate the rules surrounding their visas. \u201cWe have never reported international showcasing artists to immigration authorities,\u201d SXSW officials stated in the press release. The statement continues: We were sorry to learn that one of our invited performers chose to cancel his performance at this year\u2019s SXSW Music Festival due to a misunderstanding of our policies regarding international artists. We understand that given the current political climate surrounding immigration, the language that was published seems strong. Violating U. S. immigration law has always carried potentially severe consequences, and we would be remiss not to warn our participating acts of the likely repercussions. Language governing SXSW\u2019s ability to protect a showcase has been in the artist Performance Agreement for many years. It is, and always was intended to be, a safeguard to provide SXSW with a means to respond to an act that does something truly egregious, such as disobeying our rules about pyrotechnics on stage, starting a brawl in a club, or causing serious safety issues. The organization provided Austin360. com with the text of the contract sections in question. The SXSW Performance Agreement states: If SXSW determines, in its sole discretion, that Artist or its representatives have acted in ways that adversely affect the viability of Artist\u2019s official SXSW showcase, the following actions are available to SXSW: Artist will be removed from their official SXSW showcase and, at SXSW\u2019s sole option, replaced. Any hotels booked via SXSW Housing will be canceled. Artist\u2019s credentials will be canceled. SXSW will notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities of the above actions. Officials continued, saying, \u201cWe hope never to be put in the position to act on this. Indeed, we spend a great deal of time communicating with international artists concerning numerous issues, including how to avoid issues at U. S. ports of entry. \u201d In what officials described as an informational addition to the agreement made many years ago, SXSW added the following language to the agreement: 1. 4. Foreign Artists entering the country through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) B visa or any   visa may not perform at any public or unofficial shows, DAY OR NIGHT, in Austin from March   2017. Accepting and performing at unofficial events (including unofficial events aside from SXSW Music dates during their visit to the United States) may result in immediate deportation, revoked passport and denied entry by US Customs Border Patrol at US ports of entry.

Here\u2019s a video: pic. twitter.   \u2014   Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017,  Swenson later updated his initial statement and said the language is in two different places in the agreement, but \u201cthose two sections did appear in sequence on SXSW\u2019s invitation letter. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
