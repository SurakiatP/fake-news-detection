[Gaffney said:  If I could just make one sort of overarching observation, it seemed to me, as it\u2019s being noted by a lot of people, this was a very presidential address. Which, I think, came as a surprise to some. It was also a very principled address, and the real message here is, they were his principles. He was not abandoning the beliefs and the promises and the policies that he had laid out up to this point. I think it\u2019s fair to say he packaged them brilliantly, and I think that\u2019s especially true in the national security space. The main themes of that were easy to recognize: sovereignty, and a commitment to   a principle that he\u2019s referred to, as had my old boss Ronald Reagan, as \u2018peace through strength.\u2019 Rebuilding our national security, and protecting our people, and building that great, great wall, and dealing with the threats that are internal to our country  \u2014   whether it\u2019s drug traffickers, or gangs, or violent illegal aliens of other stripes, or the people who are trying to create beachheads of terrorism. I think that is, if not an explicit reference, then certainly a code for the Muslim Brotherhood. After SiriusXM host Alex Marlow played a clip of Trump delivering the remarks in question, Gaffney said he thought the president was properly concerned with \u201cpeople coming here from elsewhere, imbued with a different value system than we have  \u2014   and I think specifically what that suggests is an appropriate concern about what I think is best described as sharia supremacism. \u201d Gaffney defined sharia supremacism as \u201ca value system that says it\u2019s not the U. S. Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees that should govern our people, it is sharia: a totalitarian, brutally repressive doctrine that the Islamic world has long sought to impose  \u2014   not all but a lot of it. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just the people who come here to do the violence, it\u2019s the infrastructure that they can tap into, whether it\u2019s mosques and madrassas or influence operations, front groups, Islamic societies, Islamic cultural centers. That\u2019s of concern as well, and I think he\u2019s absolutely right, and it is such a refreshing thing to have him talking about it,\u201d he said. He also praised Trump for focusing on \u201cwhat he calls radical Islamic terrorism. \u201d \u201cReports that advisers, that others in his administration don\u2019t agree with that term notwithstanding, he\u2019s   about it, and he\u2019s going to try to take it down,\u201d Gaffney said. Marlow said it was \u201cincredible\u201d to hear a president use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and doubted Hillary Clinton would have been able to say it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t said at all in the administration in which she served, the Obama administration,\u201d Gaffney observed. \u201cAnd frankly, it wasn\u2019t possible to say it in the George W. Bush administration. It\u2019s been 16 years getting this right, and I think it\u2019s a huge step forward. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
