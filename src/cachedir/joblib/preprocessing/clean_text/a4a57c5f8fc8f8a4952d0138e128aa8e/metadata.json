As a literal parade of women have come forward, one after another, to accuse the candidate of grabbing them, he has responded by threatening to sue them. \\nIt is hard to believe that anyone would believe Trump\u2019s shallow denials, but if there is anyone out there who still needs convincing, here you go . \\nA video has surfaced from 2011 showing Donald J. Trump publicly humiliating a beauty pageant contestant with sexual jokes at her expense and an unwanted grope in front of thousands of corporate audience members. \\nNot only did Trump embarrass the woman and grab her in public, he did it out of a very twisted desire for revenge. \\nThe need for revenge moves Trump\u2019s misogyny out of the realm of the creepy and into the realm of the truly sick. \\nHere\u2019s what happened, according to reports . \\nTrump was speaking to a corporate audience in Sydney, Australia in 2011. As he often does in his corporate speeches, Trump talked about getting revenge on those who have slighted him. He said: \u201cGet even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.\u201d \\nWhat a prince. \\nHe went on to give the crowd an example of how he gets even. He decided to single out a woman named Jennifer Hawkins. She was the 2004 winner of the Miss Universe Pageant, which Trump owned. He had asked the beauty queen, who is Australian, to introduce him at the corporate event, but there had been some type of miscommunication. \\nEither that, or she had simply declined to do so. \\nEither way, Trump was furious at Ms. Hawkins. He wanted the crowd to see how he handled his anger at a perceived snub. As he talked about getting revenge, he said : \u201cI\u2019ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins. Where\u2019s Jennifer? Where\u2019s she sitting? Get over here, Jennifer. First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer? This is about getting even.\u201d Trump pulled Hawkins up on the stage, telling the crowd how angry he had been at her. When she tried to explain herself, Trump pulled the mic away from her and told the crowd how she had \u201cdissed\u201d him after he had made her a \u201cbig star\u201d through his pageant. He disregarded her attempts to explain, instead choosing to make a sexual joke of her. \u201cSo what happens is \u2015 and you know what? She came tonight, she came \u2015 came, she came, she came.\u201d When the audience dutifully laughed at Ms. Hawkins\u2019 expense, Trump added: \u201cSee, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.\u201d Oh, ha,ha. What a sick adolescent mind. What an ass. It got worse, though. Trump grabbed the embarrassed woman and pulled her in for a clearly unwanted kiss. She managed to get an arm in between them, but Trump still managed to kiss her cheek. This is all on video, folks. This is right there for everyone to see. The disgusting sexual pervert who wants to be our next President can\u2019t dismiss this one with a threat to sue. He can\u2019t pretend that it didn\u2019t happen. Because we can all watch it.
