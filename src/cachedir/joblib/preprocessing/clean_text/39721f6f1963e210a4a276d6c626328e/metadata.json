{"duration": 0.09025931358337402, "input_args": {"text": "'Reports that Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich was a source for WikiLeaks before his murder leaves us with even more unanswered questions surrounding the case. [1. If Rich was murdered in a robbery gone wrong, why was his wallet, watch, and phone left behind?  Following Rich\u2019s July 2016 death in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington D. C. police officers claimed that it was likely the DNC staffer was shot during a robbery gone wrong. This doesn\u2019t explain, however, why Rich was found to still be in possession of all of his personal items, including wallet, watch, and mobile phone, which are often the primary targets during a street robbery. \u201cThere had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything,\u201d said Rich\u2019s girlfriend to NBC News. \u201cThey didn\u2019t finish robbing him, they just took his life. \u201d 2. Why haven\u2019t the DNC offered a reward for information related to his murder? Numerous groups, organizations, and individuals offered a reward for information related to Rich\u2019s murder, including WikiLeaks, GOP lobbyist Jack Burkman, crowdfunding bounty site WeSearchr, and author Mike Cernovich. The DNC and other Democratic Party organizations, however, have not. Rich\u2019s death was memorialized by the DNC with a bike rack and plaque. 3. Why are the   and mainstream media ignoring the case? The murder of Seth Rich has been a hot topic among conservative, libertarian, and alternative news outlets since the incident took place last year, however the   and mainstream media has largely ignored the case, only mentioning the staffer\u2019s name during conspiracy articles about Russian hacking. A quick Google search of \u201cSeth Rich\u201d will return dozens of news articles on the subject from sources such as Fox News, The Washington Examiner, and Heat Street, but few from outlets such as CNN or MSNBC. The Washington Post did publish a story related to Rich Wednesday afternoon but focused on Rich\u2019s parents\u2019 claim that reports of him contacting WikiLeaks were without evidence. Those articles which do appear on   sites all feature headlines which immediately brand questions surrounding his death as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and seek to deter investigations. The Washington Post published an article in August 2016 titled \u201cTrump allies, WikiLeaks and Russia are pushing a nonsensical conspiracy theory about the DNC hacks,\u201d while The Huffington Post\u2018s coverage of Rich\u2019s murder last year consisted of stories such as \u201cDonald Trump Has A History Of Linking His Political Opponents To People\u2019s Deaths,\u201d and \u201cConspiracy Theorists Won\u2019t Stop Accusing The Clintons Of Murder. \u201d CNN published one single story on Seth Rich\u2019s death last year \u2014   a straight news article on the murder with a quote from former DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The majority of   sites have also completely ignored the recent reports that Rich was the source of \u201cthousands of internal emails\u201d leaked to WikiLeaks before his death, despite the fact that they worked consistently to refute these claims beforehand. 4. Will the Democrats still push that Russia hacked the DNC? Despite the increasing amount of evidence proving the opposite, a frequent   talking point is to claim that it was \u201cRussia who hacked the DNC\u201d and leaked information to WikiLeaks. This argument, however, ignores the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange stated on numerous occasions that Russia was not a source of the leaks, implying instead that it was Rich. DNC hacker Guccifer 2. 0 also allegedly claimed in messages to an actress that Rich was one of his whistleblowers, while a private detective claimed this week that Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks before his death. Most of the claims that Russia \u201chacked the election\u201d are based on reports from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm which has been reported to have ties with Google and the Obama administration, while the FBI did not examine the DNC\u2019s server themselves. CrowdStrike\u2019s report was heavily refuted by DNC hacker Guccifer 2. 0 in a report of his own. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
