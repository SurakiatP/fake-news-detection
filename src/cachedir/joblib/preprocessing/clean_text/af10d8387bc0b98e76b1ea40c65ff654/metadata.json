[The trusting attitude towards Islam is revealed in the February 2017 poll follows 17 tumultuous years of attacks against Americans motivated or shaped by Islamic ideology throughout the United States \u2014  from the   atrocity to the Pulse nightclub attack in Florida committed by an observant, orthodox Muslim man from a Muslim family.  Merely    Democrats believe that Islam is more violent than other religions, such as Christianity, Mormonism, Judaism, and Buddhism.    Democrats believe that Islam is less violent that other religions, according to the poll of 1, 019 adults, which was taken Feb. 1 and Feb. 2. In contrast, Republicans have a far colder view of Islam.   percent of Republicans view Islam as  aggressive compared to other religions, and only two percent view Islam as more pacific than other faiths.  Still, 25 percent of Republican voters believe Islam\u2019s encouragement of violence is level with Christianity\u2019s doctrines, including the Beatitudes passage, reported by Matthew: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. \u201d The Koran, in contrast, is deemed by Islam\u2019s adherents to be a direct transcript of Allah\u2019s many commands, including these belligerent commandments: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes. Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.  So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle] strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens.  Former President Barack Obama and other leaders in the Democratic Party have repeatedly suggested that Islam is not more violent than other religions. Obama told Muslims in February 2016 that Islam means \u201cpeace,\u201d although it actually means \u201csubmission. \u201d Similarly, a Feb. 3 letter signed by three senior Democratic legislators in the House argued that \u201cthere are other three million Americans who practice Islam peacefully. The specter that there would be a Federal program that \u2014  in name and action \u2014  singles out people of a particular faith warrants immediate [critical] consideration by the Department of Justice. \u201d Progressive and   activists say much violence is caused by Christians, although few make the argument that the violence is motivated Christian doctrines. \u201cHowever, and this will probably shock many, so you might want to take a breath: Overwhelmingly, those who have committed terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe aren\u2019t Muslims,\u201d according to a Daily Beast column emphasizing the role of European nationalist groups in terrorism rates. \u201cConservatives claim that all terrorists are Muslim, but most violent attacks in the U. S. are carried out by white men,\u201d claims an article at Salon. com, which emphasizes the murders of abortionists. Similarly, establishment media sites have played up the     views of White House officials without even trying to address the truth or falsity of the views. In contrast,   critics of Islam routinely argue that Islam\u2019s mixture of religion and political ideology has a harmful impact on adherents and on societies. They argue that Islam is far more aggressive and harmful to societies that what they describe as the beneficial impact of Christianity\u2019s mix of faith and reason, freedom and law.'"}, "time": 1742563650.4643958}
