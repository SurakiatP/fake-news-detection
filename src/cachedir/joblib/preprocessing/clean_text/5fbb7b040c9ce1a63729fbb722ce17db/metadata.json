Bertolini, chief executive of the large health insurer Aetna, described the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president. He was speaking with me last Thursday on stage at The New York Times\u2019s annual conference, DealBook: Playing for the Long Term. \u201cWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday. We had no idea how to approach it,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said. Business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how Mr. Trump\u2019s election and Republican control of the White House, Senate and House  \u2014   which may make Washington\u2019s notorious gridlock a memory  \u2014   will reshape economic policy. The stock market has jumped, taking many prognosticators by surprise, in anticipation of the seismic changes Mr. Trump has promised: a repeal or refashioning of the Affordable Care Act, a dismantling of the   regulations for Wall Street, a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax rates, and a major infrastructure spending program, among other things. While the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive change, the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board. Take, for instance, the   Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the law, its view is more nuanced. Most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law. So it\u2019s hard to see how even the law\u2019s   opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that Mr. Trump said he would pursue. \u201cThat omelet has been made that toothpaste is out of the tube,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at the conference. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want regulation to be repealed in toto,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want to be good for bankers, you have to have policies that would be good for economic growth. \u201d More likely than a repeal, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration will try to eliminate the components he has criticized most. A Trump administration could try to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency created by   which Republicans loathe, for example. \u201cThe C. F. P. B. probably won\u2019t be eliminated,\u201d Ian Katz, a research analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little guy. \u201d Mr. Katz predicted that the Trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied for: a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission. Mr. Trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than $10 billion in assets. Currently, such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory category, one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements. This rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition. As for the return of    \u2014   something Mr. Trump has talked about  \u2014   don\u2019t bet on it. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously,\u201d Mr. Katz wrote. \u201cThat was part of a campaign document. Big banks are useful as a populist scapegoat, and Trump may continue to use them in that way. But neither he or his top aides are interested in   2. 0. \u201d Piecemeal change may also be true of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to undo Obamacare, which was one of his bedrock campaign promises. Mr. Bertolini of Aetna predicted: \u201cThere will be a repeal first, and I think the repeal will be at a minimum in name. \u201d It\u2019s nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch. \u201cBecause what\u2019s going to happen in the next year?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people signed up we have to honor that through 2017. We\u2019ll have to work quickly to have something for 2018. \u201d Mr. Bertolini said that whatever replacement plan might materialize, the government was not going to just stop insuring the 20 million or so people who are covered under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cYou can\u2019t put them out on the street without insurance,\u201d he said. His expectation is that Medicare Advantage will be expanded. The backpedaling on the \u201crepeal\u201d pledge has already begun: Mr. Trump has said in the past several days that he intends to make sure that health insurers will not be able to turn away people with   conditions, and that people under the age of 26 will still be able to have coverage under their parents\u2019 plans. About the latter provision, Mr. Trump said he would \u201cvery much try and keep that. \u201d In an interview with Lesley Stahl of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Sunday night, the   said that the measure \u201cadds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re going to try and keep. \u201d Of course, the biggest question is how Mr. Trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in America. He has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade agreements, increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants  \u2014   both for security reasons, he contends, and because they take jobs from Americans. How those ambitions ultimately play out is anyone\u2019s guess. One issue that Mr. Trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking American jobs. \u201cThe jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by technology,\u201d Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said at the conference. That\u2019s a truth that may be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitions. Still, Mr. Schmidt had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits. \u201cManufacturing jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take that for granted. \u201d Despite all of the   among C. E. O.s surprised about the outcome of the election, there was a sense of optimism  \u2014   or at least a sense of hope  \u2014   that pervaded their words. \u201cWe all know a lot about Trump the campaigner  \u2014   now we have to find out about the Trump who needs to get things done,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said. \u201cHe will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to be,\u201d he continued. \u201cI assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things change. \u201d Mr. Blankfein added, \u201cI\u2019m going to see how it goes before I become mournful. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561649.7390742}
