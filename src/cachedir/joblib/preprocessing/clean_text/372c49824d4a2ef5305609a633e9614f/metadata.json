It was a complete disgrace.\u201d \\n\u201cThe American people have repudiated the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,\u201d the scholar said. \\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to restore a measure of sanity. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East. He is going to restore the reputation of the United States for integrity, and dealing with the international community,\u201d he noted. \\n\u201cHe respects Russia as should any president of the United States, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fell miserably short,\u201d the analyst pointed out. \\n\u201cI believe we are already seeing signs that the situation for the world community is going to vastly, dramatically improve, that the United States is going to conduct itself in accordance with international law, and restrain from regime change, and hopefully we will no longer be the greatest aggressor nation in the world,\u201d Fetzer said in his concluding remarks.
