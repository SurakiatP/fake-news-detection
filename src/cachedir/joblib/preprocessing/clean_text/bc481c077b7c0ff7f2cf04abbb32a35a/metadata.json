{"duration": 1.3340983390808105, "input_args": {"text": "'The film critics of The New York Times  \u2014   Manohla Dargis, A. O. Scott and Stephen Holden  \u2014   share their picks for the best movies of the year.  It was the best of times, it was  \u2014   well, you know. \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cThe Purge: Election Year\u201d may sound like the zeitgeist, but if you\u2019re looking for the defining movie of 2016, look no further than the new \u201cGhostbusters. \u201d It was hardly my favorite, but it made me laugh. And while its transformation into a target of misogynist and racist vitriol was surprising, it was not especially shocking. It was just another reminder that female power remains deeply threatening, even in the realm of the imaginary. As usual when it came to this year in movies, it was sometimes good if also hard, lean, bad and familiar times, both critically and commercially. \u201cBox Office Meltdown,\u201d a Variety headline shrieked in July by Nov. 25, the trade was reporting \u201cU. S. Box Office Tops $10 Billion\u201d  \u2014   \u201cthe   that it\u2019s reached the milestone. \u201d It turns out that after the acrimonious presidential election, people were coming together at the movies. Then again, packed theaters could also be chalked up to the number of solid mainstream releases, including \u201cArrival,\u201d \u201cAlmost Christmas,\u201d \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d and \u201cMoana. \u201d It\u2019s worth noting that even the most   popular movies  \u2014   as I write, Pixar\u2019s \u201cFinding Dory\u201d tops the yearly box office  \u2014   are unlikely to show up on many   lists or scoop up critics\u2019 awards. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association (I\u2019m a former member) for instance, recently gave Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d best picture, best director and best supporting actor (Mahershala Ali). Its other honorees included releases that, according to the website Box Office Mojo, opened in a limited number of theaters: \u201cKrisha\u201d (26 theaters) \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d (125) and \u201cCertain Women\u201d (138). The divide between what most Americans see and what critics reward is not new or surprising. Yet it seems worth repeating that this gulf remains as vast and seemingly unbridgeable as the one that characterized the electorate. This is less about taste (or   elites versus Jill Popcorn) than the bottom line of today\u2019s conglomerate cinema. As of early December, the six major studios have an 83. 4 percent market share of the domestic box office. Disney alone enjoys a staggering 24. 2 percent, a number that will increase with the release of \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story. \u201d It\u2019s Disney\u2019s world, after all. Though not only: By the time the Academy Awards roll around in February, the United States will have a new president. A few critics I know are trying to name the most Trumplike release of 2016 one suggested Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cSully,\u201d which I see more as an exemplar of classic Hollywood\u2019s heroic individualism. Viewing movies through the lens of today is a favorite game, never mind that most titles are in the works long before the real world catches up to them. A more fruitful game may be to weigh how this year\u2019s releases  \u2014   be they \u201cMoonlight\u201d or \u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d or \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d  \u2014   signify the end of the Obama era. As to my own favorites, well, they just keep on changing, depending on mood, both personal and national. 1. \u2018NO HOME MOVIE\u2019 This was the final feature from Chantal Akerman, who died of an apparent suicide in 2015. Akerman explained that \u201cNo Home Movie\u201d was about rooms and faraway places but \u201cabove all\u201d about her mother, Natalia, a Holocaust survivor, \u201cbut not only. \u201d It was also, Akerman wrote, about love and loss. She was presumably speaking about her mother, although of course she was also speaking for us, those who loved the daughter. [Read the review] 2. \u2018TONI ERDMANN\u2019 The filmmaker Maren Ade\u2019s latest is a perfectly directed and performed movie about a father, his daughter and the ludicrous gag teeth that help close this pair\u2019s generational, economic and social divide. It couldn\u2019t be timelier in how it considers the consequences of neoliberalism, wherein all human interactions are reduced to market relations, but it also has a beat you can dance to. [Read a review] 3. \u2018MOONLIGHT\u2019 Bathed in blue and anguish, Mr. Jenkins\u2019s elegiac film traces a single life across three chapters. There\u2019s much to love and admire about this haunting movie, including its lapidary visuals. Here, every moment  \u2014   light flooding a darkened room, an oceanic baptism and a halo of shampoo crowning the head of an abandoned child  \u2014   speaks more eloquently than most of its dialogue, though the words are very fine, too. [Read the review] 4. \u2018O. J.: MADE IN AMERICA\u2019 There\u2019s a tradition of documentaries that dig into their subjects episodically, sometimes at monumental length. Such is the case with Ezra Edelman\u2019s \u201cO. J.: Made in America,\u201d which for close to eight hours takes up the case of O. J. Simpson  \u2014   his football glory years, infamous murder trial and tawdry aftermath  \u2014   to create a titanic inquiry into race, class and celebrity in the United States. Race may be a construction, but it is one that Americans continue to live and die by. [Read the review] 5. \u2018MY GOLDEN DAYS\u2019 The director Arnaud Desplechin beautifully transcends the usual romantic clich\u00e9s with a deeply moving, exquisitely directed tale of young love and the lessons never learned. [Read the review] 6. \u2018I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO\u2019 In his thrilling documentary, Raoul Peck closes the divide between the personal and political through a portrait of James Baldwin. Expressively narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, the movie largely draws on Baldwin\u2019s own writing  \u2014   as well as material like his F. B. I. files  \u2014   to create a portrait of a man that turns into a harrowing indictment of his country. 7. \u2018ARRIVAL\u2019 The E. T. s in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s twisty   heartbreaker don\u2019t want to phone home, but they would really like to get someone on the horn. As she often does, Amy Adams comes to the rescue. Among the movie\u2019s pleasures is a creature design that at last breaks with H. R. Giger\u2019s slavering aliens. [Read the review] 8. \u2018THE HANDMAIDEN\u2019 Set in Korea in the 1930s, the latest from Park   involves two women, one a Japanese heiress and prisoner, the other an impoverished Korean con artist who could pick pockets for Fagin. Their delectable relationship takes them and the movie to places you might not imagine, while advancing an argument about gender, desire, erotica and pornography that is more complex than the movie\u2019s slickness suggests. [Read the review] 9. \u201813TH\u2019 In her ferocious, intellectually galvanizing activist documentary, Ava DuVernay takes a hard look at race in the United States through the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. You may think you\u2019ve heard it all before you haven\u2019t. [Read the review] 10. \u2018FROM THE NOTEBOOK OF   \u2026    \u2019 One of the high points of this year\u2019s New York Film Festival, this   masterwork from Robert Beavers is quite a few years old but new to me. (It was apparently finished in 1971 and reworked in 1998.) Here, Mr. Beavers considers the nature of cinema using light and shadow, various mattes and apertures  \u2014   including a window spilling sun on a desk  \u2014   a meditation that at times has the quality of a holy confession. \u201cAquarius\u201d (from Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho) \u201cAutumn\u201d and \u201cThe Dreamer\u201d (Nathaniel Dorsky) \u201cBagatelle II\u201d (Jerome Hiler) \u201cCertain Women,\u201d especially Kristen Stewart (Kelly Reichardt) \u201cCreepy\u201d (Kiyoshi Kurosawa) \u201cThe Fits\u201d (Anna Rose Holmer) \u201cThe Illinois Parables\u201d (Deborah Stratman) \u201cInto the Inferno\u201d (Werner Herzog) \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cNeruda\u201d (Pablo Larra\u00edn) \u201cKrisha\u201d (Trey Edward Shults) \u201cLa La Land,\u201d if mostly its finale (Damien Chazelle) \u201cLoving\u201d (Jeff Nichols) \u201cMountains May Depart\u201d (Jia Zhangke) \u201cPaterson\u201d (Jim Jarmusch) \u201cSunset Song\u201d (Terence Davies) \u201c20th Century Women\u201d (Mike Mills). Last spring, with #OscarsSoWhite in the rearview mirror and Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory on the    horizon, I reviewed Jeremy Saulnier\u2019s \u201cGreen Room. \u201d It struck me at the time as a smart, brutal, slightly contrived thriller about members of a rock band battling a gang of   punks in the Northwest. In retrospect, though, it seems possible that this scrappy little indie (which just missed making the list below) was something more than a bit of nasty fun. Maybe it was a harbinger, an unheeded political signal amid the   noise, a   allegory of battles to come. Am I reading too much into it now, or was I not paying close enough attention then? If so, I\u2019m hardly the only one. Relevance is one of the great shibboleths of criticism, and after a   event as dramatic and complex as this year\u2019s election, the temptation to seek clues and answers in works of popular art is almost overwhelming. Think pieces promising to tell us \u201cHow [insert title here] Explains Trump\u201d popped up after Nov. 8 like mushrooms after a rainstorm, and entertainment has been mined for signs and symptoms of   disaffection,       gullibility and every other real and imaginary affliction of the American body politic. But cinema is better at exploring than explaining, and the screen is more like a prism or a kaleidoscope than a mirror or a window. We seldom get the news from movies. Which is not to deny that they are useful tools for reckoning with reality. In a time of confusion, the best films can offer clarity, comfort and a salutary reminder of complexities that lie beyond the bluster and expedience of political discourse and conventional journalism. We go to the movies  \u2014   and we still go quite a lot, by the way, in spite of the seductions of the couch and the streaming queue  \u2014   in search of escape from reality. We\u2019re also looking for alternative routes to the truth, for sparks of imagination that can ignite or illuminate our own thinking when it gets muddled or stale. The 11 releases listed below were not only my most memorable   experiences of the year they were also, in ways I can\u2019t always specify, helpful. They stirred my curiosity, troubled my sleep and increased the range of my understanding. Sometimes they just made me feel better. 1. \u2018MOONLIGHT\u2019 Much has been written about Barry Jenkins\u2019s luminous second feature, based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, which depicts three phases in the life of a young man named Chiron. And much of that writing has drawn out the film\u2019s complicated themes  \u2014   of race, place, sexuality and manhood  \u2014   and the exquisite artistry Mr. Jenkins and his cast bring to them. But the most eloquent testimony comes when words fail, when I run into someone on the street or at a party and they say, \u201c\u2018Moonlight,\u2019\u201d and I say \u201cyeah, \u2018Moonlight,\u2019\u201d and we take a deep breath because nothing more really needs to be said. [Read the review] 2. \u2018O. J.: MADE IN AMERICA\u2019 History, biography, sports, celebrity, race, gender, police brutality and media insanity  \u2014   Ezra Edelman\u2019s   documentary touches on nearly everything horrible and fascinating in the last   of American life. A triumph of archival research, it\u2019s also a masterpiece of insight, a rare documentary with the heft and sprawl of great literature. [Read the review] 3. \u2018TONI ERDMANN\u2019 Maren Ade\u2019s sublime and squirmy comedy will change the way you think about a lot of things, including (but hardly limited to) fatherhood, daughterhood,   false teeth, Bulgarian folklore, German humor, workplace sexism,   exercises, petit fours and   global capitalism. [Read a review] 4. \u2018CAMERAPERSON\u2019 Kirsten Johnson, a prolific and widely traveled cinematographer, makes her living shooting other people\u2019s films, many of them dealing with war, injustice and sexual violence. She assembled this memoir from outtakes and home video, and the result is revelatory testimony to the simple, mysterious power of the camera to bridge the chasm between personal experience and public history. [Read the review] 5. \u2018AFERIM!\u2019 Radu Jude\u2019s Romanian western  \u2014   a      epic set in the mountains of Walachia in the   century  \u2014   was barely released in the United States, which is a shame for several reasons. For one thing, its rugged humor, high adventure and ethical seriousness pay tribute to an enduring and often misunderstood genre. For another, it takes up the moral and political problem of slavery (in its Balkan rather than its Southern manifestation) with unsparing honesty and startling nuance. [Read the review] 6. \u2018AMERICAN HONEY\u2019 The British director Andrea Arnold leads a raw and ragged adventure into the heartland, discovering it to be a strangely innocent zone of greed, lust, youthful idiocy and startling natural beauty. Sasha Lane, a fearless nonprofessional, is thrilling to watch, as is Shia LaBeouf. There is also a single shot  \u2014   of Riley Keough (who happens to be Elvis Presley\u2019s granddaughter) standing in a motel doorway, wearing a   bikini with the price tag still attached  \u2014   that just might say more about the state of the nation in 2016 than the words of a thousand pundits. [Read the review] 7. \u2018AQUARIUS\u2019 The United States was not the only country undergoing a wrenching political upheaval this year. In his generous and angry second feature, the     Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho tracks the changes shaking Brazil as they play out indirectly in the daily life of Clara, a retired music critic played by the great S\u00f4nia Braga. A mother, a cancer survivor and an avatar of culture, sensuality and intellectual independence, Clara is a fittingly embattled and indomitable heroine for our times. [Read the review] 8. \u2018SAUSAGE PARTY\u2019 This animated feature, with the voices of Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig, is a profoundly religious film that explores, with devastating rigor, a stark and scary existential predicament. What if you woke up one morning and found out that everything you had always believed in was a lie? Not for kids, obviously. [Read the review] 9. \u2018A BIGGER SPLASH\u2019 Commissioned to remake a    \u201960s thriller, Luca Guadagnino composed a gorgeous   meditation on sex, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the enduring decadence of European art cinema. Tilda Swinton is silent, Ralph Fiennes never stops talking and the gorgeous volcanic island of Pantelleria plays host to a divine and lethal vacation from hell. [Read the review] 10. \u2018ELLE\u2019 AND \u2018THINGS TO COME\u2019 (TIE) Paul Verhoeven\u2019s lurid thriller and Mia  \u2019s meditative domestic drama are complementary portraits of Frenchwomen in middle age, both of them played by Isabelle Huppert. Each movie has its flaws of directorial perspective  \u2014   reflexive sexism in Mr. Verhoeven\u2019s case, generational condescension in Ms.  \u2019s  \u2014   but Ms. Huppert transcends all limitations. She\u2019s at once the most ferociously intuitive and the most serenely intelligent actress working in movies today. [Read the reviews: \u2018Elle\u2019 | \u2018Things to Come\u2019] 1. \u2018MOONLIGHT\u2019 Kindness and tenderness, as opposed to   melodrama, are traits not commonly associated with movies that aim primarily to thrill and excite. Genuine intimacy is so rarely encountered in film that when you come upon it, your tendency is to suspect that somehow you\u2019re being played. But in Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight,\u201d my pick for the best movie of the year, there are moments of generosity and selflessness that take your breath away. This is an entirely human story in a medium enthralled by technology, violence and fantasy. As I watched the film, based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, it held me in a state of awed recognition and remembrance of the times I was touched by transformational acts of gentleness and caring. These radiant moments soften an otherwise tough movie, about Chiron, a gay black youth played by three different actors, growing up in a Miami housing project where he acquires the armor of a street thug to survive. Along with \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d and \u201cBoyhood,\u201d it is one of the three finest movies of the last decade or so. Is it a coincidence that all three have male protagonists who instinctively resist patriarchal brutishness? In its brokenhearted examination of race, class, privilege and inequality in modern America, \u201cMoonlight\u201d is one of several excellent movies set in places beyond the country\u2019s affluent enclaves. When I raved about \u201cMoonlight\u201d to several    white liberal friends and described Chiron, they politely took note but behaved as if I were telling them to eat their spinach. These same people couldn\u2019t wait to see films like \u201cThe Big Short\u201d and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d about the financial chicanery and decadence of rich white crooks. This, then, is the America we\u2019re living in: The haves would rather not contemplate the suffering of the  . And we are shocked to discover that our indifference has consequences. [Read the review] 2. \u2018O. J.: MADE IN AMERICA\u2019 The obverse of \u201cMoonlight\u201d in its focus on O. J. Simpson, a rich, entitled black star athlete, the   documentary directed by Ezra Edelman is an epic examination of race, class, sex, celebrity and the cult of sports heroism in America. It is an   of the American psyche focused on the place where all those themes converge to create what some would call the American dream. Or is it a nightmarish orgy of bloodlust? [Read the review] 3. \u2018AMERICAN HONEY\u2019 Star (Sasha Lane) the    at the center of Andrea Arnold\u2019s pungent road movie, flees a broken home and a sexually abusive father figure to join a band of teenagers roaming the heartland selling magazine subscriptions door to door. On one level, \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d is a grimy travelogue that shows you the poverty and hardship in a Middle America where the social safety net has frayed, families are ravaged by poverty and drug addiction, and young children are left unattended. The wanderers are the photonegative opposites of \u201960s hippies who deserted comfortable   homes in search of adventure. Most of these   stragglers have no place to go back to. [Read the review] 4. \u2018EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT\u2019 Viewed largely through the eyes of an aggrieved shaman whose tribe is on the verge of extinction at the hands of Colombian rubber barons in the 19th and 20th centuries, the director Ciro Guerra\u2019s fantastical mixture of myth and historical reality challenges lingering illusions of   culture as more advanced than any other. Beautiful isn\u2019t a strong enough word to describe scenes of the heaving waters of the Amazon and its tributaries, on which two explorers, separated by more than 30 years, navigate in canoes, accompanied by the shaman, Karamakate, the last survivor of an Amazonian tribe killed off by European invaders. Along the way they encounter Conradian horrors. [Read the review] 5. \u2018MANCHESTER BY THE SEA\u2019 In Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s sad, powerful film, Casey Affleck plays an embittered janitor in Boston who, after the death of his older brother, reluctantly returns to the fishing village where he grew up to be the guardian of his teenage nephew. The residents of the town may not be poor, but most are struggling. There are no easy answers and pat resolutions in a movie that feels absolutely authentic. [Read the review] 6. \u2018NEON BULL\u2019 This Brazilian movie, directed by Gabriel Mascaro, immerses you in the intensely pungent world of vaquejada, a rodeo sport in which two cowboys on horseback, seek to tug a bull to the ground by the tail. Iremar (Juliano Cazarr\u00e9) is a handsome cowboy who dreams of being a fashion designer. In this deep, sexy reflection on man and animal, the riders use fancy colognes to camouflage barnyard scents. The movie is a celebration of animal smells. [Read the review] 7. \u2018FIRE AT SEA\u2019 The Italian director Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s documentary is set on the small island of Lampedusa, whose residents  \u2014   fishing families that have lived there for generations  \u2014   help rescue desperate African migrants arriving by sea.
