So says columnist, New York Times bestselling author, and admitted Clinton \u201cbagman\u201d Jeff Rovin. Initially presenting his story anonymously in the National Enquirer , Rovin subsequently revealed his identity in a Monday interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. Among his striking claims: The Clintons have an \u201copen marriage,\u201d Hillary has had affairs with both men and women, and he paid off reporters to keep the copious Clinton dirt hush-hush. And these allegations are backed up by 24-years' worth of documentation. \\nRovin\u2019s appearance on Hannity (video below) adds further weight to his claims, as people often associate the Enquirer with fanciful tales. Yet as Hannity himself pointed out, that paper has at times broken major stories, catching the rest of the media napping. Hannity cited scoops concerning O.J. Simpson, John Edwards\u2019 mistress, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson\u2019s out-of-wedlock child, Tiger Woods\u2019 marriage woes, and others. In fact, Rovin said that such Enquirer stories are, ironically, \u201cprobably better vetted than most of the stories in other media\u201d because they\u2019re \u201cso controversial.\u201d \\nOf course, the Enquirer 's scoops almost invariably involve salacious matters, and the Clinton story is no exception. Yet most significant are Rovin\u2019s disclosures about media suppression of truth \u2014 and efforts to destroy people such as Monica Lewinsky. \\nRovin explains that as a Hollywood reporter in the '80s and '90s, his close relationship with the Tinseltown power set and press allowed him to become, as he put it, \u201c\u2018a fixer\u2019: someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press.\u201d Rovin did his job so well that in 1991 he was asked to work for a rising political couple who, together, were an embarrassing-story-disgorging machine: Arkansas governor William Jefferson Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham. As he wrote : I was informed that these stories would involve rumors of Bill Clinton' s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of Hillary Clinton with a male member of her law firm, Vince Foster, as well as a female mover-and-shaker in Hollywood. For a retainer of $4,000 a month \u2014 paid by a third party, not the campaign \u2014 I was told to keep these stories hush-hush in one of two ways: by trading access to the Clintons for \u201cpositive\u201d interviews, or by paying the reporters. The payments were always cash, usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and came in two denominations: $100 for a heads-up that a bad story was coming; or considerably more to kill the piece. \\nRovin\u2019s claims align perfectly with the recent WikiLeaks revelations about direct collusion between the corrupt mainstream media and Clinton campaign; among the examples are a New York Times reporter giving the campaign veto power over quotations, a CNBC reporter advising the campaign, and CNN commentator Donna Brazile forwarding Clinton a debate question prior to a March face-off against Bernie Sanders (yes, Sandernistas, the fix was really in). \\nYet bribery wasn\u2019t the only method for getting stories spiked; deception was another. As Rovin told Hannity, reporters \u201cwere paid to soften the stories.\u2026 What would happen is, if we got wind of a story from the tabloids, chances were pretty good it would end up in one of the mainstream newspapers or magazines. We would then contact one of those people and say, \u2018This isn't true, don't run it.\u2019\u201d \\nAnd this apparently does ring true to Hannity, who spoke of the evidence he saw, saying to Rovin, \u201cI went through with your editor everything that you had. You do have ledgers; you did have the faxes with the letterhead and the timestamps. The Clintons know you\u2026. They know you fixed things for them.\u201d \\nAnd Rovin says this fixing became a full-time job, as the Clintons committed continual sexual indiscretions in what he described as a \u201cpolyamorous\u201d and \u201copen\u201d marriage \u2014 which matches the \u201copen borders\u201d Hillary said, in an e-mail, that she wanted. \\nRovin appears to believe the Clintons\u2019 sexual depravity was so all-consuming that it distracted Bill from the business of running the country. He cites as the worst example of judgment the bachelor party in March 1994 for Clinton\u2019s half-brother, Roger Clinton, who, in quintessential Clinton style, was marrying a bride eight-months-pregnant. Prostitutes were present, and recordings were made \u2014 they included Bill Clinton. \\nNone of this will surprise those who know of Bill\u2019s having taken 26 flights on billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u201cLolita Express,\u201d but the recording was a problem: It was offered for sale to the Enquirer , says Rovin. This is when he says he swooped in and negotiated a deal to keep the recording suppressed. (Note: This would be a national-security concern, too. A foreign power that obtained such a recording conceivably could use it to blackmail the president.) \\nAlso in 1994, Rovin \u201carranged a meeting for Hillary and a woman in an exclusive Beverly Hills hotel,\u201d he said . \u201cI helped her slip out of a back exit for a one-on-one session with the other woman.\u201d The journalist described this encounter as \u201csordid.\u201d \\nRovin also reveals that he was part of a \u201cteam effort\u201d to damage Monica Lewinsky; in fact, Rovin later felt so bad about this smear campaign that he apologized to Lewinsky personally. In addition, the journalist \u201ctold Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary\u2019s crew rummaged through [Vince] Foster\u2019s office \u2026 to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal,\u201d as WND.com put it . \\nAs to Rovin\u2019s motivations for finally coming forward, he mentioned two significant factors. He told Hannity that when he learned that Enquirer editor Dylan Howard was doing the Clinton story and was naming sources he wanted kept confidential, he agreed to participate under the condition he could protect those sources. Second, he wrote in the Enquirer piece, \u201cI am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump have received. Nothing I have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the Clintons \u2014 many of which have [sic] yet to be revealed.\u201d \\nHaving said this, Rovin was dismayed at the campaign emphasis on dirt, saying to Hannity, \u201cThe election is too important to focus on this salacious material.\u201d Identifying as a libertarian, the journalist expressed the common idea that politicians\u2019 sexual indiscretions are none of anyone\u2019s business and should be beyond scrutiny. And while many issues are more important \u2014 such as Clinton\u2019s internationalist, open-borders dreams; amnesty plans; warmongering stance vis-\u00e0-vis Russia; and radical social agenda \u2014 that common idea is also a mistaken idea. \\nQuestion: Is there any sexual indiscretion a politician could commit that would bring his psychological fitness into question? What if a person habitually engages in bestiality? Would you want such an individual managing your finances or babysitting your child? If not, why not, if \u201cprivate\u201d sexual behavior has no bearing on whether the person can \u201cdo the job\u201d? \\nIf so, however, then would you want such a person\u2019s finger on the nuclear button? \\nNow, what kind of sexual depravity is not a red flag? \\nDuring the Bill Clinton years, \u201cCharacter doesn\u2019t matter\u201d became a meme used to justify Clinton corruption. But would you want to be pulled over by a cop with bad character or have your car repaired by a mechanic with same? Character is integral to everything we do . \\nThe Bible speaks of \u201ceyes blinded by sin,\u201d \u201cFor the eye altering alters all,\u201d wrote poet William Blake. Habitually engaging in wrongdoing and (as man will do) rationalizing it away \u2014 which is when we deny reality \u2014 causes us to lose touch with reality. Twisting the truth in our own minds twists our minds; conning ourselves corrupts our judgment. The eye altering\u2026 \\nHillary Clinton is poised to continue the \u201cfundamental change\u201d Barack Obama infamously promised.
