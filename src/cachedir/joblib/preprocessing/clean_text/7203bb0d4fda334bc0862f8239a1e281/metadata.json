Hillary spent twice as much as Trump and got nothing for it. Hillary raised $520 million for her campaign compared to the $270 that Trump spent. \\n*** That means that she spent twice as much as Trump and got NOTHING for it. \\nThat\u2019s why she was supposedly crying the night of the election and didn\u2019t come out and speak. Instead, she sent John Podesta out to address the crowd of social justice losers that had come to see her. Ed Klein: Hillary cried inconsolably, blamed Comey & Obama for not doing enough to stop FBI investigation. pic.twitter.com/KsqiKp5Jhz \\n\u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 9, 2016 \\nHillary Clinton stepped up today, though, and showed that it would be possible to change the toxic rhetoric that has dominated the news. \\nLet\u2019s come together, y\u2019all. To all the Bernie, Hillary, Jill and Johson supporters, we live in a Trump nation. Get used to it, but we still want you here. We just need to bring the country back to the principles that it was founded on. \\n*** Please, please, please go back out and let\u2019s sow the seeds of peace! \\nShare, share, share, share this everywhere, y\u2019all! It\u2019s time to bring this nation together under the strong leadership of Donald Trump. '"}, "time": 1742564360.5631459}
