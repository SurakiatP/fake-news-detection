This should always be the case (otherwise, why bother?), but many people get so accustomed to routines that they can be doing more harm than good. Variety is one of the keys to any workout, and running is no different. \\nYou may think of the treadmill as tedious and tiring, but there are ways that it can be just as much fun as the most exciting marathon or run on the beach. Most people look at the time they spend on the treadmill as a boring necessity that they have to put their heads down and power through, but it can be exciting and fun if done the right way. This is especially the case when you know that you are getting the absolute most out of your treadmill time. \\nMany of us would prefer to do our running outside, but the old hamster wheel can have added advantages and benefits when you know what you\u2019re doing. By the same token, it can be self-defeating if you hit a rut or make many common mistakes. \\nThat\u2019s why we put together this list. There are a few easy steps you can take (no pun intended) to turn that boring old task into an exciting, calorie burning blast, and we want to help you do that. We also want to help you avoid many of the common\u2013 and sometimes silly\u2013 mistakes that can waste precious workout time and energy. Some of these mistakes can even be harmful if not cleaned up and corrected. \\nSo first, let\u2019s start with the good stuff. Follow these five simple treadmill hacks to make sure your next time out is more productive than ever! 1. Mix Things Up \\nThis is the easiest way to turn what is usually the boring drudge of the treadmill into a more exciting way of spending your gym time. Variety is also one of the most important weapons in your fat burning arsenal. Mixing things up will provide your body the challenge it needs to shed unwanted pounds in a hurry. \\nThe simplest way to start doing this is to up your intensity and/or duration. However, this can present some problems in itself. If you work too close to your maximum heart rate, you can easily tire yourself out too quickly. On the other hand, we want to burn calories now and slower, steadier workouts can take longer to show results. \\nThe right variety will help you find that perfect soft spot right in the middle. For some days, just do your usual routine of 20 or 30 minutes a little faster than normal. For other days, go slower and longer for around an hour. We know, nobody wants slow or long; but trust us, just keep reading. 2. Use Intervals of Speed \\nThis is all about pushing your body just far enough to burn the most calories without needing to be carried out the gym. You will want to sprinkle in short bursts of sprinting throughout your workout. Remember that thing we said about keep reading? Well, here is a tip that will help you cut time and pounds in one simple step. \\nResearch shows that running hard for two minutes then slowing down for three will burn more calories than just the boring slow and steady routine. That same research also says doing that will help you drop up to four percent more body fat in a few weeks if done regularly.The best way to do this is with 1:2 intervals. For example, using this technique you would increase your speed for around 30 to 60 seconds then drop it back to normal for 60 to 120 seconds. Make sense? \\nIt could take some time to find that perfect sweet spot of speed intervals since it will be different for each individual. You want a speed that takes effort to hold for two to five minutes but don\u2019t overdo it. The goal is to find the speed that makes you feel invigorated as opposed to one that makes you fall off the treadmill with exhaustion. You can eventually build up to higher speeds, but it will all depend on your experience. Prev post Page 1 of 3 Next Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.
