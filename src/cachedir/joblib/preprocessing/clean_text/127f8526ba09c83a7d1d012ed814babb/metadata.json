Here\u2019s his description of that process, from a debate on Dual Citizenship: \\nOkay, okay, I know it sounds too good to be true. But the question of dual citizenship really was hotly discussed in a crowd of my fellow Americans-to-be as we all waited patiently for the judge to arrive and administer the Oath of Allegiance one summer day back in 1994. The woman behind me reflected the consensus. \u201cOf course!\u201d she forcefully declared to general approval, in the event of another military draft she would send her children back to the Caribbean \u2014 which she could do precisely because they all were retaining their original citizenship. While waiting to \u201cswear allegiance\u201d! With court officers all around! \\nThen the judge arrived. He swore us in and told us we were now as good Americans as anyone whose family had been here 10 generations (translation: you don`t have to assimilate), and that the United States still had a major problem: racism (i.e., vote Democratic). Obviously my Caribbean friend knew something I didn`t. \\nIntimate contact with the immigration process is one reason we immigrants usually are so much less romantic about immigration than are American intellectuals and policy wonks.'"}, "time": 1742563477.151071}
