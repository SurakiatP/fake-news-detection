A pub owner and longtime fixture on the gay scene, she rose to mainstream fame the year before the vote when her male alter ego, Rory O\u2019Neill, was sued for criticizing a group of activists on TV for their views on homosexuality. The lawsuit sparked a national outcry known as \u201cPantigate. \u201d During the controversy, Panti made a speech about homophobia that became a viral video sensation and turned her into a symbol of the gay rights movement in Ireland. The eventual success of the campaign for   marriage seemed to cement her celebrated status. That was a year and a half ago. For many activists  \u2014   or drag queens  \u2014   the story might have ended there, capped off by cheering crowds chanting her name at Dublin Castle when the results of the marriage referendum were announced. But Panti\u2019s cultural footprint has expanded ever since. \u201cHe has a radio show, the theater show, he\u2019s absolutely unstoppable,\u201d Conor Horgan, a filmmaker who directed a documentary about Mr. O\u2019Neill. \u201cPanti\u2019s brand is a movable feast. \u201d Mr. Horgan\u2019s film received critical acclaim in Ireland and Britain in 2015 and made its New York premiere last weekend at the Irish Screen America film festival. It traces the last three decades of Ireland\u2019s gay history through Mr. O\u2019Neill\u2019s life story. \u201cAs my mother would say, it\u2019s quite the turn up for the books,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said over lunch in New York. \u201cIf you\u2019d said it to me 10 years ago, I would have looked at you. It\u2019s pretty wild how queer Ireland has become. \u201d Panti is not alone. In recent years, a host of prominent Irish people have come out, including Maria Walsh, the winner of the Rose of Tralee, an Irish beauty pageant, Pat Carey, a former government minister, and Leo Varadkar, a young politician widely seen as a possible future prime minister. For Mr. O\u2019Neill, becoming a symbol of modern Ireland has had its perks beyond the film, which is now playing in American film festivals. He has traveled the world as Panti, performing a   show to   houses in New York, London and Sydney. (He is in two separate shows that are in talks for a North America run.) He also released a memoir in 2014. Panti has interviewed scientists about the meaning of life for her new national radio show, and she even addressed the country last December for a \u201cQueen\u2019s Christmas Message. \u201d It was a cheeky take on a British tradition, with a towering blonde drag queen earnestly praising the nation for its changing attitudes. Those changes reach beyond   marriage. Ireland\u2019s embrace of gay rights has inspired a new generation of progressive activism on issues like abortion access, said Ailbhe Smyth, who has long campaigned for both causes. Abortion is severely restricted by the eighth amendment to Ireland\u2019s constitution, and has been the subject of multiple referendums since 1983. Many young political activists who came of age during Pantigate and the gay marriage campaign are pushing for another referendum. Ms. Smyth called them \u201ca cadre of people who know how to do things on the ground. \u201d \u201cThe victory in the \u2018Yes Equality\u2019 campaign further opened up the path for   change in Ireland. People say \u2018we can do this, we won this,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cYou get that momentum and dynamism, that sense of optimism that flows from a victory. \u201d Panti Bliss was a leader in Ireland\u2019s gay scene for more than two decades, an H. I. V.  drag queen who hosted \u201cThe Alternative Miss Ireland\u201d pageant for 18 years and mentored a generation of younger performers. Una Mullally, a columnist for The Irish Times, said she was not the first figure in Irish history who, at first glance, seemed like an unlikely icon. \u201cWe hold our outsiders up to become Irish heroes, whether that\u2019s people who were queer, like Oscar Wilde, or intellectual, like Beckett, or who hated Dublin, like Joyce,\u201d Ms. Mullally said. \u201cPanti is in that lineage in a way. Despite our social conservatism there is a sense of devilment among Irish people. \u201d In New York, Mr. O\u2019Neill said he sometimes felt conflicted about his success. The New York premiere of his film was attended by Irish diplomats and Melissa   the speaker of the New York City Council, who hailed him as \u201ca catalyst for change\u201d in a speech. It was a far cry from his roots in the night life of the late 1980s, when he became a drag queen because it was \u201cunderground and transgressive and discombobulating,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s inherently punk,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWhich is then odd for me to suddenly be an establishment figure. \u201d He said his performances and activism have always been devoted to expanding the idea of Irishness to include the marginalized, like migrants, religious minorities or L. G. B. T. people. He calls it \u201cqueering the Irish space. \u201d Did he think it was working? The question drew a laugh. \u201cMaybe too well!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563341.093732}
