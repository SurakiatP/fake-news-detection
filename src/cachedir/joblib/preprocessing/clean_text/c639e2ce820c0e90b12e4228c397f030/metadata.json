Cannabis retailers \u2014 and one council member \u2014 immediately questioned the proposal, saying that the math doesn\u2019t make much sense. \\n\u201cSo what justified the increase other than the fact that we can do it?\u201d asked District 2 Councilmember Bruce Harrell, citing Mayor Ed Murray\u2019s more modest proposal for a $500 increase. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a cost analysis that actually reflects (the increase)? It seems like we\u2019ve exceeded it quite significantly.\u201d \\nThe city\u2019s Finance and Administrative Services department defended the cost, saying that even with the mayor\u2019s proposed increase, the licensing fee falls $430,000 short of the city\u2019s cost to regulate pot. The finance department projected that pot retailers will cost the city more than $700,000 next year. \\nPot growers and retailers wondered why this industry, from a license fee standpoint, must pay for its regulation in a way that other businesses, such as pawn shops and strip clubs, do not. Moreover, the city finance estimate misses a key point, said KC Franks, owner of Stash pot shops. \u201cWhat about the $2 million in new sales taxes to the city?\u201d Franks asked. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t their math reflect that?\u201d Seattle Council Tax-Raising-Advocate Tim Burgess \\nBurgess, who said he has no independent confirmation of the sales tax figures, conceded that the pot retailers have, \u201craised some legitimate objections, so I\u2019m sure we are going to look at all of that.\u201d \\nBut, he added, the pot issue speaks to a larger policy discussion about how cities pay for the cost of regulating local businesses. Typically, he said, a city uses a blend of licensing fees and taxes to get the money for necessary inspections and enforcement. Pot, he said, costs Seattle about $1 million a year to regulate, an amount which he characterized as a big burden. \u201cThis proposal was made to try to offset some of those costs,\u201d he said \\nBurgess said the licensing fee likely will go up, but he is not sure if the full council will support his proposed increase. The measure, as it is or modified, could come to a vote next week. \\nFranks and other marijuana retailers characterized the proposal as a simple cash grab directed at an industry without much political clout \u2013 or as much money as people seem to think. Philip Dawdy, of the Have a Heart pot shop, wondered why an industry that is a net contributor to city coffers doesn\u2019t have more council support? \\nWhen the city raised business license fees to help pay for more police, he said, they consulted retail business organizations first. The pot fee, he said, was a complete blindside. \u201cWe are actually helping to balance the city\u2019s budget thanks to sales taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are we not someone\u2019s priority?\u201d \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742561879.375248}
