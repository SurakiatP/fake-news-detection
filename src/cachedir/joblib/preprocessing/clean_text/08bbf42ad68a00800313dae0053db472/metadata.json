[Malone was stressing that \u201crespect\u201d is a key part of gun ownership that respecting firearms is part of using them properly and safely. He then spoke more broadly and suggested that more respect is needed in all of American life.  He said, \u201cWhoever it is, like him or don\u2019t like him, but respect the White House. Respect the President of the United States. \u201d Malone then addressed the way people were bothered by some of Trump\u2019s language or statements on the campaign trail, but he said the sum of a man is more than the language he uses in a moment or the statement he makes on a given topic. He stressed that people have to have enough respect to take time and get to know the man. He spoke to the people who persist in saying \u201cDonald Trump\u201d as a way to ignore the office that Trump won on November 8, saying, \u201cCall him what he is \u2014  he is the President of the United States. \u201d Malone added, \u201cAnd I tell everyone out there that wants to protest and do all that, other countries are laughing. We are a laughingstock. Respect the White House. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
