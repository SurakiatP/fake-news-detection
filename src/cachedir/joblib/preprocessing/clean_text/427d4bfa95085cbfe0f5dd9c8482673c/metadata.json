The Royal Navy deployed destroyers to, in Fallon\u2019s words, \u201c man-mark \u201d the vessels while the RAF overflew the ships with fighter jets. \\nAccording to the Russian military, the naval group\u2019s task was to \u201c ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the world\u2019s oceans, \u201d as well as \u201c the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities \u201d of Russia. \\nBritain\u2019s deployment of troops, drones and aircraft is expected to begin in May 2018.
