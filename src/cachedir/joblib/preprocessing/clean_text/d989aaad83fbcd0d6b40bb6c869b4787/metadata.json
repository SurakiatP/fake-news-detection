What is the fundamental role as a journalist, for us to do?\u201d remarked Griffiths in one of the recordings. \u201cTell a story. Tell what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a secondary corollary to that, right? Aid the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. To a degree, right?\u201d  \u201cIs that not part of the traditional role of a journalist? It\u2019s actually one of the things I can be most proud of as a journalist,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know we try to show the ugly side of humanity so we can do something about it. It\u2019s hard, very hard. \u201d The released tapes also reveal CNN\u2019s \u201cmisrepresentation of polling data\u201d and the news outlet\u2019s disdain for conservative media. 119 hours of audio data have so far been released with over 100 more hours reportedly to come. Recorded in 2009 at CNN\u2019s Atlanta HQ, the audio clips feature numerous employees including Joe Sterling, Arthur Brice, and Nicky Robertson. Project Veritas made a call for leaked information, offering $10, 000 to anyone else \u201cthat exposes media malfeasance. \u201d \u201cProject Veritas is determined to expose malfeasance, corruption and wrongdoing,\u201d declared Project Veritas founder James O\u2019Keefe. \u201cWe want to become a destination where citizen journalists can come forward, work with us and make a real impact. That\u2019s why today, we\u2019re announcing a $10, 000 award for anyone that comes forward with legally obtained materials exposing media malfeasance.  If you have hidden audio recordings, video tapes or documents inside of a news room or media institution \u2014  and the material is good enough \u2014  I will pay you $10, 000. \u201d In a comment to Breitbart Tech, O\u2019Keefe spoke of his concern at the growing leftist bias of social media companies and warned that Project Veritas would investigate them too. \u201cYes we know about it, we\u2019re concerned about it, we\u2019re fighting it,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe. \u201c[CNN Leaks] is the first in a long effort to target and expose abuse within the media, and that includes social media  \u2026     Who knows? Maybe we have someone inside with a camera right now, recording everything. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
