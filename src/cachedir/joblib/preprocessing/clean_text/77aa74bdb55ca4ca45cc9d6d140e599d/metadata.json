[It\u2019s unclear from Flake\u2019s report why the National Institute of Health granted Brown University such a significant amount of funding to study to the behaviors of students in fraternities. According the report, the $5 million was used for to determine if frat boys drink, smoke, and party more than their peers.  Studies on the habits of college students funded with $5 million of NIH grants found fraternity brothers drink, smoke and generally party more than other students. They also sleep in later, which led the researchers to speculate \u201cone explanation for this finding is that Greeks students recognize their sleep needs. \u201d Perhaps a more likely reason is that they are sleeping off their party lifestyle. Flake concludes that substance abuse amongst college students is a serious problem, but that the research conducted with state funding didn\u2019t provide any information about fraternity life that wasn\u2019t already common knowledge. Substance abuse is a very serious problem, especially among college students involved in Greek life, that deserves thoughtful attention. The studies highlighted here are not finding solutions to   problems, but simply retelling what is already widely known about Greek life. As they say at the frat house, \u201ccool story, bro. \u201d The report on the Brown study was a part of Flake\u2019s annual report that chronicle 50 cases of government fraud, abuse, and waste. Other instances of waste included nearly $2 million of government funds that was designated for the development of a comedy club that would feature holographic performers.'"}, "time": 1742628580.652399}
