Credit: UK Progressive \\nIn what some are calling a \u201chilliarious\u201d typo, Hillary Clinton\u2019s name was misspelled to represent what many people think of her as: a liar. Though it has been waved off as an accident, the ballot spelled her name \u201cHilliary\u201d Clinton and some are upset by the handling of this situation in Lonoke County, Arkansas. \\nJerry Shepard, the Republican chairman of the Lonoke County Election Commission, has said that they were not made aware of the typo until voting began. As a Republican, there would be an incentive to put in this last comical comment about Clinton\u2019s lack of trustworthiness, but even the Democratic chairman for the county\u2019s commission has said that there was no intention to defame her name. Credit: NBC News \\nMany are not convinced, as the ballots are checked thoroughly and repeatedly for typos, misprints, and incorrect information before being sent out by mail and to polling places. The misspelling of a major presidential candidate\u2019s name would not easily make it through unnoticed. \\nThough Arkansas is largely Republican, there are still Democratic voters in the state who were upset with this alleged typo. One disgruntled voter in Lonoke County took to Facebook to express their experience with trying to report the mistake: \\n\u201cI would like to believe that they did not do this on purpose because I think it was just a spelling error. However, I did contact the clerk\u2019s office and told them of this error and they told me that they are blowing it off because they don\u2019t expect people in Lonoke county to vote for Hillary Clinton. \\n\u201cWhoever I spoke to they were rude and they just laughed off my complaint so I decided to call the Arkansas Secretary of State\u2019s office. They took my complaint and forwarded me to the Arkansas Election Commission, where I filed an official complaint on the Lonoke County Clerk\u2019s office.\u201d \\nSpelling Hillary\u2019s name wrong does not affect citizens\u2019 ability to vote for her, but it\u2019s the lack of care that has people questioning whether this was really a mistake. If something similar had been done to Donald Trump\u2019s name, his supporters would be outraged and attribute it to Clinton\u2019s rigging of the election. \\nThe fact that people aren\u2019t more upset at this typo might be evidence of her reputation as a liar in a number of situations. If her email scandal hadn\u2019t discouraged some people from voting for her, then her history of constantly lying and changing her mind on key issues might. Though the typo was completely uncalled for and unnecessary, some might argue that it wasn\u2019t exactly incorrect. \\nDo you believe that this typo was a mistake?
