Democrats and voting rights advocates hailed the ruling as a significant victory in one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched voting rights cases. It was the fourth time in nearly four years that a federal court found that the Texas law discriminated against or disproportionately affected black and Hispanic voters. \u201cThe court got it right, recognizing the stink of discrimination,\u201d said Trey Martinez Fischer, a state representative who is the chairman of the   Legislative Caucus, one of several minority groups, voters and Democratic lawmakers who sued Texas over the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, found that the law had a discriminatory effect on blacks and Latinos, who often lack the forms of identification required under the Texas law. But the ruling did not strike down the law entirely, ruling instead that new procedures must be found to assist potential voters lacking the required identification. The ruling also sent back for reconsideration the question of whether Texas legislators had acted with a discriminatory purpose in passing the law in 2011, a finding that would have forced new judicial oversight of any changes in Texas election rules. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who defended the voter ID law against legal challenges when he was the state\u2019s attorney general, said the court had come to the wrong conclusion. Republican lawmakers have long defended the law, saying it is needed to prevent voter fraud. \u201cVoter fraud is real, and it undermines the integrity of the election process,\u201d Mr. Abbott said in a statement. \u201cTexas will continue to make sure there is no illegal voting at the ballot box. \u201d Passed by the   Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, the law took effect in 2013. It requires voters to present one of several forms of   identification, including a driver\u2019s license, passport, military ID card or   license. A lower court judge found that about 608, 000 registered voters in Texas lacked the types of identification required by the law, and that a disproportionate number were black or Hispanic. The judge based that finding on testimony and data presented by experts during a 2014 trial in Corpus Christi. Texas\u2019 lawyers disputed that figure. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit asked a lower court judge to come up with a remedy that \u201cdisrupts voter identification rules for the 2016 election season as little as possible, yet eliminates\u201d the law\u2019s discriminatory effect on minority voters. One possible solution, the court noted, would be to allow   cards to be used as identification. The court also instructed the judge to   the evidence about whether the Texas Legislature intentionally discriminated against blacks and Hispanics, but encouraged the judge to wait until after the November election. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement that the state had a duty to safeguard elections. \u201cPreventing voter fraud is essential to accurately reflecting the will of Texas voters during elections, and it is unfortunate that this   law, providing protections against fraud, was not upheld in its entirety,\u201d Mr. Paxton said. Asked if the state would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paxton, Kayleigh Lovvorn, replied, \u201cWe are evaluating all of our options right now. \u201d Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, called the decision on Wednesday \u201chuge in a symbolic way\u201d for voting rights across the country. Since the Supreme Court weakened the federal Voting Rights Act in 2013, he noted, several states have been \u201cratcheting up\u201d their voter ID requirements. What the Fifth Circuit  \u2014   known as perhaps the country\u2019s most conservative appeals court  \u2014   has ruled is that \u201cyou can go too far with a voter ID law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Texas had been allowed to do what it\u2019s been trying to do, that would be a green light for other states to try something similar,\u201d Professor Hasen said. But he added that the plaintiffs\u2019 victory was not as great as it would have been if the court had struck down the law. Myrna P\u00e9rez, the deputy director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which helped argue the plaintiffs\u2019 case, called the ruling a \u201cbig victory. \u201d \u201cThe court said the law is discriminatory and needs to be fixed,\u2019\u2019 she said.'"}, "time": 1742564609.942218}
