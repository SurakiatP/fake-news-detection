Georgetown\u2019s president, John J. DeGioia, who announced the measures in a speech on Thursday afternoon, said he would offer a formal apology, create an institute for the study of slavery and erect a public memorial to the slaves whose labor benefited the institution, including those who were sold in 1838 to help keep the university afloat. In addition, two campus buildings will be renamed  \u2014   one for an enslaved   man and the other for an   educator who belonged to a Catholic religious order. So far, Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plan does not include a provision for offering scholarships to descendants, a possibility that was raised by a university committee whose recommendations were released on Thursday morning. The committee, however, stopped short of calling on the university to provide such financial assistance, as well as admissions preference. Dr. DeGioia\u2019s decision to offer an advantage in admissions to descendants, similar to that offered to the children and grandchildren of alumni, is unprecedented, historians say. The preference will be offered to the descendants of all the slaves whose labor benefited Georgetown, not just the men, women and children sold in 1838. More than a dozen universities  \u2014   including Brown, Harvard and the University of Virginia  \u2014   have publicly recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. But Craig Steven Wilder and Alfred L. Brophy, two historians who have studied universities and slavery, said they knew of none that had offered preferential status in admissions to the descendants of slaves. Professor Wilder, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plans to address Georgetown\u2019s history go beyond any initiatives enacted by a university in the past 10 years. \u201cIt goes farther than just about any institution,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s to Georgetown\u2019s credit. It\u2019s taking steps that a lot of universities have been reluctant to take. \u201d But whether the initiatives result in meaningful change remains to be seen, he said. Professor Wilder cautioned that the significance of the preferential status in admissions would rest heavily on the degree to which Georgetown invested in outreach to descendants, including identifying them, making sure they are aware of the benefit\u2019s existence and actively recruiting them to the university. \u201cThe question of how effective or meaningful this is going to be will only be answered over time,\u201d Professor Wilder said. Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plan, which builds on the recommendations of the committee that he convened last year, represents the university\u2019s first systematic effort to address its roots in slavery. Georgetown, which was founded and run by Jesuit priests in 1789, relied on the Jesuit plantations in Maryland  \u2014   and the sale of produce and slaves  \u2014   to finance its operations. The 1838 sale, worth about $3. 3 million in today\u2019s dollars, was organized by two of Georgetown\u2019s early presidents, both Jesuits. A portion of the profit, about $500, 000, was used to help pay off Georgetown\u2019s debts at a time when the college was struggling financially. The slaves were uprooted from the Maryland plantations and shipped to estates in Louisiana. Dr. DeGioia said he planned to apologize for the wrongs of the past \u201cwithin the framework of the Catholic tradition,\u201d by offering what he described as a Mass of reconciliation in partnership with the Jesuit leadership in the United States and the Archdiocese of Washington. \u201cThis community participated in the institution of slavery,\u2019\u2019 Dr. DeGioia said, addressing a crowd of hundreds of students, faculty members and descendants at Georgetown\u2019s Gaston Hall. \u201cThis original evil that shaped the early years of the Republic was present here. We have been able to hide from this truth, bury this truth, ignore and deny this truth. \u201d \u201cAs a community and as individuals, we cannot do our best work if we refuse to take ownership of such a critical part of our history,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe must acknowledge it. \u201d When Dr. DeGioia invited questions from the audience, a man in a gray suit took the microphone. \u201cMy name is Joe Stewart,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cand I am a descendant of the 272. \u201d Mr. Stewart, a retired corporate executive and an organizer of a group of more than 300 descendants, expressed gratitude to the university\u2019s working group on slavery and to Dr. DeGioia for their efforts. But he said that descendants, who had not been included as members of the committee, must be involved in decision making on these initiatives moving forward. \u201cOur attitude is nothing about us, without us,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Stewart, who was flanked by five other descendants. The two buildings being renamed by university officials originally paid tribute to the Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry, the college presidents involved in the 1838 sale. Now one will be called Isaac Hall to commemorate the life of Isaac Hawkins, one of the slaves shipped to Louisiana in 1838, and the other Anne Marie Becraft Hall, in honor of a   educator who founded a school for black girls in Washington. Dr. DeGioia assembled his working group of scholars, administrators, students and alumni last September, asking them to consider how the university should address its history. Their work took on greater urgency in November in the wake of student demonstrations. In April, The New York Times published an article tracing the life of one of the slaves, Cornelius Hawkins, and his   descendants. Cornelius was the grandson of Isaac Hawkins. In its   report, the committee said that the university\u2019s dependence on slavery was deeper and broader than originally believed. Slave labor and slave sales were envisioned as part of the financing model of the college even before the doors opened in 1789. And slaves were not only forced to work on the Jesuit plantations. Some also toiled on campus, hired from students and other wealthy people. The committee said that it was likely that all of the earliest buildings on campus  \u2014   including the ones named for the university leaders who orchestrated the 1838 sale  \u2014   were built with slave labor. More historical research needs to be done, the committee said, and that will be coordinated by the new research center, the Institute for the Study of Slavery and its Legacies. The university has already selected the program director for the institute, which will also support Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plans to deepen engagement with descendants of the enslaved. Dr. DeGioia, who met with dozens of descendants this summer, plans to establish a new committee for the creation of the public memorial that will include descendants. He also plans, among other efforts, to provide descendants with access to genealogical information housed in the university\u2019s archives. \u201cAll of these will have a substantial financial impact,\u201d said Dr. DeGioia, who believes that Georgetown\u2019s philanthropic community will support his initiatives. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that will not be a constraint. \u201d But some descendants on Thursday expressed disappointment, saying that the university\u2019s measures were inadequate, given the suffering that their ancestors endured. Karran Harper Royal, a descendant of slaves sold in 1838, said that Georgetown, which has an endowment of $1. 45 billion, should have offered scholarships to descendants. And she said that she and others \u201cfelt the sting\u201d of not being formally invited to Dr. DeGioia\u2019s speech. \u201cIt has to go much farther,\u201d said Ms. Harper Royal, who is also an organizer of the group of descendants. \u201cThey\u2019re calling us family. Well, I\u2019m from New Orleans and when we have a gathering, family\u2019s invited. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628417.0416636}
