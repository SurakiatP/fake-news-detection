But the record will show that the play that sent the Toronto Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series on Sunday was scored as an error against the most notorious member of the Texas Rangers. Second baseman Rougned Odor, who punched the Blue Jays\u2019 Jose Bautista in the jaw in May, made a wild throw while trying to turn a double play in the bottom of the 10th inning at Rogers Centre in Game 3 of this division series. Josh Donaldson, who had led off with a double, slid headfirst into home to complete a   victory and a     sweep. Odor\u2019s error was the first in baseball history to end a postseason series. \u201cI threw it a little bit to the side,\u201d he said. \u201cI pulled the ball a little bit. I tried to do my best, and that\u2019s it. I had a chance at first. If it was a good throw, we can make the double play. \u201d Toronto returns to the A. L. C. S. after having lost in six games to the Kansas City Royals last fall. The series starts Friday in Boston or Cleveland the Indians can eliminate the Red Sox at Fenway Park on Monday to finish a sweep of that series. The Blue Jays emphatically stomped the Rangers, who had the A. L.\u2019s best record but fell to Toronto in the division series for the second year in a row. The Rangers hit . 204 and posted a 6. 18 earned run average. \u201cWe got cold at the worst moment,\u201d said Adrian Beltre, the veteran Texas third baseman. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a team that got hot, and we couldn\u2019t find a way to beat them. \u201d Bautista  \u2014   whose bat flip in last year\u2019s division series angered the Rangers  \u2014   had a chance to win the series against Matt Bush, the reliever who plunked him in May before Bautista\u2019s hard slide led to Odor\u2019s punch. But after Donaldson\u2019s double and an intentional walk to Edwin Encarnacion, Bush struck out Bautista to bring up Russell Martin. Martin saw eight pitches, all fastballs from 97 to 99 miles per hour. After two   fouls, he lashed a grounder to the shortstop hole, where Elvis Andrus backhanded it and flipped it to Odor, who was covering second base. Encarnacion slid into second, but Odor said that did not affect him. Still, he fired a   throw into the dirt that pulled Mitch Moreland off first base. The ball skipped off the glove of Moreland, who scrambled to pick it up and fling it home, but too late. \u201cIf it gets past me, we have no shot,\u201d Moreland said. \u201cI knew I had to knock it down and try to keep it close. It just got a little too far from me. \u201d Moreland said that if the ball had stayed in his glove, or fallen right at his feet, he doubted that Donaldson would have even tried for home. But when the ball got away, the   Moreland had to set his feet as he gathered it, emboldening Donaldson to make his dash. \u201cWhat\u2019s kind of crazy is, I played against Mitch Moreland for a long time and played against him in college as well,\u201d said Donaldson, who attended Auburn when Moreland played for Mississippi State. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t one of those situations where I was just wheeling around third to score, because I respect Mitch\u2019s arm. For me, the deciding factor was once I saw the ball get away from him, I felt like I had to take a chance. That situation in the game, if he ends up throwing me out, making a great play, you kind of have to tip your cap to him. But I\u2019m banking on the fact that I\u2019m going to make it more times than not. \u201d The Rangers\u2019 last hope was a replay review to examine whether Encarnacion\u2019s slide could be considered interference. Although the Blue Jays paused their reveling for a moment, the umpire crew chief, Joe West, soon removed his headset and gently signaled safe. \u201cIt was a little bit of a buzzkill,\u201d Martin said, but the Blue Jays were not complaining. Just five days after celebrating a thriller against Baltimore in the   game  \u2014   which was won on an Encarnacion homer in the 11th  \u2014   the Blue Jays partied in their clubhouse again. Toronto did not secure a   berth until the final day of the regular season, struggling at times with inconsistent offense despite a sturdy pitching staff. But the team has won six games in a row to clinch a playoff spot and advance through two rounds. The Blue Jays mauled the Rangers\u2019 star pitchers, Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish, to win the first two games by a combined  . \u201cEven when people around them doubted, the belief was here  \u2014   we\u2019re going to play well and we\u2019re going to be a championship team,\u201d said Mark Shapiro, the Blue Jays\u2019 president and chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve had isolated moments, but this is probably the best baseball we\u2019ve played all year  \u2014   at the right time. \u201d There was no misbehavior on Sunday, no beanballs or punches or beer cans flung from the stands. After a fan just missed hitting Orioles outfielder Hyun Soo Kim with a beer can on Tuesday, the Blue Jays announced they would serve beer only in plastic cups for the rest of the postseason. And the teams made good on their promise to leave behind their tense history and play clean. \u201cWe kind of put our emotions aside and played good baseball,\u201d Martin said. Some Rangers fans chanted Odor\u2019s name at Bautista when he batted at their park, and most Blue Jays fans vigorously booed Odor whenever he was announced Sunday. But Odor said that did not bother him. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing like this in my country,\u201d said Odor, who has played winter ball in his native Venezuela. \u201cWe have really good fans in Venezuela and I play with one of the best teams in Venezuela. It\u2019s always a lot of people, a lot of crowds. I\u2019ve been in that situation before. \u201d The Rangers have been in this situation before, too, hurting themselves in a   playoff game in Toronto. Last year while leading in the seventh inning of the decisive fifth game, Texas fell apart thanks to two errors by Andrus and another by Moreland. Andrus, 28 and also from Venezuela, said he consoled Odor, who is 22, after the game. Odor said he appreciated the support. \u201cI was the one making errors last year,\u201d Andrus said. \u201cI know how it feels. It\u2019s the worst feeling ever. But we still have a lot of years in our career. Sooner or later, we\u2019re going to be back in the playoffs, and hopefully we can go deeper. \u201d The Rangers made other mistakes in Game 3: Two misplaced sliders by Colby Lewis turned into homers for Encarnacion and Martin in the first inning, and a passed ball by catcher Jonathan Lucroy brought in the tying run in the sixth. Texas briefly held two leads, and Andrus and Odor homered off Aaron Sanchez, who gave up six runs and walked four over five and   innings. But the Rangers were nearly helpless against the Blue Jays\u2019 bullpen. Moreland greeted Joe Biagini with a double in the sixth, but Biagini and three others retired the final 13 Texas hitters. Roberto Osuna worked the last two innings for Toronto, earning the victory after securing a   save in Game 2. Now Osuna and his teammates get four days to rest before the A. L. C. S. Donaldson has been playing hurt, without disclosing the injury. It is safe to say he felt just fine diving into the next round. \u201cWhen you have 50, 000 fans screaming,\u201d Donaldson said, \u201cit kind of numbs the pain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564120.4237816}
