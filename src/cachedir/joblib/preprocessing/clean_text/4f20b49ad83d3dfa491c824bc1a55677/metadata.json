Facing off for the first time in a   debate that stretched for three and a half hours, Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Macron offered the starkest of contrasts, with the National Front leader providing a dark picture of a France besieged by immigrants and Islam, and her rival preaching conciliation. The debate also included the three other main contenders  \u2014   the Socialist Beno\u00eet Hamon, the Republicans\u2019 Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, and the   candidate   M\u00e9lenchon  \u2014   but it was the fight between Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen that riveted attention. Mr. Macron, a former economy minister who founded a  political movement centered on   France\u2019s stagnant economy, but who has never held an elected office, appeared flustered at times as Ms. Le Pen displayed a mocking smile. The first round of voting in the presidential election will be on April 23, and the top two candidates will advance to the second round on May 7. Opinion polls show that Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are the most likely to make it to that runoff  \u2014   a result that would be a stunning rebuke for France\u2019s two main political parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Ms. Le Pen, inheritor of the   populist National Front party from her father, concentrated her fire Monday night on her younger opponent. Mr. Macron, 39, has advanced more by offering a fresh face than by political savvy, and Ms. Le Pen, 48, sought to exploit his vulnerability, forcing him to define himself in opposition to her strident positions. She accused Mr. Macron of supporting the \u201cburkini,\u201d the   swimsuit at the center of a rancorous debate last summer over displays of the Muslim faith. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Islamists in our country,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cThe demands are incessant,\u201d she said, citing food and clothing. An unsettled Mr. Macron shot back: \u201cI\u2019m not putting words in your mouth. I don\u2019t need a ventriloquist. \u201d \u201cThe trap you are falling into, Madame Le Pen, with your provocations, is to divide society,\u201d he said, adding that she was making \u201cenemies out of more than four million French men and women whose religion happens to be Islam. \u201d The other three candidates present Monday night tried to get shots in at the two  . Mr. Fillon was once favored to win the election, but he has been wounded by a series of scandals, most notably charges of embezzlement over allegations that he put family members on the government payroll for nonexistent jobs. He sought during the debate to project a reassuring image of gravity, but he was forced to acknowledge that he \u201cmight have made some mistakes. \u201d Most recently, he was accused of accepting two suits worth 13, 000 euros, or about $14, 000, from a political fixer. That has left Mr. Fillon vulnerable to sly insinuations about his ethics. Mr. Hamon, for instance, pointedly described himself as someone who would be \u201can honest and fair president,\u201d free from the influence of \u201cmoney and lobbies. \u201d Mr. Hamon, the Socialist candidate, has promised a guaranteed \u201cuniversal income\u201d and has spoken of cutting the already reduced French workweek, but his chances are thought to be lowered by the presence of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, whose positions are largely similar. Ms. Le Pen, who also faces accusations related to fictional jobs, accused Mr. M\u00e9lenchon of being a \u201cRobespierre\u201d when he called on voters to \u201creward the virtuous and punish those who don\u2019t seem so. \u201d Mr. Macron, for his part, projected an image of innocence and virtue, and Ms. Le Pen aimed directly for it, with the most savage blast of the evening aimed at his reputation for speaking at length but saying little. After a windy declaration by Mr. Macron on protecting France\u2019s \u201cindependence,\u201d Ms. Le Pen, whose campaign is centered on a withdrawal from the European Union, mockingly repeated the word before firing back. \u201cYou\u2019ve spoken for seven minutes, and I have no idea what you said,\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything. Every time you talk, you take a little of this, and a little of that, and you never settle on anything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628317.2910104}
