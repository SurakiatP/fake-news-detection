In an email, the lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said Ms. Trump, the wife of Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, \u201chas placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an \u2018escort\u2019 in the 1990s. \u201d \u201cAll such statements are 100 percent false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful,\u201d Mr. Harder added. \u201cShe understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency. \u201d He said no suit had been filed, but added, \u201cThat may change. \u201d The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Harder represented the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan in the    lawsuit against Gawker Media that ultimately resulted in Gawker\u2019s filing for bankruptcy. Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur who spoke in July at the Republican National Convention, acknowledged in May that he had secretly funded the Hogan case and others against Gawker. Among the news outlets that Mr. Harder said had been sent notices were Inquisitr (which apologized to Ms. Trump and retracted an article about her that was published within the last week) Politico and Liberal America. Politico declined to comment. Reached by telephone, Tiffany Willis, the founder and editor in chief of Liberal America, said her publication received an emailed letter from Mr. Harder. In the email, a copy of which is posted on the publication\u2019s website, Mr. Harder listed several statements he claimed were defamatory and demanded that the publication \u201cimmediately and permanently remove each of these statements from the story, and print a full and complete retraction and apology, with as prominent placement as the original story. \u201d \u201cFailure to do so,\u201d Mr. Harder added, \u201cwill leave my client with no alternative but to institute immediate legal proceedings against you and, should that occur, she would pursue all available causes of action and seek all available legal remedies to the maximum extent permitted by law. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564169.8087485}
