[After a brutal cycling accident left Bill Kochevar completely paralyzed below the shoulders, he spent eight years without the ability to perform the most basic daily tasks for himself. But Dr. Bob Kirsch and his team of researchers at Case Western Reserve University have given Bill  \u2014   and others like him  \u2014   hope with the results of a new trial.  The trials were part of the \u201cBrainGate2\u201d project, which is focused on improving the lives of paralysis victims using   interfaces.  Before 36 electrodes could be placed into Kochevar\u2019s arms, he first had to learn to operate a virtual hand with the two   electrodes planted in his brain. Those electrodes act as substitute nerve centers, using neuron activity to record signals to manipulate muscle. It took four months of hard work to prepare him for his victory. Kochevar, with the assistance of another   support system, was able to lift a cup and drink from a straw on his own. He was also able to feed himself forkfuls of mashed potatoes. And while that may not seem like much to most people, it\u2019s a   change for someone whose body doesn\u2019t obey even the most elementary commands. Kochevar said that it was \u201cbetter than [he] thought it would be,\u201d and that \u201cfor somebody who\u2019s been injured eight years and couldn\u2019t move, being able to move just that little bit is awesome to me. \u201d He didn\u2019t even have to \u201creally concentrate hard on it,\u201d which speaks volumes about the success in and of itself. Dr. Kirsch said that BrainGate2 is \u201creally breaking ground for the spinal cord injury community,\u201d as \u201ca major step toward restoring some independence. \u201d They are currently holding various trials at Massachusetts General Hospital, Providence Virginia Medical Center, and Stanford University in addition to Case Western Reserve. Their goal is to \u201cprovide natural, intuitive,   control of assistive devices\u201d with their groundbreaking   implants. For people like Bill Kochevar, they\u2019re just heroes.
