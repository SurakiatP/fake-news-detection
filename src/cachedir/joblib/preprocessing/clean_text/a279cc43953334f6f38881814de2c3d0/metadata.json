With Barack Obama halfway out the door and Clinton all but crowned, Washington\u2019s laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half-measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand.

But while differing on the details, all agree something must be done. The time to act is now. \\nAs Vox puts it: \u201cThe hot new policy idea in Washington is the hottest old idea: direct US military intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war.\u201d \\nBut reading between the lines, a very different picture emerges, a realization that the U.S. has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all. Thus, the Times observes that while the Middle East is clamoring for U.S. leadership, it is not clamoring for Bush-style intervention but for some mythical \u201cmiddle ground\u201d in between him and Obama. \\nWhile reporting that pro-escalation sentiment is unanimous in Washington\u2019s vast foreign-policy establishment \u2013 sometimes known as \u201c the blob \u201d \u2013 the Washington Post notes that \u201ceven pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the Syrian air force or punish [President Bashar al-]Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces\u201d and wonders whether a war-weary public will support any intervention at all. \\n\u201cMy concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other,\u201d it quotes one expert as saying, \u201cbut that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now.\u201d \\nOfficial Washington in a Bubble \\nThus, even the Establishment worries that it lives in a bubble. Washington wants war, it needs war, and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it can\u2019t have it. So what will it do? A heart-rending propaganda image designed to justify a major U.S. military operation inside Syria against the Syrian military. \\nThen there are the mild liberals over at Vox, the hip and successful Washington website founded by journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein. Voxers pride themselves on being sharp and practical yet in the end they are sealed off as well. The poster boy for this tendency is Zack Beauchamp, a young writer who stars in a recent Vox video entitled, \u201c The crisis in Aleppo, explained in 4 minutes .\u201d \\nAs Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics and cool background music, the video faithfully toes the Washington line, both the stirring gung-ho part and the downbeat refrain that inevitably follows. Thus, he describes the Syrian civil war as a \u201cstory of flip-flops,\u201d with Assad seemingly on the ropes until Iran and Russia put him back on his feet, at which point the Saudis and Qataris put the rebels back on their feet so the game can continue. \\nBut the real turning point, he says, occurred in September 2015 when Russia stepped in with airstrikes that allowed the government to besiege the Salafists in eastern Aleppo. \\n\u201cA siege,\u201d Beauchamp then explains, \u201cinvolves trapping a group of people, civilians and fighters both, inside a certain territory and denying them supplies until they can no longer fight. Assad\u2019s strategy has a vicious logic to it. When you deprive people of food and you bomb them over and over again, they\u2019re likely to give in just to make the fighting stop.\u201d \\nThe upshot, he says, is \u201ca humanitarian crisis \u2026 roughly 250,000 people trapped in the city \u2026 running dangerously low on supplies, access to clean water and medicine.\u201d So what should the U.S. do in response? The video\u2019s tone at this point turns pessimistic and then pitch black: \\n\u201cThe United States has the military power to break the siege of Aleppo,\u201d Beauchamp says, \u201cbut doing so would be extremely dangerous. For one thing, it would need to coordinate with rebels on the ground, some of whom are extremists. For another, it means that the US would be operating in hostile air space with Russian planes.If the US were to engage with Russian planes, that could theoretically mean direct fire between two nuclear-armed superpowers, a risk that very few people in the United States are willing to take. And three, even if the US did temporarily break the siege, it would have to maintain a commitment to insure that things didn\u2019t get worse. That could mean an open-ended war. And there\u2019s no guarantee that this would make anything better, but, rather, it might just get more people killed over the long run.\u201d \\nSo U.S. options are zero: \u201cEvery diplomatic solution tried so far has failed, and failed miserably, and there\u2019s simply no economic tool that can be used to end the fighting or ease the suffering of the people inside besieged territories. There\u2019s no good answer. There\u2019s nothing that anyone has that could simply solve the crisis. It\u2019s a disaster and a disaster without any end in sight.\u201d \\nFalsehoods and Obfuscations \\nBeauchamp\u2019s explanation \u2013 which is really not an explanation at all, merely an assertion \u2013 is studded with falsehoods and obfuscations. By describing Assad\u2019s strategy as uniquely \u201cvicious,\u201d he ignores obvious parallels between the Russian air campaign in Aleppo and U.S. air assaults on Fallujah , Tikrit , and Ramadi , all in central Iraq and all largely destroyed in the course of \u201cliberating\u201d them from ISIS. U.S.-backed Syrian \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels smile as they prepare to behead a 12-year-old boy (left), whose severed head is held aloft triumphantly in a later part of the video. [Screenshot from the YouTube video] By referring to the events in Syria as a civil war, he fails to acknowledge the degree to which it is actually a foreign invasion by the U.S., Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Persian Gulf states. By repeatedly referring to the Salafists as \u201crebels\u201d \u2013 which suggests that they are Syrians rising up from within \u2013 he ignores the fact that large numbers \u2013 36,500, according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \u2013 are foreign-born.\\nWhile asserting that 250,000 people are trapped inside east Aleppo, he ignores reports that the real figure is far lower. The Guardian \u2019s Martin Chulov, for example, estimated in March 2015 that only 40,000 people remained in rebel-held areas while Vice News reported last July that \u201cmost of Aleppo\u2019s residents have fled the city. There are just a handful of civilians and rebel fighters holding on in the shattered ruins.\u201d \\nBeauchamp also implies that it is the government that has \u201ctrapped\u201d people in east Aleppo when reports in the London Independent and elsewhere indicate that Salafists are firing on anyone trying to take the government up on its offer of safe passage. While acknowledging that \u201csome\u201d fighters are \u201cextremists,\u201d he ignores the fact that the U.S. military has admitted that Al Nusra, the local branch of Al Qaeda, is firmly in charge. \\nWhen Salafists launched a short-lived offensive in east Aleppo last summer, for instance, The New York Times reported that they named it in honor of Ibrahim al-Yousef, a Muslim Brotherhood member who led a horrendous massacre of Alawite military cadets in 1979. It was indicative of how anti-Alawite sectarianism of the most bloodthirsty sort is the common denominator underlying all anti-government factions. \\nOne could go on, but the point is clear. The foreign-policy establishment has not only cut itself off from the public but, with the help of sympathetic media outlets like Vox, has cut itself off from its own intellectual history. Incapable of examining the U.S. role in the Syrian debacle in an honest and straightforward way, it can only blunder about in the dark, staggering backward or forward as circumstances dictate. Now seems to be the moment when it is poised between the two. \\nSo how will the United States respond now that Washington is preparing for a transition between Obama-style abstention and Hillary-style neo-conservatism? Here\u2019s is one reporter\u2019s modest attempt at reading the tea leaves: \\nWashington will continue to fume as the catastrophe deepens in both Syria and Iraq. As the drive to push ISIS (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, and Daesh) out of Mosul in northern Iraq degenerates into ethno-sectarian warfare among Turks, Sunni Arabs, Shi\u2018ites, and Kurds, the drive to take back Raqqa, ISIS\u2019s capital in north-central Syria will similarly falter as fighting breaks out between pro-Turkish forces and Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG. \\nThe fall of east Aleppo, which now seems to be a foregone conclusion, will drive the foreign-policy establishment to a fury. Obama may be able to hold the hawks off. But by the time he leaves office, \u201cthe blob\u201d will be in an uproar and demanding that something be done. Map of Syria. \\nWith that, Zack Beauchamp will star in another Vox video entitled, \u201cU.S. military intervention in Syria, explained in 4 minutes.\u201d In it, he\u2019ll tell how Russian atrocities in Aleppo, plus backhanded Syrian government support for ISIS, leave the U.S. no choice but to launch a swarm of cruise missiles at Syrian military facilities. \\nWhen Russian soldiers are killed, he\u2019ll try to shift blame to Vladimir Putin for stirring up trouble in the eastern Ukraine or the Baltics. He\u2019ll note that dissent is limited to a few cranky websites and far-left groups, all of which can be safely ignored since they\u2019re not part of the mainstream. Russia will then counter-attack, leading to \u2026 no one knows. \\nWhile anything can go wrong with this scenario, one thing is clear. The mood in Official Washington is the opposite of 2003 when all the \u201cexperts\u201d agreed that an invasion of Iraq would be a walk in the park. Now they\u2019re filled with trepidation. But they\u2019re still trying to talk themselves into an escalation and may succeed. If the election goes as expected, the Clinton II presidency will be an interesting one. \\nDaniel Lazare is the author of several books including The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy (Harcourt Brace).'"}, "time": 1742563364.5574222}
