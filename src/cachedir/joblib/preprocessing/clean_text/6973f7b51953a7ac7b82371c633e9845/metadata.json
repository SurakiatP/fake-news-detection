This was all while the Clinton team was hyping stories about Sanders attending fundraisers for wealthy benefactors (which, let\u2019s be honest, pales in comparison to the \u201c wealthy benefactors\u201d Hillary has in her back pocket). \\nBreitbart reported that Tina Flournoy, Bill Clinton\u2019s Chief of staff emailed the photo of Sanders sunning himself by a pool to Brian Fallon and John Podesta, two Clinton lackeys: \\nFallon\u2019s response? \u201cOMG!\u201d \\n\u201cCan we tweet?\u201d Podesta asked. \\nFallon responded \u201cI think we shd give to NY post.\u201d Flournoy added she\u2019d send more juicy details about the event, including the people who attended. \\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Fallon replied. \u201c We are on this .\u201d \\nThe entire conversation was part of the ongoing WikiLeaks document hacks of John Podesta\u2019s account. The New York Post apparently never ran with the story, but that didn\u2019t stop the Clinton camp from sending it to other people. It was published by celebrity gossip dirtbag Perez Hilton the day after the Clinton team discussed releasing it. \\n\u201cI wonder what Mike Bloomberg would think about this???\u201d wrote Hilton on his blog. \u201cBernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha\u2019s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists.\u201d \\nJust the next week, there were several stories in the media questioning Sanders for even attending the fundraiser for Harry Reid. \\n\u201cFor Sanders, campaign finance purity not always possible\u201d wrote MSNBC\u2019s Alex Seitz-Wald, citing \u201ca guest list obtained by MSNBC\u201d that included \u201cpreviously unreported are details about who exactly attended those fundraisers.\u201d \\n\u201cBernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser,\u201d wrote CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner on Monday, February 8, announcing that \u201cCNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.\u201d \\nThen both Bill and Hillary picked up on those same media stories, accusing Sanders of taking Wall Street money \u2013 the height of hypocrisy. \\n\u201cSenator Sanders took about $200,000 from Wall Street firms,\u201d Hillary Clinton said during a rally in New Hampshire on February 8. \u201cNot directly but through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. There is nothing wrong with that. It didn\u2019t change his view. Well, it didn\u2019t change my view or my vote, either.\u201d \\nBill Clinton attacked Sanders, referring directly to the CNN story and pointing out that he likely accepted money from Wall Street. \\nAnd that\u2019s how Hillary Clinton wins.
