The new law will require hiring managers to state a compensation figure upfront  \u2014   based on what an applicant\u2019s worth is to the company, rather than on what he or she made in a previous position. The bipartisan legislation, signed into law on Monday by Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, is being pushed as a model for other states, as the issue of men historically outearning women who do the same job has leapt onto the national political scene. Nationally, there have been repeated efforts to strengthen equal pay laws  \u2014   which are already on the books but tend to lack teeth  \u2014   but none have succeeded so far. Hillary Clinton has tried to make equal pay a signature issue of her campaign, while Donald J. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka praised her father for his actions on this issue when she spoke at the Republican National Convention. By barring companies from asking prospective employees how much they earned at their last jobs, Massachusetts will ensure that the historically lower wages and salaries assigned to women and minorities do not follow them for their entire careers. Companies tend to set salaries for new hires using their previous pay as a base line. \u201cI think very few businesses consciously discriminate, but they need to become aware of it,\u201d said State Senator Pat Jehlen, a Democrat and one of the bill\u2019s  . \u201cThese are things that don\u2019t just affect one job it keeps women\u2019s wages down over their entire lifetime. \u201d Federal law already prohibits   pay discrimination, but violations are hard to prove and wage gaps persist in nearly every industry. Nationally, women are paid 79 cents for every dollar that men earn, according to the United States Census Bureau. A number of factors affect that statistic, including the career fields women choose, but economists consistently find evidence of pay disparities not offset by other variables. The Massachusetts law, which will go into effect in July 2018, takes other steps as well to combat pay discrimination. Companies will not be allowed to prohibit workers from telling others how much they are paid, a move that proponents say can increase salary transparency and help employees discover disparities. And the law will require equal pay not just for workers whose jobs are alike, but also for those whose work is of \u201ccomparable character\u201d or who work in \u201ccomparable operations. \u201d Workers with more seniority will still be permitted to earn higher pay, but the law effectively broadens the definition of what is equal work. Other states have also been stepping up their protections. In May, Maryland passed a law that requires equal pay for \u201ccomparable\u201d work, and California last year enacted a law that is one of the nation\u2019s strictest, requiring employers to be able to prove that they pay workers of both genders equally for \u201csubstantially similar\u201d jobs. It, too, had the backing of important local trade groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce. And Massachusetts joins at least 12 other states that already require companies to let employees compare notes about how much they are paid. The distinguishing feature in the Massachusetts law is that job seekers will no longer be compelled to disclose their salary or wages at their current or previous jobs  \u2014   which often leaves applicants with the nagging suspicion that they might have been offered more money if the earlier figure had been higher. People will still be allowed to volunteer their salary information. \u201cThis is a sea change, and we hope it will be used as a model in other states,\u201d said Victoria A. Budson, executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and chairwoman of the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women. The law in her state, she said, \u201cwill help every single individual who applies for a job, not just women. \u201d Efforts to pass a national   law, the Paycheck Fairness Act, have been repeatedly blocked by congressional Republicans. Opponents, including the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful business lobbying group, say that such laws would increase litigation and unfairly restrict employers\u2019 compensation decisions. But proponents of equal pay laws say that attitudes are shifting among businesses. In Massachusetts, for instance, the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce was an early and enthusiastic backer. \u201cThat really set the tone,\u201d said State Representative Ellen Story, a Democrat and   of the bill. \u201cNow it wasn\u2019t just members of the women\u2019s caucus, it was business leaders, too, asking for this. \u201d The Massachusetts attorney general will be in charge of enforcing the law, which also gives workers the right to sue companies directly for violations. In June, 28 businesses nationwide, including large employers like Gap, Pepsi and American Airlines, signed an Equal Pay Pledge promoted by the White House in which they committed to conducting annual audits of their pay by gender across all job categories. \u201cCompanies that want to do the right thing are seeing that these new laws really pose no threat,\u201d said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women  Families, which tracks the fair pay bills introduced in state legislatures. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely started to pick up. These laws are not just passing in completely blue places,\u201d she added,\u201d they\u2019re passing with bipartisan votes. \u201d Businesses are also beginning to talk more openly about the often uncomfortable things those audits find. PricewaterhouseCoopers published the results of a pay analysis it did of its British staff. It found a 15. 1 percent pay disparity between men and women, and changed its promotion practices to bring more women into senior leadership roles. Salesforce, a cloud software company, says it spent $3 million last year to raise the salaries of female employees to match their male counterparts. Academic research has illustrated the negative effect pay disparity has not just on individuals, but also on the broader economy. Closing the gender wage gap would lower the poverty rates in every state, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. Just as important, according to advocates of equal pay, are the changing demographics in boardrooms and statehouses. Ms. Jehlen, one of the Massachusetts bill\u2019s   recalled the first time she testified about equal pay issues before the legislature\u2019s labor committee: All the members were men. She and others had taken up the cause on behalf of a group of female cafeteria workers who filed a lawsuit in 1991 seeking parity with male janitors, who did comparable work, the cafeteria workers said, but were paid significantly more. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled against the women, saying that the state\u2019s equal pay law was not clear in its definition of comparable work. This week, one of those cafeteria workers attended the ceremony at which Governor Baker signed the new law. \u201cFor me,\u201d Ms. Jehlen said, \u201cthat was the most emotionally powerful thing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562871.566172}
