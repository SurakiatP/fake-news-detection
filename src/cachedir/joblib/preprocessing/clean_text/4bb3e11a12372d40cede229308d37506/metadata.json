Though the violence in the Middle East continues, archaeologists and officials from various international organizations continue to explore various options for the reconstruction of archaeological sites in Syria and Iraq once the fighting has abated. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion over how to reconstruct what is lost,\u201d said Stefano De Caro, the director general of the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, based in Rome, who is also on the scientific committee. \u201cThis is one proposal combining technical documentation and manual skill. \u201d This is not the first attempt to resurrect ancient art from the ashes of war. Last month, a replica of an ancient arch from Palmyra, destroyed a year ago, was erected in City Hall Park in New York. That model was made using   scanning, but it is smaller than the original, and less finished, some officials here suggested. The Italian models are    reconstructions based on extensive documentation of various kinds. After being created using   printing techniques, the reproductions were then covered with a layer of plastic material mixed with stone powder and finished by hand to replicate the original as closely as possible. Ms. Pinnock noted that the restorer based in Florence who completed the Nimrud statue even included scratches on the surface, \u201cto give the sense of passing time. \u201d Such minute detail was possible because the restorer worked from   photographs taken by United States military officers and later stored in Mosul, she said. \u201cWe have shown that scientifically it is possible to do good work. \u201d The Ebla reconstruction was accomplished by a company based in Rome that specializes in film sets and props, while the Bel temple ceiling was made by a company in Ferrara that already works in casting copies. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just isolated objects,\u201d but markers of a civilization\u2019s \u201chistory, context and value,\u201d brought alive \u201cthanks to Italian know how,\u201d said Francesco Rutelli, a former mayor of Rome and culture minister and the driving force behind the exhibit. \u201cThis is also an Italian story that you see here today. \u201d On display are also two marble busts from the museum in Palmyra that were damaged during the   occupation by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cWe baptized them the   of Palmyra,\u201d Mr. Rutelli said. The badly damaged sculptures were brought to Italy so that they could be restored, making an arduous journey from Damascus to Rome via Beirut, Lebanon. \u201cThe only artifacts to leave Syria have been part of the illicit trafficking trade, but these came out with an accord,\u201d Mr. Rutelli said. Even though it is \u201cvery rare during a conflict that a corridor for culture opens,\u201d he said, Damascus cultural officials had allowed the sculptures to travel because they knew the pieces would be in good hands, and on display in a prestigious spot where the plight of Syrian art would reach many. \u201cThe Colosseum is the most visited site in our country,\u201d Francesco Prosperetti, the art official responsible for Rome\u2019s main archaeological area, said in a statement. It was chosen to give maximum visibility to a \u201cglobal message on the importance of cultural heritage and its value as part of national identity, on the need to protect it, preserve it, restore it and in some cases rebuild it,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628475.1230865}
