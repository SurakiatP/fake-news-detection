[\u201cThe only thing the Rockettes should be focused on is performing for our nation and helping unite us all with the joy, love, beauty and strength for which they are famous,\u201d says Patty DeCarlo Grantham, a veteran member of the renowned troupe.  Grantham, who\u2019s president of the   Rockette Alumnae Association, says she was appalled by backlash and calls encouraging Rockettes to boycott the inaugural event. \u201cTo perform for someone that represents everything that we, as women, have ever had to overcome is contrary to everything we know to be right and true,\u201d former Rockette Autumn Withers wrote last week, The Wrap reported. \u201cOn a national level, the optics of this alone normalize the atrocious remarks Mr. Trump has openly made towards women,\u201d Withers continued. \u201cThe idea that if you simply ask their bosses or perhaps pay their bosses enough money, a line of beautiful women will oblige anyone in any way is exploitation. \u201d Grantham, responding to Withers, wrote to the Madison Square Garden Co. which owns Radio City Music Hall. \u201cWe are all aware how contentious this election has been for our country,\u201d Grantham wrote, assuring MSG owner James Dolan \u201cthat in no way does Ms. Withers\u2019 opinions reflect the opinion of the Rockette Alumnae Association. \u201d Madison Square Garden Company released a statement last week confirming that the   dancers are not obligated to perform and that each Rockette \u201cmust voluntarily sign up. \u201d . @MSG says \u201dit is always their choice\u201d in new statement on #Rockettes performing at Trump inauguration https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jackie Strause (@jackiedstrause) December 23, 2016,  \u201cLike the millions of people who are true Rockette fans, we cannot wait to see the Rockettes proudly \u2018strut their stuff\u2019 for the upcoming inauguration of the President of the United States of America,\u201d wrote Grantham, who performed as a Rockette from 1959 through 1970.
