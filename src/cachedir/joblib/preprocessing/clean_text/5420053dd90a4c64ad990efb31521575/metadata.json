The Santa Fe City Council unanimously approved a resolution reaffirming its policy. [Responding to a threat from   Donald Trump to defund sanctuary cities, the council moved forward with plans to refuse access to city property by immigration agents and keep the immigration status of any person confidential.  \u201cThis is doubling down,\u201d City Council Member Joseph Maestas, the Albuquerque Journal reported. \u201cWe\u2019re thumbing our nose at this incoming administration. \u201d In reference to the possible loss of federal funding, former Santa Fe Mayor David Cross told the council, \u201cIf that\u2019s all we\u2019re worried about, shame on us. That\u2019s not what Santa Fe is about. \u201d The State of New Mexico has gone back and forth on its position on cooperating with immigration officials. In 1986,   Toney Anaya declared the state to be a sanctuary state, according to SanctuaryCities. info, a website that tracks such jurisdictions. That decision was reversed in 2011 by Governor Susana Martinez, a former prosecutor. \u201cI did an executive order within minutes after I was sworn into office in 2011,\u201d Gov. Susana Martinez said during a visit to Ruidoso, New Mexico in July 2015, the Ruidoso News reported. \u201cI said there will not be any sanctuary city. Our police officers will ask where someone is from, especially if they are being arrested and put in jail for crimes, because that needs to be considered by a judge. Are you a flight risk or a danger to the community and would you return to court for proceedings to determine whether you are culpable for some offense you are accused of?\u201d The City of Santa Fe had previously passed a sanctuary city resolution in 1999. Knowing the City is at risk of losing federal funding, it is attempting to strengthen its position. \u201cThis resolution puts us in a more defensible (legal) position than current sanctuary policies,\u201d said retired attorney Jim Harrington. Harrington has done volunteer work for Somos un Pueblo Unido, the Albuquerque newspaper reported. Harrington told the reporter the U. S. Supreme Court has restricted how the federal government can use funding cuts to enforce policy. Under existing law, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can already move quickly to not only cut off future law enforcement grants to the city \u2014  it can recoup past grants for any period of time the municipality was not 100 percent compliant with federal immigration law, according to U. S. Representative John Culberson ( ). Culberson spent most of 2016 working with DOJ officials to enforce 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1373, a law that passed in 1996 to require local and state jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officials or risk losing federal funding, Breitbart Texas previously reported. \u201cThe law requires cooperation with immigration officials 100 percent of the time,\u201d Culberson said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas in November. The DOJ Office of Inspector General certified the top 10 sanctuary jurisdictions last year and notified that they would not be eligible to apply for DOJ law enforcement grants for the coming year unless they change their policies. The current list of sanctuary jurisdictions to be defunded includes: the entire states of California and Connecticut Orleans Parish in Louisiana  New York City Philadelphia Cook County, Illinois   County, Florida Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Clark County, Nevada. The grant process begins this month. \u201cI had to stand on their \u2018air hose,\u2019\u201d Culberson explained referring to Congress\u2019 power to cut a federal agencies\u2019 funds. \u201cFor those on the   list, it is done. \u201d The actions of the defiant Santa Fe City Council could move New Mexico\u2019s capital city onto that list as well.
