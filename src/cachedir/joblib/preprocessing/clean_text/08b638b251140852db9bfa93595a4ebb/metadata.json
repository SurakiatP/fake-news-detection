S. and Russia have been trading barbs since President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on the Assad regime\u2019s military assets in Syria last week, but now Russian President Vladimir Putin has closed the door on a    meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when the U. S. top diplomat visits the country later this week. [Russia has long supported Syrian President Bashar Assad and refutes the U. S. claim that the dictator ordered the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed innocent people, including many children.  \u201cWe have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president\u2019s diary,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a Monday press conference call, according to Reuters. Before Tillerson became Secretary of State, he was the CEO of ExxonMobil, a job that included dealings with the Kremlin. In 2013, Putin presented Tillerson with the Russian Order of Friendship award. Tillerson is expected to meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during his stop in Moscow, according to Reuters. Reuters reported that Putin regularly met with John Kerry, Secretary of State under Barack Obama. \u201cReacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to stop supporting Syrian President Bashar   Russia\u2019s closet Middle East ally, Peskov called that a \u201d Reuters reported. \u201cReturning to   to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out,\u201d Peskov said. Other thorny issues may surface during Tillerson\u2019s visit to Moscow, including Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election, its violation of an arms control treaty, and finding common ground on fighting radical Islamic terrorism in Syria. Tillerson had some tough words for Russia on Thursday about the chemical weapons attack. Speaking from Trump\u2019s    estate in Florida, where Trump was meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson cited Russia\u2019s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical stockpile, saying Russia has \u201cclearly failed in its responsibility\u201d to eliminate those weapons. \u201cEither Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,\u201d Tillerson said. U. S. military officials have said they are certain Assad is responsible for the attack. \u201cWe highly suspect, and in fact, there\u2019s no credible alternative to a Syrian regime air attack as the source of the chemicals that killed so many Syrian civilians,\u201d a military official said. \u201cISIS has experimented with mustard agents, blister agents, not nerve agents,\u201d an official said. \u201cBut this is well beyond the technical capability of the opposition. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562995.7448938}
