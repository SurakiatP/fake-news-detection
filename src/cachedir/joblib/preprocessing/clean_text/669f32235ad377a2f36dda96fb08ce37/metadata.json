{"duration": 0.29383158683776855, "input_args": {"text": "'For nearly two decades, Bill O\u2019Reilly has been Fox News\u2019s top asset, building the No. 1 program in cable news for a network that has pulled in billions of dollars in revenues for its parent company, 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, the company has repeatedly stood by Mr. O\u2019Reilly as he faced a series of allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior. An investigation by The New York Times has found a total of five women who have received payouts from either Mr. O\u2019Reilly or the company in exchange for agreeing to not pursue litigation or speak about their accusations against him. The agreements totaled about $13 million. Two settlements came after the network\u2019s former chairman, Roger Ailes, was dismissed last summer in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal, when the company said it did not tolerate behavior that \u201cdisrespects women or contributes to an uncomfortable work environment. \u201d The women who made allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly either worked for him or appeared on his show. They have complained about a wide range of behavior, including verbal abuse, lewd comments, unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if Mr. O\u2019Reilly was masturbating, according to documents and interviews. The reporting suggests a pattern: As an influential figure in the newsroom, Mr. O\u2019Reilly would create a bond with some women by offering advice and promising to help them professionally. He then would pursue sexual relationships with them, causing some to fear that if they rebuffed him, their careers would stall. Of the five settlements, two were previously known  \u2014   one for about $9 million in 2004 with a producer, and another struck last year with a former   personality, which The Times reported on in January. The Times has learned new details related to those cases. The three other settlements were uncovered by The Times. Two involved sexual harassment claims against Mr. O\u2019Reilly, and the other was for verbal abuse related to an episode in which he berated a young producer in front of newsroom colleagues. Besides the women who reached settlements, two other women have spoken of inappropriate behavior by the host. A former regular guest on his show, Wendy Walsh, told The Times that after she rebuffed an advance from him he didn\u2019t follow through on a verbal offer to secure her a lucrative position at the network. And a former Fox News host named Andrea Tantaros said Mr. O\u2019Reilly sexually harassed her in a lawsuit she filed last summer against the network and Mr. Ailes. Representatives for 21st Century Fox would not discuss specific accusations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly, but in a written statement to The Times the company acknowledged it had addressed the issue with him. \u201c21st Century Fox takes matters of workplace behavior very seriously,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNotwithstanding the fact that no current or former Fox News employee ever took advantage of the 21st Century Fox hotline to raise a concern about Bill O\u2019Reilly, even anonymously, we have looked into these matters over the last few months and discussed them with Mr. O\u2019Reilly. While he denies the merits of these claims, Mr. O\u2019Reilly has resolved those he regarded as his personal responsibility. Mr. O\u2019Reilly is fully committed to supporting our efforts to improve the environment for all our employees at Fox News. \u201d According to legal experts, companies occasionally settle disputes that they believe have little merit because it is less risky than taking the matters to trial, which can be costly and create a string of embarrassing headlines. The revelations about Mr. O\u2019Reilly, 67, come after sexual harassment accusations against Mr. Ailes led to an internal investigation that found women at Fox News faced harassment. Current and former Fox News employees told The Times that they feared making complaints to network executives or the human resources department. Mr. Ailes, who has denied the allegations against him, received $40 million as part of his exit package. The company has reached settlements with at least six women who accused Mr. Ailes of sexual harassment, according to a person briefed on the agreements. At the time of Mr. Ailes\u2019s departure, 21st Century Fox\u2019s top executives, James and Lachlan Murdoch, the sons of the executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, said the company was committed to \u201cmaintaining a work environment based on trust and respect. \u201d Since then, the company has struck two settlements involving Mr. O\u2019Reilly, and learned of one Mr. O\u2019Reilly reached secretly in 2011. The company declined to answer questions about whether Mr. O\u2019Reilly had ever been disciplined. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has thrived since joining Fox News in 1996. He earns an annual salary of about $18 million as the host of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor. \u201d Every weeknight at 8 p. m. he presents a pugnacious,    viewpoint and a fervent strain of patriotism that appeals to conservative viewers. His value to the company is enormous. From 2014 through 2016, the show generated more than $446 million in advertising revenues, according to the research firm Kantar Media. This is a sensitive time for Fox News as it continues to deal with the fallout of the Ailes scandal. The network is facing an investigation by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which is looking into how the company structured settlements. Fox News has said that neither it nor 21st Century Fox has received a subpoena but that they have \u201cbeen in communication with the U. S. attorney\u2019s office for months. \u201d Details on the allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly and the company\u2019s handling of them are based on more than five dozen interviews with current and former employees of Fox News and its former and current parent companies, News Corporation and 21st Century Fox representatives for the network and people close to Mr. O\u2019Reilly and the women. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation. The Times also examined more than 100 pages of documents and court filings related to the complaints. Ms. Walsh, the former guest on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, said his offer to make her a contributor never materialized after she declined an invitation to go to his hotel suite after a dinner in 2013. \u201cI feel bad that some of these old guys are using mating strategies that were acceptable in the 1950s and are not acceptable now,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope young men can learn from this. \u201d She said romantic relationships at the workplace \u201cshould never happen when there is an imbalance of power and colleagues shouldn\u2019t unwittingly be manipulated into obtaining sex for somebody. \u201d Just over a week ago, Mr. O\u2019Reilly hired the crisis communications expert Mark Fabiani  \u2014   who worked in the Clinton White House  \u2014   to respond to The Times. In a statement, Mr. O\u2019Reilly suggested that his prominence made him a target. \u201cJust like other prominent and controversial people,\u201d the statement read, \u201cI\u2019m vulnerable to lawsuits from individuals who want me to pay them to avoid negative publicity. In my more than 20 years at Fox News Channel, no one has ever filed a complaint about me with the Human Resources Department, even on the anonymous hotline. \u201cBut most importantly, I\u2019m a father who cares deeply for my children and who would do anything to avoid hurting them in any way. And so I have put to rest any controversies to spare my children. \u201cThe worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer, the Fox News Channel. Those of us in the arena are constantly at risk, as are our families and children. My primary efforts will continue to be to put forth an honest TV program and to protect those close to me. \u201d Fredric S. Newman, a lawyer for Mr. O\u2019Reilly, said in a statement Friday evening, \u201cWe are now seriously considering legal action to defend Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s reputation. \u201d Fox News has been aware of complaints about inappropriate behavior by Mr. O\u2019Reilly since at least 2002, when Mr. O\u2019Reilly stormed into the newsroom and screamed at a young producer, according to current and former employees, some of whom witnessed the incident. Shortly thereafter, the woman, Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, left the network with a payout and bound by a confidentiality agreement, people familiar with the deal said. The exact amount she was paid is not known, but it was far less than the other settlements. The case did not involve sexual harassment. Two years later, allegations about Mr. O\u2019Reilly entered the public arena in lurid fashion when a producer on his show, Andrea Mackris, then 33, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. In the suit, she said he had told her to buy a vibrator, called her at times when it sounded as if he was masturbating and described sexual fantasies involving her. Ms. Mackris had recorded some of the conversations, people familiar with the case said. Ms. Mackris also said in the suit that Mr. O\u2019Reilly, who was married at the time (he and his wife divorced in 2011) threatened her, saying he would make any woman who complained about his behavior \u201cpay so dearly that she\u2019ll wish she\u2019d never been born. \u201d Fox News and Mr. O\u2019Reilly adopted an aggressive strategy that served as a stark warning of what could happen to women if they came forward with complaints, current and former employees told The Times. Before Ms. Mackris even filed suit, Fox News and Mr. O\u2019Reilly surprised her with a   suit of their own, asserting she was seeking to extort $60 million in return for not going public with \u201cscandalous and scurrilous\u201d claims about him. \u201cThis is the single most evil thing I have ever experienced, and I have seen a lot,\u201d he said on his show the day both suits were filed. \u201cBut these people picked the wrong guy. \u201d A public relations firm was hired to help shape the narrative in Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s favor, and the private investigator Bo Dietl was retained to dig up information on Ms. Mackris. The goal was to depict her as a promiscuous woman, deeply in debt, who was trying to shake down Mr. O\u2019Reilly, according to people briefed on the strategy. Several unflattering stories about her appeared in the tabloids. After two weeks of sensational headlines, the two sides settled, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly agreed to pay Ms. Mackris about $9 million, according to people briefed on the agreement. The parties agreed to issue a public statement that \u201cno wrongdoing whatsoever\u201d had occurred. In the years that followed, Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Fox News dealt with sexual harassment allegations in private, striking agreements with three more women. In 2011, Rebecca Gomez Diamond, who had hosted a show on the Fox Business Network  \u2014   also supervised by Mr. Ailes  \u2014   was told the network was not renewing her contract. Similar to Ms. Mackris, she had recorded conversations with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, according to people familiar with the case. Armed with the recordings, her lawyers went to the company and outlined her complaints against him. Ms. Diamond left the network, bound by a confidentiality agreement, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly paid the settlement, two of the people said. The exact amount of the payout is not known. Although that deal was made nearly six years ago, Fox News\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, learned of it only in late 2016 when it conducted an investigation into Fox News under Mr. Ailes\u2019s tenure, according to another person familiar with the matter. In the aftermath of Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster last summer, as 21st Century Fox was completing settlements and trying to put the scandal behind it, it reached deals with two women who had complained about sexual harassment by Mr. O\u2019Reilly. One was Laurie Dhue, a Fox News anchor from 2000 to 2008. Though Ms. Dhue had not raised sexual harassment issues during her tenure or upon her departure, her lawyers went to the company to outline her harassment claims against Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Ailes, according to people briefed on the complaints. In response, 21st Century Fox reached a settlement with her for over $1 million, according to a person briefed on the agreement. In September, 21st Century Fox reached a settlement worth $1. 6 million with Juliet Huddy, who had made regular appearances on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Huddy\u2019s lawyers had told the company that Mr. O\u2019Reilly pursued a sexual relationship in 2011, at a time he exerted significant influence over her airtime. Among Ms. Huddy\u2019s complaints was that he made inappropriate phone calls, the lawyers said in correspondence obtained by The Times. The letter said that when he tried to kiss her, she pulled away and fell to the ground and he didn\u2019t help her up. When she rebuffed him, he tried to blunt her career prospects, the letter said. Ms. Huddy was eventually moved to an early morning show on WNYW, an affiliate station, where she worked until she left the company in September. Before Ms. Huddy reached an agreement with 21st Century Fox, Mr. Newman, Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s lawyer, sent a letter to her lawyer outlining some embarrassing personal issues he said Ms. Huddy had. He stated that she would \u201cface significant credibility concerns if she tries to pursue a claim against Mr. O\u2019Reilly. \u201d The letter, which was obtained by The Times, said that if she were to follow through with a claim against Mr. O\u2019Reilly, he would pursue legal action \u201cto hold Ms. Huddy, and all who have assisted her, personally liable for any damage suffered by him or his family. \u201d In January, when The Times and others reported on Ms. Huddy\u2019s settlement, representatives for Fox News and Mr. O\u2019Reilly dismissed the allegations. Fox News is now in a legal battle with Ms. Tantaros, the former   personality who is suing the network and Mr. Ailes after turning down a settlement offer of nearly $1 million. Mr. O\u2019Reilly is not a defendant, but in the suit Ms. Tantaros said that in early 2016 Mr. O\u2019Reilly had asked \u201cher to come to stay with him on Long Island where it would be \u2018very private,\u2019\u201d and told her \u201con more than one occasion that he could \u2018see [her] as a wild girl,\u2019\u201d according to court documents. In an affidavit filed under oath, Ms. Tantaros\u2019s psychologist, Michele Berdy, who treated her from 2013 to 2016, said she recalled \u201ca number of occasions when Andrea complained to me about recurring unwanted advances from Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u201d Fox News said it investigated Ms. Tantaros\u2019s claims and found them baseless. The company explained her departure by saying she published a book that violated company policy. In court papers, the network said that she \u201cis not a victim she is an opportunist\u201d and that her allegations bore \u201call the hallmarks of the wannabe. \u201d Ms. Walsh, the former guest on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d told The Times she was propositioned by Mr. O\u2019Reilly in 2013 but did not lodge a complaint because she did not want to harm her career prospects. Ms. Walsh said that she met Mr. O\u2019Reilly for a dinner, arranged by his secretary, at the restaurant in the Hotel   in Los Angeles. During the dinner, she said, he told her he was friends with Mr. Ailes, and promised to make her a network contributor  \u2014   a job that can pay several hundred thousand dollars a year. After dinner, she said, Mr. O\u2019Reilly invited her to his hotel suite. Ms. Walsh said she declined. Trying to remain cordial, she suggested that they go to the hotel bar instead. Once there, she said, he became hostile, telling her that she could forget any career advice he had given her and that she was on her own. He also told her that her black leather purse was ugly. Ms. Walsh continued to appear on his show for about four months, but she said she sensed that he had become cold toward her on camera. Then, a producer for \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d told Ms. Walsh that she would no longer appear on the show. She was never made a contributor. \u201cI knew my hopes of a career at Fox News were in jeopardy after that evening,\u201d said Ms. Walsh, now an adjunct professor of psychology at California State University, Channel Islands, and a radio host at KFI AM 640 in Los Angeles. A person briefed on the network\u2019s decision said that Ms. Walsh was removed from the broadcast because the program\u2019s ratings declined during her segments. Ms. Mackris, the producer who sued Mr. O\u2019Reilly in 2004, never worked in television news again. In the years after the dispute, she suffered from   stress and spent years seeing a therapist, struggling to figure out how to create a new life, according to interviews with people close to her at the time. Ms. Mackris\u2019s settlement prevents her from talking about Fox News and her dispute with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, according to people briefed on the deal. But she is allowed to talk about her life now. Today, Ms. Mackris lives with her cats in an   condo in her hometown, St. Louis, where she keeps bowls of colorful gumballs on tabletops. Her family is close by. She has traveled the world, volunteered, returned to school, discovered prayer and meditation, and started writing. She is working on a book she researched and wrote over the past four years about a woman who fled Romania during World War II. \u201cA few years ago, I heard about a pair of natural pearl earrings forgotten in a drawer for 35 years that had just sold for millions at auction,\u201d Ms. Mackris said. \u201cThey\u2019d been given to a woman named Elena Lupescu by the king of Romania who ruled up until World War II, and I was immediately and completely taken by her story. \u201d \u201cShe lived in exile,\u201d Ms. Mackris continued. \u201cShe lived in silence. And I got really curious about three things: How did she live with it all? Did she forgive them? And was she free?\u201d At Fox News, Mr. O\u2019Reilly has continued his dominance. In the months since the presidential election, as the network has pulled in record ratings, his show has averaged 3. 9 million viewers a night, according to Nielsen. Since September, he has released three books, including one for children, adding to his growing publishing empire. And in February, Mr. O\u2019Reilly landed a coveted interview with President Trump before the Super Bowl. Mr. O\u2019Reilly was an early defender of Mr. Ailes and Fox News during that sexual harassment scandal last summer. His support remained resolute into the fall, after the company had reached agreements to settle the harassment claims from Ms. Huddy and Ms. Dhue. In November, he chided Megyn Kelly, his colleague at the time, after she described being sexually harassed by Mr. Ailes in her memoir. \u201cIf somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance,\u201d he said on his nightly show, without mentioning Ms. Kelly by name. \u201cYou don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562149.3741715}
