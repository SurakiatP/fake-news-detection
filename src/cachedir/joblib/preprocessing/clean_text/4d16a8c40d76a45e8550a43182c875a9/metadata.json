[Senate Bill 97, introduced by Keith Regier ( ) bans the application of foreign law in Montana\u2019s courts, with the debate particularly focused on Sharia Law, a form of Islamic law typically used in the Middle East.  Although the bill passed on party lines by   Democrats claimed it was designed to target Muslim communities. \u201cI think it sends a dangerous message to minority groups both here living in our state and wanting to come visit our state, just merely on the fact that you may be different,\u201d said Rep. Shane Morigeau,   while debating the bill. \u201cI truly believe this law is repugnant. I believe this is not who we are as Montanans. \u201d Meanwhile, Rep. Ellie Hill Smith ( ) proposed a failed amendment to the bill to include a ban on both Sharia Law and the Law of Moses, in order to \u201cshow the state of Montana that it is not just about Islamic Law. \u201d \u201cThe courts have said that laws that single out certain religions violate the First Amendment,\u201d Smith said, claiming that it was \u201cpeppered with   bigotry. \u201d Another Democrat, Rep. Laurie Bishop ( ) urged legislators \u201cnot to forget the roots of this bill,\u201d adding that \u201cour children are watching. \u201d Meanwhile, Rep. Brad Tschida ( ) said the bill was an attempt to push back against a \u201cconstitution [that] is constantly under assault. \u201d Bills specifically targeting Sharia Law have passed in states such as North Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, and Tennessee. The bill will now be passed on to Gov. Steve Bullock (D) for signature or veto.
