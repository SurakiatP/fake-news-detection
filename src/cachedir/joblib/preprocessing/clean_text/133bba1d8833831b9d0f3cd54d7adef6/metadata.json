Unsurprisingly, this is leading to reports of a growing number of civilians killed and wounded in the area. \\nThis has the PR people going into high gear, trying to manage the narrative around the deaths, with Western and Iraq officials accusing ISIS of forcing civilians into the city to use as human shields, and preventing them from relocating outside the city. \\nWhile some reports suggest this may be accurate, the US has also talked openly of conducting airstrikes against all \u201cfighters\u201d fleeing the city, which has led the Iraqi government to openly warn the civilian population of Mosul against fleeing , lest they get targeted as welll. \\nCivilians getting mistaken for fleeing ISIS fighters has been an ongoing problem for the US, who killed hundreds of civilians around the Syrian city of Manbij in such mistakes.
