Bernie Sanders (I-VT). \\n\\nAt the time, Brazile was not yet DNC chair, but was a regular CNN contributor. \\n\\nCNN fired Brazile on Monday, releasing a statement: \u201c\u201cWe are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.\u201d \\n\\nTrump noted that Brazile was not the core issue \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d about her, he said. Rather, he argued, Hillary Clinton should have reported Brazile the first time she tried to pass debate questions to her. \\nTrump also talked about cheating at the polls, telling supporters that the only way to overcome voter fraud would be to vote by the \u201cmillions.\u201d \\n\\nHe cited 1.8 million dead people on the country\u2019s voter rolls, and 2.75 million who are registered in more than one state. (The statistics appear to be based on a Pew Research Center study.) \\n\\nTrump challenged journalists in the room to ask Hillary Clinton why she had not reported Brazile after being provided with the debate questions. \\n\\nJoel B.
