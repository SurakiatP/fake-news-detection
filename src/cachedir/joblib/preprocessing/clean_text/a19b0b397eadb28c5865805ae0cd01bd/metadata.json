It was hardly unusual: Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India, often enjoyed an   whiskey at the bar they had adopted as a hangout. Adam W. Purinton was also there, tossing ethnic slurs at the two men and suggesting they did not belong in the United States, other customers said. Patrons complained, and Mr. Purinton was thrown out. But a short time later, he came back in a rage and fired on the two men, the authorities said. Mr. Kuchibhotla was killed, and Mr. Madasani was wounded, along with a    man who had tried to apprehend the gunman, who fled. Mr. Purinton, 51, was extradited to Kansas from Missouri on Friday, and he is charged with premeditated   murder and two counts of attempted premeditated   murder. The attack, which the federal and local authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime, reverberated far beyond both states. It raised new alarms about a climate of hostility toward foreigners in the United States, where President Trump has made clamping down on immigration a central plank of his \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda. The White House strongly rejected the notion that there might be any connection between the shooting and the new administration\u2019s sharp language about immigration. \u201cPeople are devastated,\u201d said Somil Chandwani, a friend of the two victims who lives in Overland Park, Kan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they are angry. They have a sense of insecurity at the moment. People are trying to find answers. \u201d A charging document released on Friday gave no details about the motive for the shooting. Law enforcement officials in Kansas, citing the continuing investigation and judicial ethics standards, said little about the episode. Still, the F. B. I. \u2019s role in the inquiry suggested that officials had found some evidence that could eventually lead to civil rights charges in connection with the shooting, which occurred around 7:15 p. m. Wednesday. \u201cHe snapped, and this is not his typical self,\u201d the suspect\u2019s mother, Marsha Purinton, said before declining further comment. In a brief phone interview on Friday night, Mr. Madasani described the remarks made Wednesday by the man sitting near him and Mr. Kuchibhotla at the restaurant. \u201cHe asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally,\u201d Mr. Madasani said. (Both men were educated in the United States and were working here legally.) \u201cWe didn\u2019t react,\u201d Mr. Madasani said. \u201cPeople do stupid things all the time. This guy took it to the next level. \u201d Mr. Madasani said he went in to get a manager, and by the time he returned to the patio, the man was being escorted out. After Mr. Purinton was thrown out, Jeremy Luby, 41, a software developer, said he offered to pick up the tab for the two men, who thanked him during a brief conversation about work and cultural differences. \u201cIt was wrong what happened to them,\u201d Mr. Luby said. \u201cI thought it was a nice gesture to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry someone was being rude to you like that. \u2019\u201d After the shooting began, another patron, Ian Grillot, 24, said he tried to count the shots while he hid under a table. Thinking the gunman had run out of ammunition, Mr. Grillot said, he confronted him, only to be shot in the hand and the chest. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right, and I didn\u2019t want the gentleman to potentially go after somebody else,\u201d Mr. Grillot said in a video released by the hospital where he received treatment. \u201cHe did it once. What would stop him from doing it again?\u201d The shots echoed around the area, and Chris Lacross soon emerged from a store a few doors down to an unimaginable scene: an emergency medical technician performing CPR on a man lying in the doorway of the bar\u2019s front patio, where tables and chairs had been flipped over, and someone was shouting that they needed towels. Another man took off his shirt and applied pressure to the wound of another victim, who was writhing in pain, said Mr. Lacross, who allowed some people to use a store restroom to wash away spattered blood. Within minutes, an emergency dispatcher, in a transmission archived by the Broadcastify website, told officers, \u201cWe\u2019re being advised the suspect\u2019s name is Adam, and he\u2019s a white male wearing a white shirt with military medals. \u201d Capt. Sonny Lynch, the deputy chief of police in Clinton, Mo. where Mr. Purinton was arrested at an Applebee\u2019s restaurant, said a bartender there called the police after a customer confessed to his involvement in a shooting hours earlier. \u201cHe was talking to her  \u2014   \u2018I\u2019m on the run I\u2019m hiding out from the law\u2019  \u2014   so she stuck around,\u201d Captain Lynch said of the bartender. \u201cShe just hung out there talking to the guy until he said, \u2018I shot those guys, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hiding out from the police. \u2019\u201d Mr. Purinton was arrested without incident, Captain Lynch said, and invoked his constitutional rights. It was not clear whether he had a lawyer. Mr. Purinton spent time in the Navy and, according to a website where veterans can list their military records, was deployed aboard the Long Beach, a missile cruiser, from 1988 to 1990. He later worked for the Federal Aviation Administration but left the agency in 2000, a spokeswoman said. In Johnson County, Kan. at least, he has had few   with law enforcement. Court records showed a limited history: a speeding ticket in 2008, as well as a 1999   charge that was dismissed. A neighbor, Lisa Puckett, said that Mr. Purinton was frequently intoxicated but that news of a shooting was stunning. \u201cWe always wondered if he might hurt himself, but we didn\u2019t think he would hurt someone else,\u201d she said. The dead man, Mr. Kuchibhotla, worked for Garmin, a GPS navigation and communications device company. One of the wounded men, Mr. Madasani, like Mr. Kuchibhotla in his early 30s, also worked for Garmin, according to the Indian government. On Friday, counselors were at the company\u2019s campus in Olathe, a hub of South Asian immigrants where 84 languages are spoken in the local school district. Speaking to reporters on Friday at the Garmin headquarters, Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s widow, Sunayana Dumala, said she had long been worried by shootings she read about in the newspaper. \u201cI, especially, I was always concerned, are we doing the right thing of staying in the United States of America?\u201d she said. \u201cBut he always assured me that only good things happen to good people. \u201d Now, Ms. Dumala said, she needed \u201can answer from the government\u201d about what \u201cthey\u2019re going to do to stop this hate crime. \u201d Mr. Madasani\u2019s father, Jagan Mohan Reddy, a government engineer in Hyderabad, India, said his family was in shock. He said he did not know whether he would ask Mr. Madasani, who received a graduate degree from the University of   City, and another son living in the United States to leave the country. \u201cWe have to think it over,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sons are not new to America. They have been staying there for the last 10 to 12 years. This is a new situation, and they are the best judges. \u201d Mr. Madasani, who has been released from the hospital, said he was recovering physically and mentally. \u201cI\u2019m definitely doing much better, but it\u2019s not over yet,\u201d he said. On Friday, Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s killing and the wounding of Mr. Madasani led to a chorus of fury in India, where the attack dominated the news media to such an extent that the top American diplomat in the country was compelled to issue a statement condemning what she described as a \u201ctragic and senseless act. \u201d In Washington, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, rejected any link between Mr. Trump\u2019s policy agenda and the shooting, which many Indians believed might have been inspired by the president\u2019s harsh tone on immigration. The Justice Department is under pressure to bring federal charges in the case. Moussa Elbayoumy, the board chairman for the Kansas chapter of the Council on   Relations, said the government should \u201cconsider filing hate crime charges in order to send a strong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated. \u201d On Friday night, a diverse crowd of more than 400 gathered to grieve at First Baptist Church down the street from the bar. They offered their prayers to the Kuchibhotlas and the Madasanis, characterized the shooting as an anomaly in an otherwise peaceful, tolerant suburb and vowed they would not let that change. \u201cAs a community, we are still shocked, devastated, and angry,\u201d  Mayor Michael Copeland said. \u201cBut this is not how this ends. This is not our Olathe. \u201d He added, \u201cOne evil act does not divide a united community. \u201d Mr. Purinton was scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Austins, meanwhile, planned to reopen on Saturday.'"}, "time": 1742563916.6521175}
