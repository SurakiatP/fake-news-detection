Ryan was asked by a woman who said she had been protected from deportation by DACA if he believed she should be deported. He answered that he didn\u2019t. He added, \u201cI hope you\u2019re future is here. I\u2019ll even repeat the sentiment the our incoming president says. That\u2019s the problem he wants to focus on. This is not the focus. And so, what we have to do is find a way to make sure that you can get right with the law, and we\u2019ve got to do this in a good way so that the rug doesn\u2019t get pulled out from under you and your family gets separated. That\u2019s the way we feel, and that is exactly what our new incoming president has stated he wants to do. \u201d He further stated that the woman should not be afraid about a \u201cdeportation force\u201d knocking on her door later this year. Ryan also said that there needs to be a solution for DACA kids and there is a \u201cconstitutional issue\u201d with the fact that DACA was done by the president without Congress. When asked if he would introduce legislation to block the use of information the government has on people who received protection from DACA to deport them, Ryan answered, \u201cNo. Everybody thinks that there\u2019s some deportation force that\u2019s being assembled. That\u2019s not happening. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564029.3304455}
