Clinton faces ongoing FBI probe even if she's elected President By Wills Robinson Daily Mail November 1, 2016 The FBI now has a warrant to read the emails from Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton \u2018s most trusted aide, which were among hundreds of thousands discovered on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. Law enforcement officials confirmed that investigators gained permission to start trawling through the 650,000 emails discovered on the laptop on Sunday evening, NBC reported. Thousands of them could be from Clinton\u2019s private server. Feds seized the laptop belonging to Weiner, Abedin\u2019s disgraced husband, in September after DailyMail.com exposed his sexting of a 15-year-old girl. In early October, agents told FBI heads they\u2019d found emails on the laptop from Abedin that may have been deleted from Clinton\u2019s private server but their warrant did not allow them to read emails that were not linked to the Weiner investigation. The newly reopened investigation will take time due to the sheer volume of emails to be read, the Wall Street Journal reported. It will likely take agents until well past the election to assess how many, if any, contain classified information \u2013 leaving Clinton with the prospect of facing an ongoing investigation even if she is elected president. The Democratic candidate already shows signs of slipping in the polls after an ABC News/Washington Post tracker poll revealed Trump was just one point behind \u2013 an 11 point change since last week. And since FBI director James Comey\u2019s shock announcement on Friday that the Clinton private server probe was to be reopened, questions have continued to mount over Abedin\u2019s future on the Clinton campaign. She has stayed behind in New York while her boss hits the campaign trail. Abedin has pleaded ignorance about how the emails ended up on husband Weiner\u2019s laptop. She swore under oath while testifying in a lawsuit brought against the State Department by Judicial Watch that she had handed over all of her devices that could hold emails relevant to the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. If she\u2019s found to have lied she could face up to five years in jail. On Sunday, Clinton \u2013 no longer accompanied by Abedin \u2013 said at a Florida rally that she would not be \u2018knocked off course\u2019 by Friday\u2019s shocking development. \u2018I\u2019m not stopping now, we\u2019re just getting warmed up,\u2019 she declared to a packed crowd with many gay and lesbian supporters in the city of Wilton Manors. \u2018We\u2019re not going to be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us.\u2019 Donald Trump delivered a swift kick to disgraced former Democratic congressman Weiner on Sunday, thanking him for preserving the emails that could bring Clinton down.\""}, "time": 1742562735.0535095}
