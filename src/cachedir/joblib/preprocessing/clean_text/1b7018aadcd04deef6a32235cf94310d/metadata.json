Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/abc-news-caught-staging-fake-crime-scene.html ABC News has been caught staging a fake \u201ccrime scene\u201d for reporter Linsey Davis to report from in a segment broadcast on Good Morning America. Viewers were presented with the sight of Davis standing in front of yellow police tape with the words \u201cSHERIFF\u2019S LINE DO NOT CROSS\u201d and ABC News, reporting from the site for hours, claimed Davis was in the middle of an active crime scene.But she wasn\u2019t. The ABC News report had more in common with a Hollywood production than a breaking news report.Linsey Davis was actually standing in a field in Woodruffe, South Carolina \u2013 not at the crime scene she was claiming to be reporting from.Sources with knowledge of the matter say the sheriff\u2019s tape was placed there by the ABC News crew for the purpose of its inclusion in the live shot.A photo leaked by an anonymous source shows the sheriff\u2019s tape running no more than 30 yards \u2013 and tied at both ends to ABC News camera stands. Busted \u2013 and ABC know it. \u201cThis action is completely unacceptable and fails to meet the standards of ABC News,\u201d said Julie Townsend, the vice president of communications at ABC News. \u201cAs soon as it was brought to our attention, we decided to take the producer out of the field, and we\u2019re investigating further.\u201d Fake Sheriff\u2019s Tape, Fake News But ABC News\u2019 recent behavior gets even worse.

But only for 40 seconds and only to dismiss it as \u201cinaccurate and \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d CBS This Morning\u2019s Major Garrett followed up by chiding \u201cunconfirmed speculation.\u201dOn Good Morning America, correspondent Tom Llamas continued the misleading angle. \u201cWith just four days to go, Trump in full attack mode against Hillary Clinton, sending his crowds into a frenzy with these unsubstantiated reports ABC News sources say are inaccurate.\u201d How can anybody trust these exposed liars anymore? Deceit and manipulation are fundamental to mainstream media operations these days. Evidence that the Main Stream Media is fabricating news for propaganda reasons:'"}, "time": 1742564419.932495}
