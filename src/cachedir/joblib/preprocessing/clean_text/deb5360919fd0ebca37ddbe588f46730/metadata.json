The vote to be made next week by pecking once at a pile of grain for \u2018Thanksgiving\u2019 or twice for \u2018Something Else\u2019 comes after bitter arguments in which claims and counter-claims were made about the availability of dust for bathing in over the turkeys\u2019 long-term (i.e. three-week) future. \\nMany turkeys have deplored the resulting divisions, which have seen elevated levels of pecking in the once harmonious community five miles from Wapakoneta. \u2018I\u2019ve lived here all my life, y\u2019all,\u2019 said turkey hen Wanda-Mae Cabrera. \u2018What was it we were deciding on again? Me an\u2019 my folks before me, we all lived here, yes we did.\u2019 \\nVoting for Thanksgiving means that the turkeys will be able to build a wall from their own faeces to deter any incoming poultry from Kentucky from trying to get into the shed, once they have mastered the intricacies of building a wall from their own faeces. Many also believe that this will make the shed great again, as it hasn\u2019t been great for a long time but definitely used to be. They also said they liked the sound of a new farmer called Donald, who recently grabbed a pussy-cat that raided the shed before it could do any damage. \\nSome turkeys prefer to carry on not celebrating Thanksgiving because the past 244 generations had not and had all gone away to live happily on a farm somewhere else, apparently. \u2018One labourer said we will get a right stuffing either way,\u2019 said anti-Thanksgiving turkey DeMarius Jackson, aged 28 weeks. \u2018Well, that\u2019s democracy. I imagine.\u2019 \\n\u2018I ain\u2019t having no goddam American Bronzes sharing my shed, no sirree,\u2019 raged White Holland cock Burl Griffin CCXXVI. \u2018Before you know it, they\u2019ll be gobblin\u2019 around your hens, stealin\u2019 your water and sayin\u2019 you can\u2019t worship the Great Spotlight in the Roof no more. I ain\u2019t breedist but have you seen the size of their wattles? I like my shed the way I like it, so I\u2019m for Thanksgiving, sure thing. What is Thanksgiving, anyway?\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 2nd, 2016 by Oxbridge Click for more article by Oxbridge .. More Stories about: World News 0'"}, "time": 1742562297.9106095}
