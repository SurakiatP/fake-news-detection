The militias see this as the last real fight against ISIS inside Iraq, and are openly talking about heading into Syria next . \\nWhile the militias\u2019 involvement in previous captures of major Sunni Arab cities around Iraq has seen them looting, torturing, and killing with reckless abandon, the militias\u2019 ambition to get into Syria once this is wrapped up may mean less are left behind around Mosul to harass the locals. \\nThe sectarian nature of the wars in Iraq and Syria have both led to a spike in recruitment for the Shi\u2019ite militias, with many being deployed around significant religious sites in both countries to protect them from groups like ISIS. For many of them, this has also meant a blurring of the lines between the two wars. \\nThere remains considerable concern about the impact on the Mosul population of the militias\u2019 presence. This is doubly true because, in \u201cblocking\u201d ISIS escape, they may also end up blocking the escape of the civilian population,. which is unlikely to be welcomed if they flee into Kurdish territory. \\nThat\u2019s also a recurring reality in Iraq\u2019s war, that the Sunni Arab civilians aren\u2019t welcomed into Kurdish or Shi\u2019ite territory, and generally end up having to flee into other ISIS territory for lack of alternatives. With little ISIS territory left, it is unclear where they\u2019ll go. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz'"}, "time": 1742563922.6757078}
