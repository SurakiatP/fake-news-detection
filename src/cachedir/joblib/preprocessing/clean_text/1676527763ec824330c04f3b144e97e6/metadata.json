FACT CHECK #1 \u2013 Hillary Clinton claimed that Planned Parenthood \u201cprovides cancer screenings\u201d and therefore should not be de-funded, in spite of controversy about abortion. Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE This is a repeated claim deployed in defense of Planned Parenthood, but it is not true, at least as regards breast cancer. As the left-leaning Washington Post \u2019s fact-checker wrote in 2015: When Democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that Planned Parenthood \u201cprovides\u201d mammograms, this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the X-rays. The group does not \u201cprovide\u201d mammograms. Rather, the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies, X-rays or other specialized services. It is slightly more accurate to say that women have \u201caccess\u201d to mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it\u2019s still slippery language. FACT CHECK #2 \u2013 Hillary Clinton responded to a question about Supreme Court and gun rights by saying, \u201cI support the Second Amendment.\u201d Fact-Check: FALSE When Clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision: a decision dealing with the foundations of the Second Amendment; the very roots of what it protects. In the Heller ruling, SCOTUS reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. This decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia, politics and journalism trying to persuade Americans that the Second Amendment protects a collective right. (If collective, the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or today\u2019s military or police forces.) So Heller is crucial. In fact, it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire Second Amendment rests on it. Yet Hillary disagrees the Heller ruling. Her spokesman Josh Schwerin said Hillary believes Heller was \u201c wrongly decided .\u201d So how can a woman who does not believe in an \u201cindividual\u201d right to keep and bear arms support the Second Amendment? She can\u2019t. Incidentally, Clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the Heller decision was the way the SCOTUS applied the Second Amendment in that case. For those of you who may not know, Heller centered on Washington DC\u2019s gun ban\u2013which was subsequently struck down via the SCOTUS decision. To oppose the application of the Second Amendment in Heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned. That is not supporting the Second Amendment. FACT CHECK #3 \u2013 Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday that she \u201cwill not add a penny to the debt\u201d if elected president. Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s claim is not even close to true. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that under Clinton\u2019s policies , the debt would increase by $9 trillion over a decade. \u201cClinton\u2019s plan would increase both spending and revenue,\u201d the Washington, D.C.-based independent non-profit\u2019s analyst said . \u201cUnder our preliminary updated central estimate, she would increase primary spending by $1.65 trillion over the next decade, including about $500 billion of spending on college education, $300 billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure, and significant new health-related spending.\u201d FACT CHECK #4 \u2013 Hillary Clinton claimed that \u201c33,000 people a year\u2026die from guns.\u201d Fact-Check: FALSE This is a claim Clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control; to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the American people safe. However, a Fact-Check shows Clinton\u2019s claim is not only false, but is exaggerated by 66 percent. She is using figures from 2013, and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year. Clinton first began making this claim in November 2015, repeated it in April 2016, and has since repeated it again and again. In April Breitbart News highlighted the method Clinton used to swell the numbers: In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 11,208 firearm-related homicides in the United States. An additional 505 accidental firearm-related deaths occurred in the US\u2013a figure that pales in comparison to the 38,851 deaths by accidental poisoning or the 30,208 deaths caused by falls. So Clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides. In this way, 11,713 firearm-related deaths\u2013homicides and accidental deaths\u2013quickly become 32,888 \u201cgun violence\u201d deaths in 2013 and an impetus for gun control. FACT CHECK #5 \u2013 Hillary Clinton praised President Obama \u2019s economic performance, adding: \u201cHe has cut the deficit by two-thirds.\u201d Fact-Check: FALSE This repeated Democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through Obama \u2019s first year in office, after the $862 billion stimulus, the massive omnibus spending bill (\u201cporkulus\u201d), and the deployment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was signed by Obama \u2019s predecessor but for which he voted. As Breitbart News noted when President Obama claimed in January to have cut the deficit by \u201calmost three-quarters\u201d: This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it\u2019s not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office\u2013which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He \u201ccut\u201d (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010. The truth is that Obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and ill-conceived experiment in Keynesian stimulus spending, much of which was wasted on priorities that helped Obama \u2019s political supporters \u2014 especially the public sector unions \u2014 but did little for the economy. FACT CHECK #6 \u2013 Hillary Clinton said \u201cWe at the Clinton Foundation spend ninety percent \u2014 ninety percent \u2014 of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.\u201d Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Clinton\u2019s \u201cninety percent\u201d claim is false according to her troubled charity\u2019s own t ax filings . Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute , Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors. \u201cIf you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that\u2019s what it indicates,\u201d Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily . \u201cThe Clinton Foundation will say, \u2018We assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.\u2019 Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don\u2019t really tell you. They don\u2019t really explain to you how it works.\u201d \u201cSo the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,\u201d Schweizer continued. \u201cThe other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it\u2019s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.\u201d What\u2019s more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation\u2019s 2013 tax filings and found that \u201c Hillary Clinton\u2019s non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants.\u201d \u201cThe Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million\u201310 percent of all 2013 expenditures\u2013on travel,\u201d Davis contends . \u201cNearly $4.8 million\u20135.6 percent of all expenditures\u2013was spent on office supplies.\u201d (Source: Check out over 20 more Fact Checks at Breitbart) So there you have it, folks. It was hard to narrow it down to just 6, but these were among the biggest lies of the night. '"}, "time": 1742562681.6153314}
