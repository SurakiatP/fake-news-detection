They include telling the NAACP to \u201ckiss my butt,\u201d publicly complaining about \u201cguys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty\u201d selling drugs and impregnating \u201cyoung, white\u201d girls , and blaming \u201cillegals\u201d for spreading diseases like HIV \u2014 all while cutting funding to cities that offered health care and other assistance to undocumented immigrants. \\nAfter five years of LePage practicing an extreme form of wedge politics, people like Ben Chin are working to heal the resulting divisions in Maine. \\nChin, the 31-year-old grandson of an undocumented Chinese immigrant, has been working with the Maine People\u2019s Alliance to rally support from white working class neighborhoods for a series of progressive ballot measures this November.

During his campaign, a local businessman paid for billboards that said, \u201cDon\u2019t vote for Ho Chi Chin. Vote for more jobs not more welfare.\u201d \\nSince then, Chin\u2019s turned his political focus to ballot initiatives that include increasing the state\u2019s minimum wage and levying a 3 percent tax on household incomes over $200,000 a year. \\nChin and his fellow Maine People\u2019s Alliance members don\u2019t have a \u201csilver bullet\u201d set of talking points that disarms the people they encounter with racist or anti-immigrant attitudes. Instead, they focus on questions that get people to think about their economic anxieties in a deeper way. \\nOne question they ask is, \u201cWhy do you think some people are poor and other people are rich?\u201d \\nThat opens up a discussion about the ways a small group of the wealthy and powerful are stacking the economic deck against ordinary people of all colors, with their black and brown neighbors feeling it the most because of America\u2019s history of systemic racism. \\nChin said he was particularly struck by a recent conversation with a voter in Auburn, Maine. The voter was undecided about whether to support a referendum that would increase the state\u2019s wage to $12 an hour by 2020. \\n\u201cOne of his ideas was that \u2018certain people\u2019 were going to get a wage increase,\u201d Chin said. \u201cWe tried to unpack that.\u201d \\nThey talked about his life experiences and whether he really believed that increasing the minimum wage was about helping some \u201ccertain\u201d group of undeserving freeloaders. \\nChin said that though this voter wasn\u2019t a \u201craging justice activist\u201d by the end of their conversation, he was more thoughtfully considering the minimum wage. \\nConversations like these are happening in many states around the country this election season, as progressives grapple with the mainstreaming of racist and nativist appeals by Trump and other far-right politicians. \\nThese types of empathetic conversations are the nemesis of the conservative-corporate elite who have engineered extreme wealth inequality and, for too many, the disappearance of the American dream. \\nThe last thing politicians who benefit from wedge politics want to see is working people across the nation transcending racial and cultural lines, and realizing those same politicians are the common source of their pain.'"}, "time": 1742564235.3547182}
