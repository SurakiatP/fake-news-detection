Trump\u2019s first book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client\u2019s short attention span. During their first interview, Mr. Trump endured just a few minutes of Mr. Schwartz\u2019s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t tolerate doing interviews,\u201d he tells me. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. And think about this, Michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. \u201d In the latest episode of The   Mr. Schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how Mr. Trump thinks and behaves with aides to Hillary Clinton to help her prepare for Monday night\u2019s highly anticipated presidential debate. He\u2019s worried about a habit he noticed during Ms. Clinton\u2019s performance at a national security forum hosted by NBC News a week ago: \u201cWhat I would hope is that she doesn\u2019t go the same route she did with Matt Lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. It\u2019s going to turn on emotion, it\u2019s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. And the one who wins that contest wins the debate  \u2014   and probably wins the election. \u201d Mr. Schwartz offered his help to the Clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting Mr. Trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever even the score I don\u2019t think I can ever set it totally straight,\u201d he says. All he can do now, he says, is \u201csay the truth that I know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. \u201d In the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, Frank Bruni, an opinion columnist, and Amy Chozick, a reporter who has covered Mrs. Clinton for the last two years. \u201cI think of Trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,\u201d Mr. Bruni says. \u201cAnd his advisers are saying \u2018Donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.\u2019 So the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?\u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
