According the Russian Foreign Ministry, terrorists fired two mortar rounds at the embassy\u2019s compound. One shell exploded near the diplomatic mission\u2019s entrance, damaging the building and four vehicles. The attack came from terrorist-controlled Jobar district. On Friday, the Security Council addressed the incident, saying its \u201cmembers\u2026condemned in the strongest terms another mortar shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Damascus (Syrian Arab Republic), which caused significant material damage.\u201d They stressed the \u201cfundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.\u201d Host governments are obligated \u201cto take all appropriate steps to protect diplomatic and consular premises against any intrusion or damage, and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of these missions or impairment of their dignity, and to prevent any attack on diplomatic premises, agents and consular officers.\u201d Not easily done when countries are attacked by foreign-supported death squads, supplied with heavy weapons to wage war. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed concern over no \u201cinternational reaction\u2026but we will try to get it,\u201d she said, including on the platform of international organizations, because we are talking about a diplomatic mission, about systematic terrorist attacks.\u201d Russian upper house Federation Council Security and Defense Committee first deputy chairman Frants Klintesevich believes the latest shelling was conducted to disrupt Moscow\u2019s humanitarian pause, saying it failed \u2013 nor can there be an \u201coption of making any concessions to terrorists.\u201d Separately, heavily US-led Western pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the UN Human Rights Council \u2013 a body infested with major human rights abusers, including reelected member Saudi Arabia with over a three-fourths majority vote. Ignored was its genocidal war on Yemen, ruthless despotic rule tolerating no dissent, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, torture and physical abuse, public beheadings and whippings, violence against women, along with other major violations of civil and human rights. Russia, Hungary and Croatia vied for two Eastern European seats. Moscow\u2019s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said \u201c(i)t was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We\u2019ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in.\u201d Not easily as long as Washington maintains pressure to prevent it. US-led NATO\u2019s undeclared war on Russia continues. Hillary\u2019s ascension to power next year threatens to turn it red hot. Submit your review'"}, "time": 1742628402.8629518}
