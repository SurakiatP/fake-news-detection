[With over two billion pageviews generated in 2016 and 45 million unique monthly visitors, Breitbart News has now surpassed Fox News (#47) Huffington Post (#50) Washington Post (#53) and Buzzfeed (#64) in traffic.   \u201cThe numbers speak for themselves,\u201d said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. \u201cOur 2017 global expansion strategy is hands down the most aggressive growth initiative in the history of the company. We\u2019re making major capital investments to execute a series of new offerings \u2014  one of which Breitbart will announce this week. \u201d One driver of the company\u2019s explosive traffic trajectory has been its dominance across social media. Breitbart has the number one political Facebook and Twitter pages in the world, according to analytics giant NewsWhip. Yet unlike many competitors, says Breitbart News    Alex Marlow, the company\u2019s primary traffic is not disproportionately beholden to social media it comes from destination traffic. \u201cEstablishment media \u2014  the same folks who laughed off Donald Trump \u2014  are mystified by what makes Breitbart the powerhouse we\u2019ve become,\u201d said Marlow. \u201cWe\u2019ve built an authentic,   community where people come to hang out to join in the conversation that\u2019s taking place 24 hours a day. \u201d Marlow added: \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, loud, intensely savvy 45   community where we read    reporting devoid of establishment spin and then discuss, debate, and share what it all means with the world. \u201d When Breitbart relaunched its website in 2012, the publisher generated roughly 12 million pageviews a month. Today, Breitbart receives more pageviews in a single month than it previously did in an entire year. That trend is likely to continue globally. With bureaus in London, Jerusalem, Washington, California, and Texas, Breitbart is in the process of establishing news bureaus in France and Germany.'"}, "time": 1742562384.1250124}
