In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher batted back criticism of the booking by arguing that the appearance of Mr. Yiannopoulos actually helped expose the incendiary   personality\u2019s views to a wider audience and hasten his sudden downfall. Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s collapse was set in motion Sunday when a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion resurfaced a 2016 interview in which he endorsed sexual relations with boys as young as 13. Mr. Yiannopoulos  \u2014   known for a history of offensive remarks about Muslims, Jews, transgender people and other groups, and as a ringleader in a notorious incident of online harassment  \u2014   lost a speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference and a book deal with Simon  Schuster, and then said on Tuesday that he was resigning as a senior editor from Breitbart News. Mr. Maher has been dealing for days with the fallout from his booking of  Mr. Yiannopoulos. The journalist Jeremy Scahill, who had been scheduled to appear on the same episode, withdrew from the show. Mr. Maher has defended the booking on   grounds, saying last week that if Mr. Yiannopoulos was indeed a monster, \u201cnothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed. \u201d But following the show, Mr. Maher came under attack for the chummy and conciliatory vibe of his conversation with Mr. Yiannopoulos and for a panel segment, broadcast online, in which his guest made more inflammatory remarks that seemed to go unchallenged. Speaking on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher, who counts himself as a liberal, did not sound particularly chastened by these assessments. He said he knew his interview with Mr. Yiannopoulos would never be satisfactory to some viewers. \u201cNo matter what I did,\u201d he said, \u201cit was never going to be enough for that slice of liberalism that would much rather judge a friend than engage an enemy, because it\u2019s easier. \u201d Mr. Maher spoke further about the experience of having Mr. Yiannopoulos on \u201cReal Time\u201d and its aftermath, and why he will continue to seek out provocative conservative guests. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Given all that has transpired since Friday\u2019s show, how do you feel now about your decision to have Milo Yiannopoulos as a guest, and how those segments transpired? Well, let\u2019s recap. About a week ago, I went on Van Jones\u2019s show, and somebody asked me about the booking. I hadn\u2019t really gotten into the details of Milo yet. He was just getting on my radar. I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Then we had Milo on, despite the fact that many people said, \u201cOh, how dare you give a platform to this man. \u201d What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe, trying to make a buck off of the left\u2019s propensity for outrage. And by the end of the weekend, by dinnertime Monday, he\u2019s dropped as a speaker at CPAC. Then he\u2019s dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You\u2019re welcome. You think his appearance on \u201cReal Time\u201d helped lead to his downfall? That\u2019s what I was just saying. And by the way, I wasn\u2019t trying to get him removed from society. I\u2019m somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away. They were successful that one time, for six months in 23 years, because that\u2019s how long it was between the two shows [\u201cReal Time\u201d and \u201cPolitically Incorrect,\u201d Mr. Maher\u2019s previous talk show, which aired on Comedy Central and ABC]. It just rubs me the wrong way when somebody says, \u201cI don\u2019t like what this person is saying  \u2014   he should go away. \u201d Do you feel that way even about the kinds of things Milo was saying on your show, or in the other platforms he was given? Can he do damage? I suppose he can. To a degree. Not a great degree, I don\u2019t think. Could he offend people? Could he even inspire a borderline person to do something violent? I guess so. But nothing is free in life. People seem to want to live in this world where everything is a  . That\u2019s not how life works. Could there have been more accountability in your segments with him? For instance, it seemed like he was allowed to grossly understate his role in harassing Leslie Jones on Twitter.  It\u2019s not my job to hold him accountable to everything he\u2019s ever said or done. I had eight minutes with him, on the show itself. Sorry I don\u2019t have time to go over everything everybody else would want to do. We just had time to, sort of, start a discussion of the broad view of who he is. I don\u2019t think he frankly knows what he\u2019s going to say half the time, or knows what his philosophy is. But to see him as this monster is a little crazy. You know what he is? He\u2019s the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream. So how does someone deal with a personality like Milo, who is going much, much further than other guests, saying things that are demonstrably false? The president says 10 things a day that are provably wrong. If I threw everyone off my show who says things that are provably wrong, I\u2019d never book a conservative and probably half the liberals. When he said that transgender people have a \u201cpsychiatric disorder,\u201d do you just move on from that? Move on? It dominated the entire [online] segment. The other guests attacked him. When I say, \u201cThat\u2019s not unreasonable\u201d [to not want to share a bathroom with a transgender person] it\u2019s because women have said that to me: \u201cI want to know,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with someone in the bathroom, even if they, in their minds, have decided they are a woman. \u201d Doesn\u2019t that opinion count at all? But you don\u2019t agree that transgender people have a psychiatric disorder.  No, I don\u2019t agree with that. But I don\u2019t know that much about the situation. If somebody feels like they\u2019re a woman, fine, then you\u2019re a woman. I\u2019m O. K. with that. If they\u2019ve studied that, and they say it\u2019s not a psychiatric disorder, I\u2019m O. K. with that too. If that\u2019s what scientists decided, that it\u2019s not any psychological disorder, it\u2019s fine with me. I agree. Since the start of your new season, you have had other guests like Tomi Lahren and Piers Morgan  \u2014   not nearly as provocative, but with whom liberal viewers aren\u2019t likely to agree. Are you trying to create conflict on your panels, or rile up your audience? I\u2019ve never tried to push anybody\u2019s buttons. I think everybody else in TV  \u2014   everybody else who does political commentary in a comedic way  \u2014   they\u2019re all in one box. It\u2019s so predictable, what they\u2019re going to do, which is, never say anything that would make anything  \u2014   that would make any liberal give the slightest bit of discomfort. I do a show about what\u2019s happening that week in the news. Trump is president. I\u2019m glad that we have enough credibility with both sides, that people who are Trump supporters will still do the show. Going back to \u201cPolitically Incorrect,\u201d you booked conservatives like Ann Coulter and Kellyanne Conway  \u2014   \u2014   And Laura Ingraham. We had a whole cadre of blond conservatives. There was a fourth woman conservative we used to book in those days, who we kind of discovered  \u2014   her name was Arianna Huffington. Even after your experience with Milo, do you still want to have guests your viewers haven\u2019t encountered or might want to avoid? Yes. I like people who push the limits. I like people who are not afraid to take the slings and arrows, because they\u2019re going to explore what\u2019s on the edge. Now, is this guy over the edge? Yes. I mean, he\u2019s a little cuckoo. But I would rather err on that side than on the side where everybody else is.'"}, "time": 1742562609.8685136}
