There, in the third grade, he was first called \u201credskin. \u201d Did the white classmate intend it as a term of endearment, akin to buddy? Or was it used as a verbal fist, intended to hurt and to sting? \u201cA slur,\u201d said Mr. Howard, 28, a legislative associate for the National Congress of American Indians. \u201cOh, yeah. Yes. \u201d But the widespread acceptance of the term as a pejorative  \u2014   \u201cnow considered by many to be an offensive term,\u201d according to Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary  \u2014   has apparently been tossed into linguistic uncertainty by a recent Washington Post poll that centers on the name of a certain   professional football team. Suddenly, the poll seems to suggest, \u201credskin\u201d is not so bad after all, raising the question of how society should decide what constitutes a slur. After all, if the   victims of the term are not offended, then.   \u2026     According to the poll, nine of 10 Native Americans said they took no offense in the name of the Washington Redskins, a contentious, litigious issue that has pitted     advocates against the team\u2019s owner, Daniel Snyder, and Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League. In addition, the poll  \u2014   a survey of 504 people across the country  \u2014   found that more than 70 percent of those questioned said they did not consider \u201credskin\u201d to be disrespectful to Native Americans. What\u2019s more, 80 percent said they would not be offended if called that name by someone who was not an American Indian. (An interesting   might be to spend a day or two at, say, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, walking up to random members of the Oglala Lakota community and calling them \u201credskin\u201d  \u2014   and recording how well that goes over.) The poll\u2019s results have been interpreted as some kind of vindication for Mr. Snyder. It also led to a humbling admission by Robert McCartney, a longtime Washington Post journalist who had written many opinion articles calling on his favorite football team to drop the name, which he considered a racial slur. While acknowledging that he remains \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d with the term, Mr. McCartney said that \u201cit\u2019s unsettling to learn now that I vented all that energy and passion on behalf of such a small fraction of the Native American population. \u201d The connotation of words can evolve over time. Not long ago, for example, \u201cqueer\u201d was considered a pejorative for gays and lesbians now it has become what linguists call a reclaimed epithet  \u2014   a word adopted by a group in empowering defiance. In addition, accepted use might depend on the circumstances: The sharing of a certain racial slur among   does not entitle white people to use that term, so freighted is its ignominious history. Things can change in a mere generation. As a boy in Boston in the 1970s and early 1980s, Eugene Chay identified himself as Oriental, or  . It was the accepted term. \u201cI grew up using \u2018Oriental\u2019 and being referred to as \u2018Oriental,\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Chay, who is a senior staff lawyer for a civil rights organization called   Advancing Justice. But by the   Mr. Chay had become aware of a shift in the language  \u2014   of the growing sentiment that \u201cOriental\u201d was geocentric, ethnocentric, and disparaging to Asians. It was a rhetorical tool of separation and otherness, he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t refer to people in the West as Occidental,\u201d he said. \u201cI eventually reached a point in my teens where I did not want to be referred to as Oriental, and where I took to task people who referred to me as Oriental. I asked to be referred to as Asian. \u201d But redskin? Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, who served as an expert for Native Americans petitioning to have the federal government cancel the Washington Redskins organization\u2019s trademark registration, said the term was a qualified form of a reclaimed epithet. Some scholastic teams in Indian country have nicknames that include Redskins and Braves, he said, sort of as a way to say, \u201cIf you want redskin savages, then we\u2019ll give you redskin savages. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s used in those schools in that reclaimed way,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t license its use by third parties. \u201d The term has come to be associated with hostility, and savagery, and a m\u00e9lange of popular culture stereotypes that include \u201cF Troop\u201d and \u201cDavy Crockett,\u201d removed in some way from the fact of sustained genocide and mistreatment. \u201cA word can be offensive simply because of its history,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pluck this term out of its history and say, \u2018Because my intentions are honorable, it\u2019s O. K.\u2019\u201d Debra Krol, a journalist in Arizona and an enrolled member of the Xolon Salinan Tribe, on the central coast of California, characterized the opposition to the term as symptomatic of the broader movement by blacks, Latinos and   to \u201cstrip our language of these terms that are offensive, demeaning. \u201d \u201cThese terms make it easier for people to think of us Indians as not really Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cKind of like   of a person that blacks used to be under the U. S. Constitution. \u201d Ms. Krol also said there was disagreement among American Indians about the seriousness of the issue. \u201cThere are a lot of people out there who have a problem with it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are a lot of other people who really don\u2019t care either way  \u2014   who say we have bigger problems to worry about than a sports team\u2019s mascot and a name. \u201d But Tara Houska, a tribal lawyer and a member of the Couchiching First Nation in Canada, along the Minnesota border, pointed out that during the American Indian Movement of the 1960s, tribal leaders across the country cited mascots and team names like the Redskins and the Cleveland Indians as racist and dehumanizing. \u201cThis goes back long before I was born,\u201d said Ms. Houska, 32, who helped organize a protest in Minneapolis in 2014 against the appropriation of Indian culture for team names and mascots. She questioned the methodology of the Post poll  \u2014   which mirrored the results of a poll conducted in 2004 by the Annenberg Public Policy Center  \u2014   saying that a survey of 504 people could hardly represent the feelings of 5. 2 million Native Americans. She also said that those who clung to family lore  \u2014   of, say, being part Cherokee on their mother\u2019s side  \u2014   had experiences profoundly different from those who actually lived the Native American life, whether on or off a reservation. And, she said, the damage has been documented. A decade ago, the American Psychological Association recommended the immediate retirement of Native American mascots and symbols, in part because they appear \u201cto have a negative impact on the   of American Indian children. \u201d Ms. Houska, who lives in Washington, said she was bracing for all the people who would be waving the poll in her face  \u2014   \u201cthe poll, the poll, the poll\u201d  \u2014   and saying she had no right to be offended by the name of the local football team. That the matter is even up for debate baffles her. \u201cIt\u2019s a   slur,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a   racial slur. It should be a    \u2014   but somehow, it\u2019s not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561773.798366}
