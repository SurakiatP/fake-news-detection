The dog\u2019s owner finds himself in legal trouble and may lose his rights to the dog. [Witnesses discovered Anabella, a    German   mix, locked inside a car in Manor, Texas, where temperatures reached a   109 degrees, CBSDFW reported. Manor is located just east of the state\u2019s capital city, Austin.  After freeing the puppy, officials transported her to a local veterinarian, Dr. Katharine Lund, at the Austin Animal Center. Lund told reporters the puppy was near death when she received it. However, after receiving treatment, little Annabella is showing signs of a \u201cmiraculous recovery,\u201d the Dallas CBS affiliate reported. She said that when a dog gets heat stroke, it is very difficult to get them back. Police arrested Annabella\u2019s owner. Police identified the man as    Chandler Allen Bullen. KVUE reported Bullen told police he left the puppy in the car without the engine running because he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to waste gas. \u201d He faces charges of cruelty to a   animal. \u201cWhen we find these animals in the car, they are either on the ground or on the floor board, at the lowest point of the car because obviously heat rises,\u201d Austin Police Animal Cruelty Officer Alan Schwettmann told the reporter. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what people are thinking  \u2014  maybe they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going into a location and just going to be there for a minute. \u201d As for Annabelle, \u201cShe\u2019s running around the exam room, wagging her tail  \u2014   she ate all of her food. \u201d Dr. Lund told the Austin ABC affiliate. \u201cShe\u2019s very healthy. She\u2019s very lucky. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas. He is a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.
