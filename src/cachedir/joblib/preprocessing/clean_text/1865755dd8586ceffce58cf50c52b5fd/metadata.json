Despite the fact that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s children are frequent surrogates for their father, they have not dug into their wallets for his White House run. \\nAccording to The Daily Beast , the sum total of donations from Trump\u2019s four adult children is $376.20. That amount came from Eric Trump and was described as an in-kind donation for meals. But he was reimbursed the same amount that same day. \\nThe Trump kids have donated large sums for political causes in the past. According to a 2015 report by OpenSecrets.org : Daughter Ivanka Trump has donated over $130,000 to Republicans and Democrats; Son Donald Trump, Jr. has donated more than $80,000 to candidates and committees from both sides of the aisle; Son Eric Trump has given approximately $51,000, mostly to Republicans, and Trump\u2019s youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, is not listed in the report. \\nIt\u2019s not just Trump\u2019s family that has refrained from donating to his campaign. Also missing from the Trump-donor rolls, according to The Daily Beast , are such prominent surrogates as Rudy Giuliani, Ben Carson, and Newt Gingrich. \\nMeanwhile, The Daily Beast also notes, Trump is raking in lots of dough from small contributors: \u201cWhen the Trump campaign began soliciting online donations in June , the candidate asked for a paltry $10 from each contributor\u2014an appeal his millionaire kids didn\u2019t respond to. The request resulted in a quick $3 million haul from his supporters though. And by September, Trump had paid his own businesses around $8.2 million , comprised of rent, food, and facilities and payroll for corporate staffers. He even used tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations to buy copies of his own book .\u201d \\nMaybe Trump\u2019s inner circle hasn\u2019t donated because they know where the money\u2019s really going. \\nThe Young Turks\u2019 Cenk Uygur explains further how Trump uses campaign donations to line his own pockets: \\nWatch this interview with the entire Trump clan : \\n\\nFeatured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube Video.
