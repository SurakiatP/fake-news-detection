This is who we are as Americans  \u2014   we take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited. Yet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices. As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people. This has to change. We need a government that spends on the right things  \u2014   the safety, security, and   of our people  \u2014   and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas  \u2014   of which, perhaps, there are too many. My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness. The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers. We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare. We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities. And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security. We will grow our economy it is growing already. It will grow faster than you\u2019ve seen it in decades. That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world. We are going to make sure the men and women on the front lines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure. At home, we are going to give our ICE officers  \u2014   who have done an incredible job  \u2014   and our Border Patrol agents  \u2014   who are amazing people  \u2014   everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all. It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free, and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams. We don\u2019t want   roving our streets, we\u2019re getting rid of them by the thousands, they\u2019re going to be out of here. But I\u2019m proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety, and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come. Thank you very much. You\u2019re going to love the end result. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628492.2318294}
