[Kerry called the Iran deal\u2019s monitoring processes a \u201csystem that\u2019s working,\u201d according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and criticized President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress for pushing for new sanctions against the Iranian regime.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, folks, to risk a step that gets us nothing,\u201d Kerry said of proposed new sanctions on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, according to the Chronicle. Kerry also blasted the Trump administration for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords, the Obama administration\u2019s other major foreign policy legacy. He reportedly defended his 2014 remark that climate change was a \u201cweapon of mass destruction\u201d and a threat to national security. \u201cScientists, people whose life is invested in this are telling you, \u2018This is growing in instability, and the threat is that whole parts of the ice sheet will break off. \u2019,\u201d Kerry said, according to the Chronicle. As Breitbart News\u2019 Aaron Klein reported a year ago, the Ploughshares Fund has been sponsoring national security coverage at National Public Radio (NPR) since 2005, as well as several think tanks that supported the Iran deal. It is also, Klein reported, funded in turn by George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations. NPR\u2019s ombudsman found it had not disclosed Ploughshares funding in reporting on the group and interviewing its president and sponsored experts. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
