[Marlow saluted the work done by Schweizer and his Government Accountability Institute as \u201csome of the most essential reporting of the 2016 election,\u201d and said they collected a \u201cmajor scalp\u201d this week with the end of the CGI.  \u201cThank you, Alex. Certainly Breitbart was right there. I cannot imagine how many stories \u2014  it\u2019s got to be north of a hundred stories on Clinton corruption \u2014  played an essential role,\u201d Schweizer said. He said the shutdown of the Clinton Global Initiative was a \u201cremarkable event,\u201d because \u201cthe Clintons have essentially made it so obvious that there\u2019s a connection between this   charitable activity, CGI, and their political fortunes. \u201d Schweizer went on: They didn\u2019t even wait until the election was a distant memory to say, you know what, we\u2019re going to wrap this up. They ended it immediately. I think it\u2019s just further confirmation to what we always believed, which is that their charitable activities really were directly linked to their political power, and now that that political power is gone, really honestly for the first time in 25 years  \u2014   think about that  \u2014   25 years the Clintons have been on the national political stage. They\u2019re gone, and they\u2019re essentially saying, \u2018Look, there\u2019s no need or purpose behind doing this charitable work, so we\u2019re just going to shut it down.\u2019 It\u2019s a pretty remarkable step on their part. Schweizer chuckled at Marlow\u2019s suggestion that the Clintons should have kept their organization running for a little while, with a few   boasts about how it was \u201cstronger than ever,\u201d just to maintain appearances. He said: No, they just rolled it up, and you\u2019re exactly right, they didn\u2019t pretend. In a matter of weeks from the election results \u2014  it\u2019s pretty stunning. I think we\u2019ve also now got the Clinton Foundation itself, which is involved with CGI obviously, but they\u2019re essentially separate entities. Their donations are way off. They\u2019ve got a lot of foreign donations, the government of Australia for example, and Germany, who are essentially saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to donate any more.\u2019 Donations are down by some accounts by 70%. So it may be that the Clinton Foundation goes the way of CGI. \u201cOr it could be, which I think is probably more likely \u2014  I just can\u2019t imagine them completely folding up their tent \u2014  I think it will be sort of a shadow of its former self, maybe   the size of what it once was,\u201d he ventured. \u201cBecause let\u2019s face it, what we talked about has been confirmed by the Podesta emails, it\u2019s been confirmed by these events: if they can\u2019t sell access to political power, they just don\u2019t have a product, in the form of their form of philanthropy, that people want to donate to. \u201d  \u201cThat presents an essential problem. That means they have to seek some office somewhere so they can still sell access. Does Chelsea now have to bring the next generation forth, so they can continue with this political apparatus? There\u2019s a lot of talk of that, that Chelsea\u2019s going to run for Congress, potentially in two years,\u201d Schweizer noted. He expressed some appreciation for the difficult road Chelsea Clinton has walked, pointing out that the leaked emails from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta portrayed her as one of the few   people in the Clinton Foundation who realized something fishy was going on, and called for extensive audits. \u201cBill and Hillary were fine with what was going on, the aides around them were fine. It was really Chelsea who was pushing this reform agenda. So I give her credit for that,\u201d Schweizer said, before going on to agree with Marlow that she lacks the \u201cpresence\u201d for a successful political career, even from a   Manhattan precinct controlled by the Democrat machine. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got to show you\u2019ve got the chops to actually get things done for your district in Congress  \u2026     that you have a certain innate strength and an ability to perform. I don\u2019t think the celebrity is going to be enough,\u201d he judged. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to prove that. \u201d He said Chelsea Clinton\u2019s only guaranteed campaign asset would be \u201ca lot of money, because the Clinton financial network is there. \u201d \u201cHillary Clinton did not win in November, but remember, Alex, they raised a lot of money for that race,\u201d Schweizer pointed out. \u201cTheir ability to raise a lot of money for Chelsea I don\u2019t think should be underestimated. \u201d He said that beyond vague hopes of launching Chelsea\u2019s political career, it remained a \u201cgreat mystery\u201d where the Clintons would go from here. Schweizer pointed out: Really since 1992, they have been part of the national conversation. Bill ran for President, he said you\u2019re getting two for one, so he made it clear immediately that Hillary was going to be a political player as well. They leave the White House just as Hillary enters the U. S. Senate. She then runs for president in 2008 and loses. She then becomes Secretary of State. And other than this window between January of 2013, up until she announced her campaign in 2015, they have been in political office with political power. I think it\u2019s very hard to give that up, once you\u2019ve had it. Schweizer said he doubted Hillary Clinton would try another presidential run in 2020, and that even \u201cpeople in the echo chamber around them\u201d would point out her advancing age and weakness on the campaign trail in 2016. He also suggested there was resentment of Clinton within the Democratic Party itself.  \u201cWe know they had the election wired against Bernie Sanders. We know they\u2019ve got a lot of allies. But there is a lot of bubbling resentment among the Democratic grassroots that the Clintons need to go. They had their turn, they had their chance. A lot of Democrats are convinced that if they just had a different candidate, they could have beat Donald Trump. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, but I think there\u2019s a lot of that thought out there,\u201d he said. Schweizer predicted: So they may be thinking about some run for higher office again, but I just don\u2019t think the Democratic Party is the same party of the 1990s. I think we\u2019re going to see them \u2014  probably kicking and screaming \u2014  fade into history. I just don\u2019t see this as a dynasty like the Bush dynasty, for example, where you\u2019ve got a sort of    generation that can potentially run for national office. The Clintons just simply don\u2019t have that, and I think we\u2019re going to see them fade into history, essentially. As for his own future plans, Schweizer said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about government ethics under the new administration, although he noted he pushed hard for   Trump to fully divest his assets, a path he chose not to pursue. \u201cIn that sense I\u2019m disappointed, but really, honestly Alex, when you look what he has done, he has gone far beyond what I believe the legal requirements were for him to do. So I give him a lot of credit for that,\u201d he said. Schweizer asked of Trump\u2019s children and associates: I think really now it\u2019s going to come down to that whole issue of performance. How do they handle these issues?\u2019 If the kids are offered a sweetheart deal, if they have a chance to do something and think that it can go undetected, are they going to be tempted, or are they going to take that deal? That\u2019s really what it comes down to. You can set up all kinds of structures, you can say all kinds of things, but as we\u2019ve seen in the past with other presidents, people when they want to make a buck at the public\u2019s expense, they\u2019re going to find a quick way around it. \u201cSo I count myself right now cautiously optimistic. I love the Trump message of \u2018drain the swamp.\u2019 I think there\u2019s some very serious things that he is looking at, that could get bipartisan support, to work to drain the swamp. If for no other reason, think about this: Donald Trump is the first candidate, I would have to say going back more than 30 years if not longer, who is not really beholden to the money class in Washington D. C. The lobbyists, the PACs \u2014  they didn\u2019t give him money, so he doesn\u2019t feel like he owes them anything,\u201d Schweizer said.
