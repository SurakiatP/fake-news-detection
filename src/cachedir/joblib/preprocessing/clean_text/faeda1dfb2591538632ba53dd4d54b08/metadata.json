What is unusual is the patience that Paramount\u2019s corporate owner has afforded the studio. In addition to \u201c\u201d \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,\u201d \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot\u201d and \u201cZoolander 2\u201d failed to find audiences for Paramount. \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d has been a hit. But domestic ticket sales for that film trail its series predecessor by 36 percent. (\u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d is still rolling out in major markets overseas.) On Friday, as Viacom ousted its chief executive, a media analyst, Michael Nathanson, called Paramount a \u201ctruly shocking\u201d problem, noting in a report that the studio may lose $350 million this year. Paramount did protect itself financially on \u201c \u201d by teaming with    which paid for 80 percent of the production costs. Paramount also believes that \u201c \u201d can take in $100 million overseas. \u201cMovies like \u2018Ghostbusters,\u2019 \u2018Independence Day\u2019 and \u2018 \u2019 certainly looked like they were going to be big going into the summer, but audiences, especially in the world of remakes, have been very tough,\u201d Rob Moore, Paramount\u2019s vice chairman, said in a phone interview on Sunday. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov and counting Mark Burnett as a producer, \u201c \u201d appeared to run into several problems. It was a poorly reviewed remake of a celebrated classic for which few were clamoring. Moviegoers have also generally ignored    epics in recent years. In terms of turnaround efforts at Paramount, Mr. Moore pointed toward coming films like \u201cJack Reacher: Never Go Back,\u201d with Tom Cruise \u201cArrival,\u201d a   thriller and \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of the August Wilson play starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis that is seen as an Oscar candidate. For the weekend, \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d (Warner Bros.) was again the No. 1 ticket seller. It took in about $20. 7 million, for a   domestic total of $262. 3 million, according to comScore. (Overseas, \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d has taken in $310. 4 million.) Among new   the   comedic drama \u201cWar Dogs\u201d (Warner Bros.) performed the best. Costing at least $45 million to make, \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d which received mediocre reviews, collected an estimated $14. 3 million. The animated movie \u201cKubo and the Two Strings\u201d (Focus Features) which delighted most critics and cost Laika Entertainment $55 million to make, arrived to about $12. 6 million in ticket sales.'"}, "time": 1742563388.1668675}
