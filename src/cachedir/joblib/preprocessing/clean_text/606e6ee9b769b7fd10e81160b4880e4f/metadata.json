But for these viewers, there was an even bigger problem. The women\u2019s march had drawn an estimated   people to Washington, and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country, dominating the nation\u2019s news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march. Since then, the organizers of that march have been telling their followers: You\u2019d better turn out on Friday. This year\u2019s   march in Washington  \u2014   the 44th annual March for Life  \u2014   was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories. The new president, Donald J. Trump, is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of   measures. He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago. And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider. But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year\u2019s event, with   organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come,\u201d said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington. National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year\u2019s event will have two major draws: Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward. Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year, there is   energy this year. One of the largest turnouts was in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself. Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650, 000 marchers showed up. But for this and every year, the March for Life organization itself played it conservative, estimating that the marchers numbered in \u201cthe tens of thousands. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that these numbers are the most important,\u201d said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in a telephone interview. \u201cThe number most important for us is 58 million, which is the number of Americans that have been lost to abortion. \u201d She said that calls and emails began pouring into March for Life\u2019s offices last Sunday from women who are opposed to abortion and were disturbed to see the strong abortion rights message coming from the stage of the women\u2019s march in Washington. \u201cWe are hearing from a lot of women who felt like their voices weren\u2019t represented last weekend,\u201d said Mrs. Mancini, who called in volunteers to handle the deluge. But it is unclear whether that anger will translate into attendance at the March for Life. Though many marchers come to the city by car or train, one gauge of expected attendance  \u2014   bus parking permits  \u2014   suggests the event will be smaller than last weekend\u2019s women\u2019s march. As of Wednesday only 92 permits had been issued for the March for Life, according to Events DC and the city\u2019s Department of Transportation, which handle the permits. Some 1, 800 permits were issued for the women\u2019s march, and 450 for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the transportation department said. The march has become an increasingly youthful event, attracting busloads of college, high school and middle school students from across the country, many from Catholic and evangelical Christian schools. This year, the University of Notre Dame, the famed Catholic college in Indiana, is sending 700 students on 13 charter buses, one of the largest campus contingents, said Emily Burns, vice president of communications with Notre Dame Right to Life. She said that she and many of her club members shared many of the feminist goals of the women\u2019s march, such as preventing sexual assault and violence against women, and were uncomfortable being seen as in competition with the women\u2019s march. \u201cThis definitely is not a competition for us,\u201d Ms. Burns said. \u201cBut we are hoping that with the numbers we bring year after year, maybe we receive a bit more coverage this year. \u201d There is widespread resentment in the   movement that the media has not devoted much coverage to the March for Life in the past, perhaps because it happens every year. This year, a large coalition of   groups have banded together to pressure television and cable networks to devote the same kind of media coverage to the March for Life as they devoted to the women\u2019s march. Still, compared with   supporters, organizers of Friday\u2019s march may have a smaller base of people to draw from. A survey released by the Pew Research Center in October found that 59 percent of Americans said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Although there were wide gaps between Democrats and Republicans, overall support for legal abortion was at its highest level since 1995, the survey found. At Georgetown University, which is a Catholic and Jesuit college, Ms. Irvine is expecting only 30 to 40 students to attend the March for Life, despite her group\u2019s efforts. Some students who would have wanted to attend could not, she said, because Friday is a class day and the university would not excuse absences from classes or labs to attend the march. The numbers appear far lower than Georgetown\u2019s turnout for the women\u2019s march, said Ms. Irvine: \u201cOur entire school basically went. \u201d She said it would be unfair to compare the size of the two marches, however, because Washington is a liberal city in which a vast majority of residents voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. \u201cI do think there will be comparison,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it will be an accurate representation of what the public actually thinks. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561890.5484915}
