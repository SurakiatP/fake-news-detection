The driver of Bus No. 366, the child added, drove so that it felt \u201clike the bus is going to flip over. \u201d And when a student stood in the aisle, the child wrote, the driver \u201cstops the bus and he makes people hit their head. \u201d Five days later, the bus driver, Johnthony K. Walker, driving 37 children home from Woodmore, strayed from his route and crashed, leaving six children dead in one of the country\u2019s deadliest school bus wrecks in recent years. The crash, for which Mr. Walker has been charged with vehicular homicide, is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Chattanooga police. Records released Friday night by the Hamilton County Department of Education showed that Mr. Walker\u2019s behavior was a frequent worry this semester. In a statement, the school district acknowledged that its records contained \u201cmany emails of complaint and concern. \u201d Mr. Walker, 24, is not a district employee and instead worked for Durham School Services, a contractor based in Illinois that says it carries more than one million schoolchildren each day. Complaints about Mr. Walker flowed into  \u2014   and from  \u2014   Woodmore. In September, a parent, Jasmine Mateen, wrote to a teacher that the bus driver was cursing students and slamming on his brakes, \u201cmaking them hit they heads and fall out\u201d of their seats. \u201cHe did intentional stuff to them kids on the bus all the time,\u201d Ms. Mateen said in an interview on Tuesday, a day after one of her    daughters was killed in the wreck. Two of Ms. Mateen\u2019s other children were injured. More than a month after Ms. Mateen\u2019s letter, one of Woodmore\u2019s behavioral specialists investigated when Mr. Walker complained about disrespectful students. According to the records released, the specialist, Carlis Shackelford, said that Mr. Walker \u201cstated he did not care about the students and proceeded to tell the students he did not care about them. \u201d An administrator spoke with Mr. Walker soon afterward. About the time that school officials wrote emails expressing alarm about how often Mr. Walker was making referrals for behavioral issues aboard his bus, they also documented concerns about his driving. \u201cOn Tuesday,   the driver, in my opinion, was driving way too fast when he pulled out of our school,\u201d Woodmore\u2019s principal, Brenda   wrote in an email on Nov. 11. \u201cIt was not as bad as yesterday, but still not optimal. \u201d On Nov. 16, records show, the principal warned in an email that six students had reported that Mr. Walker \u201cwas swerving and purposely trying to cause them to fall today. \u201d A Chattanooga police officer, in an arrest affidavit that was released on Tuesday, said that Mr. Walker had been driving \u201cat a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 m. p. h. \u201d on Monday afternoon. The police said Wednesday that Mr. Walker, who had been involved in a minor bus accident in September, was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the Monday\u2019s wreck. Durham has not responded to questions about its hiring practices or Mr. Walker\u2019s tenure in his   job. On Wednesday, the company\u2019s chief executive, David A. Duke, apologized for the wreck and said Durham would \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with investigators. The school district said Friday that it \u201cdoes not have any records of any accidents or disciplinary records pertaining to Durham employees. \u201d A spokeswoman for Durham, Molly Hart, said the company had no comment about the documents the school district released.'"}, "time": 1742563203.8811905}
