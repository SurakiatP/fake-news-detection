UK Telegraph Cardinal Vincent Nichols said immigrants had been enduring a worsening \u201catmosphere of fear\u201d in the months since the EU referendum with the members of the public casually voicing hatred in a \u201cself-indulgent\u201d way. (Self-indulgent? I wonder what this French priest would have to say about that?) H e accused politicians of \u201ctrading in fear\u201d and said media stories constantly portraying immigration in a negative light were proving \u201ccorrosive of our best nature\u201d. In an interview with the BBC , he insisted that increasingly secular British society could learn much from the faith of new arrivals whether Muslims or followers of other religions. \u201cOf course what we have to learn too is from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith that comes here. H e added: \u201cI think the immigration crisis is real and it needs concerted effort to address it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be addressed realistically with resources and proper legislation, but it\u2019s almost impossible to do that in an atmosphere in which fear and hatred are the dominant features. \u201cIt does nobody any good, this somewhat self-indulgent way in which people have begun to express themselves and their distaste and their hatred of people who they see as different. \u201cAnd that is creating a culture of fear among people who have been welcomed here.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628563.645956}
