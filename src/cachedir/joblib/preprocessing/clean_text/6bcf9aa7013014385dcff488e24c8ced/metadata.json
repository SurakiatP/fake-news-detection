However, it only took one observant passenger\u2019s quick glance to realize the entire flight was in trouble after he spotted what was on a Muslim man\u2019s phone. \\nAutumn Lynn was aboard the flight when she heard a man three rows behind her begin to scream for a flight attendant. It quickly became clear that an \u201colder man of Middle Eastern descent\u201d had been texting a friend about a bomb on the plane \u2013 and the petrified man immediately freaked. \\n\u201cWe are about to take off and three rows behind me there is a man of Middle Eastern descent that sent a message from his phone which said \u2018the bombs are ready,\u2019\u201d Autumn explained on a Facebook Live video, which was taken while she was on the plane, according to Daily Mail . \u201cThey have brought us back to the gate, and we\u2019re waiting to be evacuated. He\u2019s still on the plane.\u201d \\nEventually, the pilot declared an emergency evacuation and passengers were taken off of the plane. Autumn witnessed the flight attendants confiscating the man\u2019s cell phone until the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies arrived, nearly two hours later. \\n\u201cThey pulled the man off the plane, he was an older man, of Middle Eastern descent,\u201d Autumn explained. \u201cThey ripped him out of the seat and dragged him off the plane.\u201d \\nThe Sheriff\u2019s deputies confirmed the aircraft was checked for any threat and cleared. Thankfully, the man\u2019s texts were false. Unfortunately, for the passengers on the plane, their departure was delayed for over six hours before it took off for their final destination of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. Reportedly, no arrests were made. \\nAlthough nothing resulted from this particular incident, it\u2019s better that the proper precautions were taken by both the flight crew and the deputies to ensure nothing happened on the plane. It\u2019s better to be safe than to be sorry \u2013especially when we\u2019re talking about the lives of many innocent people.'"}, "time": 1742562353.900548}
