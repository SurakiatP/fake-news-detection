Donald Trump won those three states by a narrow margin and without them, he would have lost. \\nThere\u2019s a movement to ask the Justice Department to demand the audits, but they might not have to. Help is coming from a surprising source, the Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. She\u2019s calling for a recount in those three states and we can help her get one. \\n\u201cAfter a divisive and painful presidential race,\u201d the Green Party candidate said in a statement, \u201creported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable.\u201d It's official: Jill Stein announces plans to file for a recount in PA, MI & WI. From her release: pic.twitter.com/Yh0gcVBPOR \\n\u2014 Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) November 23, 2016 \\nStein may have a case: \\nLast Thursday, the activists held a conference call with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign general counsel Marc Elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. While it\u2019s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review \u2014 especially in light of the fact that the Obama White House has accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee. \\nSource: NY Magazine \\nThe math would still be tight. Michigan\u2019s count still isn\u2019t complete, but it\u2019s likely that their 16 electoral votes would add to Trump\u2019s 290. If those three states were suddenly to suddenly turn blue (Trump won the three states with a combined vote difference of just over 100,000), Trump would have 260 electoral votes and Clinton would have a total of 278 electoral votes. 270 are needed to win. \\nStein wouldn\u2019t end up winning the election, no matter what. It\u2019s hard to imagine what her motive would be, other than transparency and regardless of how you feel about her, that\u2019s laudable. \\nWhat she\u2019s lacking so far is money. She needs to raise $2 million by Friday at 4:00 PM Central Time. So far, she\u2019s raised less than 10 percent of that. \\nDoing something like this may have its downsides, although not too far down. The confidence in the Electoral College is already eroding. There\u2019s no reason at all that three midwestern states should prevent the clear popular winner from becoming President. The biggest risk is that disgruntled Trump supporters could lash out, but they are lashing out as winners, so let\u2019s not let that stop us from taking the time to ensure that our democracy stays intact. \""}, "time": 1742562191.4950485}
