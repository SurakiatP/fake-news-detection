Creatures of chiaroscuro, they conquer and retreat, like Garbo, turn chameleonic in company, like Brando, alternating sullen disgruntlement with outright  . Beards may be involved. Gloss stars, by contrast, eat up the light like a cat sunbathing on a windowsill. They strut with the   ease of toddlers showing off to their parents. Think of the peacock thrill of being looked at that John Travolta evinces in \u201cGrease\u201d or Tom Hanks in \u201cBig\u201d or Jennifer Lawrence in anything besides \u201cThe Hunger Games. \u201d Theirs is an egoless egotism that, by dint of the generosity with which it is offered up, yields audiences the promise of transcended, liberated self. Here, have me. Alan Cumming is the latter. His new book, YOU GOTTA GET BIGGER DREAMS: My Life in Stories and Pictures (Rizzoli, $29. 95) is a scrapbook of photographs taken by the actor over the years, accompanied by biographical sketches of what he was up to at the time  \u2014   prose selfies for a kind of   memoir. Here is a shot of Glenn Close\u2019s \u201ctotally smoking ripped back\u201d on the red carpet at the Tonys. Here is Eva Mendes\u2019s cleavage at the Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles. Here is a blurry shot of Oprah snapped in the star\u2019s tail winds at an Elie Wiesel Foundation dinner in her honor. \u201cVery famous people create whirlwinds,\u201d he notes, and kicks his book off with a Force 7 gale: Hurricane Liz, whom he runs into at Carrie Fisher\u2019s birthday party and soon has cackling \u201clike a trucker who\u2019d just heard a good fart joke. \u201d The book ends, some 250 pages later, with the actor\u2019s being barged out of the way by Diana Ross making a beeline for the dance floor at an Oscar party. \u201cThe song she was so desperate to dance to was one of her own!\u201d he notes. \u201cTalk about being in the middle of a chain reaction. \u201d There is a tradition of stars turning paparazzi  \u2014   Jeff Bridges has taken beautiful photographs on and off the movie set. There\u2019s a tradition, too, of British performers going to Hollywood and returning with their wits intact to write up the experience in   memoirs: David Niven set the bar with \u201cThe Moon\u2019s a Balloon. \u201d Quentin Crisp turned his   humor into a cottage industry. Cumming has already proved himself a gifted writer with \u201cNot My Father\u2019s Son,\u201d wringing humor from the hard facts of his upbringing in Scotland, not least his brute of a father, who used to shear him with clippers, like a sheep. Cumming Sr. makes a brief appearance at the start of this book, too, sneering at the little plastic Kodak camera that his son wins in a church raffle: \u201cGet on with that grass\u201d  \u2014   an instruction to which the rest of the book might be said to raise a puckish middle finger. \u201cI am a sensualist,\u201d he writes. \u201cI understand the need to let go. \u201d There is a curious innocence to his pictures of drag queens and   boys snapped on trawls through the dive bars and strip joints of Lower Manhattan, which he eats up \u201clike a deprived child. \u201d What makes Cumming unusual is that the powers of observation that make him a good writer haven\u2019t canceled out the instincts for pleasure that propel him out into the world. He has advanced and found a retreat within himself, as all artists must, throwing his own   to which we are all luckily invited. Think of this book as the goody bag you get to take home afterward. \u201cI had never seen my name engraved on a dildo before,\u201d Cumming writes of his haul from the Fleshbot Awards. \u201cAnd I had never received an award that I could potentially penetrate myself with, safely at least. \u201d It\u2019s that \u201csafely\u201d that sets you thinking. He never does get around to finishing his father\u2019s lawn. If celebrity is the biggest party the ego can throw, then the example set by Bill Murray takes the principle a step further, asking: Can the ego crash its own party? In THE TAO OF BILL MURRAY:   Stories of Joy, Enlightenment, and Party Crashing (Random House, $26) the Rolling Stone contributing editor Gavin Edwards tracks the mysterious   sightings of the comedian made by the public for years. The Scandinavian exchange students\u2019 party he crashed near St. Andrews Links in 2006, where he ended up washing the dishes. The   international conference on biodiversity and conservation Murray dropped in on to talk about sturgeon. The music festival in Austin where he popped up behind the bar in 2010, pouring people tequila regardless of their order. The list goes on: a game of kickball on Roosevelt Island, a snowball fight in upstate New York. Typically, festivities end when Murray slips away with the words \u201cNo one will ever believe you. \u201d Edwards has saved some of us a lot of work. Murray watchers have been keeping unofficial scrapbooks of this activity for years, and like many of us, the author suspects there is more going on here than the   irrepressibility that has long lightened his forays to the golf course  \u2014   using spectators\u2019 sweaters to polish his balls, for instance  \u2014   although Edwards includes these, for good measure. \u201cOur   trickster god,\u201d he writes, \u201cBill isn\u2019t just being a clown. He has a tao, a way of being, a philosophy of life. \u201d Murray\u2019s deus ex machina   are an attempt, in Edwards\u2019s formulation, \u201cto make real life more like the movies. \u201d He takes careful note of the courses in French and philosophy Murray took at the Sorbonne in the years following his \u201cGhostbusters\u201d success, where he was exposed to the teachings of the   thinker George Gurdjieff, who argued that most of us sleepwalk through our waking lives it is the task of the freethinker to wake us up. There\u2019s no record of these   calls ever being unwelcome, although one Williamsburg hipster, disgruntled to find Murray at a Halloween party with the band MGMT, does accuse him of making \u201cpoor life choices. \u201d The bulk of the activity postdates the end of Murray\u2019s second marriage in 2008, but as with his screen performances, the dusting of midlife melancholy adds rather than subtracts from the stories. My favorite has Murray driving a golf cart around the streets of Stockholm with two drunken Swedes singing Cat Stevens\u2019s \u201cFather and Son\u201d until they are stopped by the police. \u201cBill\u2019s explanation that he was a golfer proved insufficient,\u201d Edwards writes, which may be one of my favorite sentences in any film book this year. There have been greater, weightier testaments to the art of cinema published in 2016  \u2014   Edwards\u2019s book is no more than a magazine article, really, padded out with a bio of the comedian and a slightly redundant filmography  \u2014   but for sheer dopamine release, it\u2019s hard to beat. Tippi Hedren puts gossips out of their misery early on in her memoir, TIPPI (  $28. 99): Barely 37 pages in and here is Alfred Hitchcock, \u201cshorter and even rounder than I was expecting,\u201d casting the    model in \u201cThe Birds\u201d after seeing her in a Sego commercial. What follows has long been the subject of Hollywood rumor and inspired a 2012 TV film, \u201cThe Girl,\u201d so Hedren\u2019s decision to break her silence on her director\u2019s \u201cobsessive, often embarrassingly ardent, often cruel behavior\u201d is a significant addition to our current   conversation on sexual assault. Fixing Hedren with an \u201cunwavering stare\u201d wherever she went on set, Hitchcock instructed her   \u201cDo not touch The Girl,\u201d had her followed and  \u2014   creepiest of all  \u2014   had a \u201clife mask\u201d of her face made for his own personal use. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this,\u201d Hitchcock\u2019s wife, Alma, confides in her at one point. Jay Presson Allen, the writer of her subsequent film with the director, \u201cMarnie,\u201d pleads, \u201cCan\u2019t you love him just a little?\u201d Finally, after a series of \u201cexcruciating\u201d encounters in her dressing room and a fumble in the back of his limo, he summons her to his office and assaults her. \u201cIt was sexual, it was perverse, and it was ugly,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ll ruin your career,\u201d Hitchcock threatens upon being rebuffed, and then proceeds to do just that, denying her opportunities to appear opposite David Niven and Marlon Brando in \u201cBedtime Story\u201d and in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cFahrenheit 451. \u201d But the rest of the book (written with Lindsay Harrison) is not without incident. Hedren marries her manager the pair grow obsessed with lions, start a small animal sanctuary in their backyard and plow every penny into a film epic starring the beasts. A decade in the making, \u201cRoar\u201d has the scent of genuine insanity, involving multiple trips to the E. R. after the cats attack Hedren\u2019s daughter, Melanie Griffith the cinematographer Jan de Bont (later to direct \u201cSpeed\u201d) and Hedren herself, who is mauled by a leopard named Pepper. \u201cI sat on the floor with my eyes tightly closed and held perfectly still while I felt his claws on my right thigh, followed by his sandpaper tongue licking honey off my cheek,\u201d she recalls, in slightly more detail than her mauling by Hitchcock. At least Pepper didn\u2019t block her from working with Truffaut. Bryan Cranston\u2019s memoir, A LIFE IN PARTS (Scribner, $27) suffers from the lopsidedness that afflicts any account of   fame  \u2014   Cranston was 51 when he took the role of Walter White in AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which made him a global star. But Cranston is a   storyteller, practiced enough in his skills of   to make those five decades pull their weight. Determined not to repeat the path of his father, an actor who appeared on TV shows and in a movie about killer grasshoppers before succumbing to terminal resentment, young Cranston works as a farmhand, learning the correct way to kill a chicken he sees a cadaver split open while a trainee for the Los Angeles Police Department learns how to spot shoppers from thieves while working as a security guard (\u201cShoppers move quickly. Thieves have a slower pace\u201d) and is motorcycling down the Eastern Seaboard when, seeking refuge from a storm, he reads \u201cHedda Gabler\u201d in one sitting. As he drifts off to sleep that night, he knows what he wants to do with his life. \u201cI knew how he carried himself. Burdened,\u201d he writes of Walter White, upon being sent the script for \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d by the showrunner Vince Gilligan, who remembered Cranston from a small role he\u2019d given him on \u201cThe  . \u201d He\u2019d also, by that point, appeared in six episodes of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and seven seasons of \u201cMalcolm in the Middle,\u201d and was up against Steve Zahn for the role. As intriguing as the Zahn idea is, it was Cranston\u2019s less glitzy r\u00e9sum\u00e9  \u2014   the years spent doing commercials for Excedrin and Preparation H  \u2014   that was required for the    chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin Walter White: a pinpoint study in frustrated ambition and simmering megalomania, in White\u2019s demented liberation a lusty Gloria in Excelsis Deo for jobbing actors everywhere. Jason Diamond\u2019s SEARCHING FOR JOHN HUGHES: Or Everything I Thought I Needed To Know About Life I Learned From Watching \u201980s Movies (  paper, $15. 99) is one of those pop culture bildungsromans in the vein of Nick Hornby\u2019s \u201cFever Pitch,\u201d wherein a writer enacts an obsessive battle with a pop culture phenomenon that fills his or her sky, before finally realizing the fixation is perilous and parachuting to safety. Growing up Jewish in the Chicago suburbs, beaten by his father, abandoned by his mother, Diamond is by 15 a   punk with a   carving a Dead Kennedys logo into his desk, seeking plaintive escape in films like \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d \u201cHome Alone\u201d and \u201cThe Breakfast Club. \u201d \u201cI wanted to live in a John Hughes film. I wanted everything to turn out just right,\u201d he says, but wonders, \u201cHow many more times could I tell myself there\u2019d be a happy ending?\u201d The reader suffers from a similar curiosity. Diamond, now the sports editor at Rollingstone. com, never gets far enough into his John Hughes obsession to explain it, or why his alienation doesn\u2019t express itself in angrier   form  \u2014   the music of Nine Inch Nails, say, rather than the quirky but   world of Hughes. But the sweetness is telling, a sign of the strain to his nature that will eventually win out. He moves to New York, takes a job as a barista, starts an unauthorized biography of Hughes, stalls on Chapter 1 (\u201cHe\u2019s an artist just screaming to break out,\u201d his notes read) before finally returning to old haunts in Chicago, where he succeeds in laying some of his ghosts to rest and opening a crack of daylight between himself and his idol. I\u2019m not sure Diamond gets enough about Hughes into the book  \u2014   for long swaths, the title rings literally true  \u2014   but he has successfully negotiated the writer\u2019s most important rite of passage: He makes himself matter, first to himself and then to us. A sequel to his previous book, \u201cHow to Read Literature Like a Professor,\u201d Thomas C. Foster\u2019s READING THE SILVER SCREEN: A Film Lover\u2019s Guide to Decoding the Art Form That Moves (Harper Perennial, paper, $15. 99) aims to make you \u201ca better reader of movies. More informed. More aware. More analytical. \u201d Despite this lofty aim, the book is written in the   style of someone anxious to reassure his readers that they will not be left behind at any point: \u201cFilms not only have to have chemistry they\u2019re like chemistry. Now, relax, there won\u2019t be any lab reports. \u201d Foster goes in for so many of these icebreakers, each an implicit expression of the author\u2019s confident air of superiority, that you grow a little impatient for the fruits of the wisdom whose brilliance he is so thoughtfully shielding from us. What you get is this: \u201cMovies are motion\u201d \u201cIf you put enough\u201d shots \u201ctogether in the right order you get a movie\u201d \u201cEvery character has a story\u201d and \u201cA filmmaker can jump from place to place,\u201d but \u201cjumping from time to time is problematic. \u201d This last observation is so off the mark you wonder if the author has ever seen a movie: \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d? Flashbacks?  ? Elliptical editing? Every now and again, one stumbles through the fog of generalities across a piece of analysis born of simple observation: the way John Ford uses Monument Valley to frame the landscape of the West, for example, or the   cocoon of alcoves, rooms, elevators and stairwells in Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel. \u201d \u201cThis is a world very much like the actual world between the wars,\u201d Foster writes, citing Ionesco. \u201cPersonal freedom is a scarce and fragile commodity. \u201d It is telling that Foster is at his best when he forgets his readers entirely. Brian Jay Jones\u2019s biography GEORGE LUCAS: A Life (Little, Brown, $32) tells an   tale: how a scrawny, easily bored nerd from Modesto, Calif. resisted the lure of his cooler, more flamboyant filmmaking contemporaries to stun the world with   cinema aimed at his inner    that reshaped Hollywood overnight. The collective double take over \u201cStar Wars\u201d never gets old, although if it\u2019s a definitive reconstruction of the creative spaghetti that fed into the saga you want, then Chris Taylor\u2019s masterly \u201cHow Star Wars Conquered the Universe\u201d is your book. Jones, who comes to Lucas from a celebrated life of Jim Henson, tells a more straightforward story in definitive detail, although you have to wonder whether Lucas is a good fit for the biographical format: a cautious, withdrawn man, bland in his tastes, his resentment toward his father driving his   fight for autonomy from the studios. So much in Lucasland seems born of peeve and pedantry, it\u2019s a miracle the films are as ebullient as they are, but then that is the Faustian sacrifice behind \u201cStar Wars\u201d: All the fun, humor and adventure in its maker\u2019s life are instead up there on the screen. Crisper pleasures await in BRESSON ON BRESSON: Interviews   (New York Review Books, $24. 95) edited by Robert Bresson\u2019s widow, Myl\u00e8ne, and translated by Anna Moschovakis. This collection of interviews reveals the great French filmmaker\u2019s own interview technique to bear more than a passing resemblance to Roger Federer\u2019s drop shot. In shuffles a nervous interviewer to take his or her seat, stealing the odd personal observation: The auteur\u2019s eyes are   and he speaks softly. \u201cWhat was it that drew you to this subject?\u201d he is often asked. It seems innocent enough, but this is Bresson. He thinks, then gently deconstructs the implicit assumptions about cinema contained therein, and rolls the ball back to the interviewer\u2019s feet with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t choose my subjects. They choose me,\u201d he says. \u201cFilms should not have subjects at all. . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. What I\u2019m trying to do is to come up to the edge of saying too little, in order to try to express with silence what other films express with words  \u2014   the almost imperceptible things that happen on a face, or in a look in someone\u2019s eyes. \u201d He interviewed much as he made films: by saying very little, with great eloquence.'"}, "time": 1742564264.0459864}
