According to what Sciutto described as a \u201csource,\u201d those allegations aimed at Rice were false, which is what Sciutto based his claim of this being a distraction. Partial transcript as follows: Well, just a short time ago, I spoke with someone close to Ambassador Rice, and this is the first comments from someone close to Rice today on these allegations. I\u2019ll read it in quotes. \u201cThe idea that Ambassador Rice improperly sought the identities of Americans is false. There is nothing unusual about making these requests when serving as a senior national security official, whether Democrat or Republican. \u201d That coming from someone who works for Ambassador Rice. But let\u2019s go beyond that, because I spoke today with senior  \u2014   former senior U. S. intelligence officials, the senior most who served both Republican and Democratic administrations, and this is what they have told me about this story. They said, \u201cOne, this is not unusual. This happens. When you are briefed on intelligence communications like this, sometimes senior national security officials can ask the intelligence community to identify the Americans either mentioned in those conversations or on the other side of those phone calls. It\u2019s not up to that senior U. S. national security official to make that decision, it\u2019s then up to the intelligence agencies, the NSA, they decide what\u2019s appropriate to then unmask for that senior official. It is legal. There are protocols that have been put in place since   to allow this to happen. \u201d And I\u2019m told, this very meticulously logged, someone said to me, described it, it\u2019s like Catholic baptismal records. It\u2019s so   logged. You can\u2019t do this in secret and you have to do it without the approval of the intelligence community. And, finally, Anderson, I would just say, why would someone do this? Every day, they\u2019re getting briefings on intelligence. Their briefer chooses what they are briefed on, including Ambassador Rice, in those briefings, an official such as Rice might say, to further understand it, I would like to know who those names are. And that\u2019s why they would make that request, which then as I said would have to be approved by the intelligence community. That\u2019s what I\u2019m told. And again to note by senior intelligence officials who work for both Democrats and Republicans. This appears to be a story, largely ginned up, partly as a distraction from this larger investigation. But I will say, Anderson, you\u2019re aware of this, the investigations continue, but particularly on the House side, there are now questions coming from both Democrats and Republicans about how bipartisan this investigation can be.
