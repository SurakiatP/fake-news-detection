Hitler was false opposition and I am afraid Trump is too. But false opposition is better than none at all. I believe Donald Trump will win the Presidential election November 8 . However, as I will explain later, I am hesitant to think that his victory will be a setback for the New World Order. I agree with Michael Moore who eloquently predicts the majority of American voters will deliver a big Fuck You to the political establishment: \u201cDonald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said, \u2018If you close these factories as you\u2019re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, I\u2019m going to put a 35 percent tariff on those cars when you send them back. And nobody\u2019s gonna buy them.\u2019 It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives. And it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the Brexit states\u2026 And on November 8th, Election Day \u2013 although they\u2019ve lost their jobs, although they\u2019ve been foreclosed on by the bank, next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone, the car has been repo\u2019d, they haven\u2019t had a real vacation in years, they\u2019re stuck with the shitty Obamacare Bronze plan where you can\u2019t even get a fucking Percocet \u2013 they\u2019ve essentially lost everything they had. \u2026 So on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever, or felt pen, or touch screen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives. Donald J. Trump. They see that the elites, who ruined their lives, hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hate Trump \u2013 after they loved him and created him and now hate him. Thank you, media. The enemy of my enemy is who I\u2019m voting for on November 8th. Yes, on November 8th, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Bill Blow, Billy Bob Blow, all the Blows \u2013 get to go and blow up the whole God damn system because it\u2019s your right. Trump\u2019s election is going to be the biggest fuck you ever recorded in human history. And it will feel good.\u201d Despite his (pre-divorce) net worth of $50 million , Moore clearly has not lost the common touch. IS TRUMP FALSE OPPOSITION?'"}, "time": 1742561863.5563803}
