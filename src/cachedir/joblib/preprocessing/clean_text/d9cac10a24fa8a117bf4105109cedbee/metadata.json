According to the Conservative Post , never before has an FBI director endorsed a presidential candidate. \\n\u201cI\u2019m endorsing Donald Trump,\u201d Kallstrom said on Fox News. \u201cI\u2019ve known him 40 years. I\u2019ve never endorsed a candidate. He\u2019s a good human being. He\u2019s a generous person. He\u2019s got a big heart. He\u2019s done hundreds and hundreds of things for people without fanfare.\u201d \\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a patriot of this country and regardless of what he says, his acts show that he is not that person. He\u2019s been in this Hollywood crowd that talks like that, a lot of people talk like that,\u201d he continued, in reference to the leaked audio tape from 2005 in which Trump made lewd comments about women. \\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do these things. He\u2019s a good guy. I\u2019ve known his family from the time they were kids. Look at his children. Could you find a better family than he brought up in this country? This country is absolutely going in the wrong direction.\u201d \\n\u201cSeventy percent of the people want change,\u201d Kallstrom added, as reported by CP . \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get change with Hillary Clinton. This is the woman that lied when she was on the Watergate staff. I mean, she\u2019s a pathological liar.\u201d \\nWatch:'"}, "time": 1742562923.0678778}
