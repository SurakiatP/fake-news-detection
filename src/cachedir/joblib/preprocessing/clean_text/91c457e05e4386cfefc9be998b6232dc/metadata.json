Several reporters, news editors and opinion writers used Twitter to report live on the interview with Mr. Trump. Here are highlights of the significant answers Mr. Trump gave in the   interview. Many were tweeted by Maggie Haberman, a political reporter who covered Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and Michael M. Grynbaum, a media reporter for The Times. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways. \u201d He also said that it could be argued that the Clinton Foundation had done \u201cgood work. \u201d As The Times reported shortly after the election, \u201cMr. Trump told Mrs. Clinton at the second presidential debate that if elected, he would instruct his attorney general \u2018to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.\u2019 \u201d His reversal has already provoked a backlash among some of his supporters, something he said Tuesday he did not expect to happen. Mr. Trump was referring to James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general who headed United States Central Command, who is under consideration to head the Department of Defense. The Times most recently covered General Mattis on Monday, noting that he \u201coversaw military operations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia from 2010 to 2013,\u201d but \u201chad his tour cut short by the Obama administration, which believed he was too hawkish on Iran. \u201d Here are two Times articles about the conference, which took place on Saturday in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview on Tuesday. Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, a nationalist media mogul who is the former head of Breitbart News, to a top White House position, had elicited fierce criticism. The Times profiled Mr. Bannon when he was named to be Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chief in August. Asked by the   columnist Thomas L. Friedman about whether he thought human activity was linked to climate change, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much. \u201d But while acknowledging the connection, he said in response to questions about the warming climate that he was thinking about \u201chow much it will cost our companies. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s statements were a turn away from assertions that   climate change was a \u201choax,\u201d something that he later claimed never to have said. Mr. Trump was acknowledging a recent meeting with the British politician Nigel Farage, in which, The Times reported, he \u201cencouraged Mr. Farage and his entourage to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms that Mr. Trump believes will mar the pristine view from one of his two Scottish golf courses. \u201d He was referring to Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who was unseated by New Hampshire\u2019s governor, Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. Ms. Ayotte had turned against Mr. Trump late in the campaign, saying that she misspoke when she called him a role model. The \u201cHeck\u201d he\u2019s referring to is Representative Joe Heck, a Republican who was defeated in Nevada by Catherine Cortez Masto, his Democratic challenger. Pressed about his business interests, Mr. Trump also said, \u201cIn theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. \u201d As The Times reported over the weekend, recent meetings that Mr. Trump has held have suggested that he may keep up his business ties. \u201cThe law\u2019s totally on my side,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest. \u201d \u201cHe said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him,\u201d Mr. Trump said of President Obama, adding that \u201cI think he\u2019s looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition. \u201d Here\u2019s our article on the cordial   meeting in the Oval Office. Ms. Haberman was referring to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s    who has been one of the  \u2019s closest advisers. (PEOTUS is an abbreviation for   of the United States.) The Times reported Saturday  that Mr. Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, \u201chas emerged as the closest thing to a steadying influence\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. Mr. Kushner has arranged important meetings for Mr. Trump, including one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and has sought out the advice of foreign policy experts including Henry Kissinger. \u201cI would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians, that would be such a great achievement,\u201d Mr. Trump said.
