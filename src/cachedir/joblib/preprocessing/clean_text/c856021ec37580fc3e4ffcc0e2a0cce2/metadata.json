It also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said, though the administration said exemptions could be granted. Here are some major excerpts from the executive order, with comments by The New York Times. The full text of the order is available here. Most of the 19 hijackers on the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pa. were from Saudi Arabia. The rest were from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon. None of those countries are on Mr. Trump\u2019s visa ban list. The nation\u2019s founding principles, as reflected in the Declaration of Independence, included dissatisfaction with what were said to be overly restrictive immigration practices. \u201cThere is no statutory requirement that noncitizens entering the United States support the Constitution,\u201d said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. \u201cThe executive order seems to suggest that even temporary visitors like tourists and students should support the U. S. Constitution, which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. \u201d This provision is the key to the power Mr. Trump claims. It says: \u201cWhenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. \u201d The provision \u201cgives the president capacious authority to deny entry to any alien or class of aliens,\u201d Professor Spiro said. \u201cNo court has ever reversed a presidential order under it. \u201d But he added, \u201cIn terms of the number of prospective immigrants involved, this is by far the most significant use of the power by any president. \u201d Some critics say the order runs afoul of a later law that bars discrimination \u201cin the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. \u201d The tension between the two laws has not been definitively resolved by the courts. Jennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that a challenge to the executive order based on the later law\u2019s   principles was the most promising line of attack. In an opinion article in The New York Times, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said Mr. Trump had at least violated the spirit of the later law. \u201cEven if courts do find wiggle room here, discretion can be taken too far,\u201d Mr. Bier wrote. \u201cIf Mr. Trump can legally ban an entire region of the world, he would render Congress\u2019s vision of unbiased legal immigration a dead letter. \u201d The countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. These exceptions are mostly for diplomats, people traveling to the United Nations in New York, and others involved in international organizations. The initial list may soon change and expand. This provision suspends all admissions of refugees, not limited to the seven countries. As a general matter, this will give priority to Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Though framed in a neutral way, this part of the order may raise questions of   discrimination. Mr. Trump has said that he means to favor Christian refugees. That violates the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion, according to David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cOne of the critical questions with respect to the validity of executive action challenged under the Establishment Clause is its intent and effect,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cIf intended to disfavor a particular religion, it violates the Establishment Clause. \u201d This effectively expands the ban on immigrants from Syria. This cuts the cap on refugees in half.'"}, "time": 1742561831.581932}
