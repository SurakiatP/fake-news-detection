Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war. Pass the missile launchers, please \\nTrump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted -- as she already was in the past -- when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler. \\nI have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon -- reflecting Dunford\\'s comments -- knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens \" consequences .\" \\nThe Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two \"existential threats\" to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear \"first-strike\" -- which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.'"}, "time": 1742564466.186714}
