{"duration": 0.14850521087646484, "input_args": {"text": "'LOS ANGELES  \u2014   Because he was told that   were box office poison, and he wrote the screenplay for \u201cHell or High Water\u201d anyway, resulting in one of the few Hollywood films of 2016 to shine a light on   America. Because, as a former actor, he creates vivid characters that are fun to perform. Because he was overlooked by Oscar voters for his last script, the   drug thriller \u201cSicario. \u201d Could voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences talk themselves into giving Taylor Sheridan the trophy for best original screenplay? With a week and a half to go before ballots are due, the annual Oscar race has officially entered the stage when voters can grow bored with the sure bets  \u2014   repeated for months by prognostication outfits like GoldDerby. com  \u2014   and look for smaller ways to reward films that have little chance of winning bigger prizes. Fitting that bill this time may be Mr. Sheridan, a nominee for \u201cHell or High Water. \u201d The   Mr. Sheridan, 47, who quit his journeyman acting career in 2011 and moved to Wyoming, is not the   in his category. Better positioned are the establishment favorite Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d and has been nominated by the academy for his writing twice before and Damien Chazelle, the prodigy behind \u201cLa La Land\u201d who took home the writing prize at the Golden Globes. [See where to stream \u201cHell or High Water.] But Mr. Lonergan and Mr. Chazelle are vulnerable. Some voters find Mr. Lonergan\u2019s script overlong. \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d is also likely to be honored in other categories, including best actor, where Casey Affleck is a favorite. As for Mr. Chazelle, his screenplay has been overshadowed by his \u201cLa La Land\u201d directing (collecting the top prize at the bellwether Directors Guild of America Awards) and the strong likelihood that \u201cLa La Land\u201d will win best picture. \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d a meditation on failure disguised as a    chase movie, has its own disadvantages. It was released by CBS Films and Lionsgate in August, outside the traditional awards corridor. Some dislike its ambiguous ending. And it took in only $27 million at the box office  \u2014   a feat for an art film that cost a lean $12 million to make, but a niche sum all the same. (The final two films vying for the original screenplay Oscar have taken in even less. \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d a dystopian story dreamed up by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, collected $9. 1 million. Written by Mike Mills, \u201c20th Century Women\u201d has managed $5 million.) But Mr. Sheridan has a shot, partly because giving him a little gold man is a way for voters to sneak some love to the film. Directed by David Mackenzie and starring Jeff Bridges as a twangy Texas marshal, \u201cHell or High Water\u201d is nominated for best picture but won\u2019t win. Sure, Mr. Bridges could triumph in the supporting actor contest. But Mahershala Ali seems to have that one in the bag for his tender portrayal of a drug dealer in \u201cMoonlight\u201d  \u2014   especially after that emotional speech he gave at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. That leaves Mr. Sheridan. On Monday at the annual Oscar nominee luncheon in Beverly Hills, Mr. Sheridan said that he was still struggling to comprehend his nomination. A win? \u201cYou feel so presumptuous to even think about it,\u201d he said quietly. He was wearing a dark suit, but he would probably have been more comfortable in a pair of   cowboy boots. Rather than flying to Los Angeles, he drove from Wyoming  \u2014   a   trip  \u2014   in his   \u201cdually\u201d truck. (For you city slickers, that means it has a set of double tires in the back.) \u201cHell or High Water\u201d is the story of brothers  \u2014   one younger (Chris Pine) with \u201ca kind face marked by years of sun and disappointment,\u201d as Mr. Sheridan described the character in his script, and one older (Ben Foster) with \u201can air of danger that attracts as many women as it repels. \u201d They rob West Texas banks in the throes of the Great Recession to pay back predatory bank loans and save the family homestead. A casually racist lawman (Mr. Bridges) and his part Comanche, part Hispanic deputy (Gil Birmingham) investigate, passing through one dying town after another and meeting various characters, including one of the orneriest waitresses ever put on film. (\u201cThat weren\u2019t a question,\u201d she snaps, taking their   steak lunch order.) Mr. Sheridan wrote \u201cHell or High Water\u201d in less than three weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t outline,\u201d he said. \u201cI sit down to write and I take the ride. If something starts to not feel right, I go back to the last place that felt like jazz to me. \u201d He wrote what he knew. Mr. Sheridan grew up on a ranch near Cranfills Gap, Tex. population 277. It was a spare existence: His family had no stereo, he said, but they did have Bess, a yellow station wagon with an   player. His parents sometimes sat in the car with a   of beer and listened to Waylon Jennings. The Sheridans lost their property in the   economic downturn. \u201cOtherwise I would still be living there,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. Instead, he wound up in Austin after flunking out of Texas State University. One day he was approached by a Hollywood talent scout who offered to fly him to Los Angeles. \u201cI figured I might as well take the free trip,\u201d he recalled. To his surprise, Mr. Sheridan began booking small roles on series like \u201cWalker, Texas Ranger. \u201d By 2011 he had landed a regular part on \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d but he was still struggling to support his family. Conceding that his acting career had peaked, he sat down in his cramped Hollywood apartment and started writing \u201cSicario,\u201d a dark, morally ambiguous   drama with shifting protagonists. \u201cI had read enough scripts to know what not to do,\u201d he said. \u201cSicario\u201d rode strong reviews to $85 million in worldwide ticket sales. (A sequel, \u201cSoldado,\u201d may arrive later this year, as may \u201cWind River,\u201d a thriller about a manhunt on an Indian reservation that Mr. Sheridan wrote and directed.) \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d Mr. Sheridan\u2019s second script, was equally daring. \u201cA film about rural disenfranchisement and the way that institutions have abandoned people, with a major character in his 60s who spits out racist barbs  \u2014   I never thought it would sell, so I just did exactly what I wanted to do,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. The film\u2019s racial banter was particularly concerning to the film\u2019s eventual backers. \u201cThere was hesitation about that and rightly so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that exists. That\u2019s how a lot of these guys talk. \u201d Mr. Sheridan continued: \u201cI think that kind of casual racism comes from insecurity  \u2014   guys who don\u2019t know how to express their affection with each other so they revert to these insults. They think it\u2019s playful. But their words create a divide. \u201d He paused for a moment, before channeling his inner ornery waitress. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to   these people,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI wanted to be really honest  \u2014   take \u2019em or leave \u2019em  \u2014   and I think that\u2019s one reason the film has connected. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563009.1632884}
