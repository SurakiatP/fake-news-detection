But the worst part is his audience \u2013 a group of Cub Scouts, aged 7-10. \\nThe video, taken October 11, was recorded shortly after the release of the now-infamous \u201c Pussy Tape \u201d in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. Yoder even made a joke about Trump\u2019s scandalous comments: \u201cA-ha! Which parent put him up to that? Is there a hot mic in here? Well, I\u2019m a Republican, so I\u2019m going to be supporting the Republican nominee, no matter what crazy things he says.\u201d A Lesson On \u2018Spin\u2019\u2013 For the Kids! \\nYoder dishonestly suggested that the child was not curious enough to ask the question on his own. But in fact, kids are quite aware of the impending election. An informal survey of teachers found high levels of youth anxiety \u2013 especially among racial and ethnic minorities \u2013 due to Donald Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric. \\nHis reply also dishonestly implies that he\u2019s somehow obligated to vote along party lines. But the many Republican defections from the Donald Trump camp prove that is untrue. Yoder could have used the opportunity to teach the Scouts that they should always do the right thing, even if it means refusing to do what is easy and expected of you. Instead, he towed the party line. \\nPerhaps Yoder needs a reminder from the Cub Scouts about where his loyalty should lie. According to the Scout Oath , decent citizens should pledge: \u201cOn my honor I will do my best, to do my duty to God and my country\u2026\u201d Damage Control \\nYoder is running for a fourth term in a suburban Kansas City district. His team is already running damage control on the tape. Yoder spokesperson, C.J. Grover, played the remarks off as evidence of Yoder\u2019s \u201cquick wit.\u201d \u201cAnyone who knows Kevin knows that he utilizes his quick wit to connect with voters. All this video shows is Kevin continues to be out in the community taking all questions from anyone who wants to ask them, whereas his opponent has been hiding in his basement hoping his financial backers in D.C. can steal him a victory.\u201d \\nFeatured image: screengrab via YouTube video .
