George Saunders\u2019s   first novel, \u201cLincoln in the Bardo,\u201d is like a weird folk art diorama of a cemetery come to life. Picture, as a backdrop, one of those primitively drawn   mourning paintings with rickety white gravestones and   monuments standing under the faded green canopy of a couple of delicately sketched trees. Add a tall, sad mourner, grieving over his recently deceased son. And then, to make things stranger, populate the rest of the scene with some Edward   ghosts, skittering across the landscape  \u2014   at once menacing, comical and slightly   . \u201cLincoln in the Bardo\u201d takes, as its   point, the death of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s beloved    son, Willie, who succumbed to typhoid fever on Feb. 20, 1862, and the   president\u2019s visits to the crypt where his son was interred at the Oak Hill Cemetery in nearby Georgetown. Saunders intercuts facts and   (culled from books and news accounts) in a   narrative with some ghost stories of his own imagining, allowing a chorus of disembodied spirits to describe Lincoln\u2019s visits, while babbling on about their own regrets and misplaced dreams. \u201cBardo\u201d is the Tibetan Buddhist name for a transition period between death and rebirth and seems to indicate, in this case, the bizarre purgatory inhabited by these ghosts. The supernatural chatter can grow tedious at times  \u2014   the novel would have benefited immensely from some judicious pruning  \u2014   but their voices gain emotional momentum as the book progresses. And they lend the story a choral dimension that turns Lincoln\u2019s personal grief into a meditation on the losses suffered by the nation during the Civil War, and the more universal heartbreak that is part of the human condition. The ghosts are a motley lot, reminiscent of the dispossessed and disenfranchised characters in Saunders\u2019s short stories. They include a soldier, a murderer, a disgraced clerk, a rape victim, a hunter who\u2019s killed more than 30 bears and hundreds of deer, an aggrieved scholar, a mother of three girls, a young man who tried to kill himself after the man he loved spurned his affections, and an older man who was struck in the head by a falling ceiling beam and died before he could consummate his marriage to his pretty young wife. Together, these voices create a kind of portrait of an American community  \u2014   not unlike the one in Edgar Lee Masters\u2019s 1915 classic, \u201cSpoon River Anthology,\u201d which was set in a fictionalized version of a small Illinois town. The poems in \u201cSpoon River\u201d were narrated from beyond the grave by the dozens of souls \u201csleeping on the hill\u201d in the local cemetery. One of those characters was Anne Rutledge, rumored to have been Lincoln\u2019s first love, and whose untimely death  \u2014   reportedly of typhoid at the age of 22  \u2014   was said to be a source of his often melancholy outlook on the world. The similarities between \u201cSpoon River\u201d and Saunders\u2019s new novel extend well beyond the Lincoln association and the graveyard confessions. Like Sherwood Anderson\u2019s \u201cWinesburg, Ohio\u201d (1919)  \u2014   itself a notable influence on Saunders\u2019s early short stories  \u2014   and Thornton Wilder\u2019s \u201cOur Town\u201d (1938) \u201cLincoln in the Bardo\u201d appropriates Masters\u2019s multivoiced approach, using it to create a story that unfolds into a meditation on the dreams and disappointments of ordinary people, longing for connection but often left feeling isolated and alone. Saunders\u2019s short stories  \u2014   \u201cCivilWarLand in Bad Decline,\u201d \u201cPastoralia,\u201d \u201cIn Persuasion Nation\u201d and \u201cTenth of December\u201d  \u2014   tend to vacillate between two impulses: satire and black comedy, reminiscent of Nathanael West and Kurt Vonnegut and a more empathetic mode, closer to Anderson and William Trevor. Though there are moments of dark humor in some of the ghost stories here, \u201cBardo\u201d definitely falls into the more introspective part of that spectrum. In these pages, Saunders\u2019s extraordinary verbal energy is harnessed, for the most part, in the service of capturing the pathos of everyday life  \u2014   as experienced by the spirits of the dead, remembering missed opportunities by Willie, as his life slips away and he enters the limbo of the bardo and by Lincoln, as he struggles to come to terms with his son\u2019s death and the devastation of a war that is ripping the country apart. Saunders\u2019s novel is at its most potent and compelling when it is focused on Lincoln: a grave, deeply compassionate figure, burdened by both personal grief and the weight of the war, and captured here in the full depth of his humanity. In fact, it is Saunders\u2019s beautifully realized portrait of Lincoln  \u2014   caught at this hinge moment in time, in his own personal bardo, as it were  \u2014   that powers this book over its more static sections and attests to the author\u2019s own fruitful transition from the short story to the   form of the novel. \u201cHis mind was freshly inclined toward sorrow,\u201d Saunders writes of Lincoln, \u201ctoward the fact that the world was full of sorrow, that everyone labored under some burden of sorrow that all were suffering that whatever way one took in this world, one must try to remember that all were suffering (none content all wronged, neglected, overlooked, misunderstood) and therefore one must do what one could to lighten the load of those with whom one came into contact that his current state of sorrow was not uniquely his, not at all, but, rather, its like had been felt, would yet be felt, by scores of others, in all times, in every time, and must not be prolonged or exaggerated, because, in this state, he could be of no help to anyone and, given that his position in the world situated him to be either of great help or great harm, it would not do to stay low, if he could help it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563484.7263687}
