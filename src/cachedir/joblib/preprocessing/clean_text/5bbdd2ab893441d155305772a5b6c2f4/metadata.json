Trump campaign  \u2014   had been streaming. The panelists on the show, standing a few feet away in a makeshift studio inside a bland Trump Tower office, glanced around, confused. A makeup artist hired for the occasion fiddled with her phone. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and the night\u2019s special guest, kept criticizing Hillary Clinton, until somebody noted that the camera had shut off.   news, this was not. The set consisted of two wooden tables pressed together, facing a single camcorder on a tripod. The director, who eventually got the feed working again, was a recent Harvard Law School graduate with no broadcasting background. Yet \u201cTrump Tower Live\u201d has been seized on as a harbinger of a potential Trump media empire to come. The show, set to air through Election Day, debuted this week with a   crawl  \u2014   filled exclusively with headlines favorable to Mr. Trump  \u2014   and onscreen graphics borrowed from the cable news playbook. Essentially agitprop presented as news, the program is fueling speculation that Mr. Trump wants to start a network, purveying news and opinion tailored to the candidate\u2019s worldview. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s    has met with a prominent media banker and other industry figures to discuss options for a television venture. The proximity to Mr. Trump of Stephen K. Bannon, a top campaign adviser and the mastermind of Breitbart News, has also stoked talk of plans for a national media outlet. But speaking at Trump Tower on Tuesday before an evening taping, the creators of the show  \u2014   who all work for the Trump campaign  \u2014   dismissed such speculation as baseless. \u201cThat\u2019s part of a narrative that the   media is trying to spin, in order to somehow suggest that Mr. Trump is not going to win this election,\u201d said Boris Epshteyn, a lawyer who often appears on television on behalf of the Trump campaign and who serves as a   of \u201cTrump Tower Live. \u201d The show \u201cis not a trial balloon,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a channel for messaging to voters that haven\u2019t been reached yet. \u201d Judging by the scene at Tuesday\u2019s show, the production was minimal: a   team, including a microphone operator in a navy blue Make America Great Again windbreaker, in a room overlooking the Trump Tower atrium. As talk shows go, the mood was remarkably placid  \u2014   perhaps because the   hosts never disagreed with one another. The panelists  \u2014   including a former lieutenant governor of New York, Betsy McCaughey  \u2014   denounced the Affordable Care Act and accused Mrs. Clinton of committing a variety of criminal acts. There was no green room for guests, but bottles of   spring water were available. As he waited for the broadcast to start, Mr. Giuliani said that he \u201cwould have loved\u201d a similar tool during his time as mayor. \u201cThis is a very effective way to get your message over and above all the interpretations  \u2014   misinterpretations  \u2014   that occur,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cI wish we could have done it. It would have been a big help. \u201d Monday\u2019s premiere episode attracted about 60, 000 live viewers at one point, solid for Facebook, if meager for cable news. Tuesday\u2019s edition, which aired after one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, saw a   to 23, 000 viewers, though Cliff Sims, Mr. Epshteyn\u2019s   said his team was still working out kinks. \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving thing,\u201d said Mr. Sims, who built an online news and radio network called Yellowhammer in his native Alabama before taking a leave to join the Trump campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re experimenting a little bit with the form it will take. \u201d Mr. Sims pitched the idea for a Facebook Live special on the night of the final presidential debate that broadcast attracted millions of views and led to about 150, 000 people donating to the campaign. For its daily show, the campaign is considering afternoon broadcasts, and it is looking to see whether airing before or after a speech by Mr. Trump has an effect on viewership. While many noted that Monday\u2019s episode aired at 6:30 p. m. opposite major network newscasts, Mr. Sims said that was a coincidence tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule that night. Still, the \u201cTrump Tower Live\u201d crew has not shied away from asserting that it offers a corrective to traditional news. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be bypassing the   media,\u201d Mr. Epshteyn said on Monday\u2019s broadcast, prompting Mr. Sims to add, \u201cIt would be malpractice on our part if we didn\u2019t utilize these massive social media platforms that we have. \u201d Mr. Trump, for his part, has said he is focused on winning the election, not creating a media property. He told a Cincinnati radio host on Tuesday, \u201cI have no interest in Trump TV,\u201d and industry executives say the   costs for a news channel would be prohibitive. Even Sean Hannity of Fox News, a dedicated Trump partisan, sounded skeptical when asked about the idea in an interview in Las Vegas last week. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Mr. Hannity said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost you half a billion just to get in the water. \u201d Still, Mr. Berkowitz, the Trump Tower Live director, sounded bullish about his show\u2019s ambitions. \u201cYounger people don\u2019t watch CNN they just don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz said, as the studio set was dismantled around him. \u201cThis is how they get information,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the best way to bring it to them. And we\u2019re happy to do that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563315.090976}
