Bannon  \u2014   a political adviser with no direct national security role  \u2014   to full membership and downgrades the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The alteration was contained in a memorandum issued late Saturday defining the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, the top   bodies inside the White House on everything from diplomacy to counterterrorism to crisis management to nuclear and cyberpolicy. Mr. Trump\u2019s document drew from organizational precedents in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. But the ascension of Mr. Bannon, who until last year was the head of Breitbart News, and the diminishment of the president\u2019s top intelligence and military advisers took Democrats and Republicans by surprise. The new memo said that the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman would attend the \u201cprincipals meetings\u201d  \u2014   the meeting of   officials  \u2014   only when \u201cissues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. \u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Sunday that Mr. Bannon\u2019s past service as a Navy officer merited his attendance at all meetings, as part of a \u201cstreamlining\u201d of  . He did not explain the downgrading of the   general who heads the Joint Chiefs, Joseph F. Dunford Jr. who rose through the Marine Corps and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cWell, he is a former naval officer,\u201d Mr. Spicer said of Mr. Bannon on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now. \u201d He added, \u201cHaving the chief strategist for the president in those meetings, who has a significant military background, to help make, guide what the president\u2019s final analysis is going to be, is crucial. \u201d When pressed on General Dunford\u2019s role, Mr. Spicer said, \u201cThe president gets plenty of information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201d Current and former military officials said they suspected that the decision, in part, was prompted by the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who retired as a   general after he was dismissed during the Obama administration as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was the previous director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who delivered the news to Mr. Flynn that he was being removed from his post. Throughout the transition, Mr. Flynn was reportedly hesitant to place many people around the National Security Council table who had outranked him in the military. Nonetheless, there are two in the cabinet: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who retired as a   general, and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, a retired   Marine Corps general who served for 45 years, ending his military career as the commander of United States Southern Command. Both men remain principals on the council. The C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, is not mentioned at all in the reorganization order. A week ago, Mr. Trump went to C. I. A. headquarters to assure officers there that he had their backs and valued their contributions. But Mr. Pompeo\u2019s predecessor, John O. Brennan, was also not a formal member of the council, though he often attended meetings to provide intelligence assessments. Susan E. Rice, Mr. Flynn\u2019s predecessor as national security adviser, denounced the downgrading of the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman. \u201cThis is stone cold crazy,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWho needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK,\u201d she said, using abbreviations for the Islamic State and North Korea. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, also appearing on ABC, questioned the wisdom of the move. John Bellinger, who was the counsel to the National Security Council during Mr. Bush\u2019s administration, noted in a commentary on the Lawfare blog that Mr. Bannon\u2019s role was highly unusual, because \u201cthe N. S. C. function usually does not include participants from the political side of the White House. \u201d He noted that Karl Rove, Mr. Bush\u2019s top political strategist, did not attend council meetings. But in the early days of the Obama administration, David Axelrod, also a top political strategist, did attend many meetings resetting policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan  \u2014   as a guest and an observer, but not as a full member of the council.'"}, "time": 1742561805.908073}
