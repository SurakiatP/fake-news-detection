In this video, election rigging guru Robert Creamer is caught arranging an illegal $20,000 foreign contribution to Americans United for Change (AUFC). \\nKeep in mind that AUFC is the same organization that was behind all the hullabaloo at the Trump rallies. Take a look at the video. \\nAccording to the video\\'s description: \\nIn the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer\\'s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC\\'s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn\\'t been a problem for the month that they had the money. \\nProject Veritas reports: \\nIn the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer\\'s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. \\n\"First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I\\'d like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I\\'m going to make here is to my money guy and he\\'s going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,\" said the PVA journalist. \\nCreamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the \"donors\" \"niece\" - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. \\nIn an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor\\'s money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. \\nCreamer, who has been to the White House at least 340 times and at least 45 of those times met with Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah, is heard saying, \"Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters \u2026 I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.\" \\nCreamer went on to speak about Obama, whom he claims to have known since the 1980s. During that time Obama was a community organizer in Chicago. \\n\"Oh Barack Obama\\'s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too,\" said Creamer of Obama. \"I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. He\\'s a pro, I\\'ve known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago.\" \\n\"I was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in,\" he added. \"I mean, for immigration reform for the\u2026 the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.\" \\nAccording to Project Veritas, \"AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC\\'s activities.

Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn\\'t been a problem for the month that they had the money.\" \\nIf that was not enough, following the release of the previous videos, \"Americans United for Change fired Scott Foval and Robert Creamer announced to the DNC that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities.\" \\nO\\'Keefe has filed suit with the Federal Elections Commission regarding the DNC, Hillary Clinton and Robert Creamer. \\nHere is the documentation referenced in the video:'"}, "time": 1742564222.8255346}
