Shortly after the suspensions were announced, the High Education Board ordered the resignation of more than 1, 500 deans from universities across the country and revoked the licenses of 21, 000 teachers, Turkish officials said. By Tuesday night, the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had either purged or detained nearly 35, 000 members of the military, security forces and judiciary in an effort to remove from the government bureaucracy and   loyalists of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric whom the government has accused of orchestrating Friday\u2019s coup attempt. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim likened Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers to a \u201cparallel terrorist organization. \u201d \u201cWe will dig them up by their roots so that no clandestine terrorist organization will have the nerve to betray our blessed people again,\u201d Mr. Yildirim told Parliament on Tuesday. The purges of educational institutions are intended to blunt the influence of followers of Mr. Gulen, a rival of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s who has been in   exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. Mr. Gulen has inspired an international network of schools, including more than 160 public charter schools in the United States, which have won grants from the federal government. But Mr. Gulen\u2019s movement has said it has no direct ties to these schools and he has denied involvement in the coup. Western diplomats have criticized Turkey for the sweeping expulsions and arrests in the wake of the attempted coup, urging Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government to remain committed to democratic principles including respect for human rights and for the rule of law. Turkish officials say their response is appropriate considering that the plotters have been accused of trying to kill or capture the president. \u201cIt took several thousand soldiers to carry out this coup attempt,\u201d the president\u2019s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have seen many of them on the streets and there are those that hijacked helicopters and  . Many of those shot at innocent people and blocked the roads. \u201d \u201cThen there were the generals that planned the coup and declared martial law,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is only natural that we apply the rule of law to arrest these people on charges of treason and trying to change the constitutional order of the country illegally. \u201d The Turkish government also widened its crackdown on news outlets sympathetic to Mr. Gulen by canceling licenses on Tuesday for a number of radio and television channels. Earlier this year, this Turkish authorities seized Turkey\u2019s most popular newspaper, Zaman, after a court ruling placed it under state control. The newspaper was closely associated with Mr. Gulen and had become fiercely critical of Mr. Erdogan and his government.'"}, "time": 1742562561.0051026}
