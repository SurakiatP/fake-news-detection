Not knowing the culture you offend puts you in a position to seem bigoted. But are you responsible for how others perceive your words? Are you accountable to ensure that no one is ever offended by your words and actions? Is that even possible? \\nIt seems that this is now what is expected of DePaul University students. They are only to express themselves in ways that others will not take offense. \\nThe Washington Times reports : \\nThe nation\u2019s largest Catholic university told a group of pro-life students that it could not display posters reading \u201cUnborn Lives Matter,\u201d lest they provoke the Black Lives Matter movement. \\nIn a letter to the College Republicans, DePaul University president Father Dennis Holtschneider said the posters contained \u201cbigotry\u201d veiled \u201cunder the cover of free speech,\u201d the Daily Wire reported. \\n\u201cBy our nature, we are committed to developing arguments and exploring important issues that can be steeped in controversy and, oftentimes, emotion,\u201d Mr. Holtschneider said in the letter. \u201cYet there will be times when some forms of speech challenge our grounding in Catholic and Vincentian values. When that happens, you will see us refuse to allow members of our community be subjected to bigotry that occurs under the cover of free speech.\u201d \\nSo to twist the popular slogan of one group to fit another group is bigoted? Would they feel this way if the sign were different? What if the sign read, \u201cBlack Unborn Lives Matter,\u201d would that be bigoted? \\nThe truth is, the university is beginning to crack down on freedom of speech and expression, if those thoughts and expressions are conservative. More mind control from the left. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares'"}, "time": 1742628489.8577485}
