[According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the fund will be disbursed to to a \u201crapid response network\u201d composed of 12 Oakland organizations to help families that cannot afford legal representation and whose illegal status could result in deportation. Money will also go towards creating an emergency hotline for residents, holding \u201cknow your rights\u201d workshops, and providing free consultations.  \u201cWithout counsel, up against a federal prosecutor, they\u2019re supposed to represent themselves in one of the most complex areas of law, where the stakes are permanent separation from their families,\u201d Eleni   immigration program director of Centro Legal de la Raza, told the Chronicle. According to the Chronicle, over a quarter of residents in Oakland are  . The publication further noted that on Tuesday, during a City Council meeting to discuss Oakland\u2019s budget for the next two years, Mayor Libby Schaaf said, \u201cI caution that we are at a moment of unprecedented uncertainty in this new, I would say, horrific federal environment. \u201d Schaaf had previously warned, according to the San Jose Mercury News, that Turmp\u2019s order would \u201cdestroy trust in government\u201d and complaining that \u201cit\u2019s disrespecting the American tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. \u201d Trump\u2019s order states, \u201cSanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States.  These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic. \u201d It stipulates that such jurisdictions will not be eligible to receive Federal grants unless they are found necessary for law enforcement purposes as prescribed by the Attorney General of Secretary of Homeland Security. Oakland is located just over 10 miles away from San Francisco, another sanctuary city where Kate Steinle was infamously murdered by an illegal alien and felon with multiple convictions and deportations in July 2015. Only one mayor from a major California city agreed with Trump\u2019s order. Last week, Fresno Mayor Lee Brand told the Fresno Bee, \u201cI\u2019m not going to make Fresno a sanctuary city because I don\u2019t want to make Fresno ineligible from receiving potentially millions of dollars in infrastructure and other types of projects   \u2026      My philosophy is to follow the law and to avoid these national   questions. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742563187.9348853}
