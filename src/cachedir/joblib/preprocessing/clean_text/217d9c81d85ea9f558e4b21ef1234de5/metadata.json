She wasn\u2019t some dumb college student trying to make a few bucks to pay rent with a quick \u201cgrab my pussy\u201d photo shoot. She was already a multi-millionaire Fox News host. \\nLast year, when the whore Kelly was attacking Trump as a sexist, he pointed out this \u201cgrab my pussy\u201d photo op, and noted that Kelly is a bimbo. \\nIn response to allegations of bimboism, Kelly told People Magazine : \u201cI was 40, and I was pregnant, I was like, \u2018I look pretty good.\u2019\u201c \\nOf course, in woman-speak this translates to \u201cI was 40, and I was pregnant, and I wanted to send the message to random men that they should grab me by the pussy to confirm that I am still attractive.\u201d \\nAnd sure, the pictures do look good, but they are airbrushed all to hell and back \\nFor instance, she is wearing a push-up bra, but the curvature of her breasts has been corrected and wrinkles have been removed from the place where her breasts connect to her chest and from her neck. Armpit wrinkle removal is also plainly obvious. \\nSo nothing is proved by these pictures \u2013 other than the fact she wants her pussy grabbed. \\nIn the same year, 2010, she went on the Jew Howard Stern\u2019s show and said that she wanted to fuck Bill O\u2019Reilly, which is bizarre and I believe sick. In this interview she also talked about her breasts and her husband\u2019s penis size. \\n(Full interview here .) \\nIt is not like she didn\u2019t know she was walking into a sex interview here. That is Stern\u2019s entire shtick. And everyone knows who Howard Stern is. \\nSo the only reason she would go on this show is to sexually objectify herself, which again, is to feel sexy when old and beginning to sag \\nAll of this simply confirms that Megyn\u2019s continued attacks on Donald Trump \u2013 such as we saw Newt Gingrich slap her around like an even cheaper hooker than she actually is for earlier this week \u2013 are part of a gigantic shit test against Donald Trump. \\nBasically, Kelly\u2019s entire career is now devoted to trying to bully Donald Trump into grabbing her by the pussy. \\nTsk-tsk, Megyn [sic]. \\nTsk-tsk. \\nRoger Ailes Firing Conspiracy Confirmed? \\nWay back when Fox News chief Roger Ailes was fired \u2013 OVER A SEXUAL HARASSMENT HOAX THAT MEGYN [sic] KELLY TOOK PART IN BY SAYING HE HUGGED HER WEIRDLY \u2013 I said that it was obviously part of an anti-Trump conspiracy by the station\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdock . \\nMurdock, while claiming to be a \u201cconservative,\u201d is an elite globalist and friend of the Clintons. \\nAiles, while not a perfect guy (shilled for Bush\u2019s wars, shilled for Israel), is a friend of Trump and wasn\u2019t going to allow this whore Kelly \u2013 as well as a whole bunch of other hosts and pundits \u2013 to betray the network\u2019s viewership by shilling for Hillary Clinton. \\nBecause that is exactly what we are seeing now: a massive betrayal of Donald Trump by the Fox News channel. \\nO\u2019Reilly hasn\u2019t been horrible, but he hasn\u2019t been great either. \\nThe only one who has consistently supported Donald J. Trump is Sean Hannity, and his ratings have now gone through the roof because of it. I\u2019m half-surprised Murdock doesn\u2019t just fire him for it, but I suppose that wouldn\u2019t work, as the entire viewership would boycott the channel. Right now, they can do a lot of damage to Trump by having the majority of their hosts shill for Hillary, but still having a few support Trump so they don\u2019t totally expose themselves as being part of a Clinton conspiracy.'"}, "time": 1742562058.6693296}
