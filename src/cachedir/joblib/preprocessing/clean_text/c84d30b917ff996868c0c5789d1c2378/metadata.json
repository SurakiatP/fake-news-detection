The track kicked off the final concert on a tour called \u201cThe End,\u201d which the   band has billed as its last performances. After 49 years, the group  \u2014   which formed here in 1968 and has had dramatic ups and downs and a rotating roster of members  \u2014   finally threw in the towel with a hometown concert. \u201cLet\u2019s go crazy,\u201d Mr. Osbourne yelled to the crowd, adding an expletive early in the concert, before turning in thrashing renditions of the band\u2019s   songs, including \u201cWar Pigs,\u201d \u201cInto the Void\u201d and \u201cIron Man,\u201d and deeper cuts like the instrumental \u201cRat Salad. \u201d Fans and members of the news media were buzzing before the concert with rumors of possible antics and surprises  \u2014   perhaps even an appearance by the original drummer, Bill Ward, estranged from the group since 2012. But Black Sabbath played it straight, turning in almost two hours of its earliest 1960s and \u201970s songs, pretty much unadulterated (but, of course, quite loud). Flanked by the original band members Tony Iommi (on guitar) and Geezer Butler (on bass) and backed by Tommy Clufetos, a younger drummer who rejoined them for the tour, Mr. Osbourne stood center stage and clutched the microphone, undulating back and forth as he sang. There were pyrotechnics for the big numbers, confetti at the end, and at one point a surprise volley of fireworks onstage. Giant black and purple balloons spilled from the ceiling in the penultimate song, and bounced around the arena for the rest of the night. Nearly a   ago, Black Sabbath began as a blues band. It quickly morphed into its own genre. In the band\u2019s early years, its   anthems and vague overtures toward Satanism in its lyrics earned them ridicule from mainstream critics and audiences while mobilizing a growing underground fan base. Mr. Osbourne gained a reputation as a forbidding figure who embraced hard living, and gained notoriety for biting off the head of a real bat during a 1982 concert. But Mr. Osbourne\u2019s fame underwent a surprising shift when he began starring in the 2002 MTV reality TV show \u201cThe Osbournes,\u201d which portrayed him as a lovable, murmuring goofball and family man. And at its closing concert, Black Sabbath seemed pretty mainstream. On Saturday, the crowd was dotted with   fans decked out in    Black Sabbath regalia. But most concertgoers wore their fandom more lightly: One man in a Black Sabbath shirt who declined to give his name said that he worked in financial services in London and read an issue of The Economist in the moments before the lights went down. By the time Mr. Osbourne hit the climax of \u201cBlack Sabbath,\u201d the magazine was tucked away and the man was on his feet with his hands raised in the shape of devil\u2019s horns, singing gleefully along to the lyrics: \u201cSatan\u2019s sitting there, he\u2019s   those flames get higher and higher. \u201d The band has always identified as rough and tumble, alternative, working class and distinctly Birminghamian, so the hometown concert had special resonance for some in the audience on Saturday. \u201cBlack Sabbath are part of the cultural identity of being in Birmingham,\u201d said Pamela Pinski, 31, who lives and works in the area. Coming to the concert, she added, felt \u201ckind of patriotic to the city,\u201d and like a chance to celebrate \u201clocal boys that done good. \u201d In interviews, the band members have insisted that \u201cThe End\u201d  \u2014   which began in Omaha just over a year ago and made stops in Europe, South America and Australia before coming to Britain last month  \u2014   really is their last run. Mr. Iommi, who learned he had cancer several years ago, told Rolling Stone that his \u201cbody won\u2019t take it much more. \u201d And Mr. Osbourne said in a recent interview with the BBC, \u201cThis is definitely it. \u201d Mr. Osbourne has said goodbyes to music before, though, so you could forgive fans for not taking him entirely at his word: In 1992, he went on a farewell tour that he billed as his swan song. Three years later, he was on the road again. Outside the arena, Errol Lynch, 45, was one of several fans who said he thought the band had more in store. \u201cTwo years down the line, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Let\u2019s put our problem behind us,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that even if the band wouldn\u2019t tour again, \u201cthey will do an odd festival. \u201d Mr. Lynch, originally from Ireland, was in Birmingham to see the group for the third time in the space of a week. (Mr. Osbourne, who has performed with other bands and as a solo act, and who was estranged from Black Sabbath through much of the 1980s and \u201990s, has at least one solo date planned for this summer, in Illinois.) Mr. Osbourne had said that he was feeling emotional in the   to Saturday\u2019s concert, but he gave only a fleeting farewell speech, marveling at \u201cwhat a journey we\u2019ve all had. \u201d Several times throughout the night he thanked the audience, and at one point he got down on his knees and bowed. When the last song, \u201cParanoid,\u201d ended, he blew a kiss, took some final bows, then stopped to have his picture taken with his bandmates before loping off the stage. In the arena lobby after the concert, Mike King, 32, who had traveled from San Francisco, said that he ranked the show among Black Sabbath\u2019s better recent performances. \u201cI\u2019m really, really, really going to miss them,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cOnce they\u2019re gone, that\u2019s it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561640.7940226}
