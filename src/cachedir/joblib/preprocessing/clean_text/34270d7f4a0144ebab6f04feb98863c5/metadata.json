Trump plans to throw Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities in Hillary Clinton\u2019s face on live television during the presidential debates this fall, questioning whether she enabled his behavior and sought to discredit the women involved. Mr. Trump will try to hold her accountable for security lapses at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens there. And he intends to portray Mrs. Clinton as fundamentally corrupt, invoking everything from her cattle futures trades in the late 1970s to the federal investigation into her email practices as secretary of state. Drawing on psychological warfare tactics that Mr. Trump used to defeat \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio and \u201c \u201d Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries, the Trump campaign is mapping out character attacks on the Clintons to try to increase their negative poll ratings and bait them into making political mistakes, according to interviews with Mr. Trump and his advisers. Another goal is to win over skeptical Republicans, since nothing unites the party quite like castigating the Clintons. Attacking them could also deflect attention from Mr. Trump\u2019s vulnerabilities, such as his treatment of women, some Trump allies say. For Mrs. Clinton, the coming battle is something of a paradox. She has decades of experience and qualifications, but it may not be merit that wins her the presidency  \u2014   it may be how she handles the humiliations inflicted by Mr. Trump. She would make history as the first woman to be a   nominee, yet she would also be viewed, in part, through the prism of her husband\u2019s flaws. Some political allies and friends, while disgusted with Mr. Trump, see a certain cosmic symmetry at work: After decades of fighting what she once called \u201cthe politics of personal destruction,\u201d Mrs. Clinton will reach the White House only if she survives one more crucible of sordid and scandalous accusations. \u201cShe is so prepared to be president, but holding her head high and staying dignified during the campaign is probably what will help her the most,\u201d said Melanne Verveer, a longtime friend and former chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cTrump is yet another way she will be tested personally  \u2014   one of her greatest tests yet. \u201d Mrs. Clinton has often flourished in the wake of boorish behavior: her husband\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky, Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s investigation of her husband, the congressional impeachment proceedings. Women rallied to her side during her 2000 Senate race after her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, invaded her personal space during one debate, and they helped her win the 2008 New Hampshire primary shortly after Barack Obama dismissively said she was \u201clikable enough. \u201d Yet Mr. Trump said he was determined not to fall into those traps. In a telephone interview, he noted that women did not like seeing Mrs. Clinton insulted or bullied by men. He said he wanted to be more strategic, by calling into question Mrs. Clinton\u2019s judgment in her reaction to Mr. Clinton\u2019s affairs  \u2014   people close to the couple have said she was involved in efforts to discredit the women  \u2014   and in her response to crises like Benghazi. \u201cJust getting nasty with Hillary won\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou really have to get people to look hard at her character, and to get women to ask themselves if Hillary is truly sincere and authentic. Because she has been really ugly in trying to destroy Bill\u2019s mistresses, and she is pandering to women so obviously when she is only interested in getting power. \u201d He acknowledged that Republicans tried to discredit her judgment in the marathon Benghazi hearing in the fall, to little avail. But he said that he would be more pointed and memorable in linking her to the failings and deaths in Libya, and that the debate would have a vastly larger television audience than the hearing. Still, advisers of Mrs. Clinton pointed to her   with the   Benghazi committee as a sign of her unflappability. \u201cFrom Rick Lazio to the House Benghazi committee, there\u2019s a long line of Republicans who set out to personally attack Hillary Clinton but ended up inflicting the damage on themselves,\u201d a Clinton campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement. \u201cWe know Donald Trump is the most unconventional of them all, but no matter what he throws at her, she will keep running her own campaign and won\u2019t hesitate to call him out. \u201d Several Clinton advisers said they were not underestimating Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to do some damage, acknowledging that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unfavorability ratings were high  \u2014   though not as high as Mr. Trump\u2019s  \u2014   and that many Americans had concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness, according to polls. But these Clinton advisers expressed confidence that Mr. Trump would overreach and engender sympathy for Mrs. Clinton. Two advisers said that the campaign had done polling to test the possible effectiveness of Mr. Trump\u2019s lines of attacks and, while not disclosing details about the data, that they were convinced that he would not seriously hurt her. Mrs. Clinton, in turn, has begun attacking Mr. Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns, suggesting he has something to hide, and over his temperament and leadership abilities by describing him as a \u201cloose cannon. \u201d And political allies say that, in time, voters will see through Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms. \u201cHe can\u2019t run on his   agenda because he doesn\u2019t have one, and he can\u2019t go after her on substantive policy because she knows so much more than he does,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. Yet Mr. Trump has been steadily underestimated during the presidential campaign. His Republican rivals were certain that voters would tire of his slashing style and his harsh language, and some political strategists were sure his lack of policy details would make him unprepared in the eyes of too many. Even one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biggest assets to many Democrats  \u2014   becoming the first female president and returning Mr. Clinton to a White House role  \u2014   can be exploited as vulnerabilities. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a woman at the top of the ticket, and there will be plenty of people who\u2019ll have a problem with her gender,\u201d said Christina Greer, a political scientist at Fordham University. And Mr. Trump \u201ccan say that Bill Clinton was accused of rape and destroyed a girl\u2019s life,\u201d she added, referring to allegations by Juanita Broaddrick of a sexual assault in the 1970s and to the Lewinsky affair. With polls showing that Mr. Trump has unprecedented high negative ratings with voters and is in particular trouble with women, some Republican strategists say he has no choice but to try to drive up Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unfavorability ratings. A recent   poll found that 57 percent of likely Trump supporters said that their votes were more to express opposition to Mrs. Clinton than to support Mr. Trump. \u201cHis best way to rally hostile Republican delegates before the convention is to show he\u2019s a great Clinton attack dog,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who oversaw a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Bush in this year\u2019s Republican race. Mark Penn, the chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and the Harvard University Center for American Political Studies have conducted polling that indicates that attacks against Mrs. Clinton over her private email server, the deaths in Benghazi and other issues would weaken her in a matchup against Mr. Trump. \u201cThe poll shows he could bring her vote down with sharp attacks, but that does not bring his vote up,\u201d Mr. Penn wrote in an email. At a campaign rally for Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday in New Jersey, some supporters said they were concerned about the damage Mr. Trump could do. They described him as a street fighter and worried that Mrs. Clinton would not be gutsy and nimble enough to deliver a knockout punch. \u201cTrump is a real lowbrow brawler,\u201d said Michael Magazzu, an entrepreneur in the energy sector from Vineland, N. J. \u201cThat\u2019s not her style. She has to counteract him, and the best way may be to keep her cool. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564563.4024494}
