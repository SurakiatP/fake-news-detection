Young\u2019s basic thesis is that, if someone as, umm, let\u2019s say immoderate, as Trump could get elected President (in part as an anti-PC champion, no less), it would validate the PC belief that \u201ccrude xenophobia\u201d and \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d really are pervasive problems. [ Why Electing Donald Trump Could Make Political Correctness Worse , November 7, 2016] And so the PC crowd would double-down even further. \\nI think this is a good analysis. Of course, Young\u2019s implicit assumption is that increasing political polarization is a problem that can be solved, that a center-Right, classical liberal consensus is the goal. But the time for that has passed. So kudos to Young for identifying the problem, but we need a new solution\u2014such as Michael Hart\u2019s proposal for the peaceful secession of Red State America.'"}, "time": 1742563128.8972027}
