It\u2019s about shifting thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria, along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. In Moscow, Russian and Syrian foreign ministers expressed concern. Sergey Lavrov said Moscow will \u201ctake measures to prevent terrorists moving from Mosul to Syria with their heavy arms, which, of course, will seriously worsen the situation in the Syrian republic.\u201d .. \u201cWe think that it is important not to let this happen\u2026We cannot let the terrorist leave Mosul (for) Syria with the aim to re-direct their activity.\u201d .. Syrian Foreign Walid al-Muallem said the US-led \u201ccoalition has never fought Daesh. On the contrary, it is destroying the infrastructure of the Syrian economy, and recently destroyed a huge number of bridges on the Euphrates River\u2026They want to move Daesh from Mosul into Raqqa.\u201d .. Assad close political and media advisor Bouthaina Shaaban explained Washington\u2019s dirty scheme, ignored by media scoundrels, saying redeploying ISIS fighters from Mosul to Syria would represent a \u201chuge danger to our sovereignty, to our country.\u201d .. \u201cRussia and Syria are looking at this issue extremely seriously. We\u2019re not going to sit and watch\u2026The way they encircle Mosul shows they would like these terrorists to move into to Syria\u2026They\u2019re navigating terrorism from one place to another, limiting terrorism in one place, directing it to another place. That\u2019s the absolute truth of what is happening in our region.\u201d .. Washington and its rogue allies pay lip service alone to fighting terrorism while actively supporting it. So-called \u201cmoderates\u201d aren\u2019t so \u201cmoderate,\u201d Shaaban explained. \u201cThere are no \u2019Syrian moderates.\u2019 \u201c .. They\u2019re cold-blooded cutthroat killers, imperial death squads, serving US imperial interests, actively supported by its coalition partners wanting Assad toppled, Syrian sovereignty destroyed, an Israeli rival eliminated, and Iran isolated ahead of repeating the same scenario against its government. .. Aided by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah fighters, Syria is engaged in the \u201cmost challenging issue for humanity in the 21st century,\u201d Shaaban stressed \u2013 the struggle to defeat the scourge of US created and supported terrorism, threatening everyone everywhere unless challenged and eliminated. .. America intends stopping at nothing to advance its imperium \u2013 its goal, unchallenged dominion over planet earth, its resources and populations \u2013 a world unfit and unsafe to live in. Beginning with the Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidency\u2019s Balkan wars, culminating with the 1999 rape of Yugoslavia, all sovereign independent states have been targeted for regime change \u2013 the 9/11 false flag used as pretext to wage phony war on terrorism. .. \\nSyria is in the eye of the storm. Conflicts continue raging in all countries America attacked after that staged incident \u2013 effectively declaring war on humanity. Will nuclear war on Russia, China and Iran follow Hillary\u2019s likely ascension to power next year? Her rage for wanting their sovereign governments eliminated risks ending life on earth.
