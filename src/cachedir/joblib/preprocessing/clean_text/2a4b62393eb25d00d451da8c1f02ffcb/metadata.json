All three, along with several other movies that examine racial politics, are set to create thunderclaps at the Toronto International Film Festival, which begins on Thursday night and represents the unofficial starting gate for the 2017 Academy Awards. Yet these pictures, as pointed out by Cameron Bailey, the festival\u2019s artistic director, \u201ccould not be addressing race in more different ways, and to put them in a box  \u2014   as \u2018black films\u2019 or whatever  \u2014   would just be more racism, frankly. \u201d Speaking by telephone, Mr. Bailey added, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to have a conversation about their similarities, but I think it\u2019s almost more important to be aware of their differences. \u201d Mr. Bailey\u2019s concern is real, especially given the shorthand that is forming around certain films on the early awards circuit and the #OscarsSoWhite outrage that defined the last two awards cycles. In conversations about the contours of the coming season, some Hollywood players have started bifurcating (some would say segregating) award candidates  \u2014   the films that examine racism and the black experience on one hand, and everything else on the other. Another worry involves diminishing artistic experience, or \u201cflattening,\u201d as Mr. Bailey put it, which can happen when films are narrowly defined and labeled. Giving as an example Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a poetic film about a young black man growing up in a poor section of Miami, Mr. Bailey said in a   email, \u201cThe histories that shape the black experience are crucial to \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 but they don\u2019t contain it, any more than \u2018Foxcatcher\u2019 and \u2018Whiplash\u2019 should be defined mainly as movies about the white experience. \u201d (\u201cMoonlight\u201d will also play in Toronto.) A closer look at \u201cLoving,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d  \u2014   the first two counting on Toronto to rev up their awards chances, and the third hoping for a resuscitation  \u2014   reveals drastically different artistic statements and cinematic approaches. \u201cLoving,\u201d written and directed by the Southern filmmaker Jeff Nichols, is a   relationship drama that imparts its messages  \u2014   love is love let\u2019s try harder to appreciate one another  \u2014   in a whisper. It looks at an interracial marriage in 1950s Virginia. Mr. Nichols (\u201cMud\u201d) based his latest film on the true story of Richard and Mildred Loving, whose marriage broke their state\u2019s   law and led to the landmark Supreme Court ruling that deemed marriage a human right. \u201cAll this talk of civil rights,\u201d a friend tells Mildred (played by Ruth Negga) as they watch television news. \u201cYou need to get you some. \u201d Mr. Nichols said he wanted \u201cLoving,\u201d which also stars Joel Edgerton, to draw its power from subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make movies that people experience instead of just receive,\u201d Mr. Nichols said, adding that the film\u2019s intimate feeling was meant to humanize the issue at stake. \u201cEspecially in an election year like we\u2019re in, everyone goes to their corners and gets ready to fight, and what gets forgotten are the people at the center of these topics. \u201d Mr. Bailey noted that \u201cLoving\u201d counted integration dramas like \u201cGentleman\u2019s Agreement\u201d as antecedents. (That film, directed by Elia Kazan and examining   won best picture at the Academy Awards in 1948.) Focus Features, a division of Universal Pictures, plans to release \u201cLoving\u201d on Nov. 4. Taking a much more rollicking approach is Theodore Melfi\u2019s \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d which tells the true story of black women who calculated rocket trajectories for NASA in the early 1960s. \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d from Chernin Entertainment, Levantine Films and Fox 2000, a unit of 20th Century Fox, is not yet finished. But about 30 minutes of footage will be shown in Toronto, followed by a street concert by Pharrell Williams, who wrote songs for the film. The footage begins with the movie\u2019s three lead actresses  \u2014   Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e  \u2014   stranded on the side of a rural road after their car breaks down. An arrogant white cop arrives, and the central conflict is established: These are three smart,   patriotic Americans who find themselves put down, underestimated and insulted because of their race. In a scene at NASA that finds Ms. Henson\u2019s math whiz abruptly assigned to an office filled with hostile, white, male engineers, she approaches the only other woman, who is also white, to ask directions to the restroom. The icy response: \u201cI have no idea where your bathroom is. \u201d (The only \u201ccolored\u201d lavatory, as it turns out, is across campus.) At a time of particular togetherness  \u2014   everyone in the film, black and white, is galvanized behind putting a man into space  \u2014   the races could not be farther apart. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a black movie, and this isn\u2019t a women\u2019s movie: This is an everyone movie,\u201d said Margot Lee Shetterly, who wrote the book from which \u201cHidden Figures\u201d is adapted. She continued: \u201cBlack history has always been about slavery and civil rights. There is a whole lot more than that. I want the full spectrum of the   experience reflected in the same way that other American experiences are reflected. \u201d Even so, the   producer Donna Gigliotti (\u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d) who optioned Ms. Shetterly\u2019s book, emphasized that \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d set for   release, had an     ethos. \u201cA real nail biter\u201d is how Ms. Gigliotti, whose credits include \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d described the overall story, noting the   space travel effort at the center of the film. \u201cThey were mathematicians, which makes their story sound like homework,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. It\u2019s exciting. \u201d Perhaps the most scrutinized film at Toronto will be \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d a sweeping antebellum melodrama with scenes of horrifying violence. The fiery film, based on the Nat Turner slave rebellion of 1831, was considered an Oscar   and balm for #OscarsSoWhite after its sizzling debut at the last Sundance Film Festival. But in recent weeks, following renewed attention on a 1999 rape case, controversy has swirled around Nate Parker, the film\u2019s director, writer, producer and star. Mr. Parker was charged  \u2014   and later acquitted  \u2014   in that case, which occurred when he was a student at Penn State Mr. Parker\u2019s former roommate Jean McGianni Celestin, who has a story credit on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d was convicted of sexual assault, but his conviction was later overturned. Their accuser later committed suicide. Mr. Parker declined an interview request for this article, but he will attend the Toronto festival, where he is expected to participate in    sessions and a news conference, according to a spokeswoman for Fox Searchlight, which has scheduled \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d for release in theaters on Oct. 7. Mr. Parker has noted that his film, which also stars Armie Hammer and Aja Naomi King, bears similarities to \u201cBraveheart,\u201d which won the best picture Oscar in 1996. That film tells the story of William Wallace (played by Mel Gibson) who roused and united the medieval Scots against their oppressors at a time when no one thought it was possible. \u201cNat Turner became a leader against incredible odds,\u201d Mr. Parker is quoted as saying in the film\u2019s production notes. \u201cSo often when we see slavery in popular culture, it is through stories of suffering and endurance. But Nat Turner\u2019s is a more incendiary narrative he was a slave but also a true rebel against injustice. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628547.5580761}
