The official theme for the first day of the Republican National Convention was \u201cMake America Safe Again,\u201d but infighting and protests were undercurrents. Tonight\u2019s   speakers included Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Donald Trump\u2019s wife, Melania. Mr. Trump introduced her, walking on stage to Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d and telling the crowd: \u201cOh we\u2019re gonna win, we\u2019re gonna win so big. \u201d Our live coverage is here. The New Yorker published an article in which Mr. Trump\u2019s ghostwriter on \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d confesses to \u201ca deep sense of remorse\u201d for portraying Mr. Trump positively. \u201cLying is second nature to him,\u201d the author said. _____ 2. Louisiana officials detailed how an     killed three police officers and wounded three more in Baton Rouge, saying he deliberately targeted them. In a range of digital postings, sometimes under another name, the gunman complained that \u201cdevils\u201d ran the world and advocated a bloody response to recent fatal shootings by the police. \u201cOne hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,\u201d he said in one clip, \u201chave been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. \u201d _____ 3. Hillary Clinton, speaking at an N. A. A. C. P. convention in Cincinnati, denounced the attacks on police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, as well as police shootings that killed two black men this month. \u201cThis madness has to stop,\u201d she said. An analysis of dozens of recent state and national polls of voters shows that Mrs. Clinton holds a modest but clear lead over Mr. Trump. _____ 4. Leading antidoping officials urged that Russia be barred from the Summer Olympics in Rio after an independent inquiry confirmed a Russian  \u2019s claims of   doping. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said officials implicated in the report would be \u201ctemporarily suspended,\u201d but criticized \u201ca dangerous relapse of politics intruding into sports. \u201d The International Olympic Committee called an emergency meeting for Tuesday. _____ 5. One of our   stories today is a meditation on clutter from a different perspective: someone who simply couldn\u2019t afford much stuff. A woman remembers the years when poverty mandated a \u201cminimalist\u201d lifestyle so popular now among the middle class. \u201cFor people who are not so well off,\u201d she notes, \u201cthe idea of opting to have even less is not really an option. \u201d _____ 6. Facing reports that Roger Ailes would soon be removed as chairman of Fox News, 21st Century Fox insisted that \u201cthis matter is not yet resolved. \u201d Mr. Ailes is being sued for sexual harassment by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. _____ 7. Turkey\u2019s government fired nearly 9, 000 police officers, widening its vast purge of perceived opponents after a failed military coup. Above, a funeral for a police officer killed in clashes. Over the weekend, 6, 000 military personnel were arrested and 3, 000 judges suspended. Secretary of State John Kerry and the European Union\u2019s top diplomat urged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to show restraint, even suggesting Turkey\u2019s membership in NATO and candidacy for the E. U. could be compromised. _____ 8. Political tensions in France are spiking, as   opposition politicians assailed the Socialist government over Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack in Nice. Jeers and calls for the French prime minister to resign fractured a moment of silence he attended in Nice, called to honor the 84 people killed there by a rampaging truck driver. Above, the gathering. New details emerged about the attacker: he was not an observant Muslim but had been recently searching for Islamist material and had collected images of Islamic State and other terrorist figures. _____ 9. A celebrity feud flared anew. Kanye West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, posted clips of a phone conversation that appeared to counter Taylor Swift\u2019s insistence that she was blindsided by lyrics in one of Mr. West\u2019s songs. In the clips, Ms. Swift thanks him for running the line \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\u201d by her, and he responds, \u201cRelationships are more important than punch lines. \u201d _____ 10. Finally, stocked up on tissues? Our medical expert wants you to know that the summer cold is no anomaly. We tend to think of colds as being more contagious in winter, he says, possibly because the rhinovirus is more prevalent then and spreads easily when people congregate indoors. But the science, he says, shows that cold temperatures by themselves don\u2019t increase vulnerability. Above, a reminder of subfreezing temperatures. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
