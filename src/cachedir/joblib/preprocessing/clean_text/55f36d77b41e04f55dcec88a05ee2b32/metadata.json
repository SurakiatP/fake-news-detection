New Moon in Scorpio this weekend sets the tone for the month ahead, themes, needs, issues, etc. And that means \u201cshadow work,\u201d looking at all the deep dark needs, feelings, fears, and impulses that, when still unconscious, take us where we really don\u2019t want to go and cause effects we regret in the future. So onward and upward is feeling, talking about, expressing, and just flat out being aware of ourselves. \\nWhether you agree or disagree with the observations made in this video I hope they are food for thought and a springboard for further discussion within your circles of relationship. In this way, we can all become more aware of the socio-cultural-religious-educational conditioning going on so as to identify more clearly for ourselves and our children just what kind of life we want to propagate on this planet! Injoy! \\nFor info and tickets to Astrology Rising: http://astrologyrisingcostarica.com/ For JP Sears vid on the election: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhnNC\u2026 For Philip Zimbardo\u2019s TED talk on porn: https://www.ted.com/talks/zimchalleng\u2026 For the music at the end of the vid: http://scotthuckabay.com/ Share:'"}, "time": 1742563807.0669801}
