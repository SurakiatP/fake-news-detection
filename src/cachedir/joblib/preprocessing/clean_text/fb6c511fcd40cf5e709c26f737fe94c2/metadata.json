All of a sudden, as we have seen, they\u2019ve gotten interested in Russian cyberwarfare, which the administration appeared to be extremely nonchalant about until they lost the November election. And now we\u2019re going to have new investigations, meaning days and days of headlines about the other thing that Democrats attribute their loss to, meaning Comey\u2019s action with 11 days to go, in which he reopened, as he said, the investigation. Many Democrats think that\u2019s why they lost. Now, that would have faded into history. This is a way to say that it\u2019s not going to, and it will remain there. I\u2019m not sure this is the best way to ensure a good transition, one where you transfer not just the authority of office, but the legitimacy. But that seems to be what the Democrats want to do as they get out of power. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561776.798646}
