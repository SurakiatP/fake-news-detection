Trump\u2019s statement that the United States might not come to the defense of NATO allies that do not foot their share of the bill fueled anxiety on Thursday in a Europe that is already deeply unsettled about Russia\u2019s assertive posture, Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union and the rise of   populist and nationalist parties. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump suggested that if elected president he would use a country\u2019s level of military spending as a factor in deciding whether the United States would honor its commitment to defend any member nation that comes under attack. While President Obama and other American officials have also pressed European countries in recent years to increase military spending in line with their commitments to NATO, Mr. Trump more explicitly linked financial considerations to the strategic response he would order as president in the event of an attack by Russia. His comments left some European officials concerned that the United States under Mr. Trump would edge away from the security guarantees that Washington has provided to the Continent since World War II. But they also stoked the debate over cost sharing after years in which Europe had been slow to meet its commitments on military spending. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general and a former prime minister of Norway, said that he \u201cwill not interfere in the U. S. election campaign,\u201d but made clear that he was alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cSolidarity among allies is a key value for NATO,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis is good for European security and good for U. S. security. We defend one another. We have seen this in Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of European, Canadian and   troops have stood shoulder to shoulder with U. S. soldiers. \u201d He added, \u201cTwo world wars have shown that peace in Europe is also important for the security of the United States. \u201d Article 5 of the 1949 treaty that set up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obliges any member of the alliance to come to the defense of another member if it comes under attack. The article has been invoked only once  \u2014   after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. \u201cThey have an obligation to make payments,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cMany NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they\u2019re supposed to make. \u201d Asked whether the United States would come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  \u2014   three Baltic states that were invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, and joined NATO in 2004  \u2014   in the event of a Russian invasion, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you what I\u2019d do because I don\u2019t want Putin to know what I\u2019d do,\u201d referring to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, for whom Mr. Trump has expressed admiration. Reminded that NATO members are obligated by treaty to come to one another\u2019s defense, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cHave they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes. \u201d Asked on Thursday about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon of Britain snapped: \u201cArticle 5 is an absolute commitment. It doesn\u2019t come with conditions or caveats. \u201d Less than two weeks ago, at a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw, Mr. Obama reassured America\u2019s allies that \u201cin good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United States  \u2014   always. \u201d Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, took to Twitter to emphasize that his country was one of only five NATO members to meet the target that it spend 2 percent of gross domestic product  \u2014   a broad measure of economic activity  \u2014   on military spending. (The others are the United States, Britain, Poland and Greece.) Mr. Ilves also noted that Estonia contributed troops to the fight in Afghanistan in keeping with Article 5. Artis Pabriks, a former foreign and defense minister of Latvia, which borders Russia and has stepped up military spending, wrote on Twitter: \u201cIf Trump doubts NATO solidarity in the case of Article 5, then his election is dangerous for Baltic security. \u201d Lithuania\u2019s president, Dalia Grybauskaite, tried to calm her citizens. \u201cRegardless of who becomes the next president of the U. S. we trust America,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cIt has always defended nations under attack, and will do so in the future. \u201d Ms. Grybauskaite added: \u201cLithuania  \u2014   as well as other Baltic states  \u2014   is doing everything it can. We are modernizing our armed forces, we have reinstituted conscription and our defense spending will reach 2 percent of G. D. P. in 2018. I do not think interpretations of candidate Trump\u2019s remarks are necessary. We know that the U. S. will remain our most important partner. \u201d In Russia, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments met with approval. Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign relations committee of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, contrasted Mr. Trump with Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. \u201cClinton\u2019s creed: strengthen the U. S.\u2019s   alliances. Trump\u2019s creed: respond only to real threats,\u201d Mr. Pushkov wrote. \u201cAggressive banality versus common sense. \u201d NATO\u2019s 28 members pledged at summit meetings in Wales in 2014 and in Warsaw this month to do more to meet the 2 percent of GDP spending target, and Mr. Stoltenberg has made reaching that goal a priority. Xenia Wickett, the head of the United States and Americas program at Chatham House, a foreign policy think tank based in London, said Mr. Trump was echoing  \u2014   albeit in far less diplomatic terms  \u2014   concerns raised by a succession of American secretaries of defense, including the three who have served Mr. Obama: Robert M. Gates, Leon E. Panetta and Ashton B. Carter. \u201cThe U. S. is no longer willing to cover the approximately 75 percent of the NATO budget that it currently does,\u201d Ms. Wickett wrote in an email. \u201cTrump takes it to the extreme, which is new, but the direction is not new. Trump wants to see a more \u2018fair\u2019 division of labor. \u201d She added, \u201cUnfortunately, his way of expressing it is likely to aid our adversaries rather than assist the alliance. \u201d Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the head of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization, said too much was being made of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. She said the imbalance in NATO spending \u201cis just not sustainable,\u201d adding, \u201cTrump is taking the   debate to extreme levels, by directly calling into question U. S. responsibility as a NATO member state to fulfill its obligations under Article 5, in case a NATO member state got attacked by Russia. \u201d She added that European leaders needed to persuade their citizens \u201cof the importance of investing in defense to face current and future security challenges. \u201d But Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden, said he feared that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks would embolden autocratic and aggressive powers. \u201cThere is certainly a risk that he will encourage states like Russia and China to take the risk that U. S. will not stand up for its allies and its commitments, and that could be extremely dangerous for global stability,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s downplaying not only the defense of common interests, but also the defense of common values. Democracy seems nearly to be a derogatory term for him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564288.993761}
