The intimate conversations, which totaled five hours, were a research tool for his 2015 biography of the real estate mogul. But something changed. A year later, Mr. Trump decided to run for president. And Mr. D\u2019Antonio was deeply alarmed by the kind of campaign that Mr. Trump decided to wage. So a few weeks ago, the biographer allowed me to listen to the taped interviews. Those recordings, which capture Mr. Trump in unusually candid, searching and unguarded ways, are the basis for a special   episode of The  . In both, Mr D\u2019Antonio and I explore Mr. Trump\u2019s emotional life, pyschology and behaviors, relying heavily on Mr. Trump\u2019s own words from the tapes. The recordings reveal dimensions of Mr. Trump we rarely see. He describes his lust for fighting in high school. He revels in the first time his name was mentioned in a newspaper. And he acknowledges a fear that the adoration of strangers, a sustaining force in his life, may someday fade away. Episode No. 1 focuses on Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to confront the traumas of his childhood: his parents\u2019 decision to send him off, at age 13, to a distant and discplined miliary academy his difficult relationship with his father and the tragic death of his older brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s kind of tragic about Donald is, he doesn\u2019t know himself and he really doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know him,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio tells me in Episode No. 1. He goes on: Mr. D\u2019Antonio expands on that idea of a superficial reality later in our interview, as we talk about Mr. Trump\u2019s lavish lifestyle. \u201cI think there is something about him that pursues this display of luxury as a signal to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cHe thinks that we think that this is what a billionaire\u2019s life is supposed to look like. So it\u2019s not even Donald Trump\u2019s life that he\u2019s living. What he\u2019s living is the life of an imaginary billionaire. \u201d Episode No. 2 further explores the grown man Mr. Trump became: fixated on his own celebrity, anxious about losing his status and contemptuous of those who fall from grace. That episode also tackles the question of why Mr. Trump decided to run for president. \u201cDonald Trump is a bottomless pit of need, and the presidency was the only object big enough that he could imagine seizing to fill up that hole,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be enough, were he to win. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s perhaps going to lose is going to be so trying for him to absorb, and it\u2019s going to mean that that big space remains empty and unfilled,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio continued. \u201cHe is likely to go around the world trying to seek attention in the style of a president  \u2014   even though he\u2019s not actually holding the office  \u2014   in an attempt to compensate for it. \u201cIf we think we\u2019ve seen and heard a lot from Donald Trump this year, I think we haven\u2019t seen or heard anything yet. \u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
