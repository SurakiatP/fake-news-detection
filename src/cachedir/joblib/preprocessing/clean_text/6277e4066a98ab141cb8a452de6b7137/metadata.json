[In an interview with Time magazine published Thursday, the    took on Colbert, who told a series of crude jokes about Trump during last week\u2019s Monday broadcast that culminated in the host calling Trump\u2019s mouth a \u201cc*ck holster\u201d for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  \u201cYou see a   guy like Colbert. There\u2019s nothing funny about what he says,\u201d Trump told Time. \u201cAnd what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. \u201d In his opening monologue last Monday, the CBS funnyman said, \u201cThe only thing [Trump\u2019s] mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin\u2019s c*ck holster. \u201d The joke was panned as homophobic and drew outrage from fans, who quickly made the hashtag #FireColbert a trending topic on Twitter. Colbert addressed the controversy surrounding the joke on his show two days later and said he didn\u2019t regret attacking the president. In his remarks to media Thursday, Trump said Colbert\u2019s crude comments \u201conly builds up my base. \u201d \u201cIt only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut his show was dying. I\u2019ve done his show.   \u2026     But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated  \u2026     The highest rating he\u2019s ever had. \u201d Indeed, Colbert\u2019s   show has seen a ratings resurgence since Trump took office. The president also took aim at a number of mainstream media personalities. Trump told Time that CNN host Chris Cuomo looks like a \u201cchained lunatic\u201d on TV and said CNN\u2019s Don Lemon is \u201cperhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting. \u201d \u201cChris Cuomo, he\u2019s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He\u2019s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis Don Lemon who\u2019s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it\u2019s like  \u2014   sometimes they\u2019ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they\u2019ll start screaming, we\u2019re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember?\u201d \u201cWashington Post, New York Times, they\u2019re really, really dishonest,\u201d Trump continued before lashing out at Time reporters. \u201cYou people are quite dishonest in all fairness. \u201d Trump also said he said he no longer tunes in to watch MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who has repeatedly ripped the president and his administration. The president called Fox News the \u201cmost accurate\u201d news network and says he tunes in to watch the morning programming. \u201cI do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I\u2019m watching Fox. But they\u2019re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean they  \u2014   if I do something wrong. But it\u2019s really, honestly it\u2019s the most accurate. \u201d Read Trump\u2019s full remarks to Time here.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742628448.924338}
