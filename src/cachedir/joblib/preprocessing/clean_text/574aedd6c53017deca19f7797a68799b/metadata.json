No film company, not even Pixar, can claim a track record like that. \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d starring Benedict Cumberbatch as one of Marvel\u2019s lesser comic book heroes, collected an estimated $85 million at theaters in the United States and Canada, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The movie, which received  strong reviews, cost at least $275 million to make and market worldwide. Disney said that \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d took in an additional $240. 4 million overseas Imax results in China were especially robust. With ticket sales of about $45. 6 million, \u201cTrolls\u201d took second place at the domestic box office it was produced by DreamWorks Animation at a cost of $125 million and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Turnout for \u201cTrolls,\u201d based on a line of   Danish toys and featuring songs by Justin Timberlake, was on par with efforts like \u201cThe Croods\u201d and \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d both of which spawned sequels. Third place went to Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d (Lionsgate) which arrived to about $14. 8 million in ticket sales, a solid total for a   movie from a director with a lot of personal baggage that relied heavily on   marketing. It was independently financed for about $40 million and played mostly to older moviegoers Lionsgate said that 68 percent of the weekend audience was over the age of 35. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Gibson  \u2014   assisted by savvy Lionsgate and Rogers  Cowan publicists  \u2014   has   himself as a player in Hollywood after a decade when his offscreen behavior made him a movie industry pariah. \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d received mostly positive reviews and has been generating awards buzz.'"}, "time": 1742562387.2692466}
