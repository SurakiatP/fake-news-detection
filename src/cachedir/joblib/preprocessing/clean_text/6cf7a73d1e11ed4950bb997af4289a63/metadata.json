Trump, in a   speech Wednesday night at a dinner honoring his running mate, Mike Pence, jabbed at his new Republican allies and his critics alike, questioned the ethics of \u201csuper PACs\u201d and talked about creating a \u201c \u201d immigration system. Mr. Trump credited Mr. Pence with helping to bring critics around to the ticket. \u201cThey all liked Mike. They were a little bit, you know, a little concerned with me,\u201d the   said, drawing laughter from the crowd of about 500 people, which included donors, cabinet appointees and other supporters. Mr. Trump said that his aides told him that he was not required to be at the dinner, but that he thought he had to be there to honor a man whose role on the ticket he described as one of his best decisions. Mr. Trump lauded Mr. Pence in a roughly   speech, but poked at him for declining to endorse his candidacy in the primary in Indiana, where he was governor, instead backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cThe fact that every donor he had was in favor of\u201d Mr. Cruz played no role in the decision, Mr. Trump said sarcastically, according to a recording provided by a guest. In the  \u2019s telling, Mr. Pence essentially endorsed him, and mentioned Mr. Cruz only as an afterthought. Mr. Trump also took aim at Mr. Cruz (a \u201csmart guy, he was a little late to the plate, but that\u2019s O. K. \u201d) Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a rival in the primary (\u201che can be nasty, that Scott Walker\u201d) members of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement (\u201cthey\u2019re really right now on a respirator they\u2019re pretty much gone\u201d) and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson (he mocked him for being late to donate promised money to outside groups supporting his candidacy). Such groups, like super PACs, need to be \u201cstraightened out,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPeople get very rich running PACs. \u201d On immigration, two days before he assumes the power to begin rolling back President Obama\u2019s executive orders, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re working on the border. We want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in legally. \u201d He added that he wanted the immigration system \u201cat least a certain degree to be  . \u201d It was not clear what that would entail. Mr. Trump, who has proposed \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants to weed out potential terrorists, said he wanted people who arrived here to work hard, but added, \u201cWe want people to come into our country who are going to love us and respect us. \u201d In a series of interludes and asides, Mr. Trump described asking the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to focus on the effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, then shifted to talking about a change to the tax system. Mr. Trump said that people compared his success to the popular movement that put Andrew Jackson in the White House. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anything like this since Andrew Jackson,\u201d Mr. Trump quoted his admirers saying. \u201cAndrew Jackson? What year was Andrew Jackson? That was a long time ago. \u201d Mr. Trump then gave the year  \u2014   1828  \u2014   and went on to suggest that his own nationalist movement had usurped Mr. Jackson\u2019s. He said that even \u201cthe haters\u201d who disliked him called his movement \u201cunprecedented. \u201d Mr. Trump expressed gratitude to black voters who had stayed home on Election Day \u201cbecause they liked me, or they liked me enough that they just said, \u2018No reason. \u2019\u201d Before returning to New York, Mr. Trump stopped by the Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House, to have dinner. He did not dine at the Pence dinner or at a later dinner for his cabinet picks.'"}, "time": 1742563808.9799902}
