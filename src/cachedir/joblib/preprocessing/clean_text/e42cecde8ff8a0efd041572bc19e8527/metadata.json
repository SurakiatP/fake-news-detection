The initial reaction from Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, emphasized the positives. Mr. Seibert welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s support of efforts to resolve the crisis in Ukraine and  the president\u2019s confirmation of the importance of NATO. Mr. Seibert also reaffirmed Germany\u2019s commitment to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its military by 2024, as pledged during last year\u2019s NATO summit meeting. But that did not seem to be enough for Mr. Trump, who insisted on Twitter early Saturday that Germany owed the alliance \u201cvast sums of money. \u201d \u201cDespite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO  the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\u201d According to figures released by the alliance, Germany spent 1. 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its military in 2016, compared with 3. 6 percent for the United States. As security experts have pointed out, NATO members spending more on their defense does not automatically translate into more money being sent to Brussels or Washington. The style of making one point and swiftly changing direction reminded some foreign policy experts of the way Mr. Trump acted on the campaign trail, when his position on certain issues could veer wildly from one day to the next. \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ve seen Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\u201d said Sylke Tempel, the editor in chief of Internationale Politik, published by the German Council on Foreign Relations, remarking on the approach that Mr. Trump took during the leaders\u2019 joint news conference on Friday. \u201cHe was Mr. Jekyll while reading his statement, saying nice things about economic ties, his commitment to Ukraine, common friendship all the niceties,\u201d Ms. Tempel said. \u201cThen, in the    session, he\u2019s his old self: disparaging the media, criticizing the British. \u201d Although memories of Ms. Merkel\u2019s warm relationship with President Barack Obama remain fresh in the minds of many Germans, it took repeated meetings over several years before the chancellor reached that level with Mr. Obama. During a joint news conference in Dresden in June 2009, she displayed stiff body language and a chilly formality, months after she had denied Mr. Obama permission to speak in front of the Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 presidential campaign. In 2006, Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessor, President George W. Bush, sought to win her over with a playful shoulder rub, a move abruptly rebuffed by the pragmatic chancellor. One year later, however, at the summit meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, she coaxed Mr. Bush to voice support for her vision of a global plan to combat climate change. Yet both of Mr. Trump\u2019s most recent predecessors followed diplomatic conventions and worked within the institutions established after World War II to foster communication and cooperation among nations. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach and his disparagement of global trade agreements have caused uncertainty among German politicians and industry leaders. Asked by a German journalist about this approach, the president insisted that while he was not against trade, the United States had been treated unfairly in global trade agreements. \u201cBut I am not an isolationist,\u201d he said. Less than 24 hours later, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s government refused to back a pledge to fully oppose trade protectionism at a meeting in   Germany, of the finance ministers of the Group of 20, which comprises industrial and   countries as well as the European Union. Participants last year had agreed to resist \u201call forms\u201d of protectionism. Germans have been both fascinated and horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to ignore the strictures of diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. For example, he has castigated Ms. Merkel for allowing refugees to flow into Germany in 2015, and he has called into question   War II alliances, including NATO and the European Union. Germans have not been entirely sure what to make of him. \u201cOne thing we can depend upon, that we saw yesterday: Donald Trump says what he wants,\u201d Nikolaus Blome, deputy editor of Bild, wrote in its online edition. \u201cHe has predictable political interests. What he doesn\u2019t have is a predictable way to pursue them. \u201d Ms. Tempel, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said simply: \u201cIf this mission was really about getting a first impression, you got your first impression. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561654.15332}
