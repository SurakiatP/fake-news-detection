He was 87. His death was confirmed by his consulting firm, Toffler Associates, based in Reston, Va. Mr. Toffler was a   social science scholar and successful freelance magazine writer in the   when he decided to spend five years studying the underlying causes of a cultural upheaval that he saw overtaking the United States and other developed countries. The fruit of his research, \u201cFuture Shock\u201d (1970) sold millions of copies and was translated into dozens of languages, catapulting Mr. Toffler to international fame. It is still in print. In the book, in which he synthesized disparate facts from every corner of the globe, he concluded that the convergence of science, capital and communications was producing such swift change that it was creating an entirely new kind of society. His predictions about the consequences to culture, the family, government and the economy were remarkably accurate. He foresaw the development of cloning, the popularity and influence of personal computers and the invention of the internet, cable television and telecommuting. \u201cThe roaring current of change,\u201d he said, was producing visible and measurable effects in individuals that fractured marriages, overwhelmed families and caused \u201cconfusional breakdowns\u201d manifested in rising crime, drug use and social alienation. He saw these phenomena as very human psychological responses to disorientation and proposed that they were challenging the very structures of communities, institutions and nations. He continued these themes in two successful   books, \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d (1980) and \u201cPowershift\u201d (1990) assisted by his wife, Heidi Toffler, who served as a researcher and editor for the trilogy and was a named   in subsequent books. She survives him. Mr. Toffler popularized the phrase \u201cinformation overload. \u201d His warnings could be bleak, cautioning that people and institutions that failed to keep pace with change would face ruin. But he was generally optimistic. He was among the first authors to recognize that knowledge, not labor and raw materials, would become the most important economic resource of advanced societies. Critics were not sure what to make of Mr. Toffler\u2019s literary style or scholarship. Richard R. Lingeman wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Toffler \u201csends flocks of facts and speculation whirling past like birds in a tornado. \u201d In Time magazine, the reviewer R. Z. Sheppard wrote, \u201cToffler\u2019s redundant delivery and overheated prose turned kernels of truth into puffed generalities. \u201d Mr. Toffler\u2019s work nevertheless found an eager readership among the general public, on college campuses, in corporate suites and in national governments. Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, met the Tofflers in the 1970s and became close to them. He said \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d had immensely influenced his own thinking and was \u201cone of the great seminal works of our time. \u201d Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang of China convened conferences to discuss \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d in the early 1980s, and in 1985 the book was the No. 2 best seller in China. Only the speeches of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping sold more copies. Mr. Toffler was born in New York on Oct. 4, 1928, and raised in Brooklyn, the only son and elder of two children of Sam and Rose Toffler, immigrants from Poland. His father was a furrier. Alvin began to write poetry and stories soon after learning to read and aspired to be a writer from the time he was 7 years old, he told interviewers. His inspiration, he said, came from an uncle and aunt  \u2014   Phil Album, an editor, and Ruth Album, a poet  \u2014   who lived with the Tofflers. \u201cThey were   literary intellectuals,\u201d Mr. Toffler said in an interview for this obituary in 2006, \u201cand they always talked about exciting ideas. \u201d Mr. Toffler enrolled in New York University in 1946 and, by his account, spent the next four years only mildly interested in his academic work. He was far more engaged in political activism. In the fall of 1948, during a brief trip home from helping to register black voters in North Carolina, he met Adelaide Elizabeth Farrell, known as Heidi. \u201cI went to Washington Square,\u201d he said, \u201cand as I walked across the park, I saw a girl in one of my classes. And next to her was a gorgeous blonde. We have been inseparable since. \u201d Where Mr. Toffler was voluble and visionary, Ms. Toffler was cleareyed and direct. Early in 1950, before they were married, she persuaded him to finish his course work at N. Y. U. and graduate with a degree in English. \u201cI barely made it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI paid no attention to credits. In my youthful view I thought, \u2018Who needs ceremony?\u2019 Heidi is far more practical. \u201d Both shared expansive intellects and the passion to make their lives matter. Like the writers he most admired, Mr. Toffler wanted experiences to report on. \u201cSteinbeck went to pick grapes,\u201d he said. \u201cJack London sailed ships. \u201d The couple decided to move to Cleveland, then at the very center of industrial America. They were married there on April 29, 1950, by a justice of the peace whom Mr. Toffler described as a \u201croaring drunk. \u201d They lived on the city\u2019s west side and took production jobs in separate factories. Mr. Toffler learned to weld and repair machinery and came to understand in the most personal way the toll that physical labor can have on industrial workers. He broke a vertebra when a steel beam he was helping to unload twisted unexpectedly and fell on him. At night, Mr. Toffler wrote poetry and fiction and discovered he was proficient in neither. But he still aspired to be a writer. In 1954, soon after the birth of the couple\u2019s only child, Karen, he persuaded the editor of Industry and Welding, a national trade magazine published in Cleveland, to hire him as a reporter. Mr. Toffler recalled: \u201cThe editor told me, \u2018You\u2019re getting this job because you know how to weld. Now, show me you know how to write. \u2019\u201d Mr. Toffler soon landed a job as a reporter for Labor\u2019s Daily, a national trade newspaper published in Charleston, W. Va. by the International Typographical Union. It sent him to Washington to cover labor news there in 1957. Two years later, he sent Fortune magazine a proposal to write an article about the economics of the growing mainstream interest in the arts. Fortune rejected the idea but invited Mr. Toffler to New York for an interview and hired him as its labor editor and columnist. He left Fortune in 1962 and, with his wife as editor and adviser, began a   career covering politics, technology and social science for scholarly journals and writing long interviews for Playboy magazine. His 1964 Playboy interview with the Russian novelist Vladimir Nabokov was considered one of the magazine\u2019s best. Besides his wife, Mr. Toffler is survived by a sister, Caroline Sitter. The Tofflers\u2019 daughter died in 2000. Mr. Toffler published 13 books and won numerous honors, including a career achievement award in 2005 from the American Society of Journalists and Authors. He and his wife formed Toffler Associates, a global forecasting and consulting company, originally based in Manchester, Mass. in 1996. In recent years, benefiting from hindsight, some critics said Mr. Toffler had gotten much wrong. Shel Israel, an author and commentator who writes about social media for Forbes, took issue with Mr. Toffler in 2012 for painting \u201ca picture of people who were isolated and depressed, cut off from human intimacy by a relentless fire hose of messages and data barraging us. \u201d But, he added: \u201cWe are not isolated by it. And when the information overloads us, most people are still wise enough to use the power of the \u2018Off\u2019 button to gain some peace. \u201d In writing \u201cFuture Shock\u201d 46 years ago, Mr. Toffler acknowledged that the future he saw coming might ultimately differ in the details from what actually came to pass. \u201cNo serious futurist deals in \u2018predictions,\u2019\u201d he wrote in the book\u2019s introduction. \u201cThese are left for television oracles and newspaper astrologers. \u201d He advised readers to \u201cconcern themselves more and more with general theme, rather than detail. \u201d That theme, he emphasized, was that \u201cthe rate of change has implications quite apart from, and sometimes more important than, the directions of change. \u201d He added, \u201cWe who explore the future are like those ancient mapmakers, and it is in this spirit that the concept of future shock and the theory of the adaptive range are presented here  \u2014   not as final word, but as a first approximation of the new realities, filled with danger and promise, created by the accelerative thrust. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562247.0192478}
