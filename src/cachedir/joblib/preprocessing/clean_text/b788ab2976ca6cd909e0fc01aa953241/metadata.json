There really is no more astute animal at realising when the time to bolt and never been seen again has come, well they\u2019re second to John Delaney on that front, but other than that no one has a better nose for this stuff,\u201d rodent expert Michael Pest shared with WWN. \\n\u201cShite and you\u2019d almost forgotten about Pat Hickey and all that stuff, the ship was set to right itself,\u201d confirmed an OCI insider, as he used a bucket to scoop water out of the premises as it creaked slowly into the nearby sea. \\nSenior OCI members had confirmed as recently as September that the course of their organisation had been chartered to calmer waters, but word that rats feel the vessel isn\u2019t long for this world has caused fresh panic. \\nIn recent days John Delaney and Kevin Kilty have disembarked the OCI as it continues to take on dangerous levels of water. \\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fucked if I\u2019m staying on and drowning with you lot, so long,\u201d Delaney allegedly said in his resignation letter.'"}, "time": 1742563096.4416194}
