Shulkin as his nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs at his Wednesday press conference at Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower. [\u201cHe\u2019s fantastic. He\u2019s fantastic. He will do a truly great job,\u201d said Trump, who called the press conference to discuss his plan to transfer control of his business operations to his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr. and a   Trump Organization executive. \u201cYou\u2019ll be very impressed with the job he does. \u201d  The incoming president said he interviewed more than 100 candidates for the VA job, \u201csome good and some not so good. \u201d Trump said improving the VA was one of the key commitments he made in the 2016 campaign. \u201cVeterans have been treated horribly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wait for 15, 16, 17 days \u2014  cases when they go in with a minor, easy form of cancer and they can\u2019t see a doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time they see a doctor, they\u2019re terminal,\u201d he said. If Shulkin takes over the VA, it will be a promotion for the internist with more than 20 published academic papers. Sulkin is one of the few holdovers from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, where he currently serves as the chief executive of the   strong Veterans Health Administration, the nation\u2019s largest integrated health care system with more than 1, 700 sites of care, serving nine million Veterans each year. The VA also conducts medical research and is the largest employer of medical graduate students in the country. \u201cVA is at a historic crossroad and will need to make bold reforms that will shape how we deliver IT services and health care in the future, as well as improve the experiences of Veterans, community providers, and VA staff,\u201d Shulkin said at his June 22 testimony before Congress. \u201cThroughout this transformation, our number one priority has and will always be the Veteran \u2014  ensuring a safe and secure environment for their  information and improving their experience is our goal. \u201d In addition to naming Shulkin, Trump again talked about the partnerships he is forming between the VA and the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic, and other elite private medical institutions to improve the medical care veterans receive. Shulkin was confirmed by the Senate in June 2015 as the VA\u2019s Undersecretary for Health. Before joining the Obama administration, Shulkin held leadership positions in private medical companies and hospitals and was the founder of DoctorQuality, which developed and sold software allowing medical professionals to identify, track, and analyze medical adverse events and other events relevant to lessons learned and exposure to regulatory reporting.
