It\u2019s quite a collection in which he goes after 282 people, places, and things in his uniquely abusive fashion. (Don\u2019t even get me started on his tweets about Hillary Clinton; you\u2019d be reading until tomorrow.) Here, instead, is a relatively limited list of his, a tiny entry of classic nastiness aimed at a peripheral character in this year\u2019s election campaign, Senator Elizabeth Warren: \\n\u201cPocahontas\u201d \u201cbombed last night!\u201d \u201cSad to watch\u201d \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u201cwanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn\u2019t chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201ca very weak Senator\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cthe least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate\u201d \u201cone of the least productive senators\u201d \u201cgoofy\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cVery racist!\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cone of the least productive U.S. Senators\u201d \u201chas a nasty mouth\u201d \u201cAll talk, no action!\u201d \u201cTotal hypocrite!\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201clowlife!\u201d \u201cIf it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we\u2019d have no jobs in America\u201d \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a clue\u201d \u201cfailed Senator\u201d \u201cgoofy\u201d \u201cgets nothing done\u201d \u201clied\u201d \u201cOur Native American Senator\u201d \u201cgoofy couldn\u2019t care less about the American worker\u201d \u201cdoes nothing to help!\u201d \u201cusing the woman\u2019s card\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts to run for POTUS\u201d \u201cphony Native American heritage\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts to run for POTUS\u201d \u201cphony Native American heritage\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cone of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate\u201d \u201chas done nothing!\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cweak and ineffective\u201d \u201cDoes nothing\u201d \u201cAll talk, no action \u2014 maybe her Native American name?\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cphony Native American heritage\u201d \u201cGoofy\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s flunky\u201d \u201chas a career that is totally based on a lie\u201d \u201cgoofy\u201d \u201ca fraud!\u201d \u201cgoofy\u201d \\nOf course, Warren falls into a category that is commendable indeed. She doesn\u2019t take this sort of crud from anyone \u2014 and certainly not any man. And throughout election 2016, she\u2019s responded blisteringly to Trump\u2019s abuse. The most recent moment of this: after The Donald so infamously leaned into his mic in the third presidential debate and half-whispered the phrase \u201c such a nasty woman ,\u201d while his opponent was speaking about social security. (\u201cMy Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald\u2019s, assuming he can\u2019t figure out how to get out of it.\u201d) Warren later rose at a Clinton rally in New Hampshire and offered a classic riposte , the sort of thing that hasn\u2019t been part of the Trumpian playbook when it comes to the women he goes after. \u201cGet this, Donald,\u201d she said. \u201cNasty women are tough. Nasty women are smart. And nasty women vote. And, on November 8th, we nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever.\u201d \\nIf there\u2019s another \u201cnasty woman\u201d around who got The Donald deep in his abusive soul, it\u2019s been TomDispatch regular Ann Jones. Back in June, before it was the subject of real attention, she pointed out the blazingly obvious (to her, but not to the massed mass media of election 2016): that many women recognized The Donald, saw right through him because \u201cevery woman who has ever had to deal with a Trump-style tyrant in her own home or at her job already has Trump\u2019s number. We recognize him as a bloated specimen of the common garden variety Controlling Man, a familiar type of Household Hitler. In fact, Donald J. Trump perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser.\u201d Once again, today, she\u2019s a step ahead of the rest of the media crowd when it comes to the essence of The Donald in this end-game moment.
