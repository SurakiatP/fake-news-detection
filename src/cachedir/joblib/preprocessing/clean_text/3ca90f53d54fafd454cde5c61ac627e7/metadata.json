Codevilla stunningly asserted in 2010. (See \u201c America\u2019s Bipartisan Ruling Class vs. the People \u201c) \\nThe evidence? \\nThe following list of Republican bigwigs who, by publicly declaring their support for Hillary Clinton \u2014 the pathological liar who had accomplished nothing as secretary of state, but violated U.S. laws and jeopardized national security with her unsecured private email server; lied about and left four Americans to die in Benghazi; and supports the absolute \u201cright\u201d of women to kill their unborn \u2014 instead of Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, have peeled away their masks, revealing their true faces. \\nHere\u2019s a list of the Republican \u00e9lites who have declared they\u2019ll vote for Hillary: Dan Akerson , former chairman and chief executive of General Motors: \u2018\u2018Serving as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and, most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics.\u2019\u2019 Marc Andreessen , venture capitalist: \u2018\u2018[Silicon] Valley wouldn\u2019t be here, we wouldn\u2019t be doing any of this if we didn\u2019t have the amazing flow of immigrants that we\u2019ve had in the last 80 years. And the idea of choking that off just makes me sick to my stomach.\u2019\u2019 Richard Armitage , deputy secretary of state and adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush: Trump \u2018\u2018doesn\u2019t appear to be a Republican, he doesn\u2019t appear to want to learn about issues. So I\u2019m going to vote for Mrs. Clinton.\u2019\u2019 Max Boot , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to GOP presidential candidates: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m literally losing sleep over Donald Trump. She would be vastly preferable to Trump.\u2019\u2019 Sally Bradshaw , former top Jeb Bush adviser, who told CNN that she left the GOP and became an independent because of Trump: \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want another four years of Obama\u2019s policies, I can\u2019t look my children in the eye and tell them I voted for Donald Trump.\u2019\u2019 Arne Carlson , a former two-term Republican governor of Minnesota who supported Obama. Jim Cicconi , former Reagan and George H.W. Bush aide: \u2018\u2018Hillary Clinton is experienced, qualified and will make a fine president. The alternative, I fear, would set our nation on a very dark path.\u2019\u2019 Eliot Cohen , former Bush administration official who has been called \u201cthe most influential neocon in academe,\u201d declared Clinton \u201cthe lesser evil, by a large margin.\u201d Maria Comella , former spokeswoman for governors Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani: \u2018\u2018Instead of speaking out against instances of bigotry, racism and inflammatory rhetoric whether it\u2019s been against women, immigrants, or Muslims, we made a calculus that it was better to say nothing at all in the interest of politics and winning elections.\u2019\u2019 Doug Elmets , former Reagan spokesman: \u2018\u2018I could live with four years of Hillary Clinton before I could ever live with one day of Donald Trump as president.\u2019\u2019 Elmets spoke at the Democratic National Convention, along with other Republicans now backing Clinton. Mike Fernandez , $4 million to GOP candidates in recent years: \u2018\u2018If I have a choice \u2014 and you can put it in bold \u2014 if I have a choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton, I\u2019m choosing Hillary. She\u2019s the lesser of two evils.\u2019\u2019 Charles Fried , US solicitor general under Reagan and current Harvard Law School professor: \u2018\u2018Though long a registered Republican, this will be the third consecutive presidential election in which my party forces the choice between party and, in John McCain\u2019s words, putting America first. . . . It is to [Mitt] Romney\u2019s credit that this year, like John Paulson and George Will, he is standing up against the brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian tendencies of Donald Trump.\u201d Richard Hanna , a \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican Congressman (NY) who is retiring this year, told The Syracuse Post Standard he will support Hillary because Trump is unfit to lead: \u201cI think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?\u201d Ben Howe , contributing editor at RedState.com. Robert Kagan , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; former Reagan State Department aide and adviser to the campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney; will vote for Hillary. Peter Mansoor , retired Army colonel and former aide to disgraced general David Petraeus: \u2018\u2018It will be the first Democratic presidential candidate I\u2019ve voted for in my adult life.\u2019\u2019 Hamid Moghadam , chairman and chief executive of Prologis: \u2018\u2018Our country is about tolerance and inclusion and that\u2019s why, as a lifelong Republican supporter, I endorse Hillary Clinton for president in this election.\u2019\u2019 William Oberndorf , $3 million to GOP candidates since 2012: \u2018\u2018If it is Trump vs. Clinton, and there is no viable third-party candidate, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.\u2019\u2019 Henry Paulson , treasury secretary to George W. Bush. Paulson wrote: \u201cWhen it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump. \u2018I will not cast a write-in vote. I\u2019ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world. To my Republican friends: I know I\u2019m not alone.\u2019\u2019 Larry Pressler , former three-term Republican senator from South Dakota: \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, but I am. If someone had told me 10 years ago I would do this, I wouldn\u2019t have believed them.\u2019\u2019 Chuck Robbins , chief executive of Cisco. Mark Salter , former top adviser to John McCain: \u2018\u2018Whatever Hillary Clinton\u2019s faults, she\u2019s not ignorant or hateful or a nut. She acts like an adult and understands the responsibilities of an American president. That might not be a ringing endorsement. But in 2016, the year of Trump\u2019s s campaign, it\u2019s more than enough.\u2019\u2019 Kori Schake , National Security Council and State Department aide. Robert Smith , former judge on New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals: \u2018\u2018This year, I\u2019m going to vote for a Democrat for president \u2014 the first time I\u2019ve done it in 36 years \u2014 and I think the decision is easy. Hillary Clinton is the only responsible choice, and I don\u2019t understand why so few of my fellow conservatives see it that way.\u2019\u2019 Brent Scowcroft , chairman of the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board and adviser to three previous GOP presidents: \u2018\u2018The presidency requires the judgment and knowledge to make tough calls under pressure . . . [Clinton] has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.\u2019\u2019 Craig Snyder , former chief of staff to then-Republican former senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and also an ex-colleague of former top Trump adviser Roger Stone and current top Trump adviser Paul Manafort. Alan Steinberg , regional EPA administrator. Mike Treiser , former Mitt Romney aide: \u2018\u2018In the face of bigotry, hatred, violence, and small-mindedness, this time, I\u2019m with her.\u2019\u2019 Meg Whitman , Hewlett Packard executive; former California gubernatorial contender. \\nAdd to the above list Glenn Beck , the billionaire Koch brothers , Bill Kristol ( National Review ), Mitt Romney , Karl Rove , and Ben Shapiro ( National Review ), who, although not declaring they\u2019ll vote for Hillary, are reported to be adamantly opposed to Trump. \\nHere are the Republicans who will vote for the Libertarian Party\u2019s Johnson-Weld ticket and so effectively assure a Hillary win : Martin Avila , CEO of Terra Eclipse, former Digital Campaign Director to former Rep.

He was subsequently found not guilty and Hillary herself was investigated for initiating the firings and making false accusations. \\nHer intimidation and blackmailing of her husband\u2019s lovers is well known by this point- and thus her campaign\u2019s emphasis on \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d is ironic to say the least. \\nHer voting record and statements reveal an individual who is most comfortable with US serial wars abroad, no matter the reason (or lack of reasons). \\nAdditional accusations against Hillary and her husband include violence and even murder of individuals whose interests diverged from theirs. \\nMost notably, Hillary has been accused of orchestrating the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. \\nNone of this seems to register with Republicans who are \u201ccrossing over\u201d\u2026. \\nConclusion: Whatever else takes place during this federal election, the disintegration of the credibility of the two-party system is perhaps the most important development of all. \\nSee also:'"}, "time": 1742562274.3742068}
