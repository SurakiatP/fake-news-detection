Your man don\u2019t want it, Trump\u2019s A BITCH. I\u2019ll make his whole brand go under,\u201d Eminem says of Trump on the song \u201cNo Favors. \u201d  The      also raps about sexually assaulting conservative author and pundit Ann Coulter. \u201cAnd fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster. With a lamp post, door handle, shutter. A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle, rubber. Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter. A banjo and manhole cover,\u201d Eminem raps. This not the first time that Eminem has used sexually explicit language to attack a conservative woman. In 2009, Eminem\u2019s   lyrics on the song \u201cWe Made You\u201d saw the rapper imaging having sex with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then. Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!\u201d Eminem raps. In the song\u2019s music video, Eminem cast a Palin    for a raunchy sequence in which the scantily clad woman is splayed out on an office desk wearing a skirt and bustier, and Eminem is seen rapping the aforementioned lyrics and dressed as Palin\u2019s husband, Todd Palin. Eminem also praises Black Lives Matter on the new song. \u201cGo ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her. That\u2019s for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando,\u201d he raps, referencing two     deaths of black people. Rapper Big Sean took to social media earlier this week to give thanks to Eminem for being apart of his album, which was released on Friday. . @eminem No Favors feels like back to back homeruns, you fuckin destroyed this verse!
