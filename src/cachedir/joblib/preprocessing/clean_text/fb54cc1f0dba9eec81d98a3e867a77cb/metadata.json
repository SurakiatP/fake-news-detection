But Bryan Cranston could be saying farewell to the United States after the election results are announced. The 60-year-old actor has warned he will move to Canada if Donald Trump becomes the next president.\\n\u2018I would definitely move,\u2019 he told The Bestseller Experiment podcast when asked what he would do if Trump was elected over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \u2018It\u2019s not real to me that, that would happen. I hope to God it won\u2019t,\u2019 he added. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be a vacation. I\u2019d be an expatriate,\u2019 Cranston added. \\nThe Emmy-award winning actor is the latest Hollywood celebrity to pledge to leave the country if the Donald wins the election next week. He joins the likes of Clinton supporters Barbra Streisand, comedian Chelsea Handler and Girls creator and star Lena Dunham who have all said they will move abroad if the Republican presidential candidate wins the vote. No comment necessary We will have to wait and see whether they will keep their promises.\\nBut the opportunity to test them is becoming more and more likley as Trump closes ground on Clinton after the FBI announced it was re-opening the investigation into her email scandal. An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll released Sunday showed Clinton ahead 46 per cent to 45 \u2013 narrower than Saturday\u2019s 2-point Clinton edge. \\nCranston, who more recently played Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, branding him a \u2018supreme narcissist\u2019 and an \u2019emperor without any clothes\u2019 following his controversial campaign . \\nThe Emmy Award-winner said previously the billionaire tycoon\u2019s rise in politics had \u2018slapped\u2019 Americans in the face and he would eventually be \u2018swept to the side\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t want to join the vitriol that Donald Trump represents,\u2019 Cranston told the Press Association. \u2018He\u2019s crude and crass and empty headed . If it weren\u2019t serious, it would be laughable. Here we have a reality show, game show guy who\u2019s now at the top of one of the two parties. That there are millions of people who are going to vote for him says something about, perhaps, disenfranchisement. People who are left out. People who don\u2019t feel they are being listened to.\u2019 \\nCranston revealed that he\u2019s met both Trump and Clinton, but his facetime with the billionaire Republican was 20 years ago. \u2018As he was saying hello it was like he was thinking of three or four or five other things, so it didn\u2019t feel like he was actually present,\u2019 Cranston recalled. Obama showing maturity and introspection His meeting with Clinton and another with her husband were improvements. \u2018She asked me questions and I gave my opinion. And I think that\u2019s what I want, I want a president, quite frankly, with what our current president has shown \u2013 diplomacy, restraint, introspection, a maturity \u2013 he\u2019s not any of those things ,\u2019 Cranston said, moving on to Trump. Hillary showing maturity and introspection \u2018He\u2019s the antitheses of what you\u2019d want a president to be as far as behavior and comportment,\u2019 the actor added. He added that university courses will be taught, books will be written and movies will be made in the future about Trump and this bizarre election.\\nCranston, who is a Clinton supporter, said he did not care if his views cost him fans, but that it was his responsibility as a public figure to talk politics as well . \u2018I am willing to take those risks, I don\u2019t want to sit on the sidelines. \\nThe socially-conscious Cranston joins the growing list of stars who have spoken up for Clinton which also includes Elizabeth Banks, actress America Ferrera and Scandal star Tony Goldwyn, all Hillary Clinton regulars on the campaign trail. \\nMore than 100 celebrities have also signed on to a MoveOn.org campaign launched on Monday to urge voters not to put Trump in the White House , with Mark Ruffalo, Neil Patrick Harris, Shonda Rhimes, and Macklemore added to the mix. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742564298.5694814}
