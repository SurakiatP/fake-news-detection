Ed Rendell, a major swing state Democrat and Hillary Clinton ally, had quite a few commonsense sound bites during an interview with Philadelphia radio host Rich Zeoli, and one of the most notable was his comment about the \u201chidden Trump vote.\u201d \\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a hidden Donald Trump vote,\u201d Rendell told Zeoli . \u201cAll this talk about it being over and now the real contest is the Senate is going to persuade a couple of Hillary Clinton voters and Democratic voters to say \u2018Well, what do I have to stand on line for an hour [to vote] for? \\nThe media has pushed rigged polls and shown their massive bias in favor of Clinton \u2014 even Rendell had to admit that the media is biased: \u201cThe majority of the media\u2019s against Donald Trump and favors Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nRendell discussed the possibility that the Clinton campaign/media\u2019s strategy could backfire: \u201cThere a lot of things that are in motion that are favorable to Donald Trump. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s over then. The odds are that he\u2019s going to lose, but I wouldn\u2019t bet my life on it.\u201d \\nIn a further discussion about Clinton voters staying home, Rendell told Zeoli: \\nIf you\u2019re an African-American voter and you like Hillary \u2014 because you\u2019ve always liked the Clintons \u2014 but, you know, it\u2019s not Barack Obama, and you read that Hillary\u2019s got Pennsylvania locked up \u2014 the [Philadelphia] Inquirer said that the Trump team had conceded Pennsylvania this morning \u2014 you read that and you say she\u2019s going to win anyway. \u2018What do I have to stand on line for an hour?\u2019 If I were the Clinton team, I would be desperately worried about that type of talk. Desperately worried. \\nThe media bias has gotten so bad and so blatant that even a Democrat Clinton ally had to admit it. Rendell\u2019s point about possible voter suppression was a very interesting take; however, there\u2019s another more sinister reason why Clinton\u2019s camp and the media (but I repeat myself) are doing this. \\nThe Democrat National Committee rigged the primary for Clinton. If there is something set in motion to steal the election for Clinton \u2014 and given the amount of evidence we have about voter fraud it\u2019s likely \u2014 it\u2019s imperative for the media to set up the narrative that Clinton is going to win in a landslide. \\nIf the media is able to sell the myth that Clinton has opened a huge lead over Donald Trump, they have a better chance of getting away with stealing an election with minor resistance from the public. \\nWe\u2019ve heard for a while that there is a potential hidden Trump vote of people who won\u2019t say that they\u2019re voting for him because of the massive media bias, but plan to do so in the privacy of the voting booth. \\nHopefully that holds true and the vigorous support for Trump evidenced at his rallies is able to overcome the Democrats\u2019 dirty tricks.'"}, "time": 1742564196.7574606}
