[The attack, carried out in the eastern Jerusalem neighborhood of Armon Hanatziv, also known as Eastern Talpiot, comes less than three weeks after the United Nations Security Council declared eastern Jerusalem to be \u201coccupied Palestinian territory. \u201d  It follows   Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s Mideast policy speech in which he largely blamed Israel for the absence of negotiations (while the Palestinians have refused multiple statehood offers as well as attempts by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to jumpstart talks) and he repeatedly slammed Israeli settlement construction, including in eastern Jerusalem.  Notably, the State Department\u2019s condemnation of today\u2019s attack referred to the location of the terrorist onslaught as \u201cJerusalem\u201d instead of \u201cEast Jerusalem. \u201d Today\u2019s eastern Jerusalem truck terror comes one week before the Palestinians are scheduled to attend a farcical Paris \u201cpeace\u201d conference at which the international community, minus Israel, is slated to get together to set the future parameters of a Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely was right to link today\u2019s carnage to the Paris summit. \u201cThe world has received a clear answer from the Palestinians to the peace conference coming up in Paris: More terror,\u201d Hotovely said. \u201cI again call on the international community to demand an end to terror and the industry of education toward it. \u201d The Palestinians have a long and sordid history of responding to peace talks or international pressure on Israel with a terror campaign targeting Israelis. Arch Terrorist Yasser Arafat personified that tactic when he responded to generous Israeli statehood offers in September 2000 by launching the deadly Second Intifada instead of accepting a Palestinian state or even making a counter offer. Within less than   hours of last month\u2019s   UN resolution, I noticed an immediate uptick in Palestinian terrorist attacks targeting Jews in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, the very areas where Israeli construction was singled out in the UN document. I wrote at the time it was too early to tell whether the violence represented a spike in Palestinian terrorism following the UN vote or whether the incidents were part of the      trend known as the   Palestinian wave of terror that seems to escalate and then slow down. With today\u2019s truck terror, we may be more clearly seeing the Palestinian response to the mounting international pressure on Israel.
