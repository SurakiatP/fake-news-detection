Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, squeezed in among the framed Time magazine covers of Mr. Trump and exuberant   notes written in his inimitable scrawl (\u201cHopie  \u2014   You\u2019re the greatest! \u201d). \u201cFate whispers to the warrior, \u2018You cannot withstand the storm,\u2019\u201d it reads. \u201cAnd the warrior whispers back, \u2018I am the storm. \u2019\u201d Ms. Hicks, a onetime champion lacrosse player who signed a Ford modeling contract as a teenager, had never worked in politics before last year, and her widest exposure had been as a   in a Nickelodeon children\u2019s television special about golf. Now she plays confidante and sometime gatekeeper to the presumptive Republican nominee for president and, improbably, serves as Mr. Trump\u2019s sole liaison to the teeming national press corps. Hillary Clinton employs a     media handlers who field hundreds of daily requests. Mr. Trump has Ms. Hicks, who was working for his daughter Ivanka\u2019s luxury lines and for the Trump real estate brand when the candidate called her to his office in early 2015 and declared that she was joining his campaign. \u201cMr. Trump sat her down and said, \u2018This is your new job,\u2019\u201d said her mother, Caye Cavender Hicks. \u201cIt was a shocker. \u201d Hope Hicks had trained at Hiltzik Strategies, the powerful public relations firm that represents Hollywood clients and corporate executives, before Ms. Trump brought her  . She was commuting from an apartment she shared with her sister in Greenwich, Conn. above the dive bar where her father had his first beer at 18. Suddenly, she found herself a   presence by Mr. Trump\u2019s side, flying in his jet, living   in a   apartment and attending to his mercurial moods. She is arguably the least credentialed press secretary in the modern history of presidential politics. But for journalists who cover the campaign, she is sometimes the Jekyll to Mr. Trump\u2019s Hyde, emailing angry complaints from her   boss (\u201cdishonest\u201d) and often concluding with her own polite  : \u201cBest, Hope. \u201d Seemingly unfazed by her boss\u2019s outbursts, she can detect the best moments for reporters to make requests  \u2014   knowing, for instance, not to bother Mr. Trump while he is watching a major golf tournament. \u201cHer most important role is her bond with the candidate,\u201d said Paul Manafort, the veteran Republican adviser who, as of this past week, had been put in charge of the campaign. \u201cShe totally understands him. \u201d Or, as Ivanka Trump said in an interview: \u201cMy father makes people earn his trust. She\u2019s earned his trust. \u201d And not without some steeliness. Ms. Hicks remained in her role even as Mr. Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager and another early member of his team. Mr. Lewandowski and Ms. Hicks are close friends: He has visited her family in Greenwich for    dinners and, days after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination (and fired a key political aide) they took in a Hall  Oates concert with her parents in the V. I. P. tent at the Greenwich Town Party. But it was ultimately Ms. Hicks who announced Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s departure, describing it as \u201ca parting of ways. \u201d Friends of Ms. Hicks say they are thrilled by her sudden rise, dismissing concerns that her ties to Mr. Trump could damage her nascent career. \u201cShe believes in him, his leadership and abilities, and she\u2019s thrown herself completely into this,\u201d said Michael Feldman, a prominent Democratic strategist and family friend. \u201cI don\u2019t think that ties her personally to everything that\u2019s been said. \u201d But some say they are alarmed that Ms. Hicks is promoting, and defending, a candidate who has been denounced as a demagogue, a racist, a misogynist and even a fascist. In Greenwich, where her family is part of the civic firmament, the topic of her association with Mr. Trump can get touchy. \u201cBelieve me, there are times when I would like to voice my opinion,\u201d said Drew Marzullo, a Greenwich town selectman and Democrat who is close with Ms. Hicks\u2019s sister, Mary Grace. He recalled doing a double take after spotting Mr. Lewandowski and other Trump aides with the family at the Hall  Oates concert. Still, he added, \u201cIt would be unfair for someone to judge Hope or the family based on her job. \u201d In fact, Ms. Hicks is the third generation of her family to represent a powerful but highly controversial client. Her grandfather led public relations for Texaco during the 1970s oil crisis. Her father, Paul B. Hicks III, represented a major tobacco company in Connecticut and later was the top communications executive for the National Football League, where he dealt with scandals over player safety and the Patriots\u2019 deflated footballs. Her establishment pedigree aside, Ms. Hicks does not fit the part of the typical campaign press secretary, spinning reporters and gossiping over expensed drinks on the trail. Among journalists, Ms. Hicks is not known to wrangle, cajole or mingle, serving as more of a conduit for her intensely   boss, who likes to act as his own chief spokesman. Unlike her Clinton counterparts, who take pains to shape their candidate\u2019s image, Ms. Hicks is not active on Twitter and does not show up on cable talk shows. Contacted for this article, she declined to be interviewed, insisting that she did not want to draw attention away from her candidate. Reporters praise Ms. Hicks for her poise amid a chaotic campaign. But some say that she can be unresponsive to questions, a habit so pervasive that it spawned a mocking, anonymous Twitter account, @HicksNoComment. On the trail, political reporters say Ms. Hicks rarely interacts with them at rallies, preferring to communicate by text or telephone. Ms. Hicks  \u2014   perhaps the only campaign press secretary to have been photographed as a teenager by the fashion photographer Bruce Weber, in a campaign for Naturalizer shoes  \u2014   favors Burberry trench coats and heels, a break from the scruffy ranks of harried campaign operatives. One reporter recalled staggering into a New Hampshire rally after a snowstorm, soaked in water and ice, only to find Ms. Hicks dressed impeccably, her makeup unmussed. Still, the stresses of the campaign have occasionally spilled into public view: Despite their friendship, Ms. Hicks and Mr. Lewandowski were spotted in a screaming match on a Manhattan sidewalk, which later turned up in The New York Post, fueling reports of internal tensions. Mostly, however, Ms. Hicks is a friendly, if disciplined, presence  \u2014   Southern charm by way of Fairfield County. (Upon accompanying Mr. Trump to Scotland this past week, she told a reporter wryly, \u201cI don\u2019t do well in plaid. \u201d) And she is unfailingly deferential to her employer, whom she refers to only as \u201cMr. Trump\u201d or \u201csir. \u201d He seems to appreciate it. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have her,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Thursday. \u201cShe\u2019s got very good judgment. She will often give advice, and she\u2019ll do it in a very   manner, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily come in the form of advice. But it\u2019s delivered very nicely. \u201d Did he have qualms about hiring a campaign spokeswoman with no political background? \u201cWell, I have a lot of political experience, so I wasn\u2019t really concerned about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd if it didn\u2019t work out, I would be able to make a fast change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has worked out. \u201d Mr. Trump sent flowers to Ms. Hicks\u2019s family when her grandmother died earlier this year. Her parents also visited    Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort, where he greeted them and teased Mr. Hicks about the N. F. L. \u201cHe could not have been nicer,\u201d Caye Hicks said. Ms. Hicks\u2019s success has not surprised her family (\u201cHope\u2019s a fighter,\u201d as her father said) even as they harbor some concern about the intensity of her work. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really talk to anybody anymore, she has no life,\u201d Caye Hicks said. Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, where violent protests sometimes break out, can also be disconcerting. \u201cI have to hope the Secret Service is keeping them all safe,\u201d Caye Hicks said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy atmosphere. \u201d She added: \u201cI can\u2019t actually let her know how worried I am. \u201d On free nights, Ms. Hicks retreats to her parents\u2019 home in Greenwich  \u2014   her mother sometimes hears a creaking door at 2 a. m.  \u2014   to unwind. Her sister, Mary Grace, is a paramedic there, and her father, a former town selectman, remains a prominent figure: This spring, Greenwich proclaimed April 23 as Paul B. Hicks III Day to recognize his philanthropy. Ms. Hicks grew up in Greenwich swimming and golfing. When she was in sixth grade, a neighbor invited Ms. Hicks and her sister to a Ralph Lauren tryout soon their photographs were in Bloomingdale\u2019s. She made a cameo on \u201cGuiding Light,\u201d appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks like \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and once read lines for a film role with Alec Baldwin. At age 13, Ms. Hicks told Greenwich Magazine, for a cover story about the Hicks sisters\u2019 modeling careers, that she was \u201cnot ready to decide if modeling is what I want to do with my life. \u201d \u201cIf the acting thing doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d she said, \u201cI could really see myself in politics. Who knows?\u201d The Hicks sisters earned enough from modeling to file tax returns. But Hope preferred lacrosse, leading Greenwich High School to a state championship and later playing at Southern Methodist University, where she majored in English. After graduation, she and her father bumped into Mr. Baldwin at the Super Bowl. The meeting led to an interview and job offer from Matthew Hiltzik, whose clients include Mr. Baldwin and, fatefully, Ivanka Trump, who was impressed by Ms. Hicks and eventually hired her away. Aside from Mr. Trump\u2019s children, Ms. Hicks is now the   aide on his presidential bid. Mr. Feldman, the family friend, said he doubted that anyone anticipated it would last this long. \u201cYou do the best you can under very unusual circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, circumstances that are more unusual than most. \u201d The campaign is looking to hire a communications director. But as the general election looms, Ms. Hicks, who has recently been featured in Marie Claire and GQ, remains loyal, apparently unperturbed by the controversies swirling around her candidate and prepared to stick it out. Mr. Trump, asked if Ms. Hicks would have a spot in his administration, replied, \u201cShe would definitely have a role. \u201d How about press secretary? \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early. I don\u2019t want to be making those prognostications yet. But she\u2019ll certainly be involved with us. She\u2019s terrific. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561852.0921085}
