[Describing Obama\u2019s final address to the nation as a \u201ctepid farewell\u201d Kassam slammed his \u201chour long,   snooze fest\u201d:  \u201cUnlike Reagan at 20 mins, Carter at 18 minutes, Clinton at 10 minutes, or Eisenhower at 15 minutes, President Obama decided to genuflect towards himself for almost an hour last night, weeping into his hanky while lauding other people\u2019s achievements: the Navy Seal\u2019s killing of Bin Laden, the worst economic recovery in seven decades, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on   marriage. \u201cThe    is a man desperate to end his presidency by being able to use the phrase \u2018Yes we did\u2019  \u2026     More accurately, however, would have been his own phrase that he once levelled at the hard working people of this country: \u2018You didn\u2019t build that. \u2019\u201d Campaigning his \u201clegacy of mediocrity\u201d in Chicago, Illinois, Obama was quoted as saying, \u201cI\u2019ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago\u201d. Kassam hit back at the claim, pointing to the racial tensions happening concurrently to the outgoing president\u2019s final days where \u201ca U. S. Attorney General [was] being heckled during a confirmation process by Black Lives Matter activists, and while an infantile spat takes place in Congress over a painting depicting police officers as pigs\u201d. The Breitbart London EIC then tore into Obama for invoking the Constitution as an outdated document, the president saying, \u201cOur constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But it\u2019s really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power  \u2014   with our participation, and the choices we make. \u201d \u201cThe sneaky little message shone through,\u201d said Kassam, \u201cat least for me, is that the Consitution is \u2018just a piece of parchment\u2019. \u201d \u201dOur Constitution is just a piece of parchment\u201d says Obama, finally admitting his disdain for it #ObamaFarewell,  \u2014   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) January 11, 2017,  \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly intentional. A piece of parchment. Not a piece of paper. Not a set of ideals. Not a guiding light that we should all act as defenders and protectors of. No. A piece of parchment. Something old  \u2014   maybe even outdated? \u201cJust like in December when he called the electoral college a \u2018vestige\u2019 of an earlier America, his aim here was clear to me. \u201cA remarkable, beautiful gift  \u2014   sure. But the conscious effort to highlight the age of the document in a speech that urged people to keep pushing for a radical overhaul of the makeup of this country was nothing short of almost brilliant rhetorical deception. \u201d Rather than closing his speech with best wishes or God\u2019s blessings to his successor, Kassam remarked that \u201cObama did no such thing. Instead, he heaped praise on his staff, his wife and his Vice President and utterly predictably harkened back to the era of slavery and abolition. A subtle but sharp dig at the country he served so poorly. \u201d Kassam ended by saying that he, too, almost felt like crying  \u2014   \u201cI didn\u2019t  \u2014   because I\u2019m a proper bloke\u201d  \u2014   emanating from a twinge of joy over the end of the Obama administration. \u201cI almost shed a tear for him too, as a human being, having occupied the most powerful position in the entire world at a time where the field was most fertile for his radical agenda and standing up there knowing full well that on day one his successor would undo almost every  \u2026     let\u2019s use a word he likes so much vestige of his presidency. \u201d  Listen in full to Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily below  \u2026      '"}, "time": 1742628543.7425065}
