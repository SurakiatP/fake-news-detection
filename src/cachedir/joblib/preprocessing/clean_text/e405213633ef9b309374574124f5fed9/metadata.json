He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton\u2019s disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there\u2019s no telling where the information could have gone.\\nThe \u201cPutin did it\u201d story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton\u2019s war-driven agenda.\\n\\nOn a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.\\nBinney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. \u201cSo, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,\u201d he said.\\nHe finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious.
