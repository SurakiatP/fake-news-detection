It didn\u2019t make me want to run away. \u201d Ford, a longtime Democrat who hosted a fundraiser for Obama, says Trump\u2019s message resonated with a \u201cbig part of the country\u201d that has felt ignored. \u201cI think when you sense that there is a divide in your country and that there are people who perhaps you\u2019re not relating to, and that those of us who are fortunate enough to live in a world of very liberal human rights and privilege, it\u2019s a   call that we\u2019re not addressing a big part of the country that does feel disenfranchised,\u201d Ford said. Echoing the sentiments behind Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d political agenda, Ford says the billionaire\u2019s victory made him \u201cfeel more nationalistic. \u201d \u201cIt made me feel more nationalistic if anything. The whole country is not like New York and L. A. and the world that I am used to living in. \u201d WWD reports Fords is planning to move from London to a   $39 million home in Los Angeles. Ford was among the   designers, including and Marc Jacobs, who publicly declined to design clothing for Mrs. Trump. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563570.2397308}
