I think that the tax increases are gone right away. The Obamacare tax increases are now gone right away in this bill.   adults in the Medicaid expansion population, there\u2019s now a work requirement for them. And this waiver option that states can seek to get out from under those key Obamacare regulations that are driving up premiums for   families, I think when you look at those, this is the best bill we can get out of the House. But frankly, we should be clear, this is not repeal of Obamacare. If it was repeal, you wouldn\u2019t need the option for a waiver option for states to seek. So, we have to be clear with the voters about that, and continue to work on it. \u201d Jordan later said that the bill isn\u2019t a complete repeal of Obamacare, but is a \u201cgood step, and it\u2019s \u2014  I think \u2014  the best step. \u201d He added that \u201cStates can get out of some of the regulations that are driving up premium costs.   conditions \u2014  as the president mentioned \u2014  is specifically covered in the legislation. And there\u2019s $125 billion of taxpayer money that goes to the states to make sure there\u2019s that safety net provision that we call   pools available for states to use. They have to have that set up first before they can actually seek the waiver. \u201d Jordan further stated, \u201cIf you maintain continuous coverage, you can\u2019t lose coverage and coverage can\u2019t be jumped up to a higher rate if you have some tough illness happen to you or your family. That is clear. What we\u2019re trying to do, is reward responsible behavior. You maintain coverage, that\u2019s the right thing to do. You don\u2019t get bumped up because something serious happens to you or your family. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564379.3881326}
