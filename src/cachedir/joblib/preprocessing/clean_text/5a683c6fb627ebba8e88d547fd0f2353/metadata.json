Yet despite her achievements, Harrison is the country\u2019s   famous judoka. No. 1 is her former roommate Ronda Rousey, who won a bronze medal in 2008 and went on to fame, fortune and magazine covers as the   fighter in mixed martial arts. Now Harrison, 26, plans to follow her into the cage, in the World Series of Fighting organization. \u201cIf you had peeked through our apartment window in 2007 and said, \u2018One of you is going to win two Olympic gold medals, and one is going to become a sports icon,\u2019 we both would have said: \u2018What are you talking about? We\u2019re eating ramen noodles and barely getting by,\u2019\u201d Harrison said. \u201cFour years ago, if I wanted to be an M. M. A. athlete, it\u2019s not something a female could really make a lot of money doing. \u201d Harrison said. Referring to Rousey, she added: \u201cShe trailblazed a way for girls like me who want to make some money. I\u2019m hoping to stand on top of her shoulders and continue to have judo girls kill it in the cage. \u201d It will be quite a change for Harrison. The   world of Olympic sports like judo is vastly different from the colorful, crazy scene of mixed martial arts. When asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts after winning her second gold medal, in August, Harrison said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m cut out for a world where you get fights by how pretty you are and how you talk. \u201d She stands by that remark, but said: \u201cThe World Series of Fighting is looking to bring some legitimacy to the sport, and have real athletes who are treated like real athletes, not W. W. E. superstars. I hope to see it go more toward the professional route versus the entertainment route, but I\u2019m not in charge. \u201d The man who is, Carlos Silva, the chief executive, said: \u201cI want people to perceive it as a sport, not just a show. A big part of that is adding sporting people like Kayla. \u201d Harrison competed in judo at 172 pounds but expects to fight at 145 pounds. (Such discrepancies are not unusual Rousey competed in judo at 154 but fights in the Ultimate Fighting Championship at its highest weight class, 135.) Women at 145 pounds have been somewhat overlooked in mixed martial arts in favor of smaller fighters. The World Series of Fighting expects to add athletes to build up the division with its new star in mind. The biggest name in the heavier division is Cristiane Justino, known universally as Cyborg. Currently signed with the U. F. C. she is a fearsome competitor with a   record and a brutal knockout punch. A match between her and Rousey, if it could be arranged, would undoubtedly be one of the biggest in mixed martial arts history. The bigger Harrison, though, might be a more natural matchup for Cyborg down the road. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go out in my first fight and fight Cyborg,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat would be crazy. \u201d But she admitted: \u201cI had a dream the other night that I was fighting Cyborg and I got her in an armbar and I broke her arm. But she wouldn\u2019t tap, so I choked her unconscious. \u201d In Rio, when Harrison was asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts, her longtime coach, Jimmy Pedro, sitting next to her, was seen shaking his head. \u201cThat pretty much sums up how he and his father feel about it,\u201d Harrison said of Pedro and his father, known as Big Jim. \u201cThey just feel like I\u2019ve accomplished everything an athlete could ever dream of, having such an amazing career in judo. And I think personally they don\u2019t want to see me put that all on the line and see me get hurt. \u201d Still, Harrison will continue to work with the Pedros, as well as adding training in disciplines like boxing and wrestling. She said her serious training will begin in January. Harrison has no timetable for her first fight. She will start her mixed martial arts experience as a commentator for the World Series of Fighting\u2019s card at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 31. The event will feature three championship bouts, including lightweight champ Justin Gaethje against Jo\u00e3o Zeferino. For a judoka transitioning into mixed martial arts, the biggest issue is striking, which is not allowed in judo. \u201cI feel I have a great base, because judo is takedowns and finishes, armbars, chokes,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing judo, you\u2019re gripping, your hands are moving, so I already have that spatial awareness for striking, which I think gives me an advantage learning a new sport. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing the same thing for 20 years. Everything I do in judo I learned in the first six months with the Pedros. Now I\u2019m learning new things. I\u2019m learning heel hooks and knee bars and a jab and a hook, uppercuts. It\u2019s invigorating. \u201d Still, Harrison is aware that the differences are there, and that they are real. Soon, for the first time, she will be hitting people in the face, and being hit in the face in return. \u201cJudo is controlled violence,\u201d she said. \u201cJudo in Japanese means \u2018the gentle way.\u2019 It\u2019s about disarming your opponent or defending yourself, but never killing them. But M. M. A. is   gladiating. So, yeah, I\u2019m scared. Absolutely. I would be foolish not to be. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561773.4869037}
