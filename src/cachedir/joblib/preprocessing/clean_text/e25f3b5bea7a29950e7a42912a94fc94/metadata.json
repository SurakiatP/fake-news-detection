Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. \\nMoreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people\u2019s money \u2014 in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City. \\nThe reason that Trump bent over backward \u2013 and potentially broke laws \u2013 to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to \u201cstave off financial ruin.\u201d \\nThis is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his \u201csuccessful\u201d business background. \\nYet, he calls himself the \u201cking of debt.\u201d His businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. He has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. He lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. Reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to Russia. \\nAll of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. \\nEven as all of this information is out there, American voters still know very little about Donald Trump\u2019s finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. \\nAnd consider this: What Trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. If it weren\u2019t, he would have already released them. \\nThe latest New York Times story is just the latest installment of Trump\u2019s shady business background. The media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the country\u2019s pocketbook.'"}, "time": 1742628495.3569398}
