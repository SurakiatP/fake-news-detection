[We\u2019ve seen this tragic routine before: a radical Islamist wages violent Jihad against the Western world and, after a few days of clich\u00e9 sloganeering and useless hashtags, all is forgotten.  Well, for the parents and loved ones of those who were killed, all is not forgotten. They will live forever with a hole in their hearts that can never be filled. These are the consequences of open borders, and the willingness of a society to bury its head in the sand while attempting to shame and silence anyone who dares speak the truth. The truth is this: when you flood your country with millions of   migrants from the Islamic world, you shouldn\u2019t be \u201cshocked\u201d when your society acquires the same problems as the Islamic world. One plus one equals two. We can have borders, or we can have terror. No, there is no third option. This is the real world, not a sociology lecture, or CNN. You cannot force Islamists to assimilate because Islamists do not value the same things we do in the West. While most in the West view an Ariana Grande concert as an opportunity for young girls to have a fun night of singing and dancing with their friends, many in the Islamic world views it as a shameful display of dirty infidels, who deserve death for their indulgence. Manchester bomber Salman Abedi\u2019s parents were Libyan \u201crefugees. \u201d He was given refuge and even tax dollars of the very parents whose daughters he killed. Jihadists are not impressed by Katy Perry\u2019s almost instantaneous call for \u201cno borders\u201d and \u201c \u201d in response to the Manchester massacre. They are emboldened by it. She, and every other pompously ignorant celebrity like her, are worse than useless. They are useful for our enemies. This pacifistic, \u201clet\u2019s all hold hands\u201d reaction to the death of innocent children perfectly encapsulates why the West remains a giant sitting duck for radical Islamists. Imagine the disbelief our enemies must be feeling about how easy it is to wage war on a society that seeks to fight them with tolerance. Even after one of their caliphate soldiers bombs a teenage pop concert, one of the most popular singers on the planet welcomes more Islamists to our shores with open arms. But we shouldn\u2019t make Katy Perry feel like the lone wolf in her suicidal delusions. After all, we\u2019re only 6 months removed from a kumbaya President that fought ISIS with a live serenade of \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d by James Taylor. While I, like most Americans, fear another deadly Islamic terror attack, the mainstream media\u2019s biggest concern is  \u2014   that\u2019s right, you guessed it  \u2014   \u201cIslamophobia. \u201d Martha Raddatz, who gained notoriety for her appallingly biased Presidential debate moderation, lamented to George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, \u201cThis is likely to fuel   backlash across Britain, across Europe. \u201d Don\u2019t worry Martha, chances are there will still be plenty of niqabs worn in Manchester long after the carnage of young children is removed from the concert venue, and we have open border propagandists to thank for that. Unfortunately, for those who actually want to protect ourselves and our children from Jihadists, nitwitted celebrities and media pundits aren\u2019t the only problem.   groups like the SPLC and ACLU have volunteered themselves to be useful idiots for radical Islamic outfits like CAIR, a notorious Muslim Brotherhood front group that has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a   operation. Their strategy? To smear, intimidate, bully, and ultimately silence anyone who gets in the way of their   agenda. They are counting on patriotic Americans to stay silent and seated, while their   agenda marches on. Are we really going to let these open borders fanatics do to America what they\u2019ve done to Europe? Are we really going to allow terrorist attacks to become the norm in America, as they are the in the Islamic world and, increasingly, Europe? Let the goons at the SPLC and the mainstream media call me what they want, I know what I am. I am an American who loves her country, and doesn\u2019t want to see it diminished to the same rubble I laid under when Islamists blew up my home as a little girl. For those who want to do more than just tweet their outrage, who want to make their country, community, and family a safer place to call home, I invite you to join me, and every other   patriot at ACT for America\u2019s National Conference this coming October in Arlington, Virginia.
