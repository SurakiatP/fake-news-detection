Spicer likened her comments to the New England Patriots\u2019 comeback victory after being down   late in Super Bowl LI. \u201cWell look, I\u2019m a Patriots fan and I think if games ended in the third quarter, there would have been a different team here last week,\u201d Spicer answered. \u201cBut you play a game four quarters and you play an election until election day, so with all due respect to her, that\u2019s not how it works. You don\u2019t get to pick the day the election is on. \u201d He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s somewhat sad that we\u2019re still debating why the president won in the fashion that he did. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563757.6145651}
