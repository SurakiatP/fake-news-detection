{"duration": 1.4113926887512207, "input_args": {"text": "'Pop songs in the modern era are the products of collaboration  \u2014   singers, writers, producers, engineers and many more all have a part to play. That arrangement engenders a perennial   anxiety: Is it the songs that have fans, or the singer? And can the singer go it alone detached from the ecosystem that laid the foundation for her success? Kesha tested these questions in real time on Thursday night, when she played a show at Warsaw, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as part of her first proper tour in three years. That time has been tumultuous: In lawsuits seeking release from her contracts, she accused the producer Dr. Luke, her longtime collaborator and the chief of the label imprint to which she is signed, of sexual improprieties, including rape. He countersued, asserting defamation and breach of contract. As a result, she has released no original music since 2013 and has only recently begun performing her old songs live. But old songs are old memories, and as was clear at this show, Kesha was hoping to perform them in the most distanced manner possible, by completely reworking the arrangements from   pop to, well, unfriendly rock. Throughout the night, she dismantled her old hits  \u2014   \u201cWe R Who We R,\u201d \u201cTake It Off,\u201d \u201cYour Love Is My Drug\u201d  \u2014   and rebuilt them, backed by her band (the Creepies) as blowzy   with light touches of psychedelia. Kesha was dressed in rockabilly chic  \u2014   a   outfit, including a   jacket with rainbow fringe dangling from the sleeves  \u2014   and the title of the tour, which includes an expletive, was spelled out in huge   letters at the back of the stage. She sprinkled   theatrics throughout the show, fighting off a pair of comrades in dinosaur masks during \u201cDinosaur\u201d and attacking one on the floor of the stage during \u201cCannibal,\u201d coming up for air with blood dripping from her mouth. The effect was carnivalesque, a presentation indebted to the Dr. Demento era of stylistic novelty and excessive quirk. Though it was awkward and rarely effective, Kesha\u2019s taste for the outr\u00e9 wasn\u2019t unexpected. For a time in the early part of the decade, she promised to be a different sort of pop star  \u2014   stylistically limber,   as comfortable rapping as singing, seemingly uninterested in the seamlessness megapop typically promises. Back then, it was never clear just how seriously Kesha took herself, or her music, an attitude that played well against the indestructibility of her records. Both of her albums  \u2014   \u201cAnimal,\u201d from 2010,\u201d and \u201cWarrior,\u201d from 2012  \u2014   were excellent. But those songs, while still the currency that gained her entry into the pop stratosphere, have become albatrosses. Her performances of them here felt like rejections. When Kesha delivered her breakout hit \u201cTik Tok\u201d at the end of her main set using essentially its original arrangement, it was like a sunbeam breaking through clouds. It was also a needling reminder of what made her songs so effective in the first place  \u2014   the interplay of Kesha\u2019s salacious abandon and the ecstatic drive of the production, by Dr. Luke and others. In recent months, Kesha\u2019s battles have made her a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre countless other performers have offered their public support, and Taylor Swift said she would give her $250, 000 (\u201cto help with any of her financial needs during this trying time,\u201d a representative for Ms. Swift said in a statement). After \u201cDinosaur,\u201d Kesha addressed the eager crowd of about 1, 000. \u201cIt\u2019s been way, way, way too long,\u201d she said, meeting a roar of nourishing cheers. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if I would have made it the past three years without you guys. \u201d The audience replied with encouraging chants. When they screamed \u201cFree Kesha\u201d over and again, she went to the side of the stage and retrieved a phone, so that she could film the moment. Though most of her claims against Dr. Luke have been  rejected by a judge, her legal situation remains complicated. She played no new music here. In addition to the   hits of her own, she filled out her set with covers, a necessary strategy but also a problematic one. Performing someone else\u2019s music lays you bare and reveals what you can add to a conversation that\u2019s long been settled. There was a lumpy cover of Iggy Pop\u2019s \u201cNightclubbing\u201d and a disjointed take on Britney Spears\u2019s \u201cTill The World Ends\u201d (a song written in part by Kesha). During her unwelcome encore, she gnawed at the chorus of Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d for a few melancholy minutes, then sang \u201cOld Flames Can\u2019t Hold a Candle to You,\u201d a country standard written in part by her mother, closing out the tepid rendition by asserting, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of hearing people say I can\u2019t sing, so there!\u201d She was better when using songs to make statements: Lesley Gore\u2019s defiant \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me,\u201d or Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cI Shall Be Released,\u201d which closed the show. \u201cAlways have hope in your heart,\u201d Kesha told the crowd, before shouting her way through the song, using it as a diary and a cudgel.'"}, "time": 1742564020.2996888}
