Another record. The high temperatures we saw in 2015 are set to be beaten in 2016,\" WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said in a statement.\\n#StateofClimate : 2016 set to be hottest year on record.

Other Arctic and sub-Arctic regions in Russia, Alaska and northwest Canada were at least 3 C above average.\\n\"We are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree, and so this is different,\" said Taalas.\\nThe WMO report was published as UN climate talks entered their second week in Marrakesh \\x96 the first since last year\\'s huddle in the French capital concluded with the climate-rescue Paris Agreement.\\nThe Moroccan followup is meant to agree on rules for executing the plans and goals outlined in the pact, which envisions reining in global warming by cutting back on greenhouse-gas emitting coal, oil and gas for energy.\\nHigh impact events\\nEarlier Monday, the annual Global Carbon Budget report said carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels have been nearly flat for three years in a row \\x96 a \"great help\" but not enough to stave off dangerous climate change.\\nBoth analyses warned that concentrations of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continued to rise, reaching 400 parts per million in 2015 and likely to exceed that record in 2016.\\nGlobal temperatures for January to September this year were about 1.2 C over pre-industrial levels, and 0.88 C over the average for 1961-1990, said the WMO.\\n\"More than 90 percent of northern hemisphere land areas outside the tropics were at least 1 C above average.\"\\nTemperatures were also above normal over most ocean areas, contributing to coral bleaching and disrupted marine ecosystems in tropical waters, the report said.\\nArctic sea ice extent was \"well below normal\" throughout the year.\\n\"Because of climate change, the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen,\" the WMO said. Heatwaves and flooding that once occurred once in a generation, are now much more regular.\\nIt pointed to several \"high impact\" events this year, including Hurricane Matthew which ravaged Haiti in October, flooding in China, several heatwaves, the most damaging wildfire in Canadian history and major droughts.\\nFood shortages, population migration and conflict are expected to increase as a result of more frequent and potentially more intense weather-related disasters, the report warned.\\n(AFP)'"}, "time": 1742561929.2919028}
