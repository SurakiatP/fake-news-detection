This declares that refugees are entitled to claim asylum regardless of their method of reaching a country, if they say they have been persecuted in their country of origin. The government\u2019s plan would prevent migrants from visiting Australia many years later, while on business or as tourists, even if they have successfully settled in a third country and gained citizenship there. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most draconian legislation the world has ever seen, it\u2019s unprecedented in global terms, and it means that Australia puts itself, yet again, in the basket of pariah states when it comes to those sorts of issues ,\u201d Barns said. \\nTurnbull\u2019s Liberal Party will require the support of opposition parties to pass the legislation. While Bill Shorten, leader of Australia\u2019s opposition Labor Party, said the proposal \u201cseems ridiculous,\u201d his party stopped short of rejecting it and instead promised to examine the plan closely. \\n\u201cUnfortunately the opposition Labor Party in Australia has been very weak on these issues in recent years, and both the major political parties, the conservatives (Australia\u2019s Liberal Party) and the Labor Party, have been able to force these sorts of changes on Australian policy,\u201d Barns told Sputnik. \\n\u201cThere have been suggestions today that the Labor Party might finally get some backbone and oppose this legislation, because if the Labor Party, which is the major opposition party, supports this legislation, then it will become a reality.\u201d \\nThe government\u2019s claim that their proposal is compliant with international law is \u201claughable,\u201d and \u201cshows yet again that Australia snubs its nose at international law when it suits it,\u201d Barns said. \\nBarns said that Australia\u2019s immigration policy has become harsher as a result of public fears of migration, and the actions of successive government which have played on these fears. \\n\u201cSome Australians have a xenophobic, racist view about the rest of the world, they have this ridiculous fear about hordes coming to this island continent and invading it, that\u2019s been historic.\u201d \\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have strong political leadership which says that we can do better, this will become politically popular,\u201d said Barns, who contrasted the current policy with that of Malcom Fraser\u2019s 1970\u2019s Liberal government, which accepted large numbers of refugees who came on boats from Vietnam. \\nSince the government of John Howard from 1996 to 2007, \u201csuccessive governments in Australia have pandered to the xenophobic, racist side of the country, and that\u2019s precisely what Malcolm Turnbull is doing with this legislation.\u201d \\n\u201cAustralia is a nation built on migration, and in fact some of the leading figures in Australian society came here by boat. Those very same people now would be banned under this law.\u201d \\nTurnbull\u2019s proposal has won the praise of Australia\u2019s right-wing populist One Nation party, led by Pauline Hanson, who won re-election to Australia\u2019s House of Representatives this year. Good to see that it looks like the Government is now taking its cues from One Nation. Just like last time. #auspol #PHON #Nauru #Manus https://t.co/c0GQew7vR8 \\n\u2014 Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) 30 October 2016 \\nBarns said that Turnbull\u2019s proposal is an effort to attract votes from Hanson\u2019s One Nation to the conservative Liberal Party. \\n\u201cMalcolm Turnbull\u2019s party wants to try and take over some of its vote, and it seems to be that this is the way to do it. To pass outrageous, draconian laws that trash Australia\u2019s reputation even further in world eyes when it comes to refugees, simply for short-term political gain.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562284.191405}
