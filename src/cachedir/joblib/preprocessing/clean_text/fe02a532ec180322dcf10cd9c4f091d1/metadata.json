Specifically, the pay-to-play scheme that was being run through the Foundation while Hillary was head of the State Department. \\nSenator Tom Cotton from Arkansas joined Fox & Friends this morning and he didn\u2019t hold back. He absolutely unloaded both barrels. \\nHere\u2019s the quote followed by video: \\nThe more we learn about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s operations, whether it\u2019s from the book Clinton Cash, or Bret Baier\u2019s reporting or The Wall Street Journal\u2018s reporting, the more it becomes clearer that the Clinton Foundation may be the world\u2019s largest money laundering and influence-peddling operation. In fact, with two investigations swirling around Hillary Clinton both the email investigation and the Clinton Foundation investigation, I think it may become clear that those are really the same controversy. One reason why Hillary Clinton probably went and set up a private email server was so she could advance her pay-for-play agenda at the State Department with Clinton Foundation donors giving perks and benefits to dictators and shady oligarchs all around the world. . @SenTomCotton : The Clinton Foundation may be the world's largest money laundering and influence-peddling operation pic.twitter.com/wP8COKjFQN \\n\u2014 FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) November 3, 2016 Previous Story LibertyNEWS Daily Electoral Projection Tracking Map Now ... 0\""}, "time": 1742628430.3526137}
