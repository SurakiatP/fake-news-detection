The only conditions are that they have to be unemployed marketing graduates and are not funneling over a thousand tonnes a day of cement powder and cows\u2019 vaginas into a mixer and hoping for the best. \\n\u2018Artisan is a coffee-focused, fun-loving space that flirts with pushing design boundaries,\u2019 said Jason McKillop, owner of the Artisan Caf\u00e9 in Stamford Brook. \u2018Our Baristas treat each cup like a fine chef does a meal, taking pride and time to ensure each coffee is flawless. We continuously adjust the grind to allow for changes in the atmosphere \u2013 yeah, yeah, all right, it\u2019s a caf\u00e9 but we need a reason to charge \u00a34 for a cup of coffee, don\u2019t we?\u2019 \\nThe trend has been welcomed by easily impressed simpletons with unaccountably well-paid jobs. \u2018I like to know that \u201cFire is at the literal heart of Artisan; handmade, rustic dishes served straight from the flames\u201d,\u2019 said Manchester-based bell end Thomas Lee-Enderby of his favourite new restaurant. \u2018That means they are preparing and cooking the food, right? I also like the bar which \u201cserves handcrafted cocktails alongside cherry picked beers, wines and spirits\u201d because I can\u2019t stand cocktails made by robots.\u2019 \\nMeanwhile, after learning that a nearby artisan chocolatier \u2018metamorphoses the finest cocoa in a myriad of chocolate shapes and flavours to surprise and satisfy all cravings and occasions\u2019, while an artisan supplier of flush-mount wedding albums has made them \u2018insanely affordable for everyone and every day\u2019, Keith Rogers from Leamington Spa has copied and pasted from some websites and declared himself to be Britain\u2019s first artisan supplier of spare parts and accessories for photocopiers. \\n\u2018I use parts sourced from lovingly crafted polypropylene of an unmatched quality adhering to a real artisan standard,\u2019 Rogers said. \u2018By selecting only the finest toners, dyed to a rich black hue using locally sourced carbon black from South Wales, I am delivering a copier more complex in taste and variety for a more satisfying customer experience. Will that do? Now you can resume photocopying your own arses on it.\u2019 Oxbridge (HT Spartacus)'"}, "time": 1742628489.0488753}
