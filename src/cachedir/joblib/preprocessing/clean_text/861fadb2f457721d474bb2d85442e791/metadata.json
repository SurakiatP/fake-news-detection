It is also the unofficial theme of the week in Stockholm, where Mr. Dylan, who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, is not here to accept it. He has not been here for anything else, either. He did not attend the traditional news conference. He did not deliver the traditional lecture. He did not make the traditional visit to a local school, or take part in the traditional fancy dinner with the Swedish Academy, which awards the literature Nobel every year. (All those events were canceled.) And as he said before, he will not be at the ceremony on Saturday, when the literature prize is to be awarded along with the medicine, economics and science prizes, or at the banquet afterward. Though Mr. Dylan has sent a message of thanks to be read aloud, he has not dispatched someone to accept the award on his behalf, as other   have done. \u201cFrom a P. R. viewpoint, it\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d said Jens Liljestrand, the book editor at the Swedish newspaper Expressen. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very unfortunate autumn for the Swedish Academy. \u201d Mr. Dylan\u2019s absence seems of a piece with his legendarily perverse unpredictability. But it has also saddled the highly secretive academy, which is nearly as inscrutable as Mr. Dylan, with the difficult task of explaining to the world why it does not feel insulted. As the debate rages in Sweden  \u2014   is Mr. Dylan\u2019s behavior simple rudeness? a fear of being thrust into the Nobel spotlight? some sort of elaborate piece of performance art?  \u2014   the academy has taken the position, at least publicly, that none of it matters. \u201cI completely respect his decision, and I assume that he has very good reasons for not coming,\u201d Sara Danius, the academy\u2019s permanent secretary, said in an interview. \u201cHe may be completely booked, or he may have personal reasons. \u201d But in a Nobelcentric place where the literature prize is such big news that people gather around their television sets every October to hear the announcement, Mr. Dylan\u2019s absence has been seen as faintly embarrassing at best. \u201cHaving a Nobel Prize without a Nobel Prize winner is not much fun,\u201d said the writer and former publisher Per Gedin. Some Swedes have spoken wistfully about what he is missing. \u201cIt\u2019s a really warm and welcoming program arranged to make the winner happy,\u201d said the publisher Dorotea Bromberg, who recalled shepherding J. M. Coetzee, the South African writer, around Stockholm when he won the literature prize in 2003. Initially, Mr. Coetzee was reluctant, she said, but \u201cday by day he warmed up\u201d and actually ended up enjoying himself. Mr. Dylan is not the only winner in recent years who has failed to appear. Others include Alice Munro, Doris Lessing, Harold Pinter and Elfriede Jelinek, but their reasons had to do with illness, old age and, in the case of Ms. Jelinek, various prohibitive phobias (crowds, flying). In each case, the winner either delivered a lecture that was filmed and transmitted to Stockholm or had the lecture read aloud. Mr. Dylan\u2019s absence, however, does seem consistent with his general approach. \u201cHe\u2019s behaved so strangely for so many years that if he would show up now and be cheerful and pleased, you\u2019d be surprised,\u201d said Daniel Sandstrom, the literary director at the publisher Albert Bonniers. Also, he said, Mr. Dylan\u2019s politeness (or not) should have no bearing on whether he deserves to win the prize. \u201cIt would be very bad to award it just to nice people,\u201d he said. Worse, in the view of some, is that Mr. Dylan\u2019s win may disqualify other Americans, like Don DeLillo and Philip Roth, from winning, at least in the near future. Mr. Dylan is the first American laureate to win since Toni Morrison did so in 1993. \u201cIt\u2019s very unkind, to put it mildly, to give it to an American but to give it to the wrong American,\u201d said Mr. Gedin, who believes the prize should have gone to a more traditional writer. The academy is accustomed to unconventional behavior from Nobel laureates, who do not always exhibit unalloyed joy when they get the notifying telephone call. Some are scared some seem almost irritated some instruct their spouses to say they cannot come to the phone some affect an air of insouciant indifference. With the Belarussian journalist Svetlana Alexievich, who won last year, there was a language issue. \u201cI tried French I tried German,\u201d Ms. Danius said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand what I was saying, although she did understand \u2018Nobel\u2019 and \u2018prize. \u2019\u201d But Mr. Dylan\u2019s behavior has been at the extreme end of the spectrum, starting from a failure, for nearly two weeks, to respond to Ms. Danius\u2019s phone and email messages. \u201cStrange things have happened before, but nothing on this level,\u201d said Per Wastberg, the chairman of the Nobel Committee at the academy. Ms. Danius\u2019s assertion that Mr. Dylan\u2019s behavior is not a concern  \u2014   \u201cThe important thing is that the Nobel Prize in Literature belongs to Bob Dylan,\u201d she said  \u2014   is testament to the academy\u2019s view of itself as impervious to outside criticism and pressure. Highly secretive about its inner workings, it exists as something of a paradox: both steeped in the world literary community and strangely apart from and above it. Founded to promote Swedish language and literature by King Gustaf III in 1786, the academy took on the Nobel literature responsibilities in 1901, the first year the prize was awarded (the winner was the French author Sully Prudhomme). Its 18 members, who serve until they die (they can stop attending meetings, but they cannot resign) are an idiosyncratic collection of writers, academics and specialists in  \u2014   and advocates for  \u2014   particular areas of literature. Each year, the academy invites academic institutions, scholars, literary organizations, former laureates and others to put forth nominees. You are not meant to nominate yourself, though it happens all the time. \u201cWe get at least one letter a week from someone who says, \u2018I\u2019m fantastic  \u2014   you should read my book,\u2019\u201d Ms. Danius said. (These applicants are automatically disqualified.) Winners must have previously made the   shortlist at least once, and it seems that Mr. Dylan\u2019s name had been kicking around for a while. The prize is meant to reward a life\u2019s body of work, notwithstanding that even great writers produce material that not everyone loves. \u201cDoris Lessing was on the shortlist for quite a while before my time, and then she wrote a series of   novels that sank her in the view of the academy,\u201d Mr. Wastberg said. However, her name was resurrected  \u2014   in part because of her   autobiography  \u2014   and she won the prize in 2007. And what of Mr. Dylan\u2019s Nobel lecture, which under the terms of the prize is required to be given within six months of the ceremony? Rumor has it that he\u2019ll be in Stockholm next spring, \u201cthough the details are still unclear,\u201d Ms. Danius said, and he has said nothing about giving a speech. \u201cI\u2019m not sure a regular concert will do it,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the Swedish Academy always tries to accommodate the laureate\u2019s wishes, so if that\u2019s what he\u2019d like to propose, I\u2019m certain there is a way. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563040.8226902}
