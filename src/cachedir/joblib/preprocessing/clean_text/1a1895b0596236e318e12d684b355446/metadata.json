Clinton is set to fundraise with rapper Jay-Z, whose lyrics put GOP nominee Donald Trump\u2019s 11-year-old comments to shame. \\nClinton, who brands herself as some sort of champion of women\u2019s issues, will fund-raise with Jay-Z, whose popular song titled \u201cBig Pimpin\u201d includes the following lyrics: You know I \u2013 thug em, f\u2014 em, love em, leave em Cause I don\u2019t f\u2014in need em Take em out the hood, keep em lookin good But I don\u2019t f\u2014in feed em First time they fuss I\u2019m breezin. \\nTaking desperate women \u201cout the hood,\u201d taking the money they make from selling their bodies and further abusing them is really championing women\u2019s issues, eh? \\nLet\u2019s see, Trump made some lewd comments about what consenting adult women would hypothetically allow him to do because of his star status and he\u2019s a monster, but Jay-Z talks about profiting off of the misery of desperate women and treating them like garbage and hey, he\u2019s with her! \\nWestern Journalism reported : \\nWriting on TruthFeed , Amy Moreno noted that Clinton has a stable of rap artists supporting her whose language is beyond offensive. \\n\u201cEven while Hillary and her supporters are feigning outrage, she ran a contest on her website promoting a \u2018meet-and-greet\u2019 with rap artist Pusha T, who says vulgar things about women in his songs,\u201d she wrote. \\nIn Got \u2018Em Covered , Pusha T sings: All of you lil\u2019 n\u2014as quote all of the wrong figures Poke all of the wrong b\u2014s And follow the wrong n\u2014as.\u201d \\n\u201cYet, besides all that anti-woman vulgarity, Hillary had a contest on her website to meet this animal,\u201d wrote Moreno. \\nWestern Journalism also reported that earlier this month, Trump supporter Betsy McCaughey called out Clinton\u2019s hypocrisy. McCaughey responded to the video of Trump\u2019s comments by noting how Clinton accepts support from rappers who denigrate women for a living. \\n\u201cHillary Clinton expresses that she finds the language \u2026 horrific, but in fact she likes language like this, quote, \u2018I came to slay, b\u2014-. When he F me good, I take his a\u2013 to Red Lobster,\u2019 McCaughey said and added, \u201cThat happens to be a line from Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d \\n\u201cHer [Clinton\u2019s] favorite performer whom she says she idolizes and would like to imitate,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo you know what I\u2019m saying to you? There\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy.\u201d \\nClinton doesn\u2019t care about women, children , minorities, or anyone else that she uses and abuses to gain votes. Clinton cares about money and power \u2014 that\u2019s it.'"}, "time": 1742562313.9987428}
