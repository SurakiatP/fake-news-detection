[The white and   police car will be fully operational and used by the immediate response team to attend incidents around the clock across Blackpool, where it will be based.  The aim of the vehicle, on which the words \u201cLancashire Constabulary values diverse communities\u201d are emblazoned, is to \u201cengage with the gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans community to raise awareness of hate crime and domestic abuse and to encourage more people to report incidents\u201d according to a Facebook post by Lancashire LGBT Policing Team. It will also attend \u2018Pride\u2019 events across the region throughout the year, with Blog Preston noting that the colourful car will be making an appearance in the city for this reason in summer. Lancashire\u2019s Deputy Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said: \u201cWe are committed to equality and valuing difference and supporting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. \u201cBy having a car that has a bold statement is just one way of demonstrating that commitment. \u201d Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw added: \u201cAs Police and Crime Commissioner I am always looking for ways to demonstrate that the police are aware of their local communities and keen to reflect them in everything they do. \u201cThis car is just one aspect of that and again this year the Constabulary and my office will be supporting Blackpool Pride and encouraging the LGB and T community to work with us to end hate crime. \u201d Writing on Lancashire LGBT Policing Team\u2019s page, Facebook user Laura Myers welcomed the fleet\u2019s new addition, writing: \u201cGood on you   \u2026    . We are a country with diversity and equality and we should be proud to support the LGBT groups plus beats a boring old police car\u201d Responses to the rainbow vehicle were mixed, however. \u201cUsed   by immediate response?? We all know which will be the last set of keys picked up  \u2026    . This rivals the \u2018pumpkin patrol\u2019 car\u201d Charlotte Whitton commented. It was reported on Thursday that Brighton and Hove\u2019s former police commander, Nev Kemp, has been named Stonewall\u2019s Senior Champion of the Year in its 2017 Workplace Equality Index. The commander\u2019s spirited defence of an LGBT police vehicle was cited by the organisation as a key reason in their decision to issue him with the award. Stonewall said: \u201cNev\u2019s passion and tenacity were demonstrated when he responded to a criticism over a Sussex Police rainbow police car for Brighton Pride 2015 by covering the largest vehicle he could find (a van) in rainbows for Pride 2016. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563670.9082606}
