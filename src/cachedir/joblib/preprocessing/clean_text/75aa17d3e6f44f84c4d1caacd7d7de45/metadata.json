If history was any guide, the explorers said, the building the drone was filming  \u2014   a 1952 theater with unusual roof supports  \u2014   would eventually be demolished because it is not on Hong Kong\u2019s list of declared monuments. The authorities are \u201crenewing the city on behalf of the developers, not the people,\u201d said one of the explorers, who goes by the alias Ghost in videos and whose pollution mask and fingerless gloves gave him the air of a bank robber or graffiti artist. The explorers belong to HK Urbex, a   urban exploration collective whose expeditions often require trespassing or walks through dark, abandoned or dangerous sites. But unlike some urban explorers, they do not court danger purely for its own sake. Their primary goal is to peel back layers of history  \u2014   sometimes literally, by digging through dust and trash  \u2014   and forge a video archive of Hong Kong\u2019s   environment. \u201cUntil you peel them back, you don\u2019t know what existed before,\u201d said Ghost, 33. \u201cOthers are interested in the adrenaline rush, but we\u2019re interested in the story. What can it tell us about the past?\u201d Many buildings that went up here before Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule have already been replaced by taller ones, as exceptionally high property values create economic incentives to cram more towers into an already crowded skyline. But some buildings lie fallow for years between tenant evictions and demolition, and others, like the 1952 State Theater that the explorers filmed recently, are partly open to the public. The State Theater\u2019s main space, for example, is now a snooker hall. HK Urbex sees these structures as prime targets for urban expeditions. So far HK Urbex has released more than three dozen videos documenting their perambulations through derelict prisons, tenements, cinemas, hospitals, casinos, police stations, bomb shelters, subway tunnels, a shipwreck and other sites across Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. Fans say the elegiac videos, cut with bleak soundscapes and often presented without narration, are poignant meditations on urban evolution and decay. \u201cIt\u2019s about forcing us to confront the aesthetic of loss,\u201d Lee Kah Wee, an assistant professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore, said of the group\u2019s film oeuvre. \u201cIt forces us to come face to face with this debris of modernization and these ruins that are constantly accumulating, even as we keep building. \u201d The group says its most popular videos have been viewed more than 20, 000 times on YouTube. Its photographs and videos have also been cited or featured in an international art exhibition, a forthcoming photography book and an advocacy campaign to save Central Market, a 1930s landmark in central Hong Kong, from demolition. The group\u2019s eight members, all longtime Hong Kong residents, use aliases in their work to keep public attention focused on their mission instead of their personalities but also because anonymity helps shield them from potential legal trouble. They agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified only by their aliases. The HK Urbex members often spend weeks researching obscure and abandoned sites before visiting them. Once inside, they document everyday items that they stumble upon  \u2014   family portraits,   ancestral shrines, a broken piggy bank  \u2014   and that will probably never be recorded in history books. \u201cIf not for this group of urban adventurers, all of these buildings would eventually disappear without anyone knowing what they meant to society at a certain point in time,\u201d said Lee Ho Yin, the director of architectural conservation programs at the University of Hong Kong. He added that he regarded the group\u2019s members as \u201cextreme urban anthropologists. \u201d The Hong Kong government\u2019s Antiquities and Monuments Office has granted 114 buildings and cultural landmarks permanent protection from development, and assigned grades to about 1, 000 historic buildings, a list that may soon include the 1952 State Theater. But Professor Lee of the University of Hong Kong said that the second classification did not legally protect buildings from demolition, and that Hong Kong officials  \u2014   unlike their counterparts in Singapore, another wealthy Asian city and former British colony  \u2014   rarely bestowed conservation status on modernist landmarks like the State Theater. \u201cUnfortunately, the economy of Hong Kong is still very much pegged to property development,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, reached by telephone, declined to comment on HK Urbex or its activities. The group was formed in 2013 by Ghost and a friend, who goes by the alias Echo Delta. They both are   filmmakers, and they discovered their initial HK Urbex sites while scouting locations for film shoots, Echo Delta said. After a video they shot of a Hong Kong shipwreck received wide coverage in the city\u2019s   news media, they said, they decided to create the HK Urbex Facebook page, and later a YouTube channel and Tumblr blog. HK Urbex members say their videos are visual expressions of the \u201clocalist\u201d political movement that has recently gained support in Hong Kong and reflects a conviction among many younger people that their city\u2019s identity is distinct from that of the Chinese mainland. The localist movement is itself an outgrowth of the   Occupy Central protests of 2014, which swept Hong Kong  and reflected a widespread fear among many people here that Beijing is running roughshod over the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle governing Hong Kong\u2019s transfer to Chinese rule. The principle granted the city a high degree of legal, financial and political autonomy until 2047. \u201cI guess we\u2019re indirectly political,\u201d Ghost said, as Echo Delta\u2019s drone buzzed above North Point. After filming the State Theater, whose structural supports soar above its roof in concrete parabolas like those of a suspension bridge, Echo Delta and Ghost took a taxi to the city\u2019s Central district. The idea was to check on some abandoned buildings that they have been monitoring over the years. One stop was Central Market, a 1930s landmark that Ghost had previously explored twice  \u2014   first by sneaking past a security guard who was urinating and later by climbing in through a window. This time, a side door was unlocked. Echo Delta slipped inside, but a security guard quickly shooed him away. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. On nearby Bridges Street, a white residential building that the pair had once sneaked into was now ringed by a fence, with \u201cX\u201d marks in its windows. \u201cThey\u2019ve cleared it out,\u201d said Echo Delta, whose alias is a play on his   nickname. Later, they saw that while several abandoned buildings near the Graham Street Market had been razed for new construction, others were still standing, right beside the market\u2019s   vegetable hawkers. One squat apartment building in particular, which had plants growing in its crevices, caught their eye. They lingered for a few minutes under its shadow, apparently transfixed by its architectural features. \u201cLook at those long windows,\u201d Echo Delta said quietly. \u201cVictorian  \u2014   no, Georgian?\u201d \u201cThat would be one to look into,\u201d said Ghost, the only white member of HK Urbex. His alias plays on a Cantonese slang term for foreigners. His partner nodded. \u201cI bet it\u2019s going to be turned into a Starbucks,\u201d Echo Delta said.'"}, "time": 1742628547.0832157}
