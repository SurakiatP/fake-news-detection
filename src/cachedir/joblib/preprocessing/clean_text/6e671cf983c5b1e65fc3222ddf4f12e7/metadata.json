But the holiday weekend is often seen here as the start of heightened violence as well. That has been particularly worrying this year to community leaders and city officials, as they grapple with a rise in gun violence that has traumatized some neighborhoods and left city officials searching for new ways to subdue street crime. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t change, if we don\u2019t get jobs for these kids, if we don\u2019t change the economic situation, I\u2019m worried that we could be looking at a blood bath,\u201d said the Rev. Corey Brooks, a pastor on the city\u2019s South Side, a mostly   area where some of the shootings have been concentrated. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t happen, I fear that we\u2019re potentially looking at one of the worst summers we\u2019ve ever had. \u201d As of Friday morning, homicides in Chicago were up 52 percent in 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, and shootings had increased by 50 percent, though the pace of violence had slowed in recent weeks, the police said. Only five months into the year, at least 233 people had been killed. Officials are struggling with the problem and are using a range of strategies as the murder rate in Chicago, the nation\u2019s   city, outpaces that of New York and Los Angeles. Over the weekend, the Chicago police increased the number of officers on the streets. About a week after a gang sweep that led to the arrests of 140 people, the police said they planned to have extra foot patrols in parks and neighborhoods and more officers on bicycles. They are also using social media to track potentially troublesome house parties. \u201cI think you all know how important this weekend is,\u201d the police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, said on Friday afternoon at a meeting with his top command staff. On Friday evening, people gathered at more than 100 gymnasiums, parks and churches around the city to call for gang members and others to stop the violence that has long plagued some Chicago neighborhoods. The activities were the start of Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s third annual Summer of Faith and Action initiative, which promotes safety and urges people to put down their guns. \u201cIf we all come together and reclaim our streets, reclaim our parks, there\u2019s no room for the gangbangers,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said, stopping by one of the gatherings on Friday night on the Southwest Side, where people played basketball and painted murals. \u201cI would also say to the gangbangers what Eddie Johnson said,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said, referring to his recently appointed superintendent. \u201cThere\u2019s a small percentage creating an overabundance of the gun violence. The Police Department knows who you are. They know where you live. And they know what you\u2019re doing. \u201d For a few hours on Friday evening, under periods of pounding rain, the peace held, and the police scanners were filled with mundane reports of disturbances and   problems after a Beyonc\u00e9 concert. But by Saturday evening, the police reported, 19 people had been shot, four fatally, including a    girl. Last year during the   Memorial Day weekend, there were 46 shootings in Chicago, and 14 people were killed, the police said. Other years have been quieter in 2013, there were 22 shootings and six deaths. Some community leaders are concerned about what may lie ahead because of how widespread the shootings and killings were even before the warm summer months, historically the most violent time of year in Chicago. The Rev. Michael Pfleger said on Friday that residents seemed to be \u201chunkering down\u201d because they expected bad things to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like everyone\u2019s saying a hurricane is coming,\u201d said Father Pfleger, whose parish, the Faith Community of St. Sabina, is on the South Side. \u201cWhat we really need to be doing is getting out, walking around. Don\u2019t board up your house. Be out on your block. Be vigilant. Fear either paralyzes you or it motivates you. We could have this be the safest weekend of the summer if everyone was out talking to one another. \u201d The worries about summer come at an extraordinarily complicated time for Chicago, which is facing parallel crises: a drastic spike in violent crime and a Police Department viewed with suspicion, even derision, in some neighborhoods.   relations between the Chicago police and residents, especially   boiled over after the November release of a dashboard camera video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times. In the months afterward, Mr. Emanuel faced calls for his resignation, the police superintendent was fired and the Justice Department began an investigation into the Police Department\u2019s practices. Last month, a task force appointed by Mr. Emanuel issued a scathing report saying that racism had contributed to a long pattern of institutional failures by the department and that the department had lost the trust of residents. That mistrust, some here say, has made it harder to solve crimes on the streets: Witnesses and victims often choose not to share information with the police. \u201cPeople think that to get justice, they have to take the law into their own hands,\u201d said the Rev. Marshall E. Hatch, the pastor of New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church, on the West Side. Some here expressed concern about focusing on preparations for violence on a particular weekend  \u2014   Memorial Day or otherwise. \u201cThe fact is that it\u2019s constant and relentless, and that you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Joseph, a trauma surgeon at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, where some shooting victims are taken. \u201cTry to imagine what it must be like for a    trying to go to school every day and not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. \u201d No one knows for sure why Chicago\u2019s violence has increased this year, but the police say it is largely the result of a small number of people involved with the city\u2019s increasingly splintered set of gangs, and a rising number of disputes playing out on social media. A new area of concern is shootings along the expressways, where the authorities say gang feuds are spilling out of the neighborhoods. There have been 20 shootings along   expressways this year, the police said, and no arrests. \u201cThis has all amped up from what I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Father Pfleger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a boiling point, and guns have become part of America\u2019s wardrobe. People out here presume everyone has one, and they\u2019ll tell you, \u2018I\u2019m going to draw mine before I get laid down.\u2019 \u201d Chicago\u2019s population of 2. 7 million is nearly equally split among whites, blacks and Hispanics, but most of the shootings have taken place in black and Hispanic neighborhoods on the city\u2019s South and West Sides, and the majority of the victims have been  . For many who live in these neighborhoods, a recent poll showed, crime and gangs have become overriding concerns. More than 20 people under 18 have been killed this year. A number of bystanders have also been shot. Zarriel Trotter, 13, who appeared in an   video last year, was injured by a stray bullet in March. Jana\u00e9 Bonsu, the national public policy chairwoman for Black Youth Project 100, said she was hopeful that city leaders would address the increase in violence by investing more in community groups focused on better jobs and increased educational opportunities, rather than just bolstering the police. \u201cThe City Council, the mayor, nobody is being brave enough to say that maybe our efforts are concentrated in the wrong place,\u201d Ms. Bonsu said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have much going for yourself, whether it be work, whether it be school, your options are on the block. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562687.8082373}
