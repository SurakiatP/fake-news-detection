You\u2019d think they of all people would be more understanding. \\n\u201cStill, I hear Francois Hollande has an election coming up in France. Does anyone have his number? I\u2019m sure he could use a hand.\u201d Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently witterings below - why not add your own?
