four million percentage point side point end mr trump simple reason electoral college largely design give lot weight battleground state mr trump advantage traditional battleground whiter less educate country whole mr trump success state not demographic quirk history like outcome battle toledo ohio gain mrs clinton go unrewarde also plain luck one argument favor electoral college not reward regionalism candidate win huge margin one part country system not reward additional vote beyond necessary win state region get floridas electoral vote whether win vote good example regionalism drive vote split election democrat grover cleveland popular vote nearly point lose electoral college margin similar mrs clinton popular vote dominate deep south white supremacist democrats succeed disenfranchise republican black voter since end reconstruction even progressive would consider moral victory electoral college mrs clinton big win california paper potentially enough responsible vote split way deep south drive mr cleveland popular vote win unlike situation mrs clinton huge victory california along district columbia hawaii mrs clinton high percentage california almost entirely cancel mr trumps dominance base state well call appalachafornia west virginia wyoming appalachafornia consist west virginia kentucky tennessee arkansas alabama oklahoma kansas nebraska wyome montana

fare well remain blue state outside california hawaii mr trump remain red state outside appalachafornia mrs clinton state like illinois new york much large margin mr trump similarly sized red state like georgia texas compare president obama mrs clinton make sizable gain many red state outside appalachafornia include big improvement texas yet electoral vote mr trump well battleground state depend battleground define vote either break mr trump virtually tie huge improvement mitt romney show mr trump lopsided electoral vote tally state narrowly win four five state decide around one point less florida wisconsin michigan pennsylvania mrs clinton edge new hampshire outside five state electoral vote basically tie mr trump edge mrs clinton lead margin bias imbalance competitive battleground state somewhat similar regionalism issue least mathematical sense mrs clinton blue state wide margin mr trump red state rest country battleground vote republican electoral college not regionalism issue solid red solid blue state mr trump fail make gain include clear majority countrys electoral college vote population actual vote regional anomaly midw happen system mr trumps strength midwestern battleground state yield lot electoral college vote real demographic reason traditional battleground state much whiter less educate particularly less hispanic rest country demographic alone not quite justice mr trumps victory electoral college end battleground state margin claim electoral college vote four five close state win vote stake never close election united states one candidate claim resounding electoral vote margin close state lack well word mr trump good luck nothing distribution mrs clinton vote battleground nationally mean destine get electoral vote take minnesota wisconsin michigan three contiguous state span upper great lake mrs clinton actually region narrow margin vote stake ultimately state line pretty arbitrary yes line determined reason consideration like population access river resource statehood state line often poorly survey first place hotly dispute th century many state create response political consideration especially balance free slave state time could go differently consider two big nonpolitical state boundary question th century fate florida panhandle toledo war toledo war long dispute michigan ohio tiny strip land along border happen include city toledo ohio upper hand one reason earn statehood first therefore block michigan petition include strip end congress propose deal michigan would relinquish claim toledo strip exchange would get upper peninsula florida panhandle florida peninsula govern separate region west east florida spanish british rule effectively separate hundred mile treacherous swamp forest ultimately west east florida combine one state mainly coincidental alabama earn statehood florida territory annex west florida repeatedly try join alabama start soon state annex last way past civil war many effort include referendum congressional petition direct negotiation florida alabama nearly succeed ultimately minor border issue go differently mrs clinton would probably president florida panhandle heavily republican without rest florida vote democratic half toledo war work poorly mrs clinton would michigan toledo would also michigan without upper peninsula full trade give mr trump narrow win interestingly change would flip election perhaps election result national popular vote though not result florida election pronounce regionalism play would make hard change outcome tweak state line clear also make plenty change would benefit republican could reunify west virginia virginia take easy one point main bias electoral college not big state regionalism toward big battleground state break overwhelmingly one way win exactly hamiltonian argument not many justification let close state decide close national election basically system nothing state ensure provide representative
