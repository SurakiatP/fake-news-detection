The bug itself is very specific \u2014 allowing attackers to escape from security sandboxes through a flaw in the win32k system \u2014 but it\u2019s serious enough to be categorized as critical, and according to Google, it\u2019s being actively exploited. As a result, Google went public just 10 days after reporting the bug to Microsoft, before a patch could be coded and deployed. The result is that, while Google has already deployed a fix to protect Chrome users, Windows itself is still vulnerable \u2014 and now, everybody knows it. Google\u2019s disclosure provides only a general description of the bug, giving users enough information to recognize a possible attack without making it too easy for criminals to replicate. Exploiting the bug also depends on a separate exploit in Adobe Flash, for which the company has also released a patch. Still, simply knowing that the bug exists will likely spur a lot of criminals to look for viable ways to exploit it against computers that have yet to update Flash.'"}, "time": 1742563916.4304328}
