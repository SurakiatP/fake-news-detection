Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, received several ovations from the   audience as she arrived, and then another round of applause when she was acknowledged by the cast after the show. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of really awesome famous and notable people here today,\u201d the actress Patrice Covington, who gave the farewell speech on behalf of the cast after the show, said to the audience. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call all of them out  \u2014   I know you already know them,\u201d she said, before pausing, looking in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s direction, and waving at her mischievously. At that, the audience erupted into a new, loud round of applause. The reaction was substantially warmer than the scattered booing and clapping that greeted the arrival of Vice   Mike Pence when he attended \u201cHamilton,\u201d just one block north, on Nov. 18. \u201cWe love you Hillary,\u201d some audience members shouted. Several thanked Mrs. Clinton and told her, \u201cGod bless you. \u201d \u201cGod bless you,\u201d Mrs. Clinton replied. Mrs. Clinton was besieged by   before the show, at intermission and as she was ushered out a side door after the musical ended (\u201cWhoa!\u201d said her husband as they left.) Jordan Serpone, 33, an audience member from Boston, said that spotting Mrs. Clinton was a surprisingly moving experience for him. \u201cI was having every emotion I\u2019ve tried to get rid of over the past few weeks,\u201d he said during intermission. He shook her hand, but said he is still filled with frustration over her loss. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be here. She should be planning her cabinet,\u201d he said. Because the Sunday matinee was the last performance for the acclaimed production, which won last year\u2019s Tony award for best musical revival, the crowd was starry: Among those in the audience were Jonathan Groff, Mariska Hargitay, Gayle King, Debra Messing, Leslie Odom Jr. Billy Porter, Phylicia Rashad and Anna Wintour. Public sightings of Mrs. Clinton in the weeks since the election have been sufficiently rare that they create a stir on social media. Strangers have sought photographs with her at stores and in the woods near her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. But Mrs. Clinton has indicated that she and her husband plan to attend the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president on Jan. 20. \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d tells the searing story of a young black woman abused by her stepfather and her husband in rural Georgia in the early 20th century. The musical is an adaptation of a   1982 novel, by Alice Walker, which was awarded the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Steven Spielberg adapted the novel into a film in 1985, and Oprah Winfrey, who was featured in the film, went on to become an important champion, and   of the musical. The musical has been one of the most successful at attracting black audiences to Broadway. It first opened on Broadway in 2005, and features a book by Marsha Norman and music and lyrics by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Allee Willis. The revival, which opened in 2015 and was directed by John Doyle, featured a   performance by the British actress Cynthia Erivo. She won a Tony award for best actress in a leading role in a musical. The last show took place on Ms. Erivo\u2019s 30th birthday.'"}, "time": 1742561834.9881968}
