Ms. Blumenstein will become one of the   women in The Times\u2019s newsroom. She will join three other deputy managing editors  \u2014   Janet Elder Clifford Levy, who was promoted last week and Matthew Purdy. In a note to the staff announcing the appointment on Tuesday, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Joe Kahn, the managing editor, said that Ms. Blumenstein, 50, would help the newsroom \u201cdo all the big things we intend to do in 2017 and beyond. \u201d In particular, they said, Ms. Blumenstein \u201cwill focus on making sure we remain an essential destination for readers interested in business, finance, economics and technology. \u201d In recent months, the newsroom has had a dearth of female leaders. In September, Susan Chira stepped down as deputy executive editor to write about gender issues, and in December, Lydia Polgreen, an associate masthead editor, left to become the top editor at The Huffington Post. Ms. Blumenstein\u2019s appointment will quite likely be seen as a positive step, though it is notable that The Times named an outsider rather than promoting a woman from within. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kahn said it was \u201cabsolutely not the case\u2019\u2019 that they could not find a woman within The Times to play a role in newsroom leadership. \u201cThis is about Rebecca, who I think has a skill set, a perspective and the experience running a big newsroom that Dean and I and the others at the top of the masthead felt that we needed, to make sure that we\u2019re putting our best foot forward in terms of this digital transition,\u201d Mr. Kahn said. He added that there would be other masthead announcements soon. Ms. Blumenstein was seen as a potential successor to Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Journal, and news of her departure was met with surprise and sadness in the Journal newsroom, where she is known for her passion for breaking news. Asked how it felt to lure someone of Ms. Blumenstein\u2019s caliber from a highly respected competitor, Mr. Kahn was circumspect in his reply. \u201cI can only say that I follow and deeply admire The Journal\u2019s coverage, and they\u2019re a fierce competitor and a constant source of concern for us,\u201d Mr. Kahn said. \u201cSo of course it\u2019s meaningful to have one of their top editors come and join us. \u201d In a note to employees, Mr. Baker called Ms. Blumenstein \u201ca peerless exponent and advocate of the very highest quality journalism. \u201d \u201cShe has been a singularly principled and dignified leader and a great mentor and friend to so many colleagues here,\u201d he wrote. The appointment comes as both news organizations work to determine a strategy for an increasingly digital world. Both have initiated sweeping newsroom strategy reviews that have left employees anxious and uncertain about their futures. Last month, The Times released the findings of its review in a report that called for rapid change. Ms. Blumenstein has worked at The Journal since 1995, where she has held numerous senior positions, including managing editor of WSJ. com and international editor. As the newspaper\u2019s China bureau chief, she led her team to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. China was also where she and Mr. Kahn, who worked in the Beijing bureau for The Times, got to know each other, Mr. Kahn said. \u201cShe was unrelenting in pushing her team hard to beat us,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564304.4376538}
