Sterling Burnett, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday regarding President Trump\u2019s position on the Paris Climate Agreement. The Heartland Institute has called for the United States to withdraw. [The press release reads in part:  The Paris Climate Treaty puts America last, the exact opposite of what candidate Trump and now President Trump has promised. The treaty would require the United States to make massive reductions in emissions and pay billions of dollars in \u2018climate reparations\u2019 to Third World dictators, while requiring no emission cuts from developing countries including India and China. Why should the United States pay hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries at a time when the U. S. government is running massive debts, when economic growth is slower for a longer period of time than at any time since the Great Depression, and when American workers are losing out to   workers in China and India? Burnett said Wednesday, \u201cTrump rightly said he was going to withdraw from this, but   \u2026     there are two factions in the White House. There are those like Scott Pruitt, head of the EPA, like Steve Bannon, his adviser, that say keep your campaign promise. Withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. Let America grow. \u201d \u201cBut then there\u2019s the other faction,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat\u2019s led by Rex Tillerson, who has a lot of influence   \u2026     as secretary of state, who said we should stay in the agreement. It\u2019s led by his daughter and    Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.   \u2026     She wants to make climate change her signature issue. So he\u2019s got powerful interests trying to keep him in the agreement, saying not [to] leave it as it is, but renegotiate it. Cut a better deal. \u201d \u201cProblem is, there are no terms within the treaty to cut a better deal. You\u2019re not allowed within the treaty to cut a better deal. And the worst problem is, is there\u2019s no better deal to be had, in the sense that if you\u2019re forcing America to cut its emissions, you\u2019re having big government intervene in the economy,\u201d he concluded.
