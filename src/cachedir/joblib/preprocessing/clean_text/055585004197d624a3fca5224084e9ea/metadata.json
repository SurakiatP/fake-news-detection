Two draft memos signed on Friday by John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general who is now secretary of homeland security, outline an aggressive mission for the immigration authorities that would rescind policies put in place by President Barack Obama that focused mainly on removing serious criminals. The directives appear to spare many younger immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers. But some parents of children who enter unaccompanied could face prosecution under the guidelines. The approach laid out in the memos, which have not been finalized and are subject to change by the White House, reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to harden the border and deport people who entered the United States illegally. He has returned to that theme in recent days: At a rally on Saturday in Melbourne, Fla. Mr. Trump highlighted a recent spate of deportations and characterized those being sent out of the country as dangerous criminals. \u201cWe will have strong borders again,\u201d he told supporters, who cheered robustly. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he\u2019s really doing the job. You\u2019re seeing it. The gang members  \u2014   bad, bad people. I said it Day 1. And they\u2019re going out, or they\u2019re being put in prison. But for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from. \u201d Among the most significant changes in the memos, which were obtained by McClatchy newspapers and The Washington Post, would be an expansion of   expedited removal proceedings to cover thousands more undocumented immigrants. Under expedited removals, agents from the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement can deport detained individuals immediately. Under Obama administration directives, expedited removal was used only within 100 miles of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Mr. Kelly\u2019s memos would expand that to those who have been in the country for up to two years anywhere in the nation. The memos also call for the possible prosecution of the parents of children who arrived as unaccompanied minors and are later reunited with the parents. Under Mr. Kelly\u2019s directive, the parents could be charged with smuggling or trafficking. But the memos appear to exempt the Dreamers, the young immigrants protected under Mr. Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, called DACA. Mr. Trump has signaled that he is not eager to completely reverse that initiative, since those young immigrants were not responsible for their entering the country illegally. \u201cThe DACA situation is a very, very  \u2014   it\u2019s a very difficult thing for me, because, you know, I love these kids,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cI love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know the law is rough. \u201d The White House cautioned on Sunday that the details of the directives were still being reviewed but suggested final orders may be issued this week. \u201cNone of those are final and have not been signed off by the White House,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy press secretary for Mr. Trump, told reporters in Florida, where the president was spending the weekend. The Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss the memos. The changes in immigration enforcement, outlined in executive orders signed by Mr. Trump last month, have drawn praise from agents in the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cFor the first time in my 19 years, I feel like I can do the job I was hired to do, the job they tell you you\u2019ll be doing when you leave the academy,\u201d said Shawn Moran, a Border Patrol agent in San Diego and spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing 16, 000 of the agency\u2019s 21, 000 agents. But immigration advocates called the policy changes dangerous and expressed disappointment in Mr. Kelly, who they had hoped would be a more moderate voice on immigration policy in the Trump administration because he had expressed sympathy for women and children arriving in the United States after fleeing violence in Central America. \u201cThat hope is now gone,\u201d Tom Jawetz, the vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization, said on Twitter. \u201cThe border security memo mentions Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan kids coming without pretending to care why. \u201d Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he hoped the administration would rethink the approach. \u201cAll of these things are unfortunately not surprising but deeply worrisome, both for the people who are going to be directly affected and for the country as a whole,\u201d Mr. Jadwat said. \u201cThis kind of inhumane approach and the disregard for fundamental due process values that\u2019s embodied in these memos can do real damage to our country. \u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said that while he supported the removal of unauthorized immigrants who are dangerous criminals, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies seemed to lump all undocumented immigrants together. \u201cUltimately, anyone who is found in an undocumented status would ultimately be apprehended and deported, with due process totally eroded under the proposals that I\u2019m hearing about,\u201d he said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not only going to lead to massive deportations, they are going to affect every element of our society and our economic sector as well. \u201d Expanding the immigration authorities\u2019 reach would require a considerable increase in resources. With an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, the government has long had to set narrower priorities, given the constraints on staffing and money. But Mr. Kelly\u2019s memos envision hiring 10, 000 new immigration and customs agents, expanding detention facilities and creating an office to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump had some of those relatives address his rallies in the campaign, and several were present when he signed an executive order on immigration last month at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Kelly\u2019s directives would also instruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, to begin reviving a program that recruits local police officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies to help with deportation, effectively making them de facto immigration agents. The effort, called the 287g program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. The program faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up undocumented individuals. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott has said he will cut state funding for sanctuary cities and remove any elected official who promotes such policies. Mr. Abbott\u2019s office canceled a $1. 5 million grant to Travis County because the newly elected Democratic sheriff, Sally Hernandez, said her department would not respond to requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to flag inmates for possible deportation. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, the secretary of state and a transition adviser to Mr. Trump, is promoting a bill that would require the Kansas Highway Patrol to seek agreement with the federal government to deputize state troopers to enforce immigration laws. The Highway Patrol says it was not consulted on the bill. The measure faces opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans.'"}, "time": 1742563169.243269}
