It is no surprise why the gun is so reviled by gun control advocates. Omar Mateen, the gunman in the attack this weekend on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. used a spinoff of the rifle produced by SIG Sauer to kill nearly 50 people. The   weapon has also been the gun of choice in several other mass shootings: at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. at a holiday party for county health workers in San Bernardino, Calif. and at the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon. But the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the   \u201cAmerica\u2019s rifle. \u201d Though the federal government does not keep track of exactly how many   are in circulation, experts estimate that there are easily several million in the nation\u2019s rifle racks and gun safes  \u2014   a huge number, given that the gun, along with other   assault weapons, was banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004. The rifle\u2019s extraordinary popularity can be traced to a number of factors, including the ease of its use, its embodiment of a certain military glamour, and the aggressive marketing of the gun industry. The weapon was first built in the late 1950s by Eugene M. Stoner, a former Marine and the lead gun designer at the ArmaLite Division of the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. It was an unusual rifle for the era, made of lightweight plastics and aluminum instead of traditional materials like wood and metals. It also fired a .  bullet, which was smaller and faster than the typical ammunition at the time. Partly for those reasons, the Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, purchased the   in bulk in the 1960s and, after renaming it the   turned it into the standard issue for American ground troops in Vietnam. Around the same time, a civilian version of the rifle, which unlike its military counterpart could not shoot automatically, also went on sale. Today, dozens of companies produce their own version of the weapon. \u201cBack in the day, people called it the \u2018plastic rifle\u2019 because it felt like a toy,\u201d said Sam Andrews, the owner of Tier One Weapons Systems, a gun engineering company in Eureka, Mo. \u201cBut that\u2019s evolved. Now people realize that light can be good. \u201d Because of its   system, Mr. Andrews said, the   has a fairly gentle recoil. The weapon is also fast and accurate, he added, able to fire, under capable hands, eight rounds in a second. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s so popular,\u201d Mr. Andrews said, \u201cis that if you bring a handgun to a fight where there\u2019s an   you\u2019re going to lose. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a   man like me or a   girl. \u201d Gun owners say that the   is used for hunting, sport shooting and  . The rifle is also easily accessorized with custom   like flashlights, infrared scopes and a variety of grips, and is called the Lego set of the gun world. Its owners swap product reviews or share personal hacks on a wide variety of blogs and online bulletin boards. According to a 2010 survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation,   owners tend on average to have three different versions of the rifle and spend more than $400 per weapon on accessories and special modifications. Though the   can be bought as cheaply as $600, the average retail price was slightly more than $1, 000, the survey found. This demand has been accompanied  \u2014   some would say caused  \u2014   by vigorous mass marketing campaigns by gun manufacturers, which often refer to the   not as an assault rifle, but as a modern sporting rifle. Groups like the Civilian Marksmanship Program run   target competitions each year that attract scores of military veterans, one of the gun\u2019s chief sales demographics. \u201cYou\u2019ve got lots of returning servicemen who knew the   very well  \u2014   how to shoot it, clean it, take it apart,\u201d said Jim Scoutten, the executive producer of Shooting USA, a shooting sports television channel. \u201cAnd when they come back, in many cases they acquire the civilian version. \u201d The   is also heavily marketed to younger gun enthusiasts who are attracted to the highly militarized, Special Operations culture that has become increasingly prevalent in action movies and   video games like \u201cCall of Duty. \u201d In 2014, the Violence Policy Center, which advocates gun control, did a study of the marketing efforts by the Freedom Group, one of the world\u2019s largest gun manufacturers. It found that many of the company\u2019s advertisements used martial images of men in tactical gear and slogans like \u201cBuilt to Be as Tough as the Job\u201d and \u201cBravery on Duty. \u201d The study quotes an article in Shooting Sports Retailer, a gun industry trade magazine, warning salesmen to be wary of certain   buyers. \u201cMany of the new shooters attracted to tactical guns for their first firearms purchase will think that they know guns because they\u2019ve played a lot of first\u2010person shooter video games,\u201d the article says. \u201cGamers inspired by \u2018Call of Duty\u2019 to purchase their first gun will eventually discover that they have a lot to learn. \u201d But despite such admonitions, the gun industry has used the popularity of these games to sell its products to \u201ca youthful, aggressive, technologically savvy generation,\u201d said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer representing the families of Newtown, Conn. in a lawsuit against the industry. In researching his suit, Mr. Koskoff said that he found screen shots from \u201cCall of Duty\u201d of   that bear the names of   gun manufacturers. To Josh Sugarman, the founder of the Violence Policy Center, the manufacturers\u2019 attempts to push the   among the younger set stem from a stark realization about the future of the industry. \u201cThe traditional   demographic  \u2014   white males  \u2014   is aging and slowly dying off,\u201d Mr. Sugarman said. \u201cSo they\u2019re marketing the   to the next generation as the new, shiny thing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562063.9748235}
