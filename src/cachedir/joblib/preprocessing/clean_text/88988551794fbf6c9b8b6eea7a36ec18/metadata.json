Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. \\nThe following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term \u201c jumping the shark \u201c: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX \\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 \\nApparently, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged \u201cjournalists\u201d named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, \u201cWas a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?\u201d \\nWhatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. \\nJohn Roberts from Forbes explains, \u201cThe bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a \u201cfollow up\u201d piece is in the works.\u201d \\nRoberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word \u201cRETRACTION.\u201d \\nCYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. \\nDuring his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton\u2019s shrill antics, Julian Assange said, \u201c \u201cI actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.\u201d \\nThe saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party \u2013 is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. \\nStill, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower \u2013 with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. \\nAssange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it. \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \""}, "time": 1742563749.2658772}
