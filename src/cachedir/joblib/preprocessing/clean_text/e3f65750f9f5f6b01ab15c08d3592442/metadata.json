Trump as a \u201clegitimate president. \u201d Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts. \u201cAll talk, talk, talk  \u2014   no action or results,\u201d he added. \u201cSad!\u201d While some questioned Mr. Lewis\u2019s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Others ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of Mr. Lewis\u2019s district, which is majority   and encompasses   of Atlanta, as \u201chorrible,\u201d \u201cfalling apart\u201d and \u201ccrime infested. \u201d In fact, Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead the world\u2019s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation, announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia. In addition, Mr. Trump\u2019s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition effort. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the   parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, after Mr. Khan spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Those attacks were widely viewed to have backfired, and Mr. Trump later modulated his words about the Khans. Mr. Trump himself has experience questioning a president\u2019s legitimacy. He was instrumental in sowing doubts about President Obama\u2019s birthplace. Mr. Lewis, who is 76 and was first elected to Congress in 1987, is one of the few genuinely historic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by Democrats and Republicans alike. Allies of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, circulated pictures of him linking arms with Mr. Lewis at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march to fend off accusations that Mr. Sessions was a racist. Nevertheless, Mr. Lewis testified against Mr. Sessions, declaring, \u201cWe need someone as attorney general who\u2019s going to look out for all of us, and not just some of us. \u201d A few critics, including David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said they disagreed with Mr. Lewis\u2019s statement that Mr. Trump was not legitimate, which he made in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News and which will be broadcast on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Still, Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Lewis: \u201cI honor the man he is. Honesty integrity courage  \u2014   these are qualities you can\u2019t buy. \u201d In his interview with Mr. Todd, Mr. Lewis said he believed that the Russians had delivered the election to Mr. Trump. \u201cYou know, I believe in forgiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It\u2019s going to be very difficult. I don\u2019t see this   as a legitimate president. \u201d Mr. Lewis is one of a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have announced that they will boycott the inauguration on Friday. Others include Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois.'"}, "time": 1742564597.041986}
