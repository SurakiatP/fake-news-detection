[The View   Joy Behar broached the topic with McEntire Wednesday by referencing rapper Drake\u2019s recent      Trump rant. \u201cF*ck that man!\u201d Drake told a   crowd in England after a lengthy screed about Trump dividing Americans.  Behar asked McEntire, \u201cIf you ever went on a political rant in the middle of your act, what would happen?\u201d \u201cMy fans would be shocked,\u201d the     said. \u201cI take it this way: they have paid their   money to come in there and fill a seat  \u2014   parking, getting something at the concession stand, go and eat before the concert  \u2014   I am there to entertain them, to take their worries away from them, so when they walk out, they can kind of have a little lift in their step and go, \u2018Aw, that was such a great break from all the problems I have to deal with during daily life.\u2019 So I\u2019m not going to give them my political views. \u201d Asked if her decision to keep quiet about her political views is for fear of losing half her audience, McEntire said, \u201cThat\u2019s not as important as this is my job to entertain. It shouldn\u2019t be my platform to be up on stage giving my political views. \u201d The Consider Me Gone singer also praised singer Lady Gaga for singing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and focusing on unity during her mostly nonpolitical Super Bowl halftime show performance.
