A New York   News poll shows a tightened presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, two of the most unpopular candidates on record. Mrs. Clinton claims the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, to Mr. Trump\u2019s 44 percent. But differences at the state level suggest Mrs. Clinton still has a strong advantage. The Libertarian and Green Party candidates, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, remain in the single digits but could have an outsize effect on the outcome. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton resumed campaigning after a   break to recuperate from pneumonia. \u201cPeople like me, we\u2019re lucky,\u201d she told an audience at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro. \u201cWhen I\u2019m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can\u2019t. \u201d Mr. Trump unveiled a jobs plan that was short on details, though it did include the pledge to make allies pay the full cost of U. S. military resources used for their defense. Donald Trump Jr. came under fire for invoking Holocaust imagery in complaining about media double standards. If the Republicans did what Democrats were doing, he said, \u201cthey\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber. \u201d _____ 3.  The   National Museum of African American History and Culture opens next week, filling the last museum site on the National Mall. The history begins with slavery in Africa and moves to the Americas, with a welter of piercing objects, like a   lockable neck ring. The collection, which ranges from Harriet Tubman\u2019s missal to Chuck Berry\u2019s red Cadillac, \u201cis a   engrossing,   \u201d our critic writes. _____ 4. One of our most popular stories today is actually a short video narrated by Shawn Carter, better known as Jay Z. It\u2019s a compelling, speedy recap of the U. S. fight against drugs going back to the Nixon administration, pointing out how   have been disproportionately targeted and penalized. \u201cThe war on drugs is an epic fail,\u201d he concludes. _____ 5. The Philippines is struggling through its own devastating war on drugs. Its Senate heard explosive testimony from a   hit man who said that the country\u2019s new president, Rodrigo Duterte, had presided over the extrajudicial killings of about 1, 000 criminals and political opponents over the years he served as mayor of Davao City. The Senate\u2019s televised hearings have already heard that nearly 1, 800 people were killed by police officers and vigilantes in the war on drugs in Mr. Duterte\u2019s first seven weeks as president. _____ 6.  Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cSnowden\u201d opens nationwide on Friday. Our reviewer calls it \u201ca quiet, crisply drawn portrait of the world\u2019s most celebrated \u201d and, \u201cby Mr. Stone\u2019s standards, a strikingly sober film\u201d  \u2014   with little in the way of wild conspiracy theories or bravura visuals. Human rights groups are taking advantage of the film\u2019s splash to press President Obama to pardon Mr. Snowden, but lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee urged Mr. Obama not do so. _____ 7. China\u2019s new class of   is bringing another novelty to the country: the stratospheric divorce settlement. In what appears to be the latest, the Chinese tycoon who holds a controlling stake in Grindr, the gay dating app, has been ordered to transfer some $1. 14 billion in shares of his own company, Beijing Kunlun World Wide Technology, to his wife. _____ 8. Our reporter on the hajj has had to cover her hair and robe herself, despite the heat. Even so, other women on the pilgrimage to Mecca have chastised her for not wearing socks. She relates her struggle with the limits that are Islam\u2019s price of community, including a lesser place for women. \u201cIt can feel patronizing, and diminishing of our full humanity,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is why I started to lose faith after a childhood in an observant family and what I still struggle with, at 38, living a life that is secular but guided by Islamic values. \u201d _____ 9. An N. F. L. official said two Denver Broncos defenders were fined for hitting the Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton on the head in their season opener last week. Newton was hit on the head four times in the game, only one of which drew a penalty against the Broncos. But there were shining moments in the opening week of professional football, like the   34 completions the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 quarterback, Alex Smith, made against the San Diego Chargers. Tonight, the New York Jets play the Buffalo Bills. (8:25 p. m. Eastern, CBS) _____ 10.  Finally, good news: After years of planning and digitizing, much of the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s sumptuous archives are now available on the museum\u2019s website. \u201cThis is like a dream come true for me,\u201d said the archives\u2019 chief, Michelle Elligott, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been playing around with this material for 20 years and I know the depth of what\u2019s here. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
