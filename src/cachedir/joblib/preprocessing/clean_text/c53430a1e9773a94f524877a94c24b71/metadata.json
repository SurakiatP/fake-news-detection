No, she is not wearing a burkini. The photo dates from 1957. The woman is wearing a bikini on the beach at Rimini on Italy\u2019s Adriatic coast. At the time, Italy prohibited the revealing bathing suit it was too immodest to be worn in public. In the midst of France\u2019s fight over banning the burkini, the bikini is celebrating its 70th anniversary, and photographs chronicling its debut and early history in the 1940s, \u201950s and \u201960s are on display in one of Paris\u2019s chic galleries, prompting parallels to the uproar over the burkini today. What is it about women\u2019s swimwear and more generally women\u2019s attire that over and over in history has attracted controversy and impelled societies to legislate or regulate women\u2019s choices? Historians, sociologists and anthropologists have argued about it for decades, but the seemingly simplistic statement that women\u2019s bodies are a battleground has some truth to it. Formally or informally, men (primarily) have been making rules about women\u2019s attire for a very long time. \u201cCan\u2019t we decide what we want to wear in 2016?\u201d wondered Sarah Fekih, 23, from Lyon, France, in a comment she wrote to The New York Times. \u201cIf one wishes to dress skimpily or to be almost nude or to be covered from head to toe, isn\u2019t that a personal choice that can not be dictated by law?\u201d Of course, the burkini debate is not only about feminism. It is foremost a debate about the visibility and presence of Islam in France, and it comes in the context of the most recent act of terror to traumatize the country, this one in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. On July 14, a man drove a cargo truck into crowds of people there, killing 86 and wounding 300. The Islamic State later called him one of its \u201csoldiers. \u201d Less than a month later, the first of at least 30 bans on \u201cinappropriate\u201d clothing on beaches  \u2014   meant to target Muslim attire  \u2014   was enacted in Cannes, about 20 miles from Nice. Although France\u2019s highest administrative court, the Council of State, struck down one town\u2019s burkini ban on Friday  \u2014   and clearly would do the same for other towns if lawsuits were brought  \u2014   the fight is far from over. The Parliament could enact a ban, and some of France\u2019s 2017 presidential candidates on the right and far right have pledged to enact measures that run from banning the Muslim veil in universities and businesses to banning almost all religious attire in public. As the debate continues, much that is important will be said about France and racism and Islam, but it is worth pondering that it is women\u2019s clothes that are at issue. Throughout history, a combination of legislation, local regulation and social pressure has influenced the way women have dressed  \u2014   corsets and d\u00e9collet\u00e9, hoop skirts and bustles, the controversial advent of pants. France is now a society demanding that women undress, but in many ways this debate is part of the same narrative. In the case of both the bikini and the burkini, \u201cpeople in positions of power say, \u2018We\u2019re putting these rules in place for the woman\u2019s good,\u2019\u201d said Deirdre Clemente, a history professor at the University of Nevada who has studied dress codes for women. \u201cThe implication is that women are unable to regulate their appearance themselves. \u201d As recently as the 1980s, a number of large American corporations had extensive dress codes for women. \u201cThere would be four pages on what a woman could wear to work, and four sentences for men,\u201d Professor Clemente said. When it came to the bikini, not only was it forbidden in some countries, with women forced to pay fines and leave many beaches if they wore one. It was also seen as subversive and a sign of moral weakness. Italy, Spain and some beaches on the Atlantic coast of France prohibited wearing the swimsuit in the first few years after it went on the market, said Ghislaine Rayer, a   of \u201cBikini: La L\u00e9gende,\u201d a history of the  . That prohibition resonates in today\u2019s burkini debate, said Hanane Karimi, a graduate student of sociology at the University of Strasbourg. She is the leader of a feminist Muslim collective that wants mosques in France to make more space for women at prayers and to be more respectful of their involvement in religious affairs. \u201cIn some countries that had strong religiosity, like Italy, controlling women\u2019s bodies was a part of the country\u2019s religious morality today in France there is a civil religion of secularity,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it has the exact same logic in respect to the control of women\u2019s bodies: Those women who adhere to that secular morality are undressed on the beaches nothing is hidden. \u201d Today the French seem to believe as strongly that such undress is mandatory as Italy, under the Vatican\u2019s influence, felt it was necessary to hide women\u2019s bodies, she added. It was not always that way. When the designer of the first bikini, Louis R\u00e9ard, coined the name (a play on the tiny atoll of Bikini, where the United States had just tested the atomic bomb) and showed his new swimsuit at the Molitor Pool in Paris on July 5, 1946, he could not find models willing to wear it. So he hired   from the Paris Casino. \u201cIt was   it was ahead of its time,\u201d said Ms. Rayer, the   of the book on the bikini\u2019s history. \u201cIn that epoch, we were still puritan. \u201d Although the bikini quickly became popular in movies, it took more than 15 years, and longer in many places, to enter the fashion mainstream. France embraced it ahead of several other countries and eventually even allowed women to sunbathe or swim topless. Joan Wallach Scott, a social scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, sees France\u2019s approbation of revealing swimwear, as well as the current burkini bans, as products of ideas going back to the French Revolution of 1789. \u201cWhat you have in French republicanism is a conflict between a commitment to equality and the notion that sexual difference is a natural difference which explains why there can\u2019t be equality between women and men,\u201d she said. The French believe it is necessary to show the difference between men and women physically even while proclaiming their equality, Ms. Scott said. The painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix depicted \u201cLiberty\u201d as a   woman leading the righteous French. Sculptures and reliefs of a   or    Marianne, a French symbol of the revolution and liberty, can still be found on government documents, buildings and postal stamps. The very depiction of women reflects how the sexes differ. \u201cThen on the other side you have Muslim society saying that sex and sexual difference is a problem, and women, whether submitting or not, are covered. So in a sense they are exposing the contradiction in French society, and that\u2019s intolerable,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cIt becomes a commentary on the French need to have women uncovered. \u201d Indeed, the deputy mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who is a political power broker on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, has repeatedly referred to the covering of women on the beach  \u2014   whether in a burkini or a large   pants and hijab  \u2014   as a \u201cprovocation,\u201d suggesting a challenge to the French order. Such language mystifies one of the burkini\u2019s designers, who sells her pieces in France. Vanessa Louren\u00e7o, the designer, said she had started creating them to give Muslim women a chance to participate in the same activities as the rest of the community. She loves to swim herself, she said, so seeing religious Muslims or other people not go swimming \u201cstruck me as unacceptable. \u201d Ms. Louren\u00e7o, whose internet business sells swimwear in 120 countries, is not Muslim, and people often ask her why she designs for Muslim women. \u201cMy answer is simple: At the end of the day women are women, whether Muslim or not, and we all want to be comfortable, look beautiful and feel feminine,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of our clients message us saying it is the first time that they were confident enough to be at a public beach enjoying themselves with their family. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564357.8291757}
