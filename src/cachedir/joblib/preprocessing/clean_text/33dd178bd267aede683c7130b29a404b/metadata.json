During an interview broadcast on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cFox  Friends\u201d on the Fox News Channel, President Trump denied that he had softened his stance on China with regards to trade and China being a currency manipulator.  Trump said, \u201cI didn\u2019t soften my stance.   \u2026     Now, what am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea? So, I\u2019m dealing with China with great respect. I have great respect for him. We\u2019ll see what he can do. Now, maybe he won\u2019t be able to help. That\u2019s possible. I think he\u2019s trying, but maybe he won\u2019t be able to help. \u201d He added, \u201cWhat am I going to do, in the middle of him talking with North Korea, I\u2019m going to hit them with currency manipulation? This is the fake media that just does a number.   \u2026     I haven\u2019t changed my stance. China\u2019s trying to help us. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be able to or not. But, would I want to start heavy, heavy trade or currency statements against somebody that\u2019s out there right now trying to stop what could be a very bad situation?\u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628359.59846}
