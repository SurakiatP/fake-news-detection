Peter Roskam told Chicago\u2019s   that he supported the American Health Care Act crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) as a necessary fix of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. [\u201cIt was an improvement as to where we are now,\u201d he said told the station.  There is a restlessness among the people in his district about Obamacare and what will be done with it, he said. The congressman said during the   battle over the Ryancare bill, he heard from constituents who have been hurt by Obamacare and people helped by Obamacare. In the final bill, Roskam said he received assurances in writing that Illinois would not lose Medicaid protections. He said he was comfortable with concessions given to the House Freedom Caucus, including modifying the Essential Health Benefits  \u2014   those items required for all policies  \u2014   so that the EHB\u2019s were determined the states. \u201cMy view was that on balance, this bill was a step forward,\u201d he said. \u201cFriday was a big disappointment because the bill got pulled, because there was not a lot of support for it so moving forward, there was this notion that this was the healthcare debate,      and I don\u2019t believe that is true for a second,\u201d he said. One of the reasons the bill did not pass was that the speaker crafted the bill to meet the requirements of the Senate\u2019s rules governing budget bills, he said. \u201cIt is so complicated and so difficult to understand that nobody even hardly understands what you are talking about,\u201d Roskam said. \u201cThe better move in the past would have been to pass out of the House \u2014  even though it\u2019s not going to move in the Senate \u2014  the actual proposal \u2014  what is it you are for? Not with limitations, what are the aspirations?\u201d Roskam said he is convinced that in the coming weeks, there will be a serious move to reengage the House Republicans about reforming national healthcare policy. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here,\u201d he said. The next move should be to go back to the two things every American agreed about when President Barack Obama first started the Obamacare debate, he said. First, health care is too expensive and many of the cost drivers are not making us any healthier, he said. Second, it bothered everyone that Americans with   conditions did not have access to insurance coverage. \u201cIf the Obama administration had focused on those two core things, we would be having a very different conversation about health care today,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561743.020575}
