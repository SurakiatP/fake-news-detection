For months now, reporters have noted that Ms. Trump, who grew up in the small Slovenian town of Sevnica, did not obtain an undergraduate degree in architecture from the University of Ljubljana, as her professional website claimed she did. Instead, she left after her first year to pursue a modeling career in Milan. As recently as a week ago, Ms. Trump\u2019s website stated that she had obtained a degree before going on to become a philanthropist and skin care entrepreneur. On Wednesday, The Huffington Post noticed that the site had been entirely scrubbed of its content. People clicking on its address are now redirected to the Trump Organization\u2019s website. In a Twitter post, Ms. Trump said the website had been removed \u201cbecause it does not accurately reflect my current business and professional interests. \u201d Last week, Ms. Trump\u2019s speech at the Republican National Convention contained a few lines from Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention in 2008. The Trump campaign initially denied that she had plagiarized the lines. Eventually a Trump employee who had helped write the speech, Meredith McIver, acknowledged using Ms. Obama\u2019s lines and apologized, saying it was unintentional.'"}, "time": 1742563855.8138268}
