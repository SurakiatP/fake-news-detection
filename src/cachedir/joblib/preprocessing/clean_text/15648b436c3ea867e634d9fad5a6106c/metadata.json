Such talk, he said, emanated from \u201cfringe websites\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d \\nThe Hillary speech was made to a Brazilian bank known as Ita\u00fa BBA, which describes itself as \u201cLatin America\u2019s largest Corporate & Investment Bank\u201d and part of the Ita\u00fa Unibanco group, \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest financial conglomerates.\u201d \\nThe problem for Taylor and other faux journalists is that there is a whole body of research on the topic of a \u201c North American Law Project ,\u201d designed to integrate the legal systems of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The project is run out of American University\u2019s Center for North American Studies, where students can concentrate in North American Studies . As a matter of fact, such degrees are being offered by several different colleges and universities, including Canada\u2019s McGill University . \\nPassed in 1993, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, began the process of harmonizing laws among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But the Council on Foreign Relations admits that the U.S.-Mexico trade balance swung from a $1.7 billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $54 billion deficit by 2014. This has led to a loss of about 600,000 jobs. \\nIn addition to shipping jobs to Mexico, NAFTA constituted subversion of our constitutional system. President Clinton submitted NAFTA as an agreement, requiring only a majority of votes in both Houses of Congress for passage, and not a treaty, which would have required a two-thirds vote in favor in the Senate. NAFTA passed by votes of 234-200 in the House and 61-38 in the Senate. \\nA money crash soon followed in 1995 as Mexico was hit by a peso crisis, and a U.S. bailout was arranged. Congress would not bail out Mexico, so Clinton arranged for loans and guarantees to Mexico totaling almost $40 billion through the International Monetary Fund and the \u201cExchange Stabilization Fund.\u201d \\nMeanwhile, pressure has been building for the creation of a \u201cNorth American Community\u201d\u2014also known as a \u201cNorth American Union\u201d\u2014with regular meetings involving the leaders of the three countries. On June 29, 2016, the Obama White House issued a fact sheet on this year\u2019s \u201cNorth American Leaders\u2019 Summit.\u201d It said, \u201cThe economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are deeply integrated. Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners. Our trade with them exceeds $1.2 trillion dollars annually.\u201d \\nThe leaders of these countries agreed to establish a \u201cNorth American Caucus\u201d to \u201cmore effectively work in concert on regional and global issues by holding semi-annual coordination meetings among our foreign ministries.\u201d One item on the agenda was for the leaders to reaffirm \u201cNorth America\u2019s strong support for [Colombian] President Santos\u2019s efforts to finalize a peace accord with the FARC guerrillas.\u201d That fell apart on October 2 when a \u201cpeace deal\u201d with the communist terrorists was voted down by the people of Colombia. \\nBut notice how these leaders claim to speak for \u201cNorth America.\u201d \\nGoing global, they also declared, \u201cNorth America is committed to joint and coordinated actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.\u201d \\nThis is U.N.-speak for global taxes and other forms of foreign aid from the U.S. to the rest of the world. \\nWe noted in a column last year that the American people, through their elected representatives, have had absolutely no input in developing the new global agenda that President Obama has tried to implement without the input or approval of Congress. \\nInterestingly, one of those deeply involved in this global agenda, as we noted at the time, was John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign who previously served as counselor to Obama. Podesta\u2019s emails are at the center of the WikiLeaks disclosures about the operations of the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic Party. \\nPodesta, founder of the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress and a member of the elitist Trilateral Commission , went to work for Obama as a senior policy consultant on climate change. A liberal Catholic, he has been a professor at Georgetown Law School. One of the leaked emails shows Podesta saying that he applauds the work of Pope Francis on climate change and that \u201call my Jesuit friends say the Pope is the real deal.\u201d \\nPodesta was picked by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to be a member of the \u201chigh-level panel\u201d of \u201ceminent persons\u201d planning the future of the globe. This so-called \u201cHigh Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda\u201d released an 81-page report titled, \u201cA New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development.\u201d \\n\u201cIn simplest terms,\u201d explains Patrick Wood, author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation , \u201cSustainable Development is a replacement economic system for capitalism and free enterprise. It is a system based on resource allocation and usage rather than on supply and demand and free economic market forces.\u201d \\nIn this context, Wood argues that the major significance of the transfer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is not the immediate need by the U.N. or some countries to censor websites, but to generate revenue for global purposes. ICANN will do this, he argues, through management of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the links between the Internet and networks, electronic devices and embedded technology with IP addresses. \u201cIoT are the connections between inanimate objects and the humans that depend upon them,\u201d he notes. To accomplish this, ICANN has devised a new IP numbering system called IPV6, described as the \u201c vital expansion \u201d of the Internet. \\n\u201cIn terms of \u2018follow the money,\u2019 IoT is expected to generate upwards of $3 trillion by 2025 and is growing at a rate of at least 30 percent per year,\u201d Wood argues . \u201cIn other words, it is a huge market and money is flying everywhere. If the UN can figure out a way to tax this market, and they will, it will provide a windfall of income and perhaps enough to make it self-perpetuating.\u201d \\nHe adds, \u201cCongress never understood this when they passively let Obama fail to renew our contract with ICANN. However, Obama and his globalist handlers understood it perfectly well, which makes the deception and treachery of it even worse.\u201d \\nUnder the cover of \u201csustainable development,\u201d Wood predicts the Internet will be used to construct a massive database on human activities, in order to monitor and control nations\u2019 and peoples\u2019 access to resources. It will constitute ultimate socialist control and a form of \u201cdigital slavery,\u201d from which he warns there may be no return. \\nCliff Kincaid is the Director of the AIM Center for Investigative Journalism and can be contacted at cliff.kincaid@aim.org.
