Emanuel said, \u201c2016, now Democrats are in the lowest level since 1928 in the House of Representatives and the lowest level since 1925 in the state houses. Not really good. \u201d adding,\u201dIt is hard to image it getting lower. \u201d He explained \u201cYou got to go out and create a farm team. In \u201906 and \u201908 everybody goes, \u2018Oh that\u2019s when we took back the House.\u2019 You know I got a lot of crap for recruiting Iraq War vets, football players, sheriffs, business people. I said well they are running in Republican districts. I wanted to take cultural issues off the table and I wanted to present economic issues. We as Democrats like to walk around ideally  \u2014    No you got to be ruthless enough. We recruited people who matched the district. If you\u2019re running in a Republican district, you got to get at somebody who can win in a Republican district. Winning is everything. You don\u2019t win, you can\u2019t make the public policy. I say that because it is hard for people in our party to accept that principle. Sometimes you just got to win. Okay? Our party likes to be right even if they lose. \u201d He continued, \u201cDemocrats love doing a fire squad in a circle. Stop that. Don\u2019t attack, they are too moderate. Forget about it. Stop it. This guy and these people are about to do something on the tax code, the regulatory environment and things that are more threatening than what a fellow Democrat might slightly disagree with you on. Stop it. We\u2019re not strong enough to do that. \u201d He added, \u201cIt took us a long time to get this low. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in 2018. Take a chill pill, man. You gotta be in this for the long haul. And if you think it\u2019s going to be a quick turn around like that, it\u2019s not. \u201d (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561933.387972}
