But on Sunday, in the latest blow to the integrity of the government\u2019s case, an international panel of experts who began examining the disappearances a year ago asserted that five suspects whose testimony underpinned the government\u2019s conclusions gave confessions \u201cunder torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. \u201d Forced confessions are not admissible in Mexican courts. The findings not only undermined the government\u2019s case but also further eroded the credibility of the nation\u2019s criminal justice system. The system has been widely criticized for its handling of a matter that has come to represent the failures and corruption of the Mexican state. \u201cThe Ayotzinapa case has put the country at a crossroads, from which it has yet to emerge, and for that it needs a strengthening of the rule of law and of the defense, the guarantee and respect for human rights,\u201d Alejandro Valencia, a Colombian lawyer and a member of the   panel, said at a news conference here on Sunday. The government\u2019s response to the students\u2019 disappearance in September 2014 has become a referendum on the administration of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who took office in 2012 promising to reduce violence. The case set off months of street protests and demands that the government solve the mystery and end chronic corruption. The panel of experts, who were invited by the Mexican government to examine the case, revealed its findings in the news conference and in a voluminous report  \u2014   its second and last. The mandate of the group, which was appointed by the   Commission on Human Rights and is made up of Latin American lawyers and human rights activists, expires next week, and the Mexican authorities have said they will not extend it. Beginning with their first report, in September, the experts have systematically dismantled the government\u2019s conclusions, questioning the authorities\u2019 ability or commitment to thoroughly investigate the disappearances and raising doubts about the integrity of the judicial system. The panel \u201chas not a single piece of evidence to change its conclusion that the 43 students were not incinerated\u201d in the dump, Francisco Cox, a Chilean lawyer and one of the experts, said at the news conference. The government announced in January 2015 that it had solved the mystery after what Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam, then the attorney general, called an \u201cexhaustive, serious\u201d inquiry. Mr. Murillo said the students, who attended a teachers college in Ayotzinapa in the Pacific state of Guerrero, had traveled to Iguala to commandeer buses for transportation to a protest in Mexico City. According to the government\u2019s version of events, Iguala\u2019s mayor ordered the police to detain the students. The government\u2019s account, which relied on the testimony of several members of a drug gang, said the police had then turned the students over to the gang, which killed them, incinerated their bodies in a dump near Cocula and threw the remains in a river. In recent months, a team of experts on torture, working with the international investigative panel, examined evidence gathered by the Mexican authorities. Using United Nations guidelines for the documentation of torture, the technicians determined that 17 of the government\u2019s suspects had been tortured, including five gang members who claimed to have been involved in the killing and burning of the students. The findings supported testimony by some of the suspects that they had been tortured while in the custody of government security forces. The experts also raised urgent questions about the way the Mexican authorities had gathered and handled evidence in the case, especially a bone fragment found in October 2014 that was linked to one of the missing students. \u201cThis is a serious problem that needs to be investigated,\u201d said Carlos Beristain, a Spanish doctor and a panel member. Among their other findings in their   report, the experts said they had uncovered new evidence that pointed to a greater role by federal security forces in the events of Sept.   2014, despite the Mexican authorities\u2019 insistence that the crimes committed that night were local in nature. The experts also lamented the lack of investigation into the possible culpability of all but   officials. \u201cYou must look for not only the direct authors of an action but also for those who led, supported or ignored the signs of human rights violations,\u201d the panel wrote. The panel also raised questions about why the government\u2019s investigation had failed to analyze phone records from that night, which might have shed light on where the students had been taken. The experts reiterated their longstanding criticism that the Mexican government had blocked their access to crucial witnesses, including all military officials, and did not allow them to reinterview scores of witnesses. Requests for certain documents and testimonies were ignored or rebuffed, they said. Eber Omar Betanzos, the deputy attorney general for human rights, responded to the experts\u2019 report by rebutting many of their specific arguments and said the torture allegations were being investigated. The government had given the experts \u201cfull access to the information needed to develop their work\u201d and had answered 85 percent of their 941 requests, he said, adding that the remaining 15 percent were close to completion. The experts also criticized sclerotic bureaucracy. They held up the matter of Julio C\u00e9sar Mondrag\u00f3n, one of the students who had gone to Iguala. He had become separated from his friends during the chaos of the night, and his body turned up the next morning in Iguala. He had been so brutally tortured that he was not immediately identifiable. The first autopsy on the body was incomplete, the experts said, so they requested a second one. Even though they pushed the request, the Mexican authorities took three months to approve a second autopsy. In their latest report, the experts likened the agonizing wait by the student\u2019s family to \u201ca new victimization\u201d that arises \u201cwhen bureaucracy or formal aspects are more important than the victims. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563665.829691}
