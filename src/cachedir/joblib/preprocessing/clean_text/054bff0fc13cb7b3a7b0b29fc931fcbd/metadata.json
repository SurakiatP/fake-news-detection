In fact, she told news outlets that she had been explicitly instructed not to do so. But in fashion, nothing stays secret for long. The man behind the brand is Peter Dubens, 50, the   and managing partner of Oakley Capital Private Equity, a midmarket company based in London that oversees assets of more than $1. 7 billion. He is considered one of Britain\u2019s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, and has his hand in such buzzy properties as KX gym in Sloane Square, where Madonna and Daniel Craig are rumored to be clients, and the   Mark\u2019s Club in Mayfair. But he is rarely mentioned by the media. In fact, he claims to employ a public relations firm to get him out of interviews. In photographs, he almost invariably appears in a white or blue   shirt and suit jacket,   and   with a thick head of dark, graying hair. Friends and associates describe him as \u201ca big character\u201d and \u201ca family man\u201d who is \u201cobsessed with his boat,\u201d \u201calways on a diet\u201d and \u201cmad about tennis. \u201d He is not, in other words, your typical fashion investor. So how did a man more known for telecommunications than style trends end up backing the namesake label of one of Britain\u2019s most   women? Mr. Dubens is evasive about his background when reached by phone, offering, when pressed, that he grew up in the London neighborhood of Chelsea, where he still lives, and that he attended a \u201cJewish school. \u201d (The Jewish Free School in north London, it turns out.) Mr. Dubens skipped college, instead taking a job driving a British billionaire, Joseph C. Lewis, around London and the Bahamas, and then, \u201cwith no experience at all,\u201d going into business with Jonathan Sieff, a Marks  Spencer\u2019s heir, selling novelty   that changed color when exposed to heat. Five years later, when Mr. Dubens was just 25, they sold the company for 8 million pounds (nearly $10 million at current exchange rates) to Coats Viyella, the clothing, furnishing and threads group. A string of successes followed, spanning online gambling (he took in \u00a37. 5 million on the sale of 365 Media in 2006) to telecoms (Oakley Capital was involved in Pipex Communications, which sold for \u00a3330 million in 2007). \u201cAs you can tell from my background, I\u2019m a bit unorthodox, and I\u2019m passionate about backing young and new entrepreneurs,\u201d he said, noting that the draw was not about investing in \u201cluxury or glamorous brands. \u201d Still, in addition to Ms. Chung\u2019s fledging business, he has invested personally and through his venture capital fund, Pembroke VCT, in Bella Freud\u2019s fashion label, known for its graphic cashmere sweaters as well as the genealogy of its founder (she is the daughter of the artist Lucian Freud and   of Sigmund Freud). The hidden link tying Mr. Dubens, Ms. Freud and Ms. Chung? That would be Laura Bailey, a model and British Vogue contributor. While vacationing in St.  several years ago, Mr. Dubens met Ms. Bailey and they developed what she describes as a \u201cformalized friendship\u201d she introduced him first to Ms. Freud and later to Ms. Chung. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very big feel for talent and marketing and potential,\u201d she said, adding that he gives the designers \u201creal freedom\u201d in letting them run their businesses. \u201cThat\u2019s a plus. I think the danger in these kinds of relationships is too many cooks. \u201d Ms. Freud said: \u201cHe\u2019s not one of those vanity people who want to be the big cheese. He is a big cheese, but he just seems to have quite a lot of fun sailing his yacht around and stuff. \u201cA lot of those kind of people who are money people, they are quite controlling and bullying,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Flares are coming back in, why don\u2019t you do those?\u2019 \u201d Edwin Bodson, the head of atelier at Haider Ackermann, who moved to London to become managing director of Alexa Chung in April, said: \u201cWhat I have learned from Peter is that time has to be treated with discipline. No real problem needs more than 15 minutes of attention if it is well analyzed. \u201d This May, Ms. Chung\u2019s first collection will arrive at stores, including Bergdorf Goodman in New York and MatchesFashion in London. It will be priced according to what Mr. Bodson described as the \u201chigh contemporary\u201d category, from $100 to $120 for a   and $800 to $1, 500 for a sequined dress or jacket. The pieces will be, he said, \u201cclose to what people expect\u201d  \u2014   that is, garments in line with Ms. Chung\u2019s signature style. So anticipate a tea dress or two, some constructed jackets and a helping of skinny denim. To coincide with the introduction, Ms. Chung will host an event that Mr. Bodson described as a kind of fashion show, but not restricted to industry members and media. Before other young fashion designers get too excited, however, Mr. Dubens said he had no plans to invest in more apparel brands. \u201cI don\u2019t personally make investments in smaller companies any more,\u201d he said. \u201cAlexa is my last one. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563963.0646055}
