[54 percent of the nearly 8, 500 college students surveyed claimed that their online accounts were \u201csomewhat true of me,\u201d while 25 percent claimed their accounts were \u201cmostly true of me,\u201d and 15 percent claimed they were \u201cnot true of me at all. \u201d  \u201cWhile not entirely surprising, the fact that only six percent of millennials said their social media accounts portrayed their lives completely truthfully confirms a long standing belief,\u201d wrote LendEDU in their report. \u201cAnything posted on social media should be taken with a grain of salt, because with a little cleverness and craftiness, a social media post can completely distort reality. \u201d \u201cThe interesting thing about this poll was that millennials were admitting to their own   on social media,\u201d they continued, adding that \u201cThe 15 percent that said their social media was \u2018not true of me at all\u2019 know that they are totally fabricating their lives and have not only accepted it, but are are seemingly fine with it. \u201d \u201cRemember, the next time you see someone post an awesome looking picture on Instagram or Facebook do not get jealous, but temper your reaction,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cThere is a 94 percent chance that poster is either completely lying or stretching the truth. \u201d In a previous survey of 3, 701 students by LendEDU, Instagram was rated the most narcissistic social media platform. 65 percent of those surveyed placed Instagram at number one on the list, followed by Snapchat at 15 percent, Twitter at 11 percent, and Facebook at 10 percent. \u201cFor most of this demographic, social media is a powerful tool with the ability to create an entirely new persona, void of reality,\u201d claimed LendEDU in their previous report. \u201cThe formula is quite simple. If you post enough artsy, chic pictures of yourself that rack up plenty of \u2018likes,\u2019 then real life accomplishments will not matter because the popularity of your social media accounts will determine your status on the social hierarchy. \u201d \u201cThis is especially true with Instagram, where \u2018likes\u2019 are the main way of interacting with pictures and videos that are posted by users,\u201d they concluded, adding that \u201cThe large majority of Instagram users have formed unspoken alliances with each other to ensure they each tally enough \u2018likes\u2019 to make their posts stand out. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
