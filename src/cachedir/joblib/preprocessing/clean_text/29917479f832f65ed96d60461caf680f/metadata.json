Judge Jeanine called Clinton a \u201closer\u201d and told her to go back into hiding. \u201cHillary, snap out of it,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of going through this with you. You\u2019re a   loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate, you didn\u2019t have a message, you lied every time you opened your mouth you didn\u2019t know what states to campaign in, you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup, you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity, four men died under your watch as you lied about a video, and there [were] a billion dollars missing from the State Department when you left. And I could go on and on, but I just don\u2019t have the time. So, stop with the poor me nonsense. We\u2019ve had it with you Clintons always claiming victimhood. The two of you haven\u2019t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in Arkansas. \u201d She later warned, \u201cBe careful, Hillary. Be very, very careful. You pulled the wool over Jim Comey\u2019s eyes once, and you actually got the president to say you\u2019re a nice lady. Don\u2019t be so sure you\u2019re going to get away with your new game, given your illegal,   and incompetent instincts. You\u2019re a loser, Hillary. Face it. Face it, and get back in the woods!\u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562409.1832645}
