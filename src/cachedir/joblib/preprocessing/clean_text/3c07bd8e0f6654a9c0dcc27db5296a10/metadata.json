[\u201cTrump is unpredictable and Arab leaders don\u2019t want to get on his bad side so soon,\u201d Dimitri Diliani, a former member of Fatah\u2019s Revolutionary Council, said, adding that \u201cArab leaders are waiting to see what will happen eventually and how exactly the embassy will be moved. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to foresee the reaction of the Palestinians on the street, but I expect it will be harsh,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Palestinian Authority must use whatever measure it has at its disposal  \u2014   from rolling back the security coordination with Israel, to disbanding the PA and turning its security officers into paramilitaries. The Palestinian Authority cannot react lightly. It\u2019s the moment of truth. \u201d \u201cJerusalem is not the capital of the State of Israel, it\u2019s an occupied territory,\u201d he wrongly claimed, \u201cand the question is whether the United States wishes to become a country that violates international law,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect the PA leadership to use whatever means it has at its disposal to resist that decision. \u201d Earlier this week, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer was asked by reporters for an update on the embassy matter. \u201cWe are at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject,\u201d Spicer said, according to Reuters. President Trump told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity on Thursday it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to discuss moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.'"}, "time": 1742563424.3011217}
