At a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations and the European Union, Steven Mnuchin, attending his first major international gathering as Treasury secretary, signaled that American policy would follow the campaign promises made by President Trump to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d and review existing trade agreements to seek better deals for the United States. As a result, the ministers\u2019 joint statement, normally a study in blandness, became an unlikely focus of controversy here. The representatives could agree only on a tortured compromise stating, in effect, that trade is a good thing. Adjectives like \u201copen\u201d were dropped, and the ministers omitted language used in previous communiqu\u00e9s that condemned protectionism, repudiating decades of free trade doctrine. For Asian and European officials, many of them meeting their Trump administration counterparts for the first time, it was a startling lesson in how Mr. Trump and his team are overturning   assumptions about international commerce. Mr. Mnuchin led off the ministers\u2019 meeting on Friday with a declaration that current trade rules were unfair to the United States, positioning the administration against virtually all the other participants, according to an official who attended the closed session and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. \u201cWe thought that it was very important for the communiqu\u00e9 to reflect what we discussed here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a news conference on Saturday. \u201cThe historical language was not relevant. \u201d At the insistence of the United States, the communiqu\u00e9 also dropped a pledge to observe the Paris accords on climate change. Mr. Mnuchin deflected questions on the issue, saying it was outside his purview. The American government\u2019s lack of reverence for existing norms and treaties is particularly unsettling to the   Europeans, who are coping with weak economic growth and a surge in populism. The last thing they need is a disruption in commerce with their biggest trading partner. Some complained privately that the American delegation rode into this stately spa and casino town, where Romans once bathed in the   waters, determined to shake up the existing order but without any clear idea of what should replace it. The disagreement over trade principles was a sharp contrast to the statement issued when the central bankers and finance ministers met in Chengdu, China, last July. \u201cWe underscore the role of open trade policies,\u201d the leaders said in the Chengdu communiqu\u00e9, which used the word \u201ctrade\u201d six times. They promised to \u201cresist all forms of protectionism. \u201d Less than a year ago, such a statement was not questioned. Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic still hoped for a trade pact between the United States and the European Union that would eliminate already low tariffs and harmonize regulations governing things like vehicle headlights. Since then, Mr. Trump has pulled out of the   Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama, vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, and criticized the German carmaker BMW for building a factory in Mexico. The best that the Group of 20 participants could come up with on Saturday was this: \u201cWe are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies. \u201d Mr. Mnuchin argued that the news media\u2019s focus on the language of the communiqu\u00e9 was overblown and said that the discussions in Baden Baden had been congenial. \u201cWe were incredibly productive,\u201d he said. But he also made it clear that the Trump administration had a vastly different view than its recent predecessors. \u201cWe believe in free trade,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cWe want to   certain agreements. \u201d \u201cBalanced trade has to be what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s good for other people,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt has to be a   situation. \u201d The communiqu\u00e9s issued at the end of Group of 20 summit meetings are meant to show that nations like Brazil, China, France and Japan can put aside competing interests and reach consensus, however vague, on major issues. The statements emerge from tortuous deliberations and are the opposite of impulsive. But even the usual boilerplate platitudes proved fraught at this summit meeting. For many European and Asian officials, meeting in a Belle \u00c9poch spa building with polished marble floors and chandeliers dangling from the ceiling, it was their first encounter with the Trump administration and its \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy. Some viewed the meetings as a chance to socialize with the new American representatives and to try to absorb them into the international order. Angel Gurr\u00eda, the   of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a participant in the meetings, said the chance to get to know Mr. Mnuchin was more important than any joint statement. \u201cWe want to make him feel comfortable we want to make him feel at home,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda told reporters. \u201cThese meetings are not about the communiqu\u00e9. \u201d In their public statements, European leaders played down the conflicts and said that the discussions had been amiable. The meetings in   came after Mr. Mnuchin visited Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, in Berlin. \u201cNaturally we have different points of view,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said at a news conference on Saturday in  . But he added, \u201cWe worked very hard for two days in a pleasant atmosphere. \u201d He also denied that the American delegation was at odds with other participants. \u201cThe Americans were not isolated,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said. Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose punitive taxes on imported goods are a particular worry for Germany, whose economy is built around exports of automobiles and industrial machinery. The United States is the biggest purchaser of German goods, buying 107 billion euros, or $115 billion, worth last year. Germany imported goods from the United States worth 58 billion euros. The trade imbalance has made Germany a target for Trump administration officials, who have accused Germany of manipulating the value of the euro and have said they want to renegotiate trade terms directly with Berlin, even though that task is done at a European level by Brussels. \u201cWe are going to look to our counterparts to continue to trade, but to look to have more balanced trade,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThat means over time reducing our trade deficits. I think we can do that in a way that\u2019s good for the American worker, that\u2019s good for our companies and that\u2019s good for our counterparties. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628360.294433}
