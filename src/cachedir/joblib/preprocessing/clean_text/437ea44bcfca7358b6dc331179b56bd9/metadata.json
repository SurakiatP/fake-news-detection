Roymar Bello screamed. She was one of 17 passengers who had climbed onto the overloaded fishing boat with aging motors in July, hoping to escape Venezuela\u2019s economic disaster for a new life on the Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao. Afraid of the authorities, the smuggler refused to land. Ms. Bello said he gruffly ordered her and the others into the water, pointing toward the distant shore. In the panic, she was tossed overboard, tumbling into the predawn blackness. But Ms. Bello could not swim. As she began to sink under the waves, a fellow migrant grabbed her by the hair and towed her toward the island. They washed up on a rocky cliff battered by waves. Bruised and bleeding, they climbed, praying for a lifeline: jobs, money, something to eat. \u201cIt was worth the risk,\u201d said Ms. Bello, 30, adding that Venezuelans like her \u201care going after one thing: food. \u201d Venezuela was once one of Latin America\u2019s richest countries, flush with oil wealth that attracted immigrants from places as varied as Europe and the Middle East. But after President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez vowed to break the country\u2019s economic elite and redistribute wealth to the poor, the rich and middle class fled to more welcoming countries in droves, creating what demographers describe as Venezuela\u2019s first diaspora. Now a second diaspora is underway  \u2014   much less wealthy and not nearly as welcome. Well over 150, 000 Venezuelans have fled the country in the last year alone, the highest in more than a decade, according to scholars studying the exodus. And as Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s   revolution collapses into economic ruin, as food and medicine slip further out of reach, the new migrants include the same impoverished people that Venezuela\u2019s policies were supposed to help. \u201cWe have seen a great acceleration,\u201d said Tom\u00e1s P\u00e1ez, a professor who studies immigration at the Central University of Venezuela. He says that as many as 200, 000 Venezuelans have left in the past 18 months, driven by how much harder it is to get food, work and medicine  \u2014   not to mention the crime that such scarcities have fueled. \u201cParents will say, \u2018I would rather say goodbye to my son in the airport than in the cemetery,\u2019 \u201d he said. Desperate Venezuelans are streaming across the Amazon Basin by the tens of thousands to reach Brazil. They are concocting elaborate scams to sneak through airports in Caribbean nations that once accepted them freely. When Venezuela opened its border with Colombia for just two days in July, 120, 000 people poured across, simply to buy food, officials said. An untold number stayed. But perhaps most startling are the Venezuelans now fleeing by sea, an image so symbolic of the perilous journeys to escape Cuba or Haiti  \u2014   but not   Venezuela. \u201cIt has all totally changed,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n de la Vega, a sociologist at Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University in Caracas. About 60 percent more Venezuelans fled the country this year than during the year before, he added. \u201cThe earnings of these people are low,\u201d Mr. de la Vega said of the recent migrants. \u201cThe only option left to them is the nearby countries, ones they can get to on foot, or by rafts, or go on boats with tiny motors. \u201d Inflation will hit nearly 500 percent this year and a   1, 600 percent next year, the International Monetary Fund estimates, shriveling salaries and creating a new class of poor Venezuelans who have abandoned professional careers for precarious lives abroad. \u201cVenezuelans like myself are coming to Brazil for a simple reason: It\u2019s easier to survive here,\u201d said Reinier Salazar, 30, an industrial engineer who moved to Brazil last year. Now he cooks at a   restaurant for about $400 a month  \u2014   much more than he made back home in Venezuela, he said. The exodus is unfolding so quickly that since 2015 about 30, 000 Venezuelans have moved to the border region that includes the Brazilian state of Roraima, officials say. Now the Brazilian Army is bolstering patrols along highways and rivers, bracing for even more arrivals. \u201cWe\u2019re at the start of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in this part of the Amazon,\u201d said Col. Edvaldo Amaral, the state\u2019s civil defense chief. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing Venezuelan lawyers working as supermarket cashiers, Venezuelan women resorting to prostitution, indigenous Venezuelans begging at traffic intersections. \u201d Some are paying smugglers more than $1, 000 a person to reach cities like Manaus and S\u00e3o Paulo, officials say, while others just manage to cross the border into Brazil. In Pacaraima, a small Brazilian border town, hundreds of Venezuelan children are now enrolled in local schools and entire families are sleeping on the streets of town. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a solution to this problem because hunger is involved,\u201d said the mayor, Altemir Campos. \u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t have enough food for its people, so some are coming here. \u201d The small Caribbean islands neighboring Venezuela are far less hospitable, saying they simply cannot absorb the onslaught. The closest to Venezuela\u2019s coast, Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, have effectively sealed their borders to poor Venezuelans since last year by making them show $1, 000 in cash before entering  \u2014   the equivalent of more than five years of earnings in a   job. Both countries have increased patrols and deportations, and Aruba has even set aside a stadium to hold as many as 500 Venezuelan migrants after they are caught, according to the authorities. It\u2019s a dramatic reversal of fortune for Venezuelans, who once went to Cura\u00e7ao to spend money as tourists, not to plead for work. \u201cThey all say, \u2018You are from Venezuela. You are from a rich country that has everything,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Bello said of her encounters on the island. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018No longer.\u2019 \u201d Empty homes now dot the streets of the fishing town of La Vela, Ms. Bello\u2019s hometown in Venezuela, their owners having set off by sea. They have mortgaged property, sold kitchen appliances and even borrowed money from the same smuggling rings that pack them on the floorboards alongside drugs and other contraband. The journey to Cura\u00e7ao takes them on a   crossing filled with backbreaking swells, gangs of armed boatmen and coast guard vessels looking to capture migrants and send them home. Then, after being tossed overboard and left to swim ashore, they hide in the bush to meet contacts who spirit them anew into the tourist economy of this Caribbean island. They clean the floors of restaurants, sell trinkets on the street, or even solicit Dutch tourists for sex, forced by the smugglers to pay for their passage by working in a brothel, the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao say. Countless families in Venezuela are like the Bellos now. Unable to scrounge together more than a meal a day, they are scattered across seas and borders. Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Rolando works construction in Cura\u00e7ao and his wife recently joined him, leaving their    daughter with relatives back home. An uncle of Ms. Bello\u2019s was not so lucky: He sits in a Cura\u00e7ao prison, accused of smuggling migrants like his relatives. Then there is Wilfredo Hidalgo, Ms. Bello\u2019s    cousin, who studied business administration in Venezuela but never found a job. Two years ago, he was deported from Cura\u00e7ao after coming by plane. Now he is trying to return by boat, having saved half of the $350 he needs to pay the smugglers. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he said. There is also Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Roger, whose    girlfriend, Yaisbel, is six months pregnant. He, too, said he would go to Cura\u00e7ao to support his child. Yaisbel said she would stay behind but take a loan from smugglers to pay for her boyfriend\u2019s journey, using her mother\u2019s house as collateral. Hopefully, she said, her mother would never find out. \u201cI am just watching her stomach,\u201d Roger Bello said. \u201cBefore the child is here, I will be in Cura\u00e7ao. \u201d And finally there is Ms. Bello\u2019s mother, Maria Pi\u00f1ero, who gave her a life vest just before she left, knowing that she could not swim. But the smuggler ripped it off Ms. Bello just before she was thrown into the sea, saying that the swells were so high she was better off swimming under the waves. Now, despite Ms. Bello\u2019s ordeal, her mother vowed to make the journey by boat, too. \u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m leaving with nothing. But I have to do this. Otherwise, we will just die here hungry. \u201d One evening at the end of September, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, 47, climbed aboard a boat in a small town on the country\u2019s northern coast. She dropped to her knees, praying to God that she would survive the journey and find a better life in Cura\u00e7ao. The other passengers, tears in their eyes, began to pray too, some joining hands in a circle on the beach. They muttered hopes that the coast guard would not catch them, that they were good people, that they were mothers and fathers. They waded   into the water, hoisting their few possessions overhead, and climbed into the boat. Its motor started and it steered toward the horizon. Even the smuggler seemed distraught at the misfortune bringing him profits. \u201cI would prefer that the crisis ended and my business was over,\u201d the smuggler said after they had left. \u201cI would prefer a thousand times that there was no crisis and we could live in the Venezuela from yesterday. \u201d Jes\u00fas Ramos knew he would have to swim ashore from the smuggler\u2019s boat. So he spent his last weeks in Venezuela doing laps in the sea in front of his home in La Vela, his mother recalls. His friend William Cordero, 29, went too. He spent that month applying for a business license for the salon he planned to open with all the money he expected to make in Cura\u00e7ao. He had already bought a sign. \u201cMy Faith In God Barbershop\u201d it said. But the boat carrying the men never made it. The two friends, along with three other migrants and a captain, vanished somewhere off the coast of Venezuela last year. No wreckage was found. The only evidence that their journey even occurred is a few selfies sent from their smartphones just before they departed. The men posed on the side of the skiff with big smiles. \u201cI try not to cry I tell myself, \u2018He\u2019s well, that\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201d said Florangel Amaya de Ramos, Mr. Ramos\u2019s mother. The plan had been a simple one: A   journey in a speedboat. If they were stopped by Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s coast guard, they would pose as tourists. And with their documents in plastic bags, they were ready to swim ashore, knowing that the smuggler wanted to make a quick getaway. Then they could find their contacts using cellphones tucked in empty rice porridge jars. Mr. Cordero already had a Cura\u00e7ao   chip. Two years before, he had boarded a plane to Cura\u00e7ao and worked illegally as a barber there, earning several thousand dollars that he sent to his wife and two children in La Vela. But in 2015, Mr. Cordero was deported. He returned to a new, grimmer Venezuela. Long lines for food were becoming startlingly common in La Vela and inflation hit triple digits. Even in big cities like Caracas and Maracaibo, staples like corn flour, the cornerstone of the Venezuelan diet, have become increasingly hard to find, while a growing black market for other goods has driven prices beyond the reach of many. In rural towns like La Vela, residents are even more squeezed, with fewer goods than large cities and a poorer population with less money to pay for them. Mr. Cordero tried to make the best of things by opening a barbershop on his sister\u2019s patio, wearing a white uniform like the one he wore in Cura\u00e7ao. But he earned only about 40 cents per haircut, compared with $35 or more per day in Cura\u00e7ao. The lure of the island grew more intense than ever. But the country had put the new visa restrictions on Venezuelans, and the door was shut behind him. The only way back was with a smuggler by boat. Mr. Ramos, Mr. Cordero\u2019s friend, knew a man who was collecting 200, 000 bolivars each, or about $200 at the time, to run a smuggling boat. Mr. Ramos, a lanky    had also been deported recently after working as a gardener in Cura\u00e7ao, but had not managed to find work back in Venezuela. Once the money ran out from his first trip, his wife and three children were spending many days hungry. The smuggler found two other men from the area, and a fifth migrant named Jessica M\u00e1rquez who had come from M\u00e9rida, a city nearly 400 miles away. The five waited anxiously in La Vela for several days as the smuggler got reports from other fishermen in Cura\u00e7ao about coast guard patrols, trying to decide which night would be safest to leave. Mr. Cordero\u2019s sister, Saribeth Cordero, recalled the group sitting in her brother\u2019s barber shop on her porch one afternoon as a movie played on the television about a shipwreck. \u201cWhat if there are sharks?\u201d asked Ms. M\u00e1rquez, Ms. Cordero recalled. \u201cYou can\u2019t be negative like that,\u201d Mr. Cordero said, his sister recalled. But she said her brother was scared too. \u201cHe was nervous about the ocean,\u201d Ms. Cordero said. The group finally headed off in good spirits. Mr. Ramos had sold his motorcycle to pay the smuggler, telling his mother he would not need it anymore. She packed him a waterproof bag with some meager belongings: soap, toothpaste, antibiotics and a few clothes. A van arrived and they left. That afternoon, they arrived at the rendezvous point with the smuggler, a town called Tucacas. They stayed the night in a hostel there. The motor of one of the boats had failed recently, something that worried Mr. Ramos when he wrote to a friend who had agreed to meet him in the jungle once he landed in Cura\u00e7ao. \u201cIt\u2019s O. K. man  \u2026     just relax, you\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d the friend wrote in Facebook message that Mr. Cordero forwarded to his mother. \u201cYes bro, tomorrow, God willing,\u201d Mr. Ramos wrote back. Mr. Cordero climbed aboard the boat and sent a selfie to his sister. He wore yellow board shorts and no shirt, making a peace sign with his hands. It was the last anyone heard from anyone in the group. The first to know something had gone wrong was Ms. Ramos. The friend in Cura\u00e7ao wrote over Facebook that he had waited all night but her son never arrived. \u201cI cried all night,\u201d she said. Questions haunt the families of the lost migrants each time they look out toward the sea. Could the men still be alive somehow? Will Venezuela ever return to the country that it was, one where it was not necessary to swim to the shore in Cura\u00e7ao after being tossed from a fishing boat? Ms. Ramos is still waiting for her son and speaks of him in the present tense. Each Sunday, she goes to Mass to pray for his return. \u201cI always speak to God,\u201d said Ms. Ramos. \u201cI am always looking up at that picture of the Virgin. I am scared one day she will yell back at me, \u2018Enough, already. That\u2019s enough. \u2019\u201d Rolando Bello sat on a pier in Cura\u00e7ao, worrying about his mother. It was September, a week before she stepped aboard a boat to join him in Cura\u00e7ao. He knew the dangers well, having made the journey twice himself. Last year, he says, Mr. Cordero and Mr. Ramos had approached him to join their doomed trip before they set off. \u201cI was this close to going,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see what would have happened to me. \u201d Now his family was being subjected to the dangerous whims of the passage once more. His mother\u2019s boat was getting ready to set off. His sister, who had been dragged ashore by her hair, had been caught by the Cura\u00e7ao authorities and deported back to Venezuela over the summer. Desperate to work, she had sneaked into Aruba instead, taking a loan from a smuggling ring to get there. But at least his wife was with him. She came to Cura\u00e7ao that month under a new scheme. Because she did not have the $1, 000 needed to pose as a Venezuelan tourist at customs, smugglers rented her the money to satisfy the new cash requirement, which is imposed only on Venezuelans. The smuggler\u2019s agents in Cura\u00e7ao then quickly approached her at the airport to take back the money  \u2014   and to collect the $100 rental fee. Mr. Bello\u2019s wife, Lennymar Ch\u00e1vez, sat next to her husband and the two ate a large lunch. A boat sailed past a row of colonial facades, and Venezuela felt a world away. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten an arepa for three months,\u201d she said, referring to the Venezuelan staple of corn flour, which has become increasingly hard to find at home. \u201cI ate one here in Cura\u00e7ao for the first time. \u201d They had left their    daughter in La Vela with relatives. Mr. Bello had trained to be an engineer in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. Now he was a construction day laborer, happily earning about $65 a day. Ms. Ch\u00e1vez trained to be a nurse, but held few hopes of working in her profession in Cura\u00e7ao. \u201cI don\u2019t mind cleaning now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe important thing is that I\u2019m working here. \u201d But the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao, like many tiny islands, fear the immigrants will undercut the local labor force or bring violent crime. \u201cMy preoccupation is what kind of people are entering Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d said Nelson Navarro, the island\u2019s justice minister who argued that the increase in Venezuelans coincided with a 15 percent rise in crime, particularly armed robberies. \u201cIn Venezuela, they don\u2019t hesitate to shoot a police officer, but here, this is news. \u201d Alex Rosaria, a legislator on the island, worries that the migrants will further strain Cura\u00e7ao, where unemployment is at 11 percent. \u201cWe have only a limited capacity to deal with refugees,\u201d Mr. Rosaria said. For now, the task has been left to the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Rob Jurriansen, a Dutch naval officer who heads operations in Cura\u00e7ao, says his small fleet intercepted only a tiny fraction of the migrants, perhaps just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants arriving in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao, the islands the fleet patrols. Now, he says, officials in the Netherlands, the former colonial power that is still formally tied to Cura\u00e7ao within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, fear they will also get stuck with the bill of caring for a migrant tide. \u201cThey want to prevent a situation like Libya,\u201d he said, referring to the much larger flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe. His station is close to Caracas Bay, now the landing point of many who flee Venezuela. Dense, thorny brush covers the island for miles in each direction, forming a maze through which the migrants wander as they enter Cura\u00e7ao. Far across the passage, the seas had calmed and Mr. Bello\u2019s mother was preparing for her second attempt. After nearly reaching the island in September, her boat turned back, fearing it was being pursued by the Coast Guard. It set out again on a clear October night at 9 p. m. Mr. Bello\u2019s mother, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, sent a message to relatives just before taking off. It had been a choppy ride on the first voyage, but this time the 13 passengers glided smoothly over the waves. But the flat ocean also meant they were visible when they arrived early the next morning, before dawn. Somewhere on shore, Coast Guard officials say they saw what they called a \u201cstrange blip\u201d on the water. Ms. Bello was the first in the family to learn what happened next, when a friend called at 6 a. m. \u201cGirl, they got your mother,\u201d the friend said. \u201cThey caught the boat with drugs. \u201d Ms. Bello didn\u2019t want to believe the news, but opened her computer to see what she could find online. Already, images were circulating of the passengers being apprehended by the authorities. Ms. Bello recognized her mother. \u201cYes, it was her with the red hair, the one covering her face so she could not be seen,\u201d she said of her mother. Ms. Bello\u2019s mother landed with a dozen other passengers in detention, she said in a brief telephone interview, watched over by guards. She sounded desperate and tired, her voice cracking. \u201cI thought that trying would be worth it, but in the end it wasn\u2019t, because I\u2019m headed back,\u201d she said, before the line clicked and she was gone. Her son Rolando Bello remains in Cura\u00e7ao with his wife, but his mother\u2019s capture casts a heavy shadow in the small home they share with another Venezuelan migrant family. The couple was trying to gather the money for Ms. Pi\u00f1ero\u2019s plane ticket back to Venezuela, which deportees are required to pay. They would send it through a third party to avoid being discovered themselves. One evening last month, Mr. Bello was alone, wondering if the promise of Cura\u00e7ao had been worth the damage to his family. \u201cOnly God knows the sacrifice one makes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut fine. This is life. \u201d Her daughter, Ms. Bello, was angry. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad because we hope we will arrive in one piece,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then suddenly, after a journey so long, they catch you. And just send you back to Venezuela. \u201d \u201cJust imagine the despair my mother is in,\u201d she added. \u201cShe has no money. Now she may have to sell her house. What a crazy thing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628394.8329482}
