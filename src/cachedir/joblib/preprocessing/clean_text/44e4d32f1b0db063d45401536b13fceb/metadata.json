A sixth grade teacher at the Academy of Excellence, a public charter school in Phoenix, allegedly said to a Muslim student: \u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist. I can\u2019t wait until Trump is elected. He\u2019s going to deport you all.\u201d The ACLU has since filed complaints with the Obama Departments of Justice and Education. ABC15 The American Civil Liberties Union says a Somali Muslim immigrant and his sister were expelled from a Phoenix school after a sixth grade teacher allegedly discriminated against him. The complaints were made against Academy of Excellence Charter School, a public charter school in Phoenix. According to a letter sent to both state agencies, the 11-year-old student allegedly was targeted by his sixth grade teacher multiple times during the 2015-2016 school year. The letter accuses the teacher of singling out the student because of his religion and/or nationality. On one occasion, the teacher allegedly showed a video about the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The teacher is accused of then telling the student \u201cThat\u2019s going to be you,\u201d suggesting that he was to become a terrorist himself, ACLU attorney Heather Weaver said. Earlier in the school year, the same teacher had refused to let A.A. pray during class one day , and is also accused of grabbing the student by his neck and choking him because he would not stop talking with his classmates\\u200a. The letter said that, during a separate incident in which the teacher was speaking about Donald Trump, she turned to the student and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until Trump is elected. He\u2019s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn\u2019t be given visas. They\u2019ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You\u2019re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.\u201d Because of the teacher\u2019s comments claimed by the ACLU, the student allegedly was teased by classmates on the bus ride home that day and was accused of plotting to blow up the bus, calling him a \u201cterrorist.\u201d She then allegedly threatened the student, saying \u201cIf you tell your mom (about the abuse), watch what happens next.\u201d The ACLU said that when the alleged victim\u2019s mom complained to the school, the school director sided with the teacher, stating that she had done nothing wrong. The student was accused of breaking school rules by opening an emergency window while riding on the bus. As a result, both he and his sister \u2013 a second grader at the same school \u2013 were expelled; effective immediately. The complaints against the teacher were\u2019t lodged until after the students\u2019 expulsion from the school. The Academy of Excellence Charter School is refuting the claims. They\u2019ve since released a statement regarding the situation, calling the allegations false. \u201cThe Academy of Excellence Charter School Governing Board and Administration (\u201cAOE\u201d) refutes the allegations contained in two letters from the ACLU. Those letters, both of which are dated October 28, 2016, are devoid of any evidence and contain false and unsubstantiated allegations. AOE conducted an internal investigation on January 25, 2016. That investigation produced no evidence to support the claims now being made . Additionally, these allegations were investigated by the Phoenix Police Department but at that time, her only complaint was that \u201cshe believed that her children were kicked out of our school due to their Muslim faith.\u201d AOE has many children who practice the Muslim faith. It was not until February 24, 2016, that the mother and her son made the allegation of \u2018choking.\u2019 This allegation was investigated by a Detective who found that, \u2018At the conclusion of the investigation, a crime in this matter was unfounded. Both suspect and witnesses provided corroborating statements, and were not consistent with the victims\u2019 statement.\u2019 This is the \u201ccursory and inadequate\u201d investigation the ACLU notes in the footnotes to its letters. Finally, if you compare the timing of events contained in the ACLU\u2019s letters and the statements made to the Police by the teacher and the student, they are completely different. The difference between the statements calls into question the motive of the plaintif. AOE\u2019s first contact from the ACLU sought a substantial monetary payment.\u201d (DING DING DING!
