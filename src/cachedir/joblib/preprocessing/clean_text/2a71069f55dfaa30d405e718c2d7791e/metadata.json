[Barghouti is serving five life terms plus 40 years for murdering several Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk during the Second Intifada, of which he was one of the architects.  Barghouti, who is a chief contender to succeed Mahmoud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority, penned the article to explain why he had launched a hunger strike among Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, claiming abuse by prison guards, including his own claim of being kicked in the genitals. The original article included a bio describing Barghouti only as \u201ca Palestinian leader and parliamentarian,\u201d conspicuously omitting his terrorist past. Following an outcry, the NYT amended the bio. Shmuel Landau, the father of    Ronen Landau, who was killed in a July 2001 roadside shooting attack near Jerusalem that was orchestrated by Barghouti, slammed the NYT for whitewashing Barghouti\u2019s past. \u201cI would show the [NYT editors] pictures of my late son, who can no longer speak out. Terrorists went out and murdered children on the orders of a   \u2018political leader,\u2019\u201d Landau told Hebrew news site nrg, adding that he would tell the NYT, \u201cThis is what happens when you present him as a \u2018freedom fighter. \u2019\u201d \u201cHe should not be given any concessions whatsoever,\u201d Landau said, referring to Barghouti\u2019s demands for improved prison conditions. \u201cHe is a terrorist leader. He is a murderer, but he acts as if he\u2019s the head of a workers\u2019 union. I don\u2019t think he needs any leniency. \u201d Shlomo Chen, who lost his wife and mother of his two children Yoela in a 2002 shooting attack near Jerusalem, said, \u201cI have nothing to say to [the New York Times]. \u201d \u201cThose who killed my wife will never be free,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t agree to it. \u201d Tzion Sviri, whose son Doron, daughter Sharon and    Yaniv   were killed  in a shooting attack in August 2001, said, \u201cEvery week I visit the graves of my murdered children   \u2026     my hope is that Barghouti sticks with the hunger strike until the end so that [someday] his children will have to visit the cemetery each week in order to speak to him. \u201d Sviri further blasted the suggestion that Barghouti should be released early. \u201cAnyone who speaks this way, none of them were hurt and none of them know the pain of a bereaved family. I\u2019d wish them this pain and then they\u2019d talk differently. \u201d The New York Times was roundly condemned by Jewish groups in the U. S. and by Israeli lawmakers, including, chiefly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that calling Barghouti a political leader is like calling Syrian President Bashar Assad a children\u2019s doctor. On Monday, MK Michael Oren, who also served as Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U. S. said that the incident merited the shuttering of the New York Times\u2019 Jerusalem bureau. \u201cIf someone in the paper helped him [smuggle the article out of prison] the New York Times should be held accountable,\u201d said Oren. Following the outcry, the Times later added the following editor\u2019s note to the oped: On Tuesday, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Barghouti may be prohibited from meeting with his lawyers if they are found to have helped smuggle his   to the the New York Times.'"}, "time": 1742628521.1732912}
