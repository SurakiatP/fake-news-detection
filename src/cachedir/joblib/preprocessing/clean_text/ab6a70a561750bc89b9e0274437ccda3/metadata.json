S. strategy in Afghanistan, according to a senior White House official. [On one side are the military strategists, who favor a robust U. S. military approach to resolving the    Afghanistan war  \u2014   hitting the Taliban harder and pressuring them back to the negotiating table. It would also include more spending on building the Afghan government\u2019s capacity, and entail more overall funding, troops, and resources.  On the other side are those who want to maintain the current level of troops but limit U. S. involvement in the war. That option would leave it up to the Afghan government and the Taliban to resolve the conflict, but assist the Afghan government with a minimal    mission, also known as \u201cforeign internal defense,\u201d and assist local partners in fighting extremist ideology. It would also include a counterterrorism presence to target   targets. It would take notably longer than the kinetic plan but would be significantly cheaper. \u201cWe don\u2019t fight other people\u2019s wars,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe help our friends fight their own wars for themselves. \u201d Earlier this week, details of the more kinetic option leaked to the Washington Post. It would consist of an addition of at least 3, 000 more U. S. troops, and be matched by an increase in NATO forces. It would also loosen military restrictions in fighting the Taliban, and allow the Pentagon, instead of the White House, to determine how many troops are needed and where. It would bring the current number of U. S. troops in Afghanistan to at least 11, 400. That plan has drawn support from defense hawks on Capitol Hill and the Republican foreign policy establishment in Washington. \u201cWe need to break what has been described by our commander there as a \u2018stalemate\u2019 which is, after 15 years or so, an unacceptable situation that requires a new strategy, one for victory,\u201d said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain ( ). But the plan has drawn skepticism from those inside the White House who favor winding down the U. S. presence and argue that more troops won\u2019t resolve the war. The Obama administration\u2019s 2009 \u201csurge\u201d sent 30, 000 troops to Afghanistan in order to pressure the Taliban to come to the negotiating table, but once the administration began to draw down the U. S. presence, the gains reversed. The Taliban now control areas with almost a third of the population. A poll last year showed a growing number of Americans who believed Afghanistan was a vital interest, but less than half surveyed supported staying another year. Three U. S. special operators were killed earlier this year in Afghanistan  \u2014   already a fourth of all forces killed last year. Reducing the U. S. presence in Afghanistan could jeopardize gains made in building the Afghan military and air force crucial to giving them an edge over Taliban forces, and could lead to an increase in Afghan troop casualties, which are already steep. But proponents of the less kinetic plan argue that it\u2019s not up to the U. S. to decide what Afghanistan looks like, and that the U. S.\u2019s interests are fighting terrorists and to prevent another   something that can be achieved with fewer forces. \u201cWhat Afghanistan looks like is not up to America,\u201d the official said. The U. S. has spent a total of $783 billion on the Afghanistan war between fiscal years 2001 to 2016, and the Obama administration had requested $43. 7 billion for fiscal year 2017, according to a Brown University study published in September. There are currently 8, 400 U. S. troops deployed on a   basis to Afghanistan and 4, 600 NATO forces. Trump now must decide what to do, caught between his competing instincts to spend less on overseas wars and empower his top military advisers. His previous public remarks do not provide much insight into how he will decide. At a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 8, he criticized the amount of spending on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cSo we\u2019re on track now to spend  \u2014   listen to this  \u2014   $6 trillion  \u2014   $6 trillion. Could have rebuilt our country twice,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of total disrepair. It\u2019s time to rebuild America. \u201d He also told the London Times in a January 16 interview: \u201cI just looked at Afghanistan and you look at the Taliban  \u2014   and you take a look at every, every year it\u2019s more, more, more  \u2026    and you say, you know  \u2014   what\u2019s going on? Afghanistan is, is not going well. \u201d However, he then said, \u201cNow in all fairness, we haven\u2019t let our people do what they\u2019re supposed to do  \u2026    we haven\u2019t let our military win. \u201d The White House is not offering any clues into how Trump will decide, although Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday said the U. S.\u2019s \u201cmain objective\u201d in Afghanistan is to prevent it from being used as a safe haven for terrorists who attack the homeland, and called it the mission \u201cgoing forward. \u201d \u201cThat is the main objective. We remain very focused on the defeat of al Qaeda, its associates, as well as the defeat of [Islamic State in Iraq and  ] which is the ISIS affiliate there in Afghanistan. But that is, simply put, what the mission is going forward. \u201d Trump is expected to make a decision before the next NATO summit in Brussels on May 25. In anticipation of a U. S. troop increase, NATO members have already been considering increasing their troop numbers also. McMaster, who was one of the architects of the Iraq war troop surge and headed an   task force in Afghanistan, is described as the \u201cdriving force behind\u201d the more kinetic strategy, according to the Washington Post. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also backs the plan, according to the Post. McMaster is also connected to masterminds of the surge, former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, and retired Army Lt. Gen. Jack Keane. Keane praised McMaster at a dinner Tuesday evening hosted by the Washington Institute. U. S. officials told the Post that increases in troop levels and support to the Afghan government would be \u201cheavily conditioned\u201d on the ability of the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to get rid of ineffective military commanders and reduce corruption. In an ominous sign, an Integrity Watch Afghanistan survey published in December said 71 percent of those surveyed felt corruption had worsened in the past two years. Proponents of the more kinetic plan have modest expectations for the enhanced military effort, according to the Post. The expectations are that Afghan forces would at best be able to \u201chold the line\u201d this year and begin to recapture some key terrain from the Taliban next year. Their goal is to make \u201cincremental progress\u201d in coming years in order to persuade the Taliban to make concessions that will lead to peace, according to the Post. Not all retired military brass are convinced of the more kinetic option. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin took to Twitter on Wednesday to express doubt over the plan. \u201cWe have been in #Afghanistan for 16yrs and have never had clear objectives  exit strategy.   these, this could cost the #president,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI do not want #America to spend any more good #soldiers or resources to #Afghanistan pursuing a losing strategy,\u201d he added. \u201cIf sent   defined objectives + appropriate ROE, I could be persuaded that this is a viable plan,\u201d he tweeted, referring to rules of engagement. \u201cRight now, I am not convinced. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563080.8017323}
