Add to the list a 56 year-old Michigan Man who is now facing felony weapons charges after holding six children \u2013 ages 12 to 14 \u2013 at gunpoint and forcing them to the ground for allegedly knocking down his Trump yard sign. \\nThat\u2019s right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. \\nMichael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had \u2018vandalized\u2019 his Trump sign, although he hadn\u2019t actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek \u201cpulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a neighbor\u2019s lawn.\u201d In any case, it appears that the \u2018vandalism\u2019 consisted in the sign simply being knocked down \u2013 perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind \u2013 and the children were reportedly \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the experience. \\nWhen police, who were called to the scene by Kubek\u2019s mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek \u201cstanding over them yelling and cursing.\u201d The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using \u201cvery profane language.\u201d According to local news channel Fox 2, \u201cthe kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them.\u201d \\nKubek claims he felt \u201cthreatened\u201d because he was \u201coutnumbered\u201d by the adolescents and invoked his second amendment right. Luckily, he was arrested by local police and had his gun confiscated \u2014 although he has now been released on a $5,000 bail. \\nJust another day in Trump\u2019s America, folks. Hopefully, the nightmare will be over soon\u2026'"}, "time": 1742563174.2561932}
