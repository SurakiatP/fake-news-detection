In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta\u2019s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik\u2019s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \\nThe post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. \\nThe exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign\u2019s \u201ccozy relationship\u201d with the Obama Justice Department, one former U.S. Attorney tells The Daily Caller.'"}, "time": 1742564480.310727}
