When people question your ability and purpose, you begin to make for the exit sign,\u201d Democracy confirmed. \\nDespite stating its intention to leave, Democracy is required to give at least 6-months notice, have a hand in training in its successor, All Out Chaos, and going through an awkward exit interview which will see it field questions from over 57 million people who didn\u2019t vote for this.'"}, "time": 1742628596.7399213}
