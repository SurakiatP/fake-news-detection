Rozeff https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/trumps-prospects-improve/ \\nTrump shares have gained sharply in the IEM prediction market, rising from under 10 cents to about 29 cents. Ordinary polls also are showing the race tightening. Clinton leads, but the suddenly much higher volatility of prices means that Trump\u2019s prospects have improved. \\nTrump released his contract with America 6 days ago. The biased media ignored it. \\nThe failures of Obamacare made headlines coincident with Trump\u2019s shares rising. \\nDonna Brazile\u2019s passing debate questions to Clinton is also coincident with Clinton falling and Trump rising. \\nThe continuous Wikileaks revelations about Clinton are also coincident with the Trump comeback. My guess is that a good many voters who (naively) respect the integrity of the FBI are dismayed as they learn how Clinton interfered with the investigation and how the FBI was corrupted. (These are voters, and there are many, who think J. Edgar Hoover is a hero and who have never heard of entrapment.) Others are bound to be affected by the huge sums of money handed over to the Clintons where quid pro quos are evident. Charitable giving cannot explain these transfers. Yet others who support the Second Amendment are being solidified against Clinton by revelations that she intends to use executive orders to get her way. \\nClinton and Trump have taken opposite positions on the integrity of America\u2019s voting methods. Trump\u2019s position has been helped by recent complaints of machines that switched votes from one candidate to the opposition. Clinton\u2019s position has been hurt by (a) her own manipulations during the Democratic primaries, and (b) her attempts to link Trump\u2019s position with the bogeyman Russians. \\nFurthermore, Clinton accused him of treason when she said \u201cWe also know from the former head of our Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, that the kinds of rhetoric and language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.\u201d Her extremism in this charge signals her fear of Trump\u2019s challenge. It could only cause Trump supporters to close ranks behind him and assure greater voter turnout for him. \\nClinton\u2019s many baseless charges and wild exaggerations show yet again her fondness for character assassination and attacks on anyone she perceives as an obstacle to her ambitions. 11:52 am on October 28, 2016'"}, "time": 1742561878.5507045}
