Here\u2019s the latest. 1. \u201cThe suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers. \u201d That was the Dallas police chief describing a verbal exchange with a sniper who killed these five officers and wounded seven people at a protest against police shootings late Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re hurting, our profession is hurting,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cThere are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city. \u201d _____ 2. The shooter was identified as an Army veteran, Micah Xavier Johnson, 25. He served as a mason and carpenter in Afghanistan. On Facebook, he \u201cliked\u201d a black power group, the African American Defense League, whose leader often calls for violence against the police. After an hourslong standoff in Dallas, the police killed him using an explosive delivered by robot. _____ 3. President Obama, in Warsaw, interrupted his final NATO summit meeting twice to comment on the violence in the U. S. Before the Dallas attack, he addressed the police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana, calling them \u201csymptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system. \u201d After the five officers were killed, he said there was \u201cno possible justification\u201d for such a \u201cvicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. \u201d Here\u2019s what we know about all three episodes, which have deepened the painful national divide over race. _____ 4. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump canceled campaign appearances and expressed concern for black citizens as well as solidarity with the police. Mrs. Clinton stressed pain and loss, while Mr. Trump issued a call for \u201claw and order. \u201d He also made his first public comments about the police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, calling them \u201csenseless tragic deaths\u201d that show \u201chow much needs to be done. \u201d But Texas\u2019 lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, called the Dallas protesters \u201chypocrites\u201d for expecting police protection from the sniper while objecting to police shootings. _____ 5. The Labor Department delivered some positive economic news. Its monthly report said U. S. employment surged in June, with an increase of 287, 000 jobs and an uptick in wages. \u201cWow, this one takes my breath away,\u201d an analyst in Chicago said. _____ 6. Roger Federer, above after a fall, lost his first Wimbledon   in a rough match that sent the Canadian Milos Raonic to his first Grand Slam final. He\u2019ll face Andy Murray on Sunday for the men\u2019s singles title (9 a. m. Eastern, ESPN). And Serena Williams faces Angelique Kerber, who beat her in January\u2019s Australian Open final, on Saturday in the women\u2019s singles final. (9 a. m. Eastern, ESPN). _____ 7. Britain\u2019s slow march away from the European Union has produced at least one point of clarity: The next prime minister will be a woman. The Conservative Party has narrowed its options to succeed David Cameron down to Theresa May, above right, the home secretary (already called \u201cThe Iron Mayden\u201d by tabs) and Andrea Leadsom, an energy minister, above left. But it will be months before the final choice is made. _____ 8.  In theaters this weekend: \u201cCaptain Fantastic. \u201d Our reviewer says that Viggo Mortensen\u2019s captivating survivalist is the main reason to see the film, which follows him and his family into the the outside world. But she also says the insistence of the director, Matt Ross, \u201con taking your intelligence for granted is itself a great turn on. \u201d And here are our experts\u2019 recommendations for streaming and TV this weekend. _____ 9. Finally, one of the fastest creatures in the ocean is the swordfish. Scientists think they have figured out why: A gland at the base of its sword secretes a   grease that coats its head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t ordinary fish slime,\u201d the lead author of a new study said.
