A Secret Service agent told the FBI that the Clintons also enlisted Secret Service resources to do work for the Clinton Foundation. A spokesman for the foundation denied using government resources They suggested that a Secret Service agent who recounted investigating a hack on the foundation\u2019s server must have confused it with Clinton\u2019s home-brew server. \\nIf the foundation spokesman\u2019s assertion is correct, it suggests information may have been stolen when the home-brew server was attacked, which Clinton has denied. \\nAs the FBI summarized the testimony of a Secret Service agent whose name was redacted, the agent \u201cwas assigned to the protective detail of William Clinton from [redacted] to [redacted]. Because of [his] information technology (IT) skills, he was asked to do network assessments and troubleshoot IT issues at the Clinton Foundation\u2026 [he] assisted the Clinton Foundation in a case related to theft of information on the Clinton Foundation information systems.\u201d \\nThe testimony was included among documents from the FBI\u2019s email investigation that were made public Wednesday by the law enforcement agency. \\nIn addition to protecting high-level officials, the Secret Service has a secondary mission that allows it to investigate cyber-crimes, as The Weekly Standard, which first reported the testimony, noted. \\nBut the Secret Service\u2019s cyber-crimes division hadn\u2019t decided to take the case, the former president had used the taxpayer-funded guard to do other tasks, including \u201ctroubleshooting IT issues,\u201d which doesn\u2019t indicate cyber-crimes. The agent was not a cyber-crimes specialist, but rather someone who happened to have some IT skills. \\nHe conducted \u201copen source research relating to the security of email servers,\u201d likely a euphemism for reading online forums and tutorials. \\nThe agent\u2019s testimony said the assistance started for the foundation, then was expanded to include another server located in the Clintons\u2019 home. The agent \u201cwas contacted by Justin Cooper in January 2011 to assist with the security of an email server at the Clinton residence in Chappaqua, New York.\u201d Cooper is an aide to Douglas Band, Clinton\u2019s long-time personal assistant and business associate. \\nThe agent \u201ccontacted Bryan Pagliano to recommend adding outbound IP filtering to the server.\u201d Pagliano, a Clinton campaign staffer turned State Department aide, has since pleaded the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer questions from congressional investigators. \\nThe Clinton Foundation told the Weekly Standard that \u201cit appears the agent is conflating the Clinton Foundation with the president\u2019s personal office,\u201d suggesting that the foundation was never hacked and that both instances must have referred to Bill Clinton\u2019s personal office email. \\nClinton\u2019s email and the former president\u2019s personal office both ran off the same email server, Clinton has said, adding \\n\u201cThe use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure.\u201d \\nThe FBI summary of the agent\u2019s testimony said the agent \u201cwas aware of no other information pertaining to the email server located in Chappaqua.\u201d \\nSecret Service sources interviewed by the Weekly Standard said the agency \u201cabsolutely\u201d worked on the \u201ctheft of information\u201d case for the Clinton Foundation and that records show it. \\nIf an intrusion did not occur on the foundation\u2019s server and the agent was confusing the home and foundation servers, then it suggests that Clinton\u2019s private server had a \u201ctheft of information\u201d situation. \\nClinton has combated criticism of the private server by saying it was safe because the Secret Service guarded the property \u2014\u201cIt was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches.\u201d The testimony, however, weakens that argument, as the testimony indicates that the Secret Service was providing traditional physical security, and one guard happened to have some IT familiarity. \\nFederal security had already been informed of the server\u2019s existence at least as early as November 2010. That month, IT aide Pagliano reported to the Secret Service 10 unsuccessful hack attempts on the server that Clinton used to conduct State Department business. \\nThe hackers had used the login \u201cHuma,\u201d the first name of Clinton\u2019s closest personal aide at the Department of State, according to emails obtained under a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch. \\nThe \u201ctheft of information\u201d situation does not seem to refer to that failed attempt, since the Secret Service was contacted about it in November 2010, but the testimony refers to being contacted about the personal server in January 2011. \\nPresident Barack Obama said in March 2015 he only learned of the server from the news media, even though as State Department aides frantically worried about after the denial, Clinton and Obama had emailed using the private address.
