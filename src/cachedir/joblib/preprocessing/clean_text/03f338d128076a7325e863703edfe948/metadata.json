We explore that question in the latest episode of The   with Claire McCaskill, the senior United States Senator from Missouri, and Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist who has written several books on women\u2019s history. What   combination of factors is required for a country to embrace a woman as its leader for the first time? Longtime public exposure? Proximity to power? Moderate politics? And how powerful, perhaps even necessary, is it that this first woman be the spouse of a former president? History offers a guide: The first female president of any country was Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n of Argentina, the wife of its former president. The first woman elected to the United States Senate, Hattie Wyatt Caraway, was the widow of a senator. And now the United States has the first woman candidate in the general election. \u201cGiven our history it\u2019s not surprising it\u2019s the wife of somebody who had the job first,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cSome day we\u2019ll have some really charismatic woman who gets people all excited, and it doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s only been in the senate for two years and that we don\u2019t know much about her except her story,\u201d Ms. Collins said. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential runs will have paved the way for that woman to have a shot. \u201cNo matter what happens in this election, one of the great contributions Hillary Clinton has made to American history is that she made it seem sort of normal to have a woman running for president in 2008,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cBefore then it had never been a normal thing. \u201d America is behind many other countries on that front, as Senator McCaskill pointed out. \u201cMany of us are painfully aware of how many countries around the world have elected and admired women executives in their government, and it is embarrassing to many of us that America has not taken that step,\u201d she said. \u201cThe irony is that everyone always would pat women on the head and say \u2018well you know as soon as a woman is qualified there will be a woman president,\u2019 \u201d Senator McCaskill said. \u201cNow we have a stark differential in qualifications, and now it seems to be all about her integrity and how likable she is. \u201d In the episode, we discuss the challenges of running against a woman with former Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, a man who discovered those pitfalls in a very public fashion. In 2000, he was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponent in the race for the United States Senate seat in New York. In a   debate moment, Mr. Lazio approached Mrs. Clinton\u2019s podium to ask her to sign a pledge, a tactic many saw as an overly aggressive male gesture toward a female rival. Mr. Lazio told us it was a mistake that he still regrets  \u2014   and one whose visual impact he underestimated in the moment. \u201cOur folks all thought we had won the debate hands down,\u201d he told us. But the next day, he saw that clip played over and over again and realized that the moment was going to stick. \u201cThe mistake that I made  \u2014   and it was a mistake  \u2014   was to create an optic where it looked like I was somebody other than who I was it looked like I was invading her space and was not chivalrous,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt was spun in the media and shown over and over again, and it looked like it was an overbearing male approaching a female. \u201d Please let us know what you think of The  .
