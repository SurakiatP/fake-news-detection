Trump. However much Trump\u2019s candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trump\u2019s reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded Trump supporters, the real instigators are the Koch brothers. \\nAlthough the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nation\u2019s political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. The tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A. Boehner out of Congress, morphed into the inaptly- named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isn\u2019t solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job, although that is high on the Trump supporters\u2019 to-do list. \\nAs noted in Wednesday\u2019s New York Times, \u201c Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress \u2014 a target many of them seem\u2026eager to take down .\u201d \\nThe right-wing extremist that actually \u201c took down \u201d former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat, issued a warning to establishment Republicans: \\n\u201c There\u2019s a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to D.C. Leadership comes and smacks our guy? That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to put down a marker? Really? And the American people are just scratching their head saying, \u2018Really? That\u2019s rich .\u2019\u201d \\nBrat has been a thorn in the establishment\u2019s side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of \u201c real conservatives \u201d who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton. \\nDonald Trump and a few of his \u201c senior aides \u201d are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump. In fact, besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump, it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy. And, during an interview with Reuters he complained that \u201c The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top .\u201d Win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a Herculean task to save the party. \\nThis impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. The chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. And \u201cuber-conservative\u201d is just a different way of saying a \u201c non-government \u201d according to the Koch brothers\u2019 vision of American libertarianism. Don\u2019t believe it? \\nTwo groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers, Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks , have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the party\u2019s decisions; something establishment types are resisting. \\nOver the past few days, leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the House; something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome. \\nAccording to the chief executive of Heritage Action, Michael Needham, there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they don\u2019t bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump. Mr. Needham said, \\n\u201c If the party doesn\u2019t learn lessons and change based on what\u2019s gone on for the last year and a half, I think it\u2019s going to be just catastrophe .\u201d \\nAnother conservative extremist, House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needham\u2019s sentiment and said, \u201c You can\u2019t ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle. \u201d \\nThe dilemma for Republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. That doesn\u2019t seem likely because if Trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trump\u2019s more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. If Trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans. \\nThe Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger. After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by Donald Trump, the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party.'"}, "time": 1742628606.6848931}
