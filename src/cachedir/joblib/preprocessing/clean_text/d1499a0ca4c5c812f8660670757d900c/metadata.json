Mexico, and Canada since 1994. But even his position now \u2014  that the treaty needs to be renegotiatedhas caused protests from our northern neighbor. [\u201cIt has been a bad week for U. S.  trade relations,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday:  Last Monday, it became apparent that Canada intends to effectively cut off the last dairy products being exported from the United States. Today, in a different matter, the Department of Commerce determined a need to impose countervailing duties of roughly one billion dollars on Canadian softwood lumber exports to us. This is not our idea of a properly functioning Free Trade Agreement. On Thursday Rep. Claudia Tenney ( ) and a group of 70 bipartisan House members sent a letter to the president urging him to hold Canada accountable for its current trade commitments to the U. S. especially the dairy industry. \u201cUntil recently, Canada used a   milk pricing system. However, in April, Canada revised its milk classification system, which has led to changes in the dairy market that have disproportionately hurt our farmers,\u201d a press release announcing the letter said. \u201cUnfair trade deals have disadvantaged American workers for far too long,\u201d Tenney said, noting the dairy farms in upstate New York have been especially hard hit. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we hold our trading partners accountable for their actions, especially in this case where the consequences equal lost jobs and closed farms. \u201cWhen given an even playing field, our famers can produce and sell the highest quality dairy in the world,\u201d Tenney said. \u201cI urge the administration to defend our dairy farmers and hold Canada accountable. \u201d Tenney also applauded President Trump\u2019s Executive Order signed earlier this week, directing the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to conduct a review to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations that have put undue burdens on farmers and rural communities. Former American Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman told Berns News Bureau that NAFTA renegotiations may have already started and that the U. S. should be \u201cforceful\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d in any reworking of the trade deal.'"}, "time": 1742564117.5788078}
