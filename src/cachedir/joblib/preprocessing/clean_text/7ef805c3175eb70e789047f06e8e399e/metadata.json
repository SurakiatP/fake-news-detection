Trump signed the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Improvement Act, a bill to help streamline benefits for disabled officers and the families of fallen officers. \u201cFor too long, injured officers have suffered, and the children of fallen officers have put their dreams of college on hold while bureaucracy delayed crucial benefits, made it impossible for their families,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo longer. It\u2019s unacceptable, and it\u2019s going to end today. \u201d Trump also signed the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, a bill allowing federal grants to help military veterans transition to careers in law enforcement. \u201cAmerica is proud of our veterans, and I think I can say a double proud or a triple proud,\u201d he said. Referring to his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, Trump joked that the two bills he signed Friday were \u201cslightly less controversial than yesterday. \u201d Several members of the law enforcement community joined Trump in the Diplomatic Reception Room for the signing ceremony, including representatives from the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association. Law enforcement officers from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Virginia were also present. \u201cWhen a home is threatened, when danger visits our doorstep, when innocent lives are on the line, Americans turn to their courageous officers of law enforcement because we know they are here to serve and to protect us all,\u201d Trump said, thanking them.'"}, "time": 1742562679.586304}
