The court on Thursday blocked Mr. Obama from moving ahead with his sweeping assertion of executive authority and will force him to leave office next year without the major progress he promised to millions of Latino immigrants living under the threat of deportation. But even as Republicans hailed what they called a major victory, Democrats said they believed the ruling would energize a nationwide voter registration drive intended to benefit Mrs. Clinton in her presidential campaign against Donald J. Trump. Within moments of the court\u2019s   order, Democratic activists vowed to mobilize, and a president whose face was etched with disappointment acknowledged the issue now rested with voters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a choice about who we\u2019re going to be as a country, what we want to teach our kids, and how we want to be represented in Congress, and in the White House,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters on Thursday morning. \u201cAmericans are going to have to make a decision about what we care about and who we are. \u201d The ruling could also serve as political ammunition for Mr. Trump, who has accused Mrs. Clinton of wanting to expand what the Republican presumptive nominee calls the president\u2019s illegal \u201camnesty\u201d for immigrants. Mr. Trump denounced Mexican immigrants while announcing his campaign and has vowed to build a wall on the border. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, described the deadlocked court ruling as a vindication of the Republican view that Mr. Obama had abused his authority in ordering immigration changes affecting as many as five million unauthorized immigrants. The speaker called it \u201canother major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers. \u201d But that optimism may not carry over to the campaign trail. Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida, one of the most competitive battleground states, predicted that the court\u2019s ruling would help unite Hispanic voters behind Mrs. Clinton. He said she could win as much as 70 percent of Hispanic votes in the state, compared with the 60 percent Mr. Obama won in 2012. Immigration is \u201csort of like a basic  \u201d test with Hispanic voters, Mr. Schale said, adding that Hispanics are tuning out Mr. Trump because of his labeling of immigration reform as \u201camnesty\u201d and his promise to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally. The \u201csuper PACs\u201d the Latino Victory Fund and Priorities USA immediately announced a   online ad campaign aimed at bolstering support among immigrant voters in Colorado, Nevada and Florida. Ben Monterroso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, a separate nonprofit group that registers voters in six states with high Hispanic populations, said the ruling was the latest provocation that would increase turnout. \u201cThe road to the White House goes through the Latino community,\u201d said Mr. Monterroso, whose group enrolled 18, 440 new voters in the first three months of 2016. Democrats and Republicans alike said the ruling all but ensured an even sharper clash over immigration during the presidential campaign. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump quickly issued statements on Thursday that agreed on only one point: The outcome of the presidential election will determine the direction of the nation\u2019s immigration laws. \u201cThe election and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his statement, accusing his opponent of pledging to \u201cexpand Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. \u201d Mrs. Clinton said the ruling showed \u201cus all just how high the stakes are\u201d because Mr. Trump has \u201ccalled for creating a deportation force to tear 11 million people away from their families and their homes. \u201d There are an estimated 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. The Clinton campaign has long planned an aggressive effort to mobilize the estimated 27 million eligible Hispanic voters nationwide. Lorella Praeli, the campaign\u2019s Latino vote director, said the court ruling Thursday will add to Latino anger about Mr. Trump for comments like calling a federal judge unfit to preside in a case against Mr. Trump because of his   heritage. In comments throughout the day, Mrs. Clinton sought to embrace those voters. \u201cMy heart is really breaking for the five million people in this country who\u2019ve been waiting for the decision,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with Telemundo. For Mr. Obama, the court\u2019s ruling ends his hope that his administration would be able to carry out his executive orders allowing nearly five million illegal immigrants to \u201ccome out of the shadows\u201d and work legally. It freezes his actions for the rest of his term, leaving the program\u2019s future, and millions of unauthorized workers, in limbo. Instead, one of the president\u2019s chief immigration legacies will be the years of raids in immigrant communities and the increased enforcement he ordered at the border with Mexico. The tough tactics did not lead to a compromise with Republicans on legislation, and the aggressive actions, mostly in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, enraged families separated by the raids and deportations. The court ruling does not undo changes ordered by Mr. Obama that require immigration officers to focus on deporting unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes or who repeatedly try to enter the United States illegally. The officers have been directed not to move against   illegal immigrants who have lived here for years. The court\u2019s decision also will not affect actions Mr. Obama took in 2012 to help the   Dreamers, young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as small children. Under his program, more than 730, 000 Dreamers received documents allowing them to work legally, without fear that they might be sent home. Mr. Obama\u2019s 2014 executive actions came after years of fighting to get Congress to act. In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration overhaul that the administration said the president could support. But House Republicans blocked any consideration of the legislation and accused the Senate and Mr. Obama of supporting amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. For most of his presidency, even Mr. Obama said he did not have the power to act unilaterally. He repeatedly told Hispanic activists that he could not use the Dreamers program as a model to expand similar protections to a much larger pool of illegal immigrants. \u201cIf we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally,\u201d Mr. Obama told Jos\u00e9   in an interview in September 2013, after it was clear that House Republicans were blocking the Senate\u2019s immigration measure. \u201cSo that\u2019s not an option. \u201d But the pressure from Hispanic activists only increased. (The head of the nation\u2019s largest Latino advocacy organization once called Mr. Obama the \u201cdeporter in chief. \u201d) By the summer of 2014, the president had ordered Jeh Johnson, the homeland security chief, to lead a legal team in reassessing how much power Mr. Obama had to act. In remarks at the White House on Nov. 20, 2014, the president made it clear that he had reversed himself. \u201cThe actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past \u201d Mr. Obama said at the time.'"}, "time": 1742628473.6218462}
