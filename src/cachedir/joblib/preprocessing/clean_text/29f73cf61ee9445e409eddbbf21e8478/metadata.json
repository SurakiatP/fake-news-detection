[\u201cIn Zuckerberg\u2019s view, according to Fast Company, tackling click bait required a rejiggering of the site\u2019s algorithms, as assisted by users\u2019 input,\u201d reports Fortune. \u201cThe solution is similar to the approach the site is now taking to improve the situation around \u2018information diversity or misinformation or building common ground\u2019 \u2014  euphemisms for the more popular conceptions of \u2018filter bubbles,\u2019 \u2018fake news,\u2019 and \u2018echo chambers. \u2019\u201d  \u201cNow it\u2019s not gone a hundred percent but it\u2019s a much smaller problem than it used to be,\u201d said Zuckerberg on the issue of  . \u201cIt\u2019s not like they are problems that exist because there\u2019s some kind of underlying, nefarious motivation. \u201d Last month, The Daily Mail reported that Facebook, which has become notorious for banning conservative and   users, as well as harmless comedy pages, has started to roll out  \u201cfake news\u201d features, which are run by partisan   services led by The Poynter Institute. \u201cUsers have reported seeing a   window when they attempted to share articles that were deemed inaccurate by   \u201d reported The Daily Mail. \u201cFacebook itself will not decide what is real and what is considered fake. Instead, it is enlisting The Poynter Institute, a Florida journalism school, to sift through content. The Poynter Institute is the host of the International Fact Checking Network which bills itself as a \u2018global alliance of fact checkers\u2019. Its members include ABC News, Politico, The Associated Press, Snopes. com and The Washington Post. \u201d Facebook has also started placing \u201chow to spot false news\u201d   on user timelines. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charlie Nash (@MrNashington) April 12, 2017,  The term \u201cfake news\u201d has often been used to smear independent conservative news sources, such as Breitbart News, despite the fact that several news outlets have been exposed by Breitbart for publishing their own \u201cfake news,\u201d including the Independent, the Daily Beast, CNN (numerous times) the Atlantic, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. As previously reported, \u201cSnopes   Arturo R. Garcia openly labels himself as a \u2018progressive,\u2019 attempted to compare Trump supporters to racists on Twitter, misattributed a quote about him to Breitbart News, and acts as the editor of \u2018Racialicious\u2019  \u2014   \u2018A blog about the intersection of race and culture\u2019. \u201d Fellow Snopes   Bethania Palmer attempted to link Trump to the KKK, defended a racist professor, wrote numerous   articles for Raw Story  \u2014   including two attempting to associate former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon to domestic violence and white supremacy  \u2014   and acts as a contributor for the \u201cprogressive\u201d   Truthout. David Emery, another   and staff writer at Snopes, openly asked on Twitter whether there were \u201cany   Trump supporters. \u201d Despite their clear political biases, all three were tasked with   political candidates over the 2016 presidential election under the guise of a neutral service. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook, who financially supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U. S. presidential election, called on tech companies to filter out \u201cfake news,\u201d while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also penned a plan to tackle \u201cfake news\u201d last month, highlighting his intention to roll out the   feature.
