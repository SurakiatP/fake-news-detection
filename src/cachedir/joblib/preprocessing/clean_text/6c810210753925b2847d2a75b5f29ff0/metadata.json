And when he spoke out about his concerns about the nature of celebrity, Frank Sinatra pulled out his stationery and responded. A 1990 story by The Los Angeles Times focused on Mr. Michael\u2019s refusal to promote his music by making videos which, at the height of MTV, was a risky move at best, and career suicide at worst. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think that I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure,\u201d Mr. Michael said at the time. \u201cI think that is the ultimate tragedy of fame. \u201d He added: \u201cPeople who are simply out of control, who are lost. I\u2019ve seen so many of them, and I don\u2019t want to be another clich\u00e9. \u201d Mr. Sinatra, who was then in his   and had experienced the ups and downs of celebrity, gently admonished the younger star in a letter that appeared in The Los Angeles Times a week later. The letter was later published by the online museum Letters of Note. \u201cCome on, George,\u201d Mr. Sinatra wrote. \u201cLoosen up. Swing, man. Dust off those gossamer wings and fly yourself to the moon of your choice and be grateful to carry the baggage we\u2019ve all had to carry since those lean nights of sleeping on buses and helping the driver unload the instruments. \u201d Mr. Sinatra, who died of a heart attack in 1998 at age 82, knew something about the other side of fame. After years of soaring popularity, Mr. Sinatra, a   baritone, saw his career slide in the late 1940s. By the early 1950s, he had retooled his musical persona and won a string of acting roles. To call it a career revival was an understatement: Sinatra had transformed himself from a fledgling wartime singer into a pop culture titan. \u201cThe tragedy of fame is when no one shows up and you\u2019re singing to the cleaning lady in some empty joint that hasn\u2019t seen a paying customer since Saint Swithin\u2019s day. \u201d Mr. Sinatra wrote. \u201cAnd you\u2019re nowhere near that you\u2019re top dog on the top rung of a tall ladder called Stardom, which in Latin means     who were there when it was lonely. \u201d Mr. Sinatra finished the letter succinctly: \u201cTrust me. I\u2019ve been there. \u201d As the letter resurfaced after Mr. Michael\u2019s death, it quickly spread on social media. In 1990, not all readers had taken Mr. Sinatra\u2019s side, either. One urged for a more compassionate treatment of Mr. Michael, whose struggle with fame continued until his death. \u201cFor Mr. Sinatra to trivialize George Michael\u2019s statements and make them seem superfluous or   indicate his grasp of the downside of \u2018the business\u2019 is minuscule. A performer is, foremost, a human being, not a commodity, a windup toy or machine,\u201d a reader, Mike Sekulic, wrote to The Los Angeles Times on Sept. 23, 1990.'"}, "time": 1742561675.0860496}
