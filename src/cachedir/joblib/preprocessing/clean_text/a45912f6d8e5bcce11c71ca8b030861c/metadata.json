It also ordered civilian vessels to stay away from the waters just south of Hainan island and northwest of the disputed island chain in the South China Sea. \\nThe announcement of the drills, which are quite routine in the disputed waters, comes less than a week after USS Decatur conducted a \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d sail-by near the disputed Spratly or Paracel Islands, through which some $5 billion dollars\u2019 worth of trade passes through each year. \\n\u201cUSS Decatur (DDG 73) conducted this transit in a routine, lawful manner without ship escorts and without incident on October 21,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Commander Gary Ross told the Navy Times. \u201cThe United States conducts these routine operations on a regular basis around the world, in full compliance with international law.\u201d \\nThe US operation last Friday was the fourth \u201c freedom of navigation\u201d maneuver conducted in the past year by Washington. The move, as always, drew strong response and criticism from Beijing. \\nAccording to the Chinese Defense Ministry, as the USS Decatur was \u201ctrespassing\" by the islands it was approached by at least two Chinese vessels. The People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy ships repeatedly warned the US warship to leave, as they escorted USS Decatur from waters claimed by China.

Do not repeat the mistakes again,\u201d Chinese Defense Ministry said . \\nAt the same time, Beijing vowed to increase military air and sea patrols, as well as to strengthen the defense capacity to better protect the country\\'s national sovereignty and security. \\nThe Spratly Islands are comprised of more than 750 islets and reefs off the coastlines of Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and China, with all the claimants having their own national names for the archipelago. \\nChina has a strong military presence on the archipelago concentrated around Woody Island, where Beijing maintains a runway and an arsenal of surface-to-air missiles. Beijing continues to claim the reefs in defiance of a Hague International Arbitration Court verdict this summer.'"}, "time": 1742628434.5679805}
