[Prothero did his best to smear Gorka. He describes the former Breitbart News editor (inaccurately) as having \u201cfailed his way upwards\u201d (a description that could apply equally to the career paths of many of BuzzFeed\u2019s own crack reporters).  But in the search for evidence of Gorka\u2019s ties to the   Prothero came up short, despite contacting Gorka\u2019s former employers in Hungary and members of the Hungarian counterintelligence service. Gorka\u2019s Hungarian critics are not shy to attack him, either: some describe him rather viciously. Even so, they say that Gorka is not a Nazi or an antisemite. \u201cSebastian Gorka is not a Nazi or a security threat because he is some sort of secret British agent,\u201d said a member of the Hungarian counter intelligence service, who has reviewed the files a security background check on Gorka from 2002. \u201cGorka is, how do you say in English  \u2014   a peddler of snake oil. \u201d   \u2026     Gorka\u2019s rejection for a [Hungarian] security clearance to serve on the committee was a devastating blow to his reputation in Hungary. He had come to be seen as a   the intelligence official said, while the minor ties to the British government that had been established were enough to alienate him from much of the Hungarian nationalist right.   \u2026     This chimes with the views of some of those who knew him in Hungary, who remember Gorka as   and keenly   but whose views set him outside the  .   \u2026     \u201cWithin the context of historical Hungarian fascism, Gorka never appeared to be particularly interested in these [extreme,  ] movements, having always been a supporter of the   Atlantic alliances and an advocate for Hungarian integration into the West,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to characterize him as a Nazi, when he\u2019s more of a  . \u201d   \u2026     \u201cThe charges that Gorka supports   movements\u201d  \u2014   such as Jobbik, which has been roundly criticized by human rights groups across Europe  \u2014   \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem consistent with his attitude or background when he was here in Hungary,\u201d said Horvath, citing Gorka\u2019s loud   stance. \u201cWhile all   seem to be Nazis, not everyone in the Hungarian right is a racist because there\u2019s a lot of diversity in thought. \u201d When asked about the controversy over Gorka\u2019s use of his father\u2019s Order of Vit\u00e9z medals and title, Molnar first dismissed the complaint, arguing that the Order was fairly common in Hungarian political circles, and is associated with nationalism rather than ideology. Porter also confirms what was first reported here at Breitbart News  \u2014   that the medal Gorka wore at the inauguration, which was awarded to his father for his anticommunist activism by an organization called the Vitezi Rend, had nothing to do with the historical Vitezi Rend that had ties to the   Hungarian regime in the Second World War.
