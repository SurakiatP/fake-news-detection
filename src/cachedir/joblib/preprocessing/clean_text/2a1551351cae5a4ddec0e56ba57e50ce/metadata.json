We were therefore forced to cancel the event\u201d she continued. Dozens of police were deployed by the university in an attempt to control the protests, as protestors holding \u2018 \u2019 banners tore down barricades and broke into scuffles in an attempt to stop the event from taking place.

The statement also condemned \u201cmessages that promote hate. \u201d He was probably talking about MILO rather than the protesters, but perhaps now he will reconsider?
