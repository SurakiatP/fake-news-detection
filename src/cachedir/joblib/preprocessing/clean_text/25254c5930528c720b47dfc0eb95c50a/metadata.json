Our promise back in May: 2 \"personally stop Trump, 2 stand in front of WH door if necessary.\" \\n\u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 28, 2016 \\nAs for that threat, our money is on the Secret Service figuring out a way to deal with the dual threat of a Maher\u2013Moore roadblock. \\n*** \\nRelated:'"}, "time": 1742564035.7870133}
