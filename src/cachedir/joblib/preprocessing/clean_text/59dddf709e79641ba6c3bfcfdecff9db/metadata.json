[Jamie Snider of Fresno, 30, underwent treatment and chemotherapy for an aggressive form of cervical cancer while she was pregnant with twins, the Daily Mail reported.  After undergoing a   and a radical hysterectomy March 16, Snider passed away from heart failure. Snider had beaten the cancer before when she had an ovary removed. She was surprised and overjoyed when she got pregnant with twins. Snider already had two young daughters, Aubrey and Maddie, and was ready to fight the cancer once more. She went through intensive treatment at Stanford Medical Center while she was pregnant, and the disease went into remission once again. Snider posted a photo of herself on Facebook, optimistic about her pregnancy and things to come. Snider\u2019s friend Larina Campanile told KFSN about Snider\u2019s last post on Facebook before the surgery. \u201c\u2018Tomorrow will be a great day,\u2019\u201d Campanile read from the post. \u201c\u2018God has been by my side the whole time. All your prayers and love have kept me going as well. Wish me luck. I\u2019m having a   at 7 and then a radial hysterectomy right after. I\u2019ll be fine. Thank you, God, for keeping me positive through all the hard times.\u2019 And that was her last post. \u201d Snider survived the surgeries March 16 but died of heart failure the morning after. The babies, named Camila and Nico, were born prematurely, at 33 weeks, but they are healthy, according to family members. \u201cWhat gives me peace in my heart is she got to see those babies and hold them and be with them a little bit,\u201d said Campanile. Family and friends have raised money on GoFundMe for Snider\u2019s funeral expenses and help with the children.'"}, "time": 1742562119.7501683}
