Sam Brownback, who is facing a rebellion from his own Republican Party over his trademark   doctrine. In a unanimous ruling, the court said black, Hispanic and poor students were especially harmed by the lack of funding, pointing to lagging test scores and graduation rates. The justices set a June 30 deadline for lawmakers to pass a new constitutional funding formula, sending them scrambling to find more money to pay for a solution. This is the second time in about a year that Kansas\u2019 highest court has ruled against the state\u2019s approach to paying for schools, just as Mr. Brownback finds himself wrestling with growing budget deficits and as his relations with fellow Republicans have deteriorated to new lows. Mr. Brownback, who has made cutting taxes and shrinking government the centerpiece of his administration since taking office in 2011, championed the largest tax cuts in state history, turning Kansas into a national testing ground for his staunchly conservative philosophy. But the state has since struggled with gaping deficits, and patience has run thin, even among some former allies. Just last month, the   Legislature approved a tax increase that would have raised more than $1 billion to help narrow the budget gap  \u2014   a bold rejection of Mr. Brownback\u2019s vision. In the end, the governor vetoed the measure, and he barely survived an override attempt. The school funding ruling now adds yet another layer of fiscal trouble for Kansas and political tumult for Mr. Brownback. \u201cEither the governor will have to bend, or we have to get enough votes in the House and Senate to override him,\u201d Dinah Sykes, a Republican state senator, said, noting that lawmakers will have to get to work immediately to find money in the budget to satisfy the court\u2019s requirements. \u201cI thought that the tax plan that we put on his desk that was vetoed, I thought that was a compromise,\u201d Ms. Sykes said. She added that lawmakers now had to prepare to find a legislative solution  \u2014   with or without the governor. \u201cWe just have to dig in and figure out how to solve this problem,\u201d she said. The court did not specify how much more money was needed for the state\u2019s schools, but finding any could prove difficult. Current budget deficits reach into the hundreds of millions. \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear supermajority of legislators that want to move away from Brownback economics and the failed tax experiments,\u201d said State Representative Jim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House. \u201cNow the school decision expedites the importance of getting that done sooner rather than later. \u201d Mr. Brownback, who is barred by term limits from seeking   next year, has faced plunging approval ratings and increasingly criticism from the moderate wing of the Republican Party. In a statement, he acknowledged that some students in Kansas had not received a suitable education, calling for a new funding formula to \u201cright this wrong. \u201d \u201cThe Kansas Legislature has the opportunity to engage in transformative educational reform by passing a school funding system that puts students first,\u201d Mr. Brownback said. \u201cSuccess is not measured in dollars spent, but in higher student performance. \u201d He made a pitch for schools outside of the public education system, suggesting that parents \u201cshould be given the opportunity and resources to set their child up for success through other educational choices. \u201d School funding consumes about half of Kansas\u2019 budget, and its political salience cuts across party lines. Kansas prides itself on its public schools, and, in many small towns, the high school serves as a community anchor. The right to a suitably funded education is enshrined in the state Constitution. The current lawsuit was prompted by a slide in education financing that began after the recession under Mr. Brownback\u2019s predecessor as governor, Mark V. Parkinson, a Democrat. But the school funding mechanism has been litigated in Kansas courts for years, and there are sharp regional distinctions in how the issue is viewed. In the affluent Kansas City suburbs, where test scores are high, many want to preserve special taxes that benefit their local school districts. In rural and urban parts of the state, where incomes are lower and academic performance sometimes lags, plans to provide more   funding for minorities and poor students have greater resonance. \u201cBecause of the budget cuts, frozen budgets, we\u2019ve had to eliminate almost all of our extended learning time,\u201d said Alan Cunningham, the superintendent of Dodge City Public Schools, a district where the first language of a majority of students is not English. \u201cThose kids are not able to get the time they need to learn the things that they need to learn to be successful,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. In its ruling, the court detailed statistics that showed   and Hispanic students, as well as poor students and those learning the English language, lagging behind their peers academically. Cynthia Lane, the superintendent of public schools in Kansas City, Kan. where more than 80 percent of students come from   households and qualify for free or   lunches, said lawmakers needed to make special provisions for disadvantaged children in the new funding plan. \u201cFor a decade, we have been cutting support  \u2014   we have been offering less tutoring, less support, less enrichment,\u201d said Dr. Lane, whose school district was one of the four plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cSo this ruling today gives me great hope that we can start talking about our aspirations, not just worrying about protecting where we are. \u201d James E. Ryan, the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that courts in school finance cases frequently order state legislatures to come up with funding formulas that are fair  \u2014   and Kansas was no exception. \u201cWhat you see in Kansas you see in states across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNamely, that there is an achievement gap between poorer kids and more   kids, and between white students and students of color. \u201d Mark Tallman, a lobbyist for the Kansas Association of School Boards, said he was pleased with the court\u2019s ruling and hopeful that it would result in more resources in schools. He also said the ruling was an indication that the political winds in Kansas had shifted against Mr. Brownback, particularly with a more moderate Legislature voted into office in November, when Democrats gained 13 seats. \u201cI do think that this Legislature is much more interested in funding education,\u201d Mr. Tallman said. \u201cI think the election results suggest that voters are seeing problems with our funding system that they want to address. \u201d For now, Mr. Brownback has shown a willingness to use a veto pen, leaving it uncertain whether lawmakers can agree on a new school funding plan by the June deadline, and whether they can raise enough revenue to support it. \u201cYou have enormous political will in Kansas to make the changes necessary,\u201d Mr. Ward, the Democratic lawmaker, said, \u201cand any politician obstructing that does it at their own peril. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562805.6976345}
