But the shade he threw on Newt Gingrich after his rant against Megyn Kelly was nothing short of scorching. \\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of people like you using language that\u2019s inflammatory, that\u2019s not true!\u201d Gingrich exploded on The Kelly File. \u201cWhen you use the words, you took a position. And I think it\u2019s very unfair of you to do that!\u201d \\nThen, the former Speaker went for the throat: \\n\u201cYou wanna go back through the tapes of your show recently? You are fascinated with sex and you don\u2019t care about public policy! That\u2019s what I get out of watching you tonight!\u201d \\nAnderson Cooper noticed something unusual about Gingrich's line of attack: \\n\u201cFor Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,\u201d Cooper stated. \u201cThis is a guy, who\u2019s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d \\nThat's about right. Newt Gingrich admitted to cheating on his first and second wives and having an affair during the Clinton impeachment hearings. \\nWatch the segment: \\nTrump supporters may not be pleased with the way Megyn Kelly has commented on all of those accusations, and her throwing doubt upon Juanita Broaddrick's rape claims against Bill Clinton did not win her friends in that camp. But love her or hate her, it's not Megyn's job to be the Trump campaign's unofficial spokeswoman. \\nIt may be her job to assume the role of a news commentator, however, rather than that of an \u201cobjective\u201d journalist. The idea that there is \u201cobjectivity\u201d when it comes to reporting the news is a tired and dangerous cliche the American people should put to rest. \\nAs for being \u201cfascinated by sex,\u201d it just might be that Kelly is professionally interested in sexual assault and groping allegations against a presidential candidate, unfounded or otherwise, since the way those are perceived by the public just might sway a national election. \""}, "time": 1742628486.66284}
