The party was able to raise $2.5 million needed to at least pay for the recount in Wisconsin in less than 12 hours from the time the Greens\u2019 intentions were reported by the media on Wednesday. \\nJill Stein, leader of the party that received less than 1 percent of the national vote, said in a press release that the Greens wanted the recount \u201cbecause reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable.\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The deadline to file for a recount is Friday in Wisconsin, Monday in Pennsylvania and Wednesday in Michigan. \\nThe cost of the Wisconsin recount is $1.1 million, according to the Green Party press release . The release does not say what the cost for all three recounts is, but the party initially sought $2.5 million. That was widely reported as the total amount needed. But once that goal was reached, the target was jacked up to $4.5 million. \\nThe party\u2019s home page appeal for money says the entire cost with legal fees could be $6 million to $7 million. This statement also includes a quote from Stein that blames \u201cforeign agents\u201d for hacking into \u201cparty databases, private email servers, and voter databases in certain states.\u201d Her quote in the press release removed the words \u201cforeign agents.\u201d \\nSlim Margins \\nTrump narrowly beat Democratic contender Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and is leading in Michigan, which more than two weeks later is still too close to call. Just a 55,000-vote swing is all that is needed in the three states to flip the election to Clinton. \\nOn Tuesday it was reported that a group of U.S. professors \u2013 computer scientists and elections lawyers \u2013 had held a conference call with the Clinton campaign to ask it to file for an audit in the three states. They said that actual results differed from exit polls and that Trump had done considerably better in areas where electronic voting machines were used. Clinton did better where paper ballots were used. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. \\nSome experts explained that electronic machines were used in rural areas, which were stronger for Trump, while paper ballots were used in urban areas largely backing Clinton. \\nThe academics lobbying the Clinton campaign have suggested that a foreign government may be behind the hacks. The Obama administration had said before the election that Russia was trying to influence the election through hacking, though no evidence was made public. \\nIn his final testimony to Congress last week, outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted that there was no proof about who was behind the supposed hacks into email accounts of Democratic leaders which proved embarrassing to the Clinton campaign. \\nThe Clinton campaign has made no statement about the recount. But many Clinton supporters have backed the effort online. The Trump transition team has made no comment. \\nTrump won the Electoral College vote 290 to 232, with Michigan\u2019s 16 electoral votes still outstanding and with 270 votes needed to be elected President. Clinton won the national popular vote by about 2 million votes. \\nThe Green\u2019s Motive \\nBecause of Clinton\u2019s popular-vote plurality, there have been calls for electors from states that voted for Trump to change their vote to Clinton, but there is no indication that Trump\u2019s electors are switching sides. Twenty-four states do not legally bind electors to vote with the popular will of their states. The electors will vote in their state capitals on Dec. 19. The Congress will certify the election on Jan. 6. \\nThe move by the Greens raises many questions. At face value, they say the integrity of the electoral system is the only thing at stake. But the Greens must know that the recount effort could only help Clinton and hurt Trump. \\nIs there some collusion between the Democratic Party and the Greens? Are they a Trojan horse for Clinton who can stay above the fray while getting the recount that some of her supporters have called for? \\nHave wealthy Clinton donors been behind the flood of cash into the effort in so short a time? Or are the Greens sincere in wanting voting irregularities exposed? One theory is that the recount will expose cheating by both the Republicans and Democrats \u2013 and thus reflect badly on the two-party system which has marginalized the Greens and other third parties. \\nThere\u2019s also the mystery of why one Stein quote mentions \u201cforeign agents\u201d while another doesn\u2019t. In the waning days of the campaign, Clinton and her surrogates attacked Trump by suggesting Russian agents were conspiring to install him in the White House. Why did Stein, at least briefly, pick up that Clinton theme even though DNI Clapper had distanced himself from the accusation? \\nThough there\u2019s widespread doubt among election experts that an audit of the results in the three states will swing the election to Clinton, there now is the possibility that the unpredictable 2016 election might still have a few last-minute twists. \\nJoe Lauria is a veteran foreign-affairs journalist based at the U.N. since 1990.
