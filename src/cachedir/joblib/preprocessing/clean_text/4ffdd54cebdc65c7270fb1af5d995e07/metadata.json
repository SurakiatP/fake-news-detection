It smells like a turd that has festered in satan\u2019s butt hole for a thousand years.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hat, or shall I say crown. I shall wear it wherever I go from now on, and anyone who looks at me will see my beautiful crown that I wear so proudly, and think of me.\u201d \\nAt that moment, four dozen bluebottle flies plop themselves on Gina Miller\u2019s crown and tuck down to some good nosh. \\nIn the background, the spire of Big Ben looms over the scene, and as the coughing photographer clicks away, a wry smile comes over Gina Miller, she is the Queen today, the Queen of No-Brexit, and she will cherish this moment of fame for the fifteen minutes it will afford her. \\nEnjoy your crown Gina Miller, you will wear it for the rest of your pitiful life.'"}, "time": 1742564506.2233574}
