[In an interview with Rolling Stone published Monday, the      said a song from her latest album titled \u201cHeartbeat Away\u201d  \u2014   in which a president launches nuclear weapons  \u2014   was written before Trump received the Republican nomination.  \u201cMy sleep has been disturbed. My insides are ridden with unease,\u201d Crow told the outlet. \u201cI wrote that song before Trump got the nomination  \u2014   it already felt apocalyptic that people were entertaining the idea of making a man like that the most powerful person in the world. \u201d \u201cHeartbeat Away\u201d is a track on Crow\u2019s latest studio album, Be Myself, which was released April 21. The lyrics of the song include references to the unnamed president\u2019s possible connections to Russia, including a reference to Russia \u201cblowing up the phone. \u201d \u201cI had to go into deep meditation and find a way to have compassion for the people of this country that are hurting and believe [Trump] cares about them,\u201d the     told Rolling Stone. \u201cI\u2019m worried, but my meditation teacher said something fascinating. Her phrase was, \u2018This is the way forward. \u2019\u201d In her interview, Crow also opened up about her battle with brain cancer and how it felt to have been embraced by some of her musical idols through her   career in the music industry. \u201cMy idea for music was that I didn\u2019t want to be great. I wanted to be important,\u201d she explained. \u201cI wanted to write important music, and so, when you start having a music career and you\u2019re certainly not one of the cool kids, but you\u2019re embraced by the older class  \u2014   I was just like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe these people know me.\u2019 As hokey as it might sound, I still feel really humbled by that. \u201d Crow has previously spoken out about her dislike of Trump. In an October appearance on The View, the singer said she doesn\u2019t let her children watch television when Trump is on screen. \u201cI want to be able to say to my kids, being the president of the United States is the most honorable position and it needs to go back to that and we need to change the dialogue,\u201d she said at the time.
