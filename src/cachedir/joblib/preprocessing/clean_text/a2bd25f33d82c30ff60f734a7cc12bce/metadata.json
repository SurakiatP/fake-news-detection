From Attorney General Loretta Lynch on down through the Justice Department\u2019s political ranks, the Department has blocked the FBI from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion. Whether it is Hillary\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while serving as Secretary of State or her involvement in the pay-for-play Clinton enterprise known as the Clinton Foundation, the Obama administration is applying a banana republic-style double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her. \\nLynch and President Obama were reportedly furious with FBI Director James Comey for sending a letter to Congress on October 28 th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the e-mail case had come to light, which required further investigation. This evidence consisted of a batch of e-mails FBI investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to Anthony Weiner, Clinton confidante Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband, while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving Weiner\u2019s alleged sexting to an underage girl. Comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let Hillary off the hook in the e-mail case last July. He was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from FBI agents who felt betrayed by that decision. \\nDepartment of Justice officials had leaned on Comey not to send the letter to Congress, claiming that it would violate Department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election. To his credit, Comey ignored the Department officials\u2019 objections, claiming he had an obligation to keep the Congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case. \\nDemocrats, who had lavished praise on Comey for his July decision, lashed out at Comey for sending his letter updating Congress. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that Comey may have violated the law by informing Congress, because, Reid argued, he appeared to be taking sides in an election. The disgraced former Attorney General Eric Holder, held in contempt of Congress for withholding information relating to the Fast and Furious scandal, said about Comey\u2019s action, \u201cI fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. It is up to the director to correct his mistake \u2014 not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.\u201d \\nSince when has Holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the American people? Holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust, with his blatant politicization of the Obama Department of Justice. As evidenced by the Obama Department of Justice\u2019s handling of the multiple FBI investigations involving Hillary Clinton, the Department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption. It interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in Hillary\u2019s favor, ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed Obama and preserve his legacy. \\nFirst, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the e-mail case or in connection with the FBI\u2019s investigation of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations. \u201cThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,\u201d former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said . \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\u2019m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.\u201d \\nKallstrom\u2019s belief that Lynch acted to influence the results of the FBI probes in Hillary\u2019s favor is buttressed by Lynch\u2019s 30 minute private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before FBI Director Comey faced the cameras on July 5 th with his exculpatory announcement. \\nSecond, at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the e-mail case, including to Hillary\u2019s lawyer and confidante Cheryl Mills and to Platte River Networks\u2019 Paul Combetta. It appears that Combetta had previously lied to government investigators \u2013 a crime in itself \u2013 while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently Bleachbited e-mails to delete them, even though they had been subject to a previously issued Congressional subpoena. The immunity agreements garnered nothing in return, but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the FBI\u2019s separate Clinton Foundation investigation. Apparently, the Department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant, rather than granting useless immunities, in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the e-mail investigation that might have been contained in those devices. \\nThird, the Department and FBI did not conduct their last minute interview of Hillary Clinton under oath and allowed Cheryl Mills \u2013 herself a material witness \u2013 to sit in during Hillary\u2019s interview. They did not ask pertinent follow-up questions. There was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of Hillary\u2019s statements during the interview against her sworn Congressional testimony or her many public statements. \\nFourth, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to allow the FBI to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations. In fact, senior Department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough FBI investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further. Such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while Hillary was Secretary of State, their true motivations and any favors extended by the State Department in return. \\nFinally, the cross-connections between the Clintons and some high level Department of Justice and FBI officials cry out for recusal. But not so in this administration. For example, the wife of the deputy FBI director who was involved in the laggard Clinton Foundation investigation, Andrew McCabe, just happened to have received a large donation from close Clinton ally Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to her 2015 run for the State Senate. \\nTo make matters worse, the Obama Department of Justice assigned Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik, a close friend of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager John Podesta, to communicate with Congress about what Kadzik promised would be a \u201cthorough\u201d review of the newly discovered e-mails from Anthony Weiner\u2019s online account. \\nPodesta praised Kadzik in an e-mail to an Obama campaign official back in 2008 as a \u201cFantastic lawyer,\u201d and said about his pal, \u201cKept me out of jail.\u201d Their history together goes further back than that. During the waning days of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, it was Kadzik, then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive Marc Rich, who lobbied Podesta, then serving as Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, for a presidential pardon on his client\u2019s behalf. Kadzik\u2019s lobbying effort, no doubt helped along by contributions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign and to Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential library, paid off. Bill Clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office. \\nKadzik joined the Department of Justice in April 2013, first as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, and then as the Principal Deputy. With the Podesta connection intact, Kadzik has served as a highly placed Clinton campaign mole in the Department. An e-mail dated May 19, 2015 from Kadzik to Podesta, released by WikiLeaks , proves the point. Bearing the subject heading \u201cHeads Up,\u201d Kadzik advised Podesta about upcoming Congressional testimony by the head of the Department\u2019s Civil Division, and about another filing in the Freedom of Information case that would mean \u201cit will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.\u201d Podesta forwarded Kadzik\u2019s heads up e-mail to several senior Hillary Clinton campaign officials with the admonition: \u201cAdditional chances for mischief.\u201d \\nExploiting his coordinating role in the re-opened e-mail investigation and contacts with FBI investigators, Kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal Podesta and to provide inside information to the Clinton campaign\u2019s supporters in Congress as well. \\nThe Clintons manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption. The Obama Department of Justice is no exception.  '"}, "time": 1742562590.2351644}
