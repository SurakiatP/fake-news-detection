Rowling after eight years on its authoritative billionaires list, saying high British taxes and large charitable contributions had eroded her fortune. Forbes may want to rethink that. Last weekend, \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d  \u2014   the first of a new, multifilm franchise, with a script by Ms. Rowling  \u2014   opened in the United States to a strong $75 million weekend. (The international box office was close to another $150 million.) Hugely popular Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions have opened at Universal Studio theme parks in Orlando, Fla. Hollywood and Osaka, Japan, as well as a Potter attraction at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London. The   drama \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d is a smash hit in London and is scheduled to open on Broadway in 2018. A book based on the play was an instant No. 1 best seller. Warner Bros. recently licensed the television rights to the Harry Potter films to NBCUniversal for as much as $250 million. Any estimate of Ms. Rowling\u2019s fortune is at best informed speculation, and most previous attempts I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t seem very informed. Ms. Rowling is famously private, especially about her financial and business affairs. She denied being a billionaire after Forbes first anointed her, telling the television interviewer Katie Couric in 2005 that \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of money, more money than I ever dreamed I would have. But I am not a billionaire. \u201d She has remained publicly silent on the subject since. So I set out this week to assess the size and scope of her fortune, not to invade her privacy but because she\u2019s that    commodity in the ranks of the ultrawealthy  \u2014   a role model. Not only has she made her fortune largely through her own wits and imagination, but she also pays taxes and gives generously to charity. At a time of bitter disputes over rising income inequality, no one seems to resent Ms. Rowling\u2019s runaway success. \u201cIt\u2019s an impressive story,\u201d said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and an author of \u201cIt\u2019s the Market: the   Rise in the Return to Top Talent,\u201d a study of wealth generation in the digital age. \u201cShe struggled as a single mother,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, she created this amazing franchise. She had tremendous talent, and she\u2019s reaping the rewards. People don\u2019t mind that. What they resent is when chief executives get paid for failure. \u201d Ms. Rowling has also been backed by some   negotiating and marketing muscle  \u2014   Scholastic, which published the Potter books Warner Bros. the studio behind the Potter films and now the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise and NBCUniversal, which opened the Wizarding World attractions at its theme parks. Neil Blair, a former Warner Bros. executive, has represented her and fiercely protected her interests since he founded the Blair Partnership, a literary agency, in 2011, with Ms. Rowling as his most prominent client. Mr. Blair did not respond to requests for comment. Along with other famous authors, entertainers and sports stars, Ms. Rowling has also benefited from globalization and technology advances, the same forces that have squeezed the working class. \u201cThirty and 40 years ago, entertainers and sports figures didn\u2019t have that kind of money,\u201d Professor Kaplan said. (He noted that Bob Hope was the only entertainer on the original Forbes 400, and he made most of his money in real estate.) \u201cThanks to globalization, the internet and social media, they can reach a much bigger market today,\u201d he said. A close look at Ms. Rowling\u2019s sources of income suggests that she\u2019s worth more than $1 billion, even allowing for a large margin of error. I came up with the estimates by interviewing a range of publishing and entertainment executives and agents. Some of them have negotiated with Ms. Rowling\u2019s representatives and knew what terms they were seeking. No one was willing to be identified because pretty much everyone hopes to do business with Ms. Rowling. \u201cShe\u2019s a sacred cow,\u201d one executive said. To start with the obvious, there\u2019s the source of her wealth: The seven Harry Potter books have sold an estimated 450 million copies, with estimated total revenue of $7. 7 billion. At a standard 15 percent author\u2019s royalty, she would have earned $1. 15 billion. These books continue to sell strongly years after they were first published. Ms. Rowling has presumably been able to negotiate better deals for her subsequent books, which include adult mysteries under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, published by a Little Brown imprint, as well as numerous Potter spinoffs. These works probably contributed at least another $50 million. Ms. Rowling\u2019s deal with Warner Bros. is a closely guarded secret, but it has been reported that she sold the film rights to the first four Potter films for just $2 million. Nearly all such deals, though, also include a percentage of the net profits, which were substantial. The first four films grossed close to $3. 5 billion and generated an estimated $2. 5 billion in profit. If she managed to achieve a 10 percent net profit participation, that\u2019s $250 million. The next four Potter films were far more lucrative, generating well over $4 billion in revenue. By then, she was one of the rare talents who probably had negotiated a deal providing her a percentage of a film\u2019s gross revenue. At 10 percent, that\u2019s another $400 million. She almost certainly, according to the people I spoke with, managed a similar deal for the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d series. Even if the first film generates just $500 million in revenue, less than half the   Potter films, that adds another $50 million to her fortune, bringing the film total to $700 million. Warner negotiated Ms. Rowling\u2019s theme park deals on her behalf. That deal with NBCUniversal is also secret, but she is one of the unusual examples of someone who is also a \u201cconsultant\u201d and gets a percentage of the gate. (Steven Spielberg, the only other known example, gets 2 percent of ticket sales at Universal Studios.) She also received a   licensing fee estimated at $60 million to $80 million and annual development fees. Like Mr. Spielberg, Ms. Rowling also gets a percentage of gross sales of merchandise, food and beverages. NBCUniversal does not break out revenue from the Wizarding World attractions, but attendance has more than doubled since the first Harry Potter attraction opened in 2010. Last year, NBCUniversal\u2019s parent, Comcast, said overall theme park revenue jumped more than 60 percent to $1. 4 billion. If half of that comes from Wizarding World, and Ms. Rowling gets 2 percent, then her take last year would have been $14 million. Since 2010, when the first attraction opened, I\u2019d estimate she has earned at least $30 million on ticket sales, which would bring her total theme park earnings to roughly $100 million. NBCUniversal also bought exclusive television rights to the eight Harry Potter films this summer in a deal valued at as much as $250 million. Ms. Rowling presumably received a large piece of that, at least $125 million. That replaced a deal with Disney estimated to have been worth $50 million or more to her. That brings her total estimated earnings from books, movies, theme parks and television to more than $2. 2 billion. Assuming that she paid Britain\u2019s top individual tax rate of 45 percent, she would have been left with $1. 2 billion. Ms. Rowling also has other income. She did not write the play \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d but no doubt earned a licensing fee and is a profit participant.   hit shows can generate enormous income  \u2014   the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has an estimated net worth of $1. 2 billion. She earns licensing fees on all   merchandise. She owns the   rights to her books, sold on her proprietary website, Pottermore. Pottermore loses money, but it said this week that it expected to earn a profit in 2017. And, of course, Ms. Rowling has substantial investment income and unrealized capital gains given the long stock market rally. An average 8 percent return on invested assets of $1 billion would generate $80 million a year, and it compounds. Ms. Rowling has given generously to charity  \u2014   Forbes estimated a total of $160 million by the time it dropped her from its list in 2012  \u2014   but there\u2019s no indication that the contributions have even offset her investment income, let alone seriously dented her net worth. Whatever the precise size of her fortune, Ms. Rowling is enormously wealthy. In this postelection holiday season, maybe her   success is something everyone can feel warm about. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen to everyone, but it\u2019s an inspiration that if you work hard and have talent, really good things can happen,\u201d Professor Kaplan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like her books: Good triumphs over evil. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561894.9816656}
