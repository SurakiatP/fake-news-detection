After being sick for many years with \u2018strange\u2019 allergies, which all began after living in a home with a hidden mold problem, I can\u2019t tell you how thankful I am and what a blessing it is that God has led me to Glen, the gentleman in the video. It is wonderful beyond words to actually feel \u2018normal\u2019 again after having felt sick, tired, and practically living in a prison to my allergies for many years now.\\nFor many years now, I have lived with allergies so bad, not only did I feel like I had a cold 24-7, but I had other strange symptoms too:\\n\u2014extreme fatigue\\n\u2014sudden visual disturbances or double vision\\n\u2014dizziness\\n\u2014light headedness\\n\u2014problems hearing, ringing in the ears\\n\u2014swelling in my face\\n\u2014swollen glands\\n\u2014constant food allergies\\n\u2014allergies to just about everything, including smells\\n\u2014just an overall not feeling right, you can\u2019t really put your finger on it, but you just don\u2019t feel good\\n\u2014constant excessively low BP and feeling as if I am about to pass out at times\\n\u2014feeling like I am in a fog\\n\u2014unmovitvated\\n\u2014not feeling good when I would wake up in the morning, like a person having a massive hangover\\nThere is so much more\u2026 but I have literally lived this way since around 2004 until now, and this is the first thing that has really helped to make a difference. I will keep everyone updated, as I have not yet tried the full dose. But so far, the low dose is really making a difference. I was told by Glen to start off small due to the strange allergies. So that is what I\u2019ve been doing.\\nI really want to share this with everyone because I understand how frustrating life is when you don\u2019t feel good, especially when no one gives you answers for your suffering and you have no idea what to do to fix it or make yourself feel better. It\u2019s extremely depressing. I strongly urge everyone to share this post and to try this product. God bless you!\\nCHECK OUT LYN LEAHZ ON YOUTUBE AND SUBSCRIBE TODAY\u2014CLICK HERE NOW!
