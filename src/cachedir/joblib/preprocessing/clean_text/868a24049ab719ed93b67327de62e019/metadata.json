S. Chamber of Commerce is distressed by the executive order. [The U. S. Chamber of Commerce slammed Trump\u2019s order, which mandates that the Departments of Justice, Labor, and Homeland Security conduct legal reviews of the   system and its impacts on American labor.  \u201cEconomic growth requires a skilled workforce, so it should be a priority to make sure American workers have the skills required to fill open jobs with American companies,\u201d the Chamber wrote in a statement. \u201cIt would be a mistake to close the door on   workers from around the world who can contribute to American businesses\u2019 growth and expansion and make the U. S. more competitive around the world. The   program plays an important role in addressing this need, but it can be improved. \u201d The U. S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s statement also claims the organization supports Trump\u2019s \u2018Buy American\u2019 initiative, but said \u201cexpanding current \u2018Buy American\u2019 rules in U. S. law would make it more difficult to spur growth and jobs here at home. \u201d Rather than reforming or ending the   visa program, which gives at least 85, 000 U. S.  jobs to foreign workers every year, the Chamber said they would prefer an expansion. \u201cIf the goal is to grow the economy and create jobs, which the administration has indicated, it\u2019s important to open more procurement markets for American companies and attract the best and brightest talent,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe look forward to working with the administration to accomplish those shared goals. \u201d The U. S. Chamber of Commerce touts their support for \u201ca legal status\u201d for illegal immigrants on their website, despite the harmful impacts it would have on American workers. As Breitbart News has reported, there are perhaps 1. 8 million foreign guest workers in the U. S. despite 4 million young Americans entering the workforce every year. If the   visa program had never been introduced and enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, Breitbart News reported. With American voters, the   visa remains incredibly unpopular, since only 30 percent of Americans said in a recent poll that the   visa is necessary, Breitbart Texas reported.
