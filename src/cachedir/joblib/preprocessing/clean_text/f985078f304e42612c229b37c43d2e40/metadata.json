[In a video piece accompanying an article headlined, \u201cMilo Yiannopoulos is trying to convince colleges that hate speech is cool,\u201d CNN states that MILO is on a mission to \u201ctake on the liberal college establishment, and he\u2019s not the only one\u201d before cutting to an interview with white nationalist Nathan Damigo. The video then shows clips from white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s rallies and claims that Spencer\u2019s planned college tour is inspired directly by MILO.  \u201cWhy are you seeking to associate me with these people?\u201d MILO asked the CNN interviewer, who replied, \u201cThey associate themselves with you. \u201d \u201cWhat you are seeking to do, by associating me with people who have odious and disgusting opinions, is suggest that I somehow in some way tacitly enable these people,\u201d MILO replied. \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have unsavory opinions about skin color. F*ck you. \u201d CNN asked some of the students that invited MILO to UC Berkeley about their opinion on what MILO is doing in trying to \u201ctake down the ivory tower\u201d of   college campuses, \u201cthey\u2019re finally learning from the Democrats. \u201d One student added, \u201cit\u2019s been years and years that they\u2019ve controlled the university. \u201d Unlike the protesters at UC Berkeley, MILO has stated multiple times that skin colour and race do not matter, ideas and values do. Last week while speaking at UC Colorado Springs, MILO explicitly denounced racism: \u201cWhite pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn\u2019t the way to go,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe way to go is reminding them and yourselves that you should be aspiring to values and to ideas. \u201d \u201cYou should be focusing on what unites people and not what drives them apart,\u201d MILO concluded. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give a shit about skin color, a shit about sexuality  \u2026     You shouldn\u2019t give a shit about gender, and you should be deeply suspicious of the people who do. \u201d CNN did not include those statements in their story, but they were sure to include this analysis from the   League\u2019s Oren Segal: \u201cWhether Milo considers himself actually   or not, clearly those who represent the   see what he\u2019s doing as an opportunity for them as well. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562767.5905678}
