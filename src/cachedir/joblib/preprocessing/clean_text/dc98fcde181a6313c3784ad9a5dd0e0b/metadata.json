Trump were predictably unsparing. But when the participants were asked about Hillary Clinton, their appraisals were just as blunt and nearly as biting. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do if I don\u2019t like him and I don\u2019t trust her?\u201d a millennial black woman in Ohio asked. \u201cChoose between being stabbed and being shot? No way!\u201d \u201cShe was part of the whole problem that started sending blacks to jail,\u201d a young black man, also from Ohio, observed about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s a racist, and she is a liar, so really what\u2019s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?\u201d another young black woman from Ohio said. Young   like all voters their age, are typically far harder to drive to the polls than   and older Americans. Yet with just over two months until Election Day, many Democrats are expressing alarm at the lack of enthusiasm, and in some cases outright resistance, some black millennials feel toward Mrs. Clinton. Their skepticism is rooted in a deep discomfort with the political establishment that they believe the    former first lady and secretary of state represents. They share a lingering mistrust of Mrs. Clinton and her husband over criminal justice issues. They are demanding more from politicians as part of a new, confrontational wave of black activism that has arisen in response to police killings of unarmed  . \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a movement with a real sense of urgency,\u201d explained Brittany Packnett, 31, a St.   leader in the push for police accountability. Mrs. Clinton is not yet connecting, she said, \u201cbecause the conversation that younger black voters are having is no longer one about settling on a candidate who is better than the alternative. \u201d The question of just how many young   will show up to vote carries profound implications for this election. Mrs. Clinton is sure to dominate Mr. Trump among black voters, but her overwhelming margin could ultimately matter less than the total number of blacks who show up to vote. To replicate President Obama\u2019s success in crucial states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, she cannot afford to let the percentage of the electorate that is black slip far below what it was in 2012. And while a modest   of black votes may not imperil Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prospects, given Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity among upscale white voters, it could undermine Democrats\u2019 effort to capture control of the Senate and win other   elections. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s difficulties with young   were laid bare in four focus groups conducted in Cleveland and Jacksonville, Fla. for a handful of progressive organizations spending millions on the election: the service employees union, a joint \u201csuper PAC\u201d between organized labor and the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, and a progressive group called Project New America. The results were outlined in a   presentation by Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster, and shared with The New York Times by another party strategist who wanted to draw attention to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s difficulties in hopes that the campaign would move more aggressively to address the matter. Word of the report has spread in the constellation of liberal operatives and advocacy groups in recent weeks, concerning officials who saw diminished black turnout hurt Democratic candidates in the last two midterm elections. Adding to the worries is a separate poll of   that Mr. Belcher conducted earlier in the summer indicating that Mrs. Clinton is lagging well behind Mr. Obama\u2019s performance among young blacks in a handful of crucial states. In Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, 70 percent of   under 35 said they were backing Mrs. Clinton, 8 percent indicated support for Mr. Trump and 18 percent said they were backing another candidate or did not know whom they would support. In 2012, Mr. Obama won 92 percent of black voters under 45 nationally, according to exit polling. Over 25 percent of   are between 18 and 34, and 44 percent are older than 35, according to 2013 census data. \u201cThere is no Democratic majority without these voters,\u201d Mr. Belcher said. \u201cThe danger is that if you don\u2019t get these voters out, you\u2019ve got the 2004 John Kerry electorate again. \u201d In Ohio, for example, blacks were 10 percent of the electorate in the 2004 presidential race. But when Mr. Obama ran for   in 2012, that number jumped to 15 percent. What frustrates many blacks under 40 is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s overriding focus on Mr. Trump. \u201cWe already know what the deal is with Trump,\u201d said Nathan Baskerville, a    North Carolina state representative. \u201cTell us what your plan is to make our life better. \u201d Such talk can be frustrating to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides, who point out that her first speech of the campaign was on criminal justice and that she has laid out a series of proposals on the topic. \u201cIt is on us to make sure that that\u2019s known,\u201d said Addisu Demissie, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s voter outreach and mobilization director, adding of young black activists, \u201cWe share their goals, we share their values and we want to make sure that\u2019s reflected through our campaign. \u201d The focus groups and interviews with young black activists suggest many of them are not aware of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plans regarding police conduct, mass incarceration and structural racism broadly. Christopher Prudhome, 31, recounted a recurring conversation he has with other   as he travels around the country as the head of a nonpartisan group dedicated to registering young voters: They do not like either candidate. \u201cYoung people feel discouraged and apprehensive about the political process as is, and then they look at the two options in front of us,\u201d said Mr. Prudhome, adding of Mrs. Clinton: \u201cNobody has seen an agenda for   millennials. I don\u2019t think they believe she cares about them. \u201d Part of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s problem, said Symone Sanders, a former top aide to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign, is that the candidate is overly cautious and is conducting an outdated style of black outreach. Ms. Sanders has begun taking matters into her own hands. She said she was working with other young activists to recruit black celebrities for a millennial mobilization tour through Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. \u201cBlack churches and an H. B. C. U. tour is just not going to cut it in 2016,\u201d said Ms. Sanders, referring to historically black colleges and universities. \u201cThe Clinton campaign has to be willing to get out of what\u2019s comfortable and get on the streets. \u201d Mr. Demissie said the Clinton campaign\u2019s efforts were more expansive, pointing to voter registration efforts already underway in barbershops and salons as well as sneaker and video game stores. Mrs. Clinton has met with mothers of those who lost children at the hands of the police and has used the signature refrain that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d in public remarks. But she and her husband also come from an earlier political tradition rooted in the Deep South, where black voters are primarily reached through the church and the threat of white conservative backlash is never far from mind. Today\u2019s young   voters are less likely to be found in black churches and more likely to be found in schools, loosely organized activist groups and online, said Ms. Packnett, the St. Louis activist. And the leaders are more diverse. \u201cIt\u2019s not just heterosexual men,\u201d she noted. Not only are younger black activists reached in different ways, they also have far higher expectations on leaders, dismissing boilerplate pleas for racial equality and justice as insufficient. \u201cGone is the day of patience,\u201d said Tony J. Payton Jr. 35, a former Pennsylvania state representative. \u201cNo longer should we accept systemic racism. \u201d Doubts about how aggressively Mrs. Clinton will move to combat racism are at the heart of black suspicion toward her. Some   said her 1996 reference to some young criminals as \u201c\u201d and the legislation that President Bill Clinton signed imposing stiff sentences on nonviolent offenders, have made today\u2019s activists skeptical about her true intentions. \u201cThat stuff comes up unprompted,\u201d Mr. Belcher said. Mr. Trump has turned to remarkably blunt language about blacks in recent weeks  \u2014   portraying their communities as dystopian hellscapes and asking them, in courting their support, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d Some   allies of Mrs. Clinton believe he is serving as her most effective     lever. \u201cHe is literally saying something every day that is disrespectful to the black community,\u201d said Michael Blake, a New York State assemblyman from the Bronx who worked on Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns and is close to many Clinton aides. Yet when   voters in the focus groups were shown campaign fliers and asked to rate them, there was no mistaking what was most effective. A pamphlet with a picture of Mr. Trump that read, \u201cWe have to beat the racists,\u201d fell flat with young black audiences. Scoring much higher were a stark black and white handout showing the names of those killed at the hands of the police and another with images of mothers of the victims that said, \u201cTheir Children Can\u2019t Vote, Will You?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564195.3399146}
