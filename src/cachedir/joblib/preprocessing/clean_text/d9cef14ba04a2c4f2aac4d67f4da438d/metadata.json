He\u2019ll finally get his chance this Sunday, the first time in nearly a decade that a working   star will be M. C. of the Oscars. Mr. Kimmel, 49, is taking on this award show in a year when there doesn\u2019t seem to be much mystery about which major nominees will win. And he\u2019ll have to find a way to connect with a nationwide audience at a fractious time, when political tempers are running high. So, no pressure there. As Mr. Kimmel said in a recent telephone interview, speaking from the El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles where \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d is produced: \u201cI\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that someone is going to be disappointed in me at the end. I just don\u2019t know who it will be yet. \u201d Days before he steps onto the Dolby Theater stage, in front of tens of millions of people, Mr. Kimmel spoke about the challenges of making this show while still working his day job and trying to find a sweet spot between a program with too much political content and one with not enough. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How are the preparations going? Where do you even find the time? What, am I supposed to be planning something? I was thinking I would wing it. No one\u2019s ever done that before. We\u2019ll do some crowd work and see how it goes. [Laughs] We do it in whatever spare time we have. After the show, I usually spend an hour or two on the Oscars, and dedicate Fridays to   and planning and interviews and meetings, promo shoots. Eventually it adds up. Does hosting a nightly talk show better prepare you for a challenge like this? When you do a show every night, hosting an awards show doesn\u2019t seem as monumental a task as it might. Really, when you break it down, it\u2019s like a   monologue and a couple of taped pieces, then some intros and jokes along the way. You have to give out awards for all the categories, and you want to keep the show under nine hours long. You don\u2019t have a ton of room to play with. Are you approaching this as a potential audition to host again in future years?  That\u2019s definitely not something I have in mind. [Laughs] You never know how these things have gone until you step offstage and read what a bunch of strangers thought. All your friends tell you it was great, no matter what you did, and your mother thinks it\u2019s wonderful. Obviously it\u2019s an honor, but the workload cannot be ignored. How do you make peace with this? It\u2019s not even really about the work  \u2014   it\u2019s the anxiety leading up to the event itself, and the general malaise that I put my family through. I said to my wife this morning, \u201cWhat if, to save time, instead of using the word \u2018categories,\u2019 we just called them \u2018cats\u2019?\u201d And she pointed out that I would waste more time just explaining that. Given recent award shows and the general tenor of the moment, are you expecting a lot of political speeches? Is there a point where that becomes too much? There definitely is a point at which that becomes too much. There\u2019s also a point at which it becomes too little. And finding that balance is, for me, the most difficult hurdle, when it comes to this broadcast. We don\u2019t know what our mood in this country is going to be on Sunday. We seem to be in a very temperamental period. We\u2019re having wild mood swings as a nation right now. Hopefully everyone will be in a good mood that night. Given that Donald J. Trump won the presidency and the Patriots won the Super Bowl, does that ensure that \u201cLa La Land\u201d will win best picture? I don\u2019t know if they go   . But my plan is, I\u2019m going to tank the first half of the Oscars. And then lead a furious comeback in the second four hours. Do you also see this as an opportunity to promote your ABC show? Well, let\u2019s be honest: There\u2019s a good chunk of America that doesn\u2019t know that Jimmy Fallon and I are different people. So I\u2019m not going to go into this presuming that they know me and all my bits. You need to approach this without any ego. If there\u2019s too much inside stuff, it won\u2019t work. So we shouldn\u2019t expect to see Guillermo in any Oscars bits? I think that would be confusing to a lot of people. He\u2019ll be working anyway  \u2014   out on the red carpet, corralling people. People are shocked to hear that we have a show the next night and all week after that. It\u2019s not like we can relax after it  \u2014   we\u2019ve got to get right back on the pony. There\u2019s no point, really, to doing this if you don\u2019t carry that momentum into your nightly show. In recent weeks, Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d has been drawing more viewers than Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show. \u201d Do you think it\u2019s a sign that audiences want more pointed topical comedy? This is all fake news. [Laughs] I mean, that\u2019s a very simple way of looking at the ratings. People seem to forget how important your   is, too. When \u201cThe Voice\u201d comes back, so will the ratings of \u201cThe Tonight Show. \u201d We\u2019re all pretty lucky right now  \u2014   all the   shows  \u2014   that more people are watching and reacting. I think everyone loves to have a story line, and people get excited if the tide is turning. But any mathematician would bang you over the head with his calculator. There\u2019s a category of   hosts  \u2014   Mr. Colbert, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Trevor Noah  \u2014   who seem to own the   beat. Do you worry about being left out of this group? It doesn\u2019t worry me. I think it\u2019s wrong. If anything, my concern is, do we do too much Trump stuff on the show? My monologue is at least 50 percent Donald Trump, and it\u2019s not all light commentary. My focus is to comment on what people are talking about. It just so happens that this is what people are talking about. Right now, you go to dinner, and everyone wants to talk about Donald Trump the whole time. Love \u2019em or hate \u2019em, he is Topic No. 1, 2 and 4. Would you want to host this year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner? If it seemed like it was going to be very uncomfortable, I would consider it. I\u2019m attracted to that kind of situation. But I don\u2019t know that it would be worth all the blowback. I did it once  \u2014   it went well. Why put myself through that nightmare again? My dream is to be only saddled with doing [the talk show]. That would be just fine with me.'"}, "time": 1742563829.7404745}
