S. is pulling out of the Paris climate accord  \u2014   with one senior U. N. adviser calling Trump \u201can idiot\u201d and a former climate envoy saying the U. S. is now \u201ca rogue state. \u201d[Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and senior adviser to the U. N.   since 2002, told Bloomberg Television Friday that President Trump lives in a \u201cdream world\u201d and is an \u201cidiot\u201d for his decision to pull out of the treaty. He also blamed the decision on the left\u2019s favorite boogeymen  \u2014   the Koch Brothers.  \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, this is obvious he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s happening behind here is real politics. This is the victory paid and carried out for 20 years by two people: David and Charles Koch. \u201d \u201cThis is all about the Koch brothers, I\u2019m sorry to say it, they have bought and purchased the top of the Republican Party,\u201d Sachs said, pointing also to House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s ( ) support of Trump\u2019s position. Sach\u2019s Koch claim is particularly unusual in that President Trump and the Koch Brothers have frequently clashed on a number of issues. The conservative patriarchs refused to back Trump in 2016, while Trump mocked conservatives who sought their backing  \u2014   once accusing Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) of being their \u201cpuppet. \u201d Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the \u201dpuppet\u201d of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016,  Sachs, who was retained by current   Ant\u00f3nio Guterres this year, is known for his   views. In April, he wrote a column titled: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Climate Fantasies. \u201d \u201cIn less than 100 days, we have learned that Trump is a man living in a fantasy world. He issues decrees, barks orders, sends out midnight Tweets, but to no avail. The facts  \u2014   real ones, not his \u2018alternative\u2019 variety  \u2014   keep intervening,\u201d Sachs wrote. He has also called Trump a \u201c  font of lies\u201d in a column in March. Sachs\u2019 remarks come after a former U. N. special envoy on climate change, Mary Robinson, said the decision makes \u201ca rogue state on the international stage. \u201d It isn\u2019t the first time Robinson, a former president of Ireland, has made such remarks. In November, she said in a Reuters interview, \u201cIt would be a tragedy for the United States and the people of the United States if the U. S. becomes a kind of rogue country, the only country in the world that is somehow not going to go ahead with the Paris Agreement. \u201d   Guterres was more restrained in his language, calling Trump\u2019s decision \u201ca major disappointment. \u201d \u201cThe decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security,\u201d Guterres\u2019 spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said in a statement Thursday. However, he remained optimistic and said he \u201clooks forward to engaging with the American government and  all actors in the United States and around the world to build the sustainable future on which our grandchildren depend. \u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
