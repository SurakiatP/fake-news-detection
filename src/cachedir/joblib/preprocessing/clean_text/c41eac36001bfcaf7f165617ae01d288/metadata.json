Last week, speaking to a sympathetic crowd in Chicago, she also pointed a finger in a surprising new direction: at herself. \u201cI personally know I have work to do on this front a lot of people tell pollsters they don\u2019t trust me,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a speech to the   Coalition on June 27. \u201cIt is certainly true I have made mistakes,\u201d she said a moment later, adding, \u201cSo I understand people having questions. \u201d The questions grew far more intense after the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey Jr. on Tuesday bluntly contradicted numerous statements Mrs. Clinton and her aides had made over the past year in defending her email practices as secretary of state. Though Mr. Comey\u2019s stark critique of her actions as \u201cextremely careless\u201d came after he recommended that she not be criminally charged, it cast a harsh light on perhaps the central challenge to Mrs. Clinton and her campaign: how to get skeptical voters to trust her. Yet the snippet of introspection last week from Mrs. Clinton, a candidate not known for public   may have signaled an important shift in how she and her campaign hope to do just that. \u201cYou can\u2019t just talk someone into trusting you,\u201d she told her audience. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to earn it. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers say there is little she can do to address this trust deficit  . While a candidate seen as unprepared could give speeches and interviews to demonstrate intellectual and policy heft, and intimate, folksy events could help address likability issues, distrust is not something that a week of themed events or a rollout of new proposals can correct. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic set of words you can say to wash all that away,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, a campaign spokeswoman, who was referring specifically to Republican attacks, not to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own acts, as having eroded trust. \u201cOnce she has the job,\u201d Ms. Palmieri added, \u201cher performance, and how hard she works for the people she represents, quells those doubts. \u201d So Mrs. Clinton will not bluntly ask voters to trust her, aides said. Instead, she will try to own up to the fact that many voters do not, and will discuss this in more personal terms, depending on the setting and audience. At the same time, aides said, Mrs. Clinton will try to build, or rebuild, trust with voters by demonstrating competence and a devotion to policies that are important to them, like making college more affordable, achieving equal pay for women, and enacting paid family and medical leave. For Mrs. Clinton, that means emphasizing how she won over skeptical New Yorkers when she ran for the Senate in 2000 after having just moved to the state. \u201cA lot of voters had doubts about me,\u201d she said in the Chicago speech. \u201cI delivered for people, and they learned they could count on me to fight for them. And in the end, I earned their trust. \u201d Trust is not a problem exclusive to Mrs. Clinton: Never have polls shown the presumptive nominees of both major parties so distrusted or disliked. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that only 45 percent of voters considered the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, honest and trustworthy just 37 percent said so of Mrs. Clinton. The nearest comparison to her predicament may involve Richard M. Nixon, who polished his image before successfully reintroducing himself to voters in 1968. \u201cHe did it by focusing on all the things he brought to the table: foreign policy experience and a different approach to Johnson on Vietnam,\u201d said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a speechwriter for Nixon and later Ronald Reagan. Yet the time for reintroductions is long past, and opinions about Mrs. Clinton are arguably even more entrenched. Even the brochure at the Chicago luncheon referred to the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals and described Mrs. Clinton as \u201cthe only first lady to have been subpoenaed. \u201d (A   spokesman told The Chicago Tribune that a volunteer\u2019s \u201cbrain freeze\u201d was to blame.) \u201cRealistically speaking, it is pretty hard in today\u2019s media and political environment for the   candidate to significantly lift up how voters perceive them on trust,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster and senior adviser to Priorities USA Action, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton. \u201cVoters are much more inclined to believe the bad things they hear about a political figure than the good things,\u201d he said. Showing contrition so close to the election could also ring hollow: It took months after the email scandal broke for Mrs. Clinton to admit she had made a mistake. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s trust problem is also different from Mr. Trump\u2019s, polls show. In the most recent New York   News poll, some 62 percent of registered voters said Mrs. Clinton said what she thought people wanted to hear most of the time, rather than what she believed, compared with 39 percent who said the same about Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s more like she\u2019s saying things because they\u2019re politically correct or because they further her agenda, rather than because it\u2019s coming from the heart,\u201d said Alan Podmore, 53, of West Hills, Calif. Even her supporters tell pollsters that they do not trust her, a weakness Republicans identified early and have tried to capitalize on for more than a year. Voters often cite the emails or her paid speeches to Wall Street banks as reasons for their distrust, but they also point to past Clinton scandals and to a vague gut feeling that she has never been completely truthful. \u201cIt goes all the way back to when she was first lady,\u201d said Misty Leach, 43, a high school teacher in McDonough, Ga. \u201cI remember her going on TV about the Monica Lewinsky thing and saying, \u2018It was just a Republican conspiracy to get my husband.\u2019 No, it wasn\u2019t. \u201d Mrs. Clinton must also tread carefully in asking voters to trust her as a policy maker while forgiving or setting aside mistakes like the email imbroglio. Thanks to Mr. Comey, Republicans can now argue more persuasively that she neglected the public interest, took risks with national security and broke faith with voters. \u201cHillary Clinton has spent the last 16 months looking into cameras deliberately lying to the American people,\u201d said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. The Democratic convention in Philadelphia this month will present Mrs. Clinton with her most significant opportunity to address her trustworthiness. Her campaign plans to release biographical videos showing how she has delivered on promises to help children and families throughout her career. And the party will lean on President Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren, among others, to vouch for her. Conventions can indeed work wonders: In the 1992 campaign, when Bill Clinton contended with accusations of adultery and   his aides produced the \u201cMan from Hope\u201d video, which reintroduced him as a   kid who made good. But aides to Mrs. Clinton also take solace from polls showing that voters believe she is more prepared than Mr. Trump to be commander in chief and that she is looking out for the middle class. \u201cYou can never forget that elections are about choices,\u201d said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief strategist. Demolishing an opponent\u2019s trustworthiness can also be fairly quick work in politics: Mrs. Clinton is assailing Mr. Trump\u2019s credibility and honesty in many areas, from his record in business to his campaign promises. Still, attacking Mr. Trump, no matter how successfully, will not necessarily fix what is broken in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s relationship with voters. \u201cTrust is one of the hardest things to regain once it\u2019s lost, whether it\u2019s with   friends, relatives, spouses, kids,\u201d said Russell J. Schriefer, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney. \u201cThere are two things that drive us in politics: the head and the heart,\u201d he added. \u201cTrust is a question of heart. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628458.0042608}
