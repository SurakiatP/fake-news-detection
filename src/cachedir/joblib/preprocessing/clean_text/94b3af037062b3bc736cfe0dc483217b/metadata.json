C. From the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cAs much as I might love poking fun at the media and as much as you kind of deserve it sometimes, your job has never been harder,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re basically get paid to stand in a cage while a geriatric orangutan screams at you.   \u2026     You expose injustice against the weak and you continue to   the president as if he might someday get embarrassed! Tonight is for you. \u201d   \u2026     The special\u2019s commercial breaks were led with taped sketches of Bee roasting a handful of previous presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Bill Clinton, complete with   garb. \u201cThis story has more wrinkles than the president\u2019s nutsack,\u201d she said of Ronald Reagan and the   affair, while Richard Nixon \u201cachieved John F. Kennedy\u2019s two goals: landing a man on the moon and getting f \u2014  ed by a deep throat. \u201d The final sketch of this series had Bee roasting Mike Pence, who became president after Trump died after \u201cgetting his head stuck in a jar of honey. \u201d She was shown wearing a chastity belt and a   turtleneck: \u201cI attempted to cover my pillows but the slut shines through. \u201d   \u2026     One   segment skewered Jeff Zucker and CNN. \u201cZucker\u2019s greatest success besides The Apprentice  \u2014   which, by the way, thanks for that  \u2014   is filling airtime between car crashes with a reality show loosely based on the news where   hacks make us measurably dumber by spewing mendacious nonsense while a hologram of Anderson Cooper stand by,\u201d said Bee, pleading for the network to \u201cfree\u201d its journalists. \u201cAnderson is a smart reporter! Give him his black   back and put him in front of a natural disaster!\u201d She added, \u201cCNN gives you news like your shitty boyfriend gives you orgasms: in the end, you wind up lying in the wet spot and he\u2019s snoring. \u201d For the rest of the article, click here. The TBS program Full Frontal with Samantha Bee\u2019s Not the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner is set to air Saturday at 10 p. m. eastern.'"}, "time": 1742564577.6276765}
