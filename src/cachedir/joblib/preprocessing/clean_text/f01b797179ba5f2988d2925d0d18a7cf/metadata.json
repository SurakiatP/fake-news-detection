Supreme Court just filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch was a key factor in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House victory last November. [Speaking of the the Supreme Court vacancy, Sen. McConnell told the Washington Examiner, \u201cAt the end, this issue more than any other elected Donald Trump, because, at the end, you had two candidates who were overwhelmingly unpopular. \u201d  McConnell noted that blocking President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat suddenly left vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016 was important. As Obama\u2019s remaining months in office wound down last year, he made the uncommon move of nominating a replacement for Scalia instead of waiting for the results of the   election and allowing the next president to make a nomination. As leader of the Senate, McConnell decided not to allow the Garland nomination to move forward, arguing that since the election was so close, the next president  \u2014   whether it be Trump or Clinton  \u2014   should be allowed the nomination. According to McConnell, the possibility that a Republican could get the next nomination energized the drive to elect Trump. \u201cNobody was predicting Trump would get 90 percent of the Republican vote just like Mitt Romney did [in 2012,] but he did,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd the single biggest reason was, they wanted him to make the Supreme Court appointment, not Hillary Clinton. \u201d \u201cThis call was made in February,\u201d McConnell concluded. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who our nominee was going to be yet. What I did not predict was that we would nominate somebody who a lot of Republicans questioned whether he was a Republican. I mean, after all, Donald Trump was having fundraisers for [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer four or five years ago. \u201d Before his election, Donald Trump met with several groups of conservatives and asked for their recommendation as to whom he should pick for the Supreme Court and then made the unusual move of publicizing his list of possible picks. Trump\u2019s move brought in many voices of support for his campaign that he may not otherwise have won.
