[\u201cWe are listening to our colleagues, from those who are the most conservative to those who are the most moderate, about what are the final solutions that we need to achieve, so we can reach consensus,\u201d said Rep. Kevin Brady (R. ) whose committee approved the RyanCare bill March 9. Brady is one of the committee chairmen who approved the \u201cmanager\u2019s amendments\u201d Monday, which made modest changes to the bill.  Thursday\u2019s vote on the bill was canceled by Ryan after a bloc of conservatives, led by the House Freedom Caucus, secured north of 25  \u201cno\u201d votes. With 237 GOP congressman, Ryan cannot lose more 22 votes to reach the 216 votes required for passage. The Ryancare bill is still a work in progress, Brady said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s clear we do not have the votes, no one is walking away from the table \u2014  that means our members here in the House and certainly not in the White House as well, so let\u2019s stay at the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of new solutions to try to reach that common ground let\u2019s just keep working towards it,\u201d he said. Breitbart News spoke to the chairman less than 100 feet from Ryan\u2019s office, where the speaker was meeting with members of the House Freedom Caucus and senior aides to President Donald Trump.'"}, "time": 1742563067.6850502}
