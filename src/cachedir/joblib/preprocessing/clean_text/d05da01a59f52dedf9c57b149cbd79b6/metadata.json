That, in fact, is why the case was re-opened yesterday. \\nIf those new details prove particularly damning for Hillary, the FBI could very well recommend criminal charges against the former Secretary of State and current Democratic nominee for president. \\nWorse yet, that FBI recommendation could come before the election. \\nWhether or not she intends to keep the promise she made four months ago, the spotlight will certainly then fall on Lynch to act and act fast. \\nWhat she\u2019ll do next is anyone\u2019s guess. \\nBut keep in mind Lynch is an Obama appointee. And if history is any indication, when given the choice between doing what is right and doing what is not right, Obama and his friends will choose the latter option every time.
