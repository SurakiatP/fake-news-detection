Putin, the president of Russia, called for cooperation with the new American administration in his annual state of the nation address.

Mattis, a former general who served in the Middle East and is known for his critical stance toward Iran, will be his nominee for defense secretary. We mapped out the array of conflicts of interest that Mr. Trump\u2019s global business empire presents. And the  \u2019s freewheeling exchanges with foreign dignitaries prompted the White House to urge him to seek diplomats\u2019 counsel. _____ \u2022 Hallucinogens help cancer patients. Psilocybin, an ingredient found in hallucinogenic mushrooms, can significantly reduce anxiety and depression in the patients, according to a new study. The drug, administered via wooden goblet in one study, has been illegal in the U. S. for more than 40 years. _____ \u2022 British ministers said that the country could agree to pay the European Union to retain access to its single market.

Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report today will be scrutinized as the last indicator of unemployment and wages before the Federal Reserve\u2019s likely increase in interest rates. \u2022 Global bond markets are plunging.

[Der Spiegel] \u2022 Greece\u2019s war of words with Turkey on territorial claims has deepened before bilateral talks this weekend. [Ekathimerini] \u2022 Ban   the departing secretary general of the United Nations, apologized for the organization\u2019s role in the cholera outbreak that has claimed 10, 000 lives. [The New York Times] \u2022 At least 350 people have come forward to report sexual abuse at the hands of youth soccer coaches in Britain, deepening a scandal that has engulfed English soccer. [The New York Times] \u2022 Israel sent its first ambassador to Turkey in five years, just as the Turkish high court takes up a case involving the debacle that broke relations: the lethal Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara, a ship challenging the Gaza blockade. [H\u00fcrriyet] \u2022 There are no laws in the Shuafat Refugee Camp, where 80, 000 people live surrounded by a   concrete wall, despite it being inside the city of Jerusalem. [The New York Times] \u2022 Scotland plans to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12, from 8, currently the lowest in Europe. [The Scotsman] \u2022   century Paris, the harrowing escape of an American slave and a seemingly ordinary Korean housewife turning vegetarian after a terrifying dream: These are The New York Times Book Review\u2019s 10 Best Books of 2016. \u2022 In memoriam: The actor Andrew Sachs, who played Manuel in the British comedy series \u201cFawlty Towers,\u201d died at 86. \u2022 Buzz Aldrin, the    adventurer and former astronaut who was the second person to walk on the moon, was evacuated from Antarctica after he became ill while visiting the South Pole with a tourism group. \u2022 Isabelle Huppert, the French actress, chooses roles that are sometimes hard to watch. And yet we can\u2019t bring ourselves to look away. \u2022 Recipients of a new British scholarship will spend time in Buckingham Palace, but don\u2019t get the wrong idea: They will cook, cater and otherwise serve the British royals. \u2022 A    Alaskan environmentalist with no formal design education is challenging a fashion world dogma: Is all fur bad fur? \u2022 Zinedine Zidane may not be the perfect soccer club manager, but he could well be perfect for Real Madrid. \u2022 And \u201cSnow Beach,\u201d a new book, chronicles the style of snowboarding culture in the 1980s and 90s. Artists, art collectors, curators and the scenesters who surround them are in Miami this week for Art Basel Miami Beach. It\u2019s a spinoff of the fair held in Switzerland. (There\u2019s also a Hong Kong version). Despite the party atmosphere, the art world may intimidate the uninitiated  \u2014   especially with its terminology  \u2014   so we\u2019re here to offer some help. Showcasing \u201cthe masters of Modern and contemporary art\u201d is Art Basel\u2019s stated aim. Those categories may sound redundant, but they\u2019re not. While \u201cmodern\u201d can indicate the present, it is also tied to ideas that \u201cwere new or even experimental\u201d when they were developed, according to the Museum of Modern Art. Contemporary means work by living artists. Just don\u2019t confuse \u201cmaster\u201d with \u201cOld Master,\u201d which is a \u201cdistinguished European artist from about 1500 to the early 1700s. \u201d Think Michelangelo. At a gallery, you might enter a room with related sculptures. This isn\u2019t an installation unless it encourages \u201cactive engagement\u201d by the spectator. And if you\u2019re thinking of calling something \u201csublime,\u201d you\u2019re saying the piece is \u201cworthy of reverence,\u201d according to MoMA. One last tip: Remember, the artists and the dealers are also nervous about how you\u2019ll react. \u201cWhat depresses me the most is if people walk past the booth and don\u2019t stop,\u201d a dealer told The Times this summer. \u201cI want people to come in and then have a journey. \u201d Christopher Shea contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
