Seven years later, she is in her second year of college, and law school is in reach. (With a scholarship in hand, modeling is no longer a financial requirement.) In 2009, Curtis Byers was a shy    with a halo of hair, an aptitude for science and an allergy to school. Seven years later, the halo has been buzzed short, but the love of science remains and he is aiming for a career in veterinary care. In 2009, the oldest of the three Byers siblings, Daniel, was 17 and a student at Park West High School in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in Manhattan, where he was preparing for a career in cooking. Seven years later, he is a professional cook, with a string of restaurant jobs and catering work on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. His current goal: culinary school (and a way to pay for it). And from her   Harlem apartment, Lynette Byers, now 85, keeps an eye on all three  \u2014   the boys still at home and Rayshell in her second year at Salem College, an  \u2019s university in   N. C. That is a little too far for Ms. Byers\u2019s complete comfort, even though Rayshell has provided her with an iPhone to keep in touch via text and FaceTime. \u201cI can text her,\u201d Ms. Byers said, \u201cand if she doesn\u2019t get back to me, I\u2019m right on the phone. \u201d It was the goals, dreams and hopes of the Byerses that led the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, to give them $289 seven years ago  \u2014   $110 for an electric mixer and baking tins for Daniel, $50 for Rayshell\u2019s application fee to an   arts program and $129 for a toolbox for Curtis. Ms. Byers and her sons are not sure where the mixer and toolbox went. \u201cWe put it in the bank,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it went to good use. \u201d Strangers still mistake Ms. Byers for her children\u2019s grandmother, which did not bother her in 2009 and does not bother her now. She took in all three as foster babies  \u2014   they are genetic siblings  \u2014   and formally adopted them when she was in her 60s, after her own son had grown. \u201cI guess they keep me young,\u201d she said. During a recent interview, it hardly seemed that seven years had passed, except that Ms. Byers\u2019s sons are taller. (Daniel is 6 feet 6 inches, and Curtis is just a few inches shorter.) Daniel gets Rayshell on FaceTime, and the Byerses huddle around on Ms. Byers\u2019s easy chair for a talk that defies both time and distance. Rayshell talks classes: criminal law, psychology, English, professional writing. \u201cYou can tell you\u2019re going to be a lawyer,\u201d her mother teases. \u201cYou keep talking. \u201d Daniel pulls out his personal phone, which is filled with photos of dishes he has created: his own spins on baked chicken, rice and cabbage, shrimp Alfredo, a variety of soul food dishes and lots of Mexican food. \u201cI like spicy,\u201d he said. Daniel added that he spends at least three hours a day cooking, even on days when he is not working. And that is fine with Ms. Byers, who is content to let Daniel do the shopping and the cooking, even if he is not as good with the cleaning up. Daniel\u2019s restaurant jobs mean long hours  \u2014   he sometimes leaves the house at 4 a. m.  \u2014   and he is trying to save for culinary school. Right now, Ms. Byers said, \u201cIt costs too much, and he doesn\u2019t want to go into debt. \u201d Curtis, then as now, is the quietest, and still does not like to talk about himself unless the subject is his skill at video games. Then he gets very technical in a blur of conversation about the tools he uses, the games he plays and the avatars he employs. \u201cIt started when I was young,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into it with the graphics. \u201d But when talk turns to the future, Curtis grows more serious: \u201cI want to work with animals. \u201d Financing that education is a problem here, too. The family\u2019s participation in the Neediest Cases campaign looms large in their memories. It goes beyond the money itself. \u201cIt made me realize,\u201d Rayshell said, \u201cthat I wanted to be in a position where I could be the one to help. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563654.9666257}
