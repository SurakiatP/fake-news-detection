Trump canceling political events on Friday and striking different tones about the killings. Mr. Trump called the episode \u201can attack on our country,\u201d and Mrs. Clinton used it as evidence of the need for \u201cmore love and kindness. \u201d \u201cWe must stand in solidarity with law enforcement, which we must remember is the force between civilization and total chaos,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a video statement that his campaign released to TV networks on Friday evening. He also alluded to the two black men, Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. who were killed by white police officers this week. \u201cEvery American has the right to live in safety and peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe will make America safe again. \u201d In an interview with CNN, Mrs. Clinton praised the Dallas officers and called the attack \u201can absolutely horrific event. \u201d She promptly brought the conversation back to the shootings of Mr. Castile and Mr. Sterling, which were recorded in graphic videos that reignited outrage and debate over the treatment of black men by white police officers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything possible to support our police and to support innocent Americans who have encounters with police,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. She vowed to fight \u201csystemic racism\u201d in police departments and to better train law enforcement officials and integrate them into the communities they serve. She also called on white Americans to empathize with   who live in fear of clashes with the police. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who have to start listening to the legitimate cries that are coming from our   fellow citizens,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. On Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton offered condolences to the families of the police officers killed in Dallas. \u201cI mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families and all who serve with them,\u201d Mrs. Clinton posted on Twitter. She postponed a rally with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Scranton, Pa. that had been scheduled for Friday. But she did address the shootings of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile, and the Dallas attacks, at a conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, where emotions were raw on Friday afternoon. \u201cThere is too much violence, too much hate, too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the group. She said she knew she would upset some people by calling for an overhaul of the criminal justice system while praising law enforcement officials. \u201cBut all these things can be true at once,\u201d she said. On Friday morning, Mr. Trump asked the New York Police Department if he could address an afternoon roll call at a Midtown Manhattan precinct to show solidarity with the police, but the department denied his request, according to the police commissioner, William J. Bratton. \u201cOur interest is in staying out of the politics of the moment, not to provide \u201d Mr. Bratton said during a news conference at Police Headquarters in Manhattan. A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Jason Miller, said neither the candidate nor anyone from the campaign had requested a roll call appearance. The events in Dallas came weeks after the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. which forced both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump to address bigotry, homegrown terrorism and gun violence. The attack on Thursday has now added urgency for both candidates and their parties to address racial divisions in the country while showing support for its law enforcement officials. Mrs. Clinton made criminal justice reform and improving relations between police forces and black communities central to her Democratic primary campaign, calling for an end to the \u201cera of mass incarceration. \u201d She often appeared at campaign events with the mothers of black men killed in clashes with the police. Appearing alongside Mr. Biden would have complicated that message. The vice president enjoys a close bond with police officers, but he also played a central role in enacting the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. That legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, put more police officers on the streets, built dozens of new prisons and created tougher penalties for drug offenders. It has been widely criticized as having an adverse impact on black communities and the high levels of incarceration, arrests and police presence that have contributed to the current tensions. Mrs. Clinton has not put as much emphasis on the issue of criminal justice in the general election campaign. That approach is expected to change after the deaths of Mr. Castile and Mr. Sterling and the killings in Dallas. If Mr. Trump intended to project a measured reaction to the shootings, his campaign\u2019s state chairman in Virginia, Corey Stewart, went sharply in a different direction. Mr. Stewart, who is also reported to be planning a run for governor in Virginia in 2017, posted on Facebook as news of the shooting was developing, explicitly blaming Mrs. Clinton for the deaths. \u201cLiberal politicians who label police as racists  \u2014   specifically Hillary Clinton and Virginia Lt. Governor Ralph Northam  \u2014   are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight,\u201d Mr. Stewart wrote in a post that he later deleted. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said, \u201cCorey does not speak for the campaign, and this is not something we agree with. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628505.0918078}
