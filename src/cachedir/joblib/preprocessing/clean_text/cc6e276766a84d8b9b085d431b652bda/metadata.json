But a piece of her heart never quite left the   plains of West Texas  \u2014   not Midland, where she spent her adolescence, or Lubbock, where she attended Texas Tech University. She would send her itinerary to her Friends and Family List, so that if she were singing in Vienna or Sydney or Timbuktu and someone from home happened to be there, they could connect. Clay Brakeley long held a place of honor on that list. They had met at college in 1983 (she was a graduate student in music he was an undergraduate in theater  \u2014   as part of a boisterous social scene that gravitated toward Ms. Graham\u2019s place, known as the Party Hut. \u201cIt was a little   rental house near the campus, and we were the repository for lost and wayward souls,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never knew who was going to be sleeping on the couch when you woke up. \u201d Young, brash and prone to roaring around town on a motorcycle, Mr. Brakeley first caught her eye and then her ear as she gave him voice lessons. \u201cHe has a great voice and sang Riff in \u2018West Side Story,\u2019\u201d she said, snapping her fingers and cooing softly. \u201c\u2018Boy, boy, crazy boy, get cool boy!\u2019 I taught him that. \u201d Soon they were an item (\u201cShe chased me till I caught her,\u201d is how he likes to put it) in that haphazard way that college couples often are. When in 1985 she moved to New York to attend the Manhattan School of Music, he visited a few times, and their relationship fell back into its carefree rhythms. But eventually distance and careers divided them, and they sought love in closer proximity. \u201cWe both understood that we were moving in different circles at that point, but there was always a little something underneath when we would see each other,\u201d Mr. Brakeley said. His own life turned peripatetic when he moved to Los Angeles and began working in lighting and stagecraft for Bonnie Raitt, Neil Diamond, Bon Jovi and the Jacksons (Michael and Janet). And as Ms. Graham\u2019s itineraries kept arriving  \u2014   first as letters, then as emails  \u2014   their paths would occasionally intersect: Lunch in Chicago. A rock concert in San Francisco. Her stellar performance of a signature role, Octavian in Strauss\u2019s \u201c Rosenkavalier,\u201d at the Met. And two memorable days in Paris in 1996, when she was singing Dorabella in Mozart\u2019s \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte\u201d at the Palais Garnier for the first time, and he had flown in from touring Ireland with Michael Bolton to see her  \u2014   and to get his   roadie\u2019s hair lopped off at a salon. (She requested that he wait a day so she could gaze at his leonine mane a bit longer.) \u201cI was in a relationship with somebody else, and none of those encounters were anything but just friendly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always great to see him and there was always, I think, a little bit of sizzle, a little bit of familiarity and comfort. \u201d In 2000, Mr. Brakeley was married. Six years later he and his wife had twins  \u2014   a son, Finn, and a daughter, Sydney. Meanwhile, Ms. Graham, her career soaring, thought that marriage and children were not an option. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a choice,\u201d she said. \u201cMy career was my child. My career took all of my energy and all of my nurturing and all of my love, and it was very fulfilling. \u201d \u201cI had some fantastic relationships, and I do not for a minute regret a single one of them or a single minute of my life,\u201d she said. But the complexities of dating men not comfortable with her increasing fame won out, and she wondered if perhaps she would grow old, with cats, in her \u201cheart home,\u201d Santa Fe, N. M. (She also has an apartment in New York.) In February 2010, Mr. Brakeley, by now separated and working in production for auto shows, discovered that he and Ms. Graham would be in Chicago at the same time. So he called and offered to cook her dinner at the apartment she was staying in while performing with the Lyric Opera. \u201cI knew that his life had sort of been blown apart,\u201d she said, \u201cand he needed a friend. \u201d She, in turn, invited him to escort her that weekend to the opera\u2019s gala, with instructions to meet her at the stage door. \u201cHe showed up with the hair perfectly done, the tuxedo, the long black cashmere coat, the black leather gloves, looking so sharp,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, he\u2019s got it going on. \u2019\u201d Guiding her with his hand on her back, he instinctively understood whom she wanted to talk to and whom they should avoid. And she had forgotten how well he could move until he twirled her across the floor. The   at which the women reclined on sofas while dangling their pumps from their toes and the men loosened their ties and drank Scotch, reminded them of a champagne ad. But mostly they were intoxicated with each other. \u201cI think that cemented a reconnected time, and it has been that way ever since,\u201d Mr. Brakeley said. \u201cShe has always been a bright light and a positive individual, and it\u2019s very easy to fall under that particular spell. \u201d (\u201cYou are scintillating,\u201d he wrote in a note to her afterward.) At four in the morning, he kissed her good night in front of her apartment building, then walked to his hotel across the street. But as the time approached for them to attend a Super Bowl party later that afternoon, Ms. Graham started to worry. \u201cI thought, O. K. this is a big   point  \u2014   because last night was great and do we go forward like we\u2019re dating? Or do we go forward like we\u2019re still just buddies and last night didn\u2019t really have the import that it might have had?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was a little skittish because I thought, you can\u2019t screw it up with somebody who has been your friend for 25 years. You don\u2019t want to rashly go into something that you\u2019re not sure about. But at the same time, how can you be sure at that moment? So we sort of just went forward as if we were pretending we were dating. \u201d By the end of their stay in Chicago, Mr. Brakeley was mapping out opportunities to meet months in the future. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Whoa, hold on, buddy. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m willing to commit that far out,\u2019\u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cBecause first of all, he was separated for over a year but he wasn\u2019t completely divorced yet, and he had two little kids. And I guess I didn\u2019t know what it would feel like to be   in a bona fide relationship. \u201d But she also realized that she didn\u2019t want to lose him again, and decided to take the leap. With their mutual passion for music and theater as well as an understanding of the stress that accompanies a major career, they found that their lives blended seamlessly. And on the rare occasion when she acted the diva, he sweetly reminded her that he had worked for Michael Jackson, who was an even bigger star than she was. Two years later, it was Ms. Graham who sought a commitment and Mr. Brakeley who was reluctant to give it. But when it became clear that they were going to be together, with or without marriage, she made peace with their arrangement. \u201cI always wanted to get married sometime, but I never was in the right place at the right time with the right person to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce I found him, I thought, this is the right place and the right time and the right person, but he has to want it, too. \u201d On July 23, 2015, Ms. Graham, who had been touring Australia, met Mr. Brakeley and his twins on Maui. It was her 55th birthday, and at the end of the festivities, he presented her with one last gift: a box holding three diamond bands in white, yellow and rose gold, symbolizing Mr. Brakeley and each of his children. \u201cIf you take one of us, you get all three of us,\u201d he told the stunned Ms. Graham as he proposed, with an elated Finn and Sydney, now 10, jumping up and down in the background. \u201cPart of the reason that she is who she is in her career is because of how open and inviting she is,\u201d said Mr. Brakeley, 51. \u201cShe has all of these friends in all of these places all over the world. And that is the thing that hasn\u2019t changed since she was in college. Underneath it all she is the same person. She just happens to be the same person with this really famous aspect of herself. And I think it\u2019s wonderful. \u201d Laughing, Ms. Graham said, \u201cDeep down, I\u2019m just a very, very simple girl who has been thrust into an extraordinary life. \u201d On Sept. 17, Ms. Graham and Mr. Brakeley were married at Las Campanas Country Club in Santa Fe, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains silhouetted in the distance beneath a harvest moon. Irene Swain, a nondenominational minister, officiated at a ceremony filled with poetry written for the couple by Arnold Adoff and a Native American blessing in honor of the New Mexican landscape (both the bride and groom were born in the state). Ms. Graham\u2019s eyes welled up, she later recalled, as Mr. Brakeley spoke to her generous spirit and beautiful nature, and she compared him to her deceased father, whom she likened to a towering redwood, during their vows. \u201cYou are the only man since my father on whom I know I can rely to be for me and take care of me when I need it, and even when I don\u2019t think that I do,\u201d she said. The   Sasha Cooke sang Jake Heggie\u2019s \u201cMy True Love Hath My Heart\u201d during the ceremony. The soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming serenaded the couple with a cover of Etta James\u2019s \u201cAt Last\u201d for their first dance. \u201cIt took a long time to get here but it happened  \u2014   we got it done,\u201d said Ms. Graham\u2019s mother, Betty Graham Webber. \u201cShe waited a long time, but he would be worth waiting for. He\u2019s a great guy. I\u2019m very proud of Suzy. \u201d The couple honeymooned briefly in Santa Fe before heading to performances in Boston, after which Ms. Graham headed alone to Toledo, Spain. These were their first journeys in a married life that will find them reconnecting as a family in New York or Burbank, Calif. where Mr. Brakeley lives with his twins (who, to the delight of their new stepmother, are members of the Los Angeles Children\u2019s Chorus and appeared in the Los Angeles Opera production of Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d last spring). Marrying Mr. Brakeley 33 years after their first encounter \u201cwas a euphoria beyond anything I\u2019ve ever felt on the stage,\u201d Ms. Graham said after the wedding. \u201cIt beats the best curtain call I\u2019ve ever taken. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564361.0989165}
