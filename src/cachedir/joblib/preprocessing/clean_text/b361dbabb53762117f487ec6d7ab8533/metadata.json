Instead, all that\u2019s needed is a good pair of clippers and some nerve. \u201cEver since I shaved my head, I really bloomed,\u201d said Alana Derksen, a    Toronto resident, whose buzz cut frequently draws admiring comments from her more than 21, 000 Instagram followers. \u201cIt\u2019s given me this confidence I never had. \u201d Ms. Derksen had wanted to shave her head for years but refrained out of fear of how her \u201cconservative\u201d family would react. Then, late one night last summer during a tense trip home, she finally gave in to the impulse, cutting off her hair in her parents\u2019 bathroom and using a Bic razor to finish the job. Now, she said, she\u2019s so used to her bald head, which she maintains with electric clippers, she has nightmares about her hair growing back. Even her parents have come around on the shorn \u2019do. \u201cAt first they thought there was something wrong with me,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they love it. \u201d Regardless of parental approval, it seems more and more women are taking up the clippers to make a statement  \u2014   sartorial or otherwise. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely noticed this trend on the streets recently,\u201d said Andrea Donoghue, who owns Laurel, a private studio in the East Village. \u201cI think it\u2019s a trickle down from what\u2019s been happening in fashion lately. \u201d Models like Ruth Bell, whose career took off after she got buzzed for an Alexander McQueen campaign last year, have helped popularize the style. High fashion has always had an appreciation for a shaved head, but this time even   brands like Zara and Forever 21 embraced Ms. Bell. \u201cA client of mine recently came in with a picture of Ruth from a Zara campaign,\u201d Ms. Donoghue recalled. \u201cBefore, it was more punk,\u201d said Tamy Glauser, 31, whose nearly    buzz cut predates her modeling career. \u201cNow, people are starting to think maybe a shaved head is actually really chic and elegant. It\u2019s not just for skinheads. \u201d Ms. Glauser has walked the runway for Louis Vuitton for the last five seasons, and credits the designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s stamp of approval for helping to change the fashion industry\u2019s view on bald women. Fashion has always had a symbiotic (some may say parasitic) relationship to subculture. So while the buzz cut is more visible than ever within the fashion community, the trend is undeniably rooted in the street. Take  \u2019s recent Futurewise issue: One of its four covers features a buzz cut on the model Lina Hoss, but inside the issue, which was envisioned as \u201ca global portrait of youth, opinion and style in 2016,\u201d you can spot many more on the teenagers   by the publication. \u201cIndividuality and androgyny are certainly not a new thing in fashion, but the trend has swung back around due to a larger gender conversation,\u201d said Alastair McKimm, the fashion director at  . As awareness of the transgender community dawns in the United States, and as the English language grapples with new gender pronouns, millennials (sometimes called the   generation) are placing greater importance on expressing their identity through clothing, makeup  \u2014   and, yes, hair. \u201cA girl with a buzz cut is like Jaden Smith wearing a skirt,\u201d Ms. Glauser said, referring to Will Smith\u2019s son, who has publicly challenged gender norms through fashion. Ms. Glauser says that people often make assumptions about sexual orientation based on appearances, \u201cbut the two have nothing to do with each other. \u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s good for society to see people going against what we\u2019ve all been taught is the way we\u2019re supposed to dress for our sex and our orientation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize there\u2019s no right or wrong. \u201d Even for women who take up the clippers for completely unrelated reasons, the experience can prompt realizations about gender norms. \u201cThe first time, it was an impulsive decision,\u201d said Mackenzie Jones, 20, who has kept a shaved head since she was 15, when a bad breakup inspired the act. \u201cBut when I look back now, I think I did it  \u2014   without knowing it at the time  \u2014   because it was the ultimate rejection of the male gaze. \u201d Besides the obvious convenience and the aesthetic appeal, Ms. Jones said, she has stuck to the shorn style because, particularly when she was younger, it helped filter out potential suitors who weren\u2019t \u201con my level. \u201d (Plenty of guys, she adds, are into the look.) Dressing for one\u2019s self, not one\u2019s paramour, has been a theme in fashion for several seasons now, with the rise of athleisure and the growing importance placed on personal comfort. Unsurprisingly, those values have spread from our clothes to our hair. \u201cWomen are moving away from that long, pretty bohemian vibe that was happening for so long and starting to take more risks,\u201d Ms. Donoghue said. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid to not look pretty. \u201d Before taking the plunge, Ms. Donoghue recommends that   buzzers visit a salon to get a professional\u2019s opinion. \u201cSome head shapes are better for the style than others,\u201d she said. For those with unfortunately shaped heads, there is still hope: Ms. Donoghue said there are slight variations on the cut, like a \u201csubtle fade,\u201d in which the hair \u201chugs the nape and hairline a little tighter and then gradually fades into a round shape,\u201d which tends to be more flattering.   or not, what Ms. Donoghue can\u2019t prepare clients for is the ensuing feeling of exposure  \u2014   and liberation. \u201cA lot of women are very attached to their hair,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cWhen I was in a bad relationship, my hair was like this mask. Once it\u2019s all gone, you don\u2019t have anything left to change. You have to look yourself in the face and deal with it. It\u2019s really transformative. \u201d Which is why, regardless of how mainstream it becomes, the buzz cut will always be more than just a hairdo.'"}, "time": 1742561983.9989681}
