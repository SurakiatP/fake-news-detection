A long strip of deep and fertile soil pinched by sharply rising mountains, the valley has more than doubled its output of produce in recent decades and now grows well over half of America\u2019s leaf lettuce. Yet one place the valley\u2019s bounty of antioxidants does not often appear is on the tables of the migrant workers who harvest it. Public health officials here describe a crisis of poverty and malnutrition among the tens of thousands of farmworkers and their families who tend to the fields of lettuce, broccoli, celery, cauliflower and spinach, among many other crops, in an area called the salad bowl of the nation. More than a third of the children in the Salinas City Elementary School District are homeless overall diabetes rates are rising and projected to soar and 85 percent of farmworkers in the valley are overweight or obese, partly because unhealthy food is less costly, said Marc B. Schenker, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the health of farmworkers. \u201cThe people who grow our food can\u2019t afford to eat it, and they are sicker because of it,\u201d said Joel Diringer, a public health specialist and advocate for farmworkers. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible irony that those who work in the fields all day long don\u2019t have access to the fresh produce that they harvest. \u201d For decades, the fields of the Salinas Valley have been a revolving door of migrants, from the Okies of John Steinbeck\u2019s writings to the Latin American immigrants who tend the fields today.   percent of farmworkers in California are foreign born, primarily from Mexico, according to the United States Department of Labor. While the valley\u2019s vegetables are reaching an   number of American households, public health officials say there are no signs of improvement in the living conditions and diets of farmworkers. The popularity of sugary drinks and cultural preferences for filling but   foods like tacos and tamales contribute to the obesity of farmworkers and their families, public health officials say. Because an estimated half of agricultural workers in the Salinas Valley are in the country illegally, many do not have health insurance and go without treatment until symptoms become acute. The combination of high rents and low incomes  \u2014   wages typically fall in the range of $10 to $15 an hour  \u2014   leaves farmworkers with minimal and often inadequate money for food and is a contributor to the housing crisis in Salinas. Homelessness has risen so steadily in recent years that the Salinas City Elementary School District now has a liaison for students without permanent housing. Cheryl Camany, the school district\u2019s homeless liaison, listed the types of dwellings where some farmworkers slept: \u201cTents, encampments, abandoned buildings,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could be living in a toolshed, a chicken coop. \u201d Poverty and neglect among farmworkers is by no means new. Steinbeck, the valley\u2019s most famous native son, wrote in the 1930s about the \u201ccurious attitude toward a group that makes our agriculture successful. \u201d \u201cThe migrants are needed, and they are hated,\u201d he wrote, a sentiment that residents here feel has been revived with the election of Donald J. Trump as president and his promises to deport undocumented workers. At a diabetes and nutrition awareness class held at a nursery school in King City, overweight women from farmworker families were given a barrage of statistics on the dangers of poor diets, especially those excessive in sugar. \u201cTwo in five Americans will develop diabetes,\u201d Lisa Rico, the instructor, told the class in Spanish. \u201cBut for us it\u2019s one in two. \u201d The class was run by the Natividad Medical Foundation, a nonprofit that is part of Natividad Medical Center, a large hospital in Salinas. Ms. Rico read to the class the findings of a survey of 1, 200 young people in Monterey County, which includes Salinas: 72 percent of children under 10 years old and 83 percent of teenagers said they drank at least one soda a day adolescents drank 4. 5 times as many sugary drinks as water. A study published in March by the U. C. L. A. Center for Health Policy Research reported that 57 percent of residents in Monterey County had diabetes or prediabetes, just slightly above the California average of 55 percent. But Dr. Dana Kent, the medical director for health promotion and education at the Natividad Medical Foundation, said estimates among farmworkers might be low, especially among those who are undocumented and fearful to obtain medical services. \u201cWe get a sense that there are a lot of people out there who are undiagnosed,\u201d Dr. Kent said. On a recent afternoon, workers from Mexico and El Salvador harvested heads of iceberg lettuce in a field in Gonzales, a city in the heart of the Salinas Valley. The workers moved so quickly  \u2014   slicing, trimming the outer leaves and putting the heads of lettuce into plastic bags  \u2014   that they looked like actors in a film played at an accelerated speed. Angelica Beltran, the supervisor, said her workers typically ate six to eight tacos while at work and had two or three sodas during their shift. \u201cNo one drinks diet soda,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste good. \u201d Despite the frenetic pace of the work, farmworkers suffer from what Melissa Kendrick, the head of the Food Bank for Monterey County, calls the \u201cobesity paradox of the poor. \u201d \u201cThey are fat, yes, but they are malnourished because all they are eating is garbage,\u201d she said. The consumption of cheap, starchy food has been a major contributor to the epidemic of obesity across America. But the rates among farmworkers here are significantly higher: 85 percent are overweight or obese compared with 69 percent nationally. Some farmworkers in the Salinas Valley sleep next to the vegetables they cannot afford to buy. In a row of dusty,   apartments straddled by railway tracks and vast fields of broccoli, Maria Hernandez, 60, pays $520 a month for two tiny rooms, each about 18 feet across. Her extended family are Mexican immigrants who have spent their lives farming and picking strawberries, celery and other crops. She became aware of the need to eat healthily when both her mother and her sister were diagnosed with diabetes. \u201cAlthough we are surrounded by it, we don\u2019t eat it because it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said Antonia Tejada, Ms. Hernandez\u2019s daughter, who works the night shift at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe will buy a big bag of beans instead of a little thing of broccoli for $2 that won\u2019t feed even one person. \u201d Only an hour south of Silicon Valley, the Salinas Valley is a rural setting with urban prices. Israel de Jesus, who works as an interpreter at the Natividad Medical Center in Salinas, crowded into a home that rented for $1, 600 a month when he was doing farm work. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to save money because of the bills and the rent,\u201d Mr. de Jesus said. \u201cBut you have to save money so you can make it through the winter. \u201d Even when vegetables and other healthy foods are available or affordable, farmworkers sometimes opt for the satisfaction of comfort food. Brigita Gonzalez rises every day at 3:30 a. m. to prepare food for her husband, who leaves for the fields an hour later. When she made him a salad once to accompany his tacos, he returned in the evening with the salad unfinished. Ms. Gonzalez says her husband was needled by   for eating a salad: \u201cEverybody was like, \u2018What are you eating? \u2019\u201d Ms. Kendrick of the food bank said demand was strong for healthy foods, cultural preferences notwithstanding. The food bank gives out about five million meals a year and is raising money to build a large food warehouse on a   plot. Ms. Kendrick, who previously worked in Silicon Valley, said she was motivated by the idea that malnutrition and hunger were fixable in a country with so much wealth. \u201cI\u2019ve spent time in India, the Middle East, Southeast Asia  \u2014   third world countries where poverty is everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking when it\u2019s in your home state. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628340.7378223}
