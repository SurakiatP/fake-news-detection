That represents an increase of more than 350,000 checks over the previous October, itself a record. It\u2019s also the 18th month in a row to set a record. \\nWith two months to go, 2016 has already seen 22,206,233 NICS checks, making it the second highest year for checks in the history of NICS with only 2015 seeing more . \\nNICS checks are considered to be one of the most accurate indicators for gun sales because nearly all sales made through federally licensed firearm dealers require a check by law. The number of NICS checks in a month do not represent an exact count of gun sales for a number of reasons. For instance, many states require a NICS checks for those applying for gun carry permits, and many states do not require NICS checks for sales between private parties. \\n\u201cThese statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS,\u201d the FBI said. \u201cThey do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742562034.3324683}
