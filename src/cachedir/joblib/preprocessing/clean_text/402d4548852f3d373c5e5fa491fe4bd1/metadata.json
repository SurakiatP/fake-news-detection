Until two weeks ago. One   recording of Donald J. Trump boasting about how his stardom gave him license to grope women\u2019s private parts appears to have prompted the kind of change in public consciousness that usually takes decades. The lewd and aggressive comments by Mr. Trump, the Manhattan tycoon turned Republican presidential nominee, revealed a generational divide in the way many Americans understand sexual assault and consent. But, remarkably, the widespread outrage and outpouring it unleashed, with millions of women speaking out about their own experiences  \u2014   appear to have narrowed that gap. \u201cThis is a moment of transition,\u201d said Estelle B. Freedman, a Stanford University historian who studies the evolution of laws and norms surrounding sexual assault. \u201cWe are having a national conversation about new rules,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are nationally trying to rethink issues of sexuality, consent, autonomy, relationships. \u201d While the Trump tape and its aftermath feel like a turning point in the public understanding of sexual assault, Alexandra Brodsky, a   of Know Your IX, an organization dedicated to ending sexual violence on college campuses, believes that \u201cit\u2019s actually a reflection that we are already past the turning point. \u201d \u201cIt is not obvious to me that five years ago, grabbing or kissing someone without her permission would have been recognized as sexual assault,\u201d she said. Dr. Freedman sees this moment as the culmination of decades of change. Until the   century, her research shows, sexual assault and rape were viewed primarily as crimes against the honor of women\u2019s husbands and fathers, not themselves. As women gained new rights to control their own property and legal decisions, sexual assault began to be considered a matter of consent, not honor. But there was little agreement about what consent meant, Dr. Freedman said. Many people believed consent could be implied or presumed by the way a woman dressed, for instance, or even her decision to accept a job with a male boss. By the 1990s, feminist advocacy had begun to push the idea of \u201cno means no. \u201d Antioch College in 1991 adopted a code of conduct requiring students to affirmatively opt in to sexual activity starting with a kiss. While such   rules were lampooned on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as political correctness run amok, they have become increasingly mainstream. States including New York and California require colleges and universities to adopt them. The widespread backlash to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, experts say, was fueled in part by the growing view, among people in their 20s and 30s, of affirmative consent as a guiding principle, not a lofty ideal or extreme demand. \u201cI think that affirmative consent is an imperfect legal concept,\u201d Ms. Brodsky, a recent graduate of Yale Law School, allowed. \u201cBut it\u2019s a powerful normative concept. \u201d But old beliefs about honor and consent persist. Mr. Trump\u2019s bragging in the video that women \u201clet\u201d him kiss and grope them because he was a star, for instance, seems straight out of the   era, in which anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d could be seen as passive acquiescence. Dr. Freedman also detects shades of the old   system in some men\u2019s responses that, as husbands and fathers, they found the video unacceptable. Until recently, pervasive shame and stigma meant that silence was often the rational choice for survivors of sexual violence. That was particularly true for women who grew up in an era when any sexual activity outside of marriage was considered unacceptable: revealing an assault risked being labeled promiscuous or worse. But as those norms have changed, the costs of speaking out have dropped. Younger women in particular are becoming more willing to protest sexual assaults that once might have been deemed too minor to merit reporting. And that, in turn, may be affecting the way older generations of women perceive episodes from their own pasts. It certainly worked that way for Emily Hoffman, 25, who works in the television industry in New York, and her mother, Amy Plummer. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to post this,\u201d Ms. Hoffman wrote on Facebook on Oct. 10, a few days after the Trump tape was aired. But she went on to reveal to her 1, 326 Facebook friends what for seven years had been one of her most private secrets: that she had been assaulted by a senior male colleague while an    intern at a   company. He attacked her in a deserted stairwell, Ms. Hoffman announced, kissing her, groping her breasts and genitals, and then forcibly masturbating against her. \u201cMy experience mimicked what Donald Trump described in those tapes,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt was very upsetting. \u201d For Ms. Plummer, who is in her 60s, seeing her daughter\u2019s post was transformative. \u201cWhen Emily felt brave enough to put her experiences down was when I specifically started to think about my own experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized I would not have had the courage she had to say it publicly. \u201d But she also realized she had things of her own to share. She still felt that some of her experiences were too \u201cexplicit\u201d to discuss. But she shared others with her daughter. How in junior high, for instance, her male guidance counselor told her that she should \u201cconsider a career as a Playboy bunny. \u201d And how she left graduate school without her master\u2019s degree after a professor told her that she would not be able to pass her oral exams \u201cunless I was \u2018nice\u2019 to him. \u201d One thing is notably missing from most of the stories survivors are now sharing: perpetrators\u2019 names. The stigma of having been assaulted may have waned, but making an accusation against a specific individual is a different matter. It can raise the risk of legal consequences such as libel or slander suits. Many survivors, however, say social consequences are a more significant deterrent. \u201cThere is a sense that a \u2018good victim\u2019 merely shares her story to raise awareness or make people feel less alone,\u201d Ms. Brodsky said. \u201cBut the minute there is a desire for accountability or change or retribution, suddenly she\u2019s untrustworthy. \u201d When women accuse celebrities or other   people like Mr. Trump or Roger Ailes, the former Fox News executive, she said, \u201cthat triggers the unfounded but insidious myth that women say that they\u2019ve been assaulted for attention or money. \u201d The pressure not to name names can be strong whenever the perpetrator is someone the woman knows. An accusation forces everyone who knows the two people to choose a side: accuser or accused? Choosing the accuser often means going against the broader group or community. In her work on college campuses around the country, Ms. Brodsky said, she has observed that \u201cpeers and friends are much more inclined to be sympathetic to victims if they don\u2019t make anyone\u2019s life more complicated. \u201d \u201cNaming names creates an inconvenience,\u201d she added. Psychological research shows that people find it extremely difficult  \u2014   even painful  \u2014   to challenge their peer groups. In the famous \u201cconformity study\u201d conducted by Solomon Asch, a professor of social psychology at the University of Pennsylvania who died in 1996, participants were asked to answer a series of simple, questions with obvious answers. There was a catch, though: Before the subject had a chance to respond, other research assistants disguised as participants all confidently selected the same wrong answer. That set up a dilemma: Choose the right answer, or conform to the group by selecting the wrong one? Even though the stakes were very low, about   of participants capitulated to group pressure at least once. Ms. Hoffman believes that her decision not to name her accuser is the reason her post has received such a uniformly positive response. \u201cI\u2019m not naming anybody in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s somebody who they need to defend. \u201d But according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, 60 percent of sexual assaults are committed by an intimate partner, relative, friend or acquaintance. So the pressure on individuals not to name names can add up to widespread impunity for perpetrators. Nancy Erika Smith, a New Jersey lawyer who has represented victims of sexual assault and discrimination for more than two decades, said she recognized that asking people to identify who had harmed them was in many ways an unfair burden. \u201cDon\u2019t do it for yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it for all of us. Speak up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628606.0447268}
