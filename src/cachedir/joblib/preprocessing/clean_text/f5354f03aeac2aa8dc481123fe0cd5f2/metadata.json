I feel fury,\u201d the    actor told Esquire for the magazine\u2019s April cover story.  \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. People were just so desperate to hear someone say that someone is to blame,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were just so happy to hear that someone was angry. Hear someone say that Washington sucks. They just want something new without actually understanding. I mean, guys like Steve Bannon \u2014  Steve Bannon! \u2014  this man has no place in politics. \u201d Evans  \u2014   who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign  \u2014   has been an outspoken critic of Trump on social media. The actor has criticized the president\u2019s executive orders on immigration, and last year accused him of \u201cenergizing lies. \u201d Shortly after the election, Evans called for an end to the Electoral College, which secured Trump\u2019s victory even as Clinton won the popular vote. Evans told Esquire that he is aware it may not be smart for him, from a business perspective, to be so outspoken about his political beliefs. \u201cLook, I\u2019m in a business where you\u2019ve got to sell tickets. But, my God, I would not be able to look at myself in the mirror if I felt strongly about something and didn\u2019t speak up,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI think it\u2019s about how you speak up. We\u2019re allowed to disagree. If I state my case and people don\u2019t want to go see my movies as a result, I\u2019m okay with that. \u201d Still, the actor acknowledged the possibility that people could be turned off to differing opinions if rhetoric becomes too heated, explaining that instead of yelling about one\u2019s views, it is now a \u201ctime for calm. \u201d \u201cBecause not everyone who voted for Trump is going to be some horrible bigot,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in that middle those are the people you can\u2019t lose your credibility with. If you\u2019re trying to change minds, by spewing too much rhetoric you can easily become white noise. \u201d Elsewhere in the long interview, Evans revealed that he may hang up the Captain America shield after his upcoming appearances in Avengers: Infinity War and its planned sequel, which will shoot    beginning in April.
