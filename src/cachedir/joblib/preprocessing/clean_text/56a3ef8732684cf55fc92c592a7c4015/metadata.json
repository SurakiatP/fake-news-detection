Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her \u2013 and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. \\nHalloween is a fun time for many people \u2013 especially families with younger ones. However, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. Proving just that is a video shared to the Facebook page called \u201c Uncle Sam\u2019s Misguided Children ,\u201d which shows how one person went political with theirs. \\nAs can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. Making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of Hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison \u2013 where she belongs. \\nWithin just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. However, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. \\nAs it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. In fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words \u201cHillary 4 Prison\u201d on their creations as well:'"}, "time": 1742628549.2759235}
