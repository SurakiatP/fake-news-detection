Trump made a passing remark about the first presidential debate last week and about the audio equipment that he has blamed for his    performance. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the mike didn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Trump said, during comments about the difficulties he had faced during the debate. The problem, he said, was that the people operating the soundboard had been \u201coscillating\u201d as he spoke, changing the levels of his voice. In any other election, this would have been an anodyne comment. But it came after Mr. Trump had spent days insisting he had had a \u201cbum mike\u201d and theorizing that there may have been foul play. Mr. Trump\u2019s new comments may be obscured somewhat by the arrival of Hurricane Matthew. But, ahead of the crucial second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday, they represented an adjustment by Mr. Trump of what had been a rallying cry portraying him as a potential victim of sabotage. In an email Thursday evening, a Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, pointed to a brief statement by the Commission on Presidential Debates last week saying that an audio issue had affected how Mr. Trump was heard in the hall. \u201cWe\u2019d like to reiterate, as the commission stated independently, that Mr. Trump experienced audio issues the night of the debate,\u201d Ms. Hicks said. \u201cRegardless of the exact technical cause or effect, it was unfortunate. \u201d The event on Thursday was intended to help Mr. Trump find a comfort zone before the Sunday debate, which shares the    format. But it was moderated by a friendly conservative radio host, questions were screened in advance, and Mr. Trump spoke for only about 30 minutes. Mr. Trump, who faced some criticism for seeming ill prepared for the first debate, will spend time today and over the weekend preparing for the second. But the hurricane  \u2014   potentially the worst to hit the United States in many years  \u2014   threatens to drown out attention on the race, perhaps even on debate day.'"}, "time": 1742563140.042853}
