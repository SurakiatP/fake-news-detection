Those saying they have \u201csome\u201d respect for police is down to 17 percent and those claiming to have \u201chardly any\u201d respect for police is down to 7 percent. \\nThe Gallup survey flies in the face of the narrative of leftists and Black Lives Matter. They\u2019re trying to convince Americans \u2013 especially black Americans \u2013 that the police are on a racist rampage and that they have nothing more to fear in this country than a man in uniform. \\nBut the public doesn\u2019t buy it. \\nWith both whites and \u201cnon-whites,\u201d respect for police is up sharply. Four in five white Americans say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d of respect for the police in their area, while just over two in three \u201cnon-whites\u201d also say they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of respect. \\nRespect for police is highest among Republicans, at 86 percent, but even 68 percent of Democrats claim a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of respect. \\nAdults 55 and older (81%) have the most respect, but even those 18-34 had high levels of respect at 71%. \\nThere is a moral to this for the BLM Social Justice Warriors: You can paint our cops as racist thugs, but we know better. Police risk their lives every day to protect us and deserve our utmost respect. And judging by this poll, they\u2019re getting it. \\nFrom the Gallup Poll: \\nThe sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive \u2014 both politically and for their lives while they are on duty \u2014 amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings. After an officer was killed by a gunman in Harlem last year, then-New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton warned that the U.S. has fostered \u201can anti-police attitude that has grown\u201d and that the national dialogue on police-community relations needs to discourage individuals who \u201cexhibit anti-police behavior or attitudes.\u201d \\nLouisiana became the first state to pass a bill that treats acts targeted against police officers as a hate crime. Other states are discussing passing similar laws. It\u2019s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer. \\nAlthough confidence in police varies among subgroups, majorities of all groups say they have a great deal of respect for their local police. And the percentage of national adults who say they have \u201chardly any\u201d respect for local law enforcement remains small.'"}, "time": 1742628470.011609}
