Gorsuch veered, somehow, to the matter of mutton busting. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wanted to hear about the Denver rodeo. And Judge Gorsuch, elusive all week as Democrats have strained to pinpoint his judicial leanings, turned instantly expansive. \u201cMutton busting, as you know, comes sort of like bronco busting for adults,\u201d he began on Tuesday. \u201cYou take a poor little kid, you find a sheep and you attach the one to the other and see how long they can hold on. \u201d He went on. \u201c  \u2026    You know, it usually works fine when the sheep has got a lot of wool and you tell them to hold on  \u2014   I tell my kids hold on   you know? Really get in there, right? Get around it  \u2026    \u201d The Democrats stared blankly. \u201c  \u2026    Because if you sit upright, you go flying right off, right? So, you want to get in. But the problem when you get in is that you\u2019re so locked in that you don\u2019t want to let go, right? And so, then the poor clown has to come and knock you off the sheep. \u201d Judge Gorsuch smiled. \u201cWe can talk mutton busting all day,\u201d he said. They may as well have. As Judge Gorsuch glided through the third day of his hearings on Wednesday, suffering few slips and answering no question he did not wish to, Senate Republicans were eager to assist. There is a rich tradition of Republicans and Democrats making life easier on their preferred nominees, tossing congressional pool noodles to a judge who might flounder, at least somewhat, under questioning from the other party. But this year, Republicans have elevated the practice to high art  \u2014   supplying extra cushioning for a nominee who does not appear to need it and adding a measure of   levity to a process that virtually all inside the Capitol agree will end with a confirmation. On matters fraught and frivolous, Senate allies have coaxed Judge Gorsuch to the safest of verbal    eager to defuse Democratic lines of attack with whimsy and digressions. \u201cDo you think your writings reflect a   attitude against   regulations?\u201d Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah asked on Wednesday. \u201cNo, Senator,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI don\u2019t either. \u201d In other moments, they have urged Judge Gorsuch to remind the public that no one, even the president, is above the law, or to make clear that his rulings in workers\u2019 rights cases  \u2014   an area of concern for Democrats  \u2014   were rendered only in service of the law. More memorable were the flourishes that strayed far from judicial doctrine: \u201cWould you tell me where your favorite fishing stream is?\u201d \u201cIs it true that you have been endorsed by John Elway?\u201d \u201cJury duty. Have you ever been called up?\u201d That question, from Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, earned an audible laugh from Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. \u201cNo, I just thought it was very odd questions for this, but it\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Franken said, as eyes turned his way. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I laughed. I just  \u2014   it caught me. \u201d Moments later, after Judge Gorsuch\u2019s answer (he has served) Mr. Franken chimed in again. \u201cThat was a great question,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThanks, Al,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cAppreciate it. \u201d Yet it was Mr. Flake\u2019s earlier curiosity  \u2014   sparked by his teenage son, he said, and a   internet meme  \u2014   that attracted more attention: Would Judge Gorsuch rather fight \u201c100   horses or one   duck?\u201d Judge Gorsuch took no position on Horse v. Duck, demonstrating his unflinching commitment to avoiding declarative statements about matters that could one day come before the court. But he did not hesitate during another exchange, with Mr. Cruz, who seemed to revel in inside jokes and winking asides during his allotted 30 minutes of questioning. \u201cWhat is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything?\u201d Mr. Cruz asked at the top of his allotted time. \u201c\u201d Judge Gorsuch said. (The pair explained at some length that this was a reference from \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. \u201d) Mr. Cruz later asked about the jump shot of Justice Byron R. White, Judge Gorsuch\u2019s legal mentor, a former football star who was also known to swing elbows on the basketball court. Then there was the rodeo. \u201cAs a Texan,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, gazing admiringly at Judge Gorsuch for much of his testimony, \u201cI think everyone\u2019s life can be rendered richer by going to the rodeo. \u201d Mr. Franken, the next lawmaker up after the nominee\u2019s explanation of mutton busting, wondered aloud about animal abuse laws in Colorado. But most Democrats seemed to accept their colleagues\u2019 gambit during the proceedings, at least grudgingly. Beginning his second round of questioning on Wednesday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, summarized what the Judiciary Committee had learned from Republicans\u2019 questions so far: \u201cWe know your love of   and rodeos and family. \u201d \u201cI know that senatorial assignment,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve been there myself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563561.883828}
