The   agreement between the federal government and city leaders would introduce a wide range of police reforms, including training, new technology and community oversight. The agreement rose from a scathing 2016 Justice Department report that found systemic racial bias in the police department. \u201cThe talk is over,\u201d Brandon Scott, a Baltimore city councilman who leads the Police Oversight Committee, said after the decision on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to handle our business. \u201d The approval came as a relief to supporters who feared the agreement might be delayed or canceled under the new presidential administration. The pact was signed on Jan. 12, eight days before Donald J. Trump was inaugurated. Its supporters knew President Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, would be less likely to support it. On Monday, the Justice Department sought a   delay so it could review all police reform agreements, including the one in Baltimore. But Judge James K. Bredar said Friday that he interpreted that request as the department\u2019s trying to determine \u201cwhether it wants the court to enter the decree at all, or at least the current version of it. \u201d That opportunity had passed, he said. \u201cThe parties have already agreed to the draft before the court,\u201d Judge Bredar wrote in his decision. \u201cIt would be extraordinary for the court to permit one side to unilaterally amend an agreement already jointly reached and signed. \u201d Mr. Sessions said in a statement that the decree \u201cwas negotiated during a rushed process by the previous administration and signed only days before they left office. \u201d \u201cWhile the Department of Justice continues to fully support police reform in Baltimore, I have grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city,\u201d he said. He added that the agreement contained \u201cclear departures from many proven principles of good policing that we fear will result in more crime. \u201d The Justice Department\u2019s report found that the police in Baltimore, a city that is 63 percent black, disproportionately targeted black people, often for dubious reasons. The 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a      man, while in police custody led to violent riots. The   consent decree covers a wide range of reforms. It includes a requirement for officers to undergo 80 hours of training, including best practices on stopping, searching and arresting people, and technological upgrades like video cameras inside police vans. City leaders praised Judge Bredar\u2019s decision to approve the agreement. Tessa   president of the Baltimore branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said on Friday that residents she had spoken to \u201creally wanted this to go through,\u201d and were worried the effort they had put into the agreement would be for naught. \u201cFor all of that just to fall apart because they didn\u2019t want to go through with it would have hurt everybody,\u201d she said. The city\u2019s mayor, Catherine Pugh, said at a news conference that the decision was \u201ca great victory for the citizens of Baltimore, as well as the Baltimore Police Department. \u201d The next step is most likely to be the federal appointment of an independent monitor who will ensure the city is adequately addressing bias complaints. \u201cUntil the independent court monitor is assigned, everything else is on hold,\u201d said Mr. Scott, the councilman. In his statement, Mr. Sessions said the Justice Department \u201cstands ready to work with Baltimore to fight violence crime and improve policing in the city. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562836.8166265}
