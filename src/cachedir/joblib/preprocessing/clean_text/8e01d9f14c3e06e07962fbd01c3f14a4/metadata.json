But what would be dead last? Probably the hackneyed political groan-inducer dreamed up by Liz Cheney for her daughter. \\nFor inexplicable reasons, Liz Cheney \u2013 daughter of America\u2019s most detestable former vice president, Dick \u2013 decided to staple a bunch of pieces of office scrap paper onto her daughter and send her to school as \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails.\u201d Ugh. \\nOn social media, proud mom Liz even boasted about the costume. Trick or treat? Our daughter Gracie went to school in the scariest of Halloween costumes: Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. #HappyHalloween pic.twitter.com/Gs33p78FJT \\n\u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) October 31, 2016 \\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a less \u201ccool\u201d thing to go as than the living embodiment of a manufactured right-wing scandal that only aging conservatives cared about in the first place. Teens, whom already lean heavily liberal, probably won\u2019t spontaneously become registered Republicans because a classmate showed up covered in paper. Making matters worse, the costume\u2019s gimmick isn\u2019t even obvious. Kids will have to go up to Gracie and ask \u201cSo what are you supposed to be?\u201d And she will have to respond, time and again, \u201cI\u2019m Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. Those things your grandfather was yelling about at the family reunion and quite literally nobody else is interested in.\u201d \\nAnd because irony died and was buried in a shallow grave this year, Liz Cheney didn\u2019t bother to justify her own father\u2019s carelessness with emails. Forget the 33,000 emails, the Bush Administration \u201clost\u201d or \u201cdeleted\u201d over 22 million. Guess whose emails \u201cdisappeared\u201d most often? \\nMost troubling, researchers found a suspicious pattern in the White House email system blackouts, including periods when there were no emails available from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cThat the vice president\u2019s office, widely characterized as the most powerful vice president in history, should have no archived emails in its accounts for scores of days\u2014especially days when there was discussion of whether to invade Iraq\u2014beggared the imagination,\u201d says Thomas Blanton, director of the Washington-based National Security Archive. \\nI guess stapling 22 million emails to her daughter would be a bit impractical, though. Maybe they should have stuck with a superhero costume. \\nFeatured image via Twitter'"}, "time": 1742562682.344824}
