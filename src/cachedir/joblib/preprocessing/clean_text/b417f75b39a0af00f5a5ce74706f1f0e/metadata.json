And it is an honor of some of the first immigrants to come to this country, the Irish. They often on this day celebrate what they say the luck of the Irish. Of course, if you\u2019re elderly, sick or poor, your luck as just run out. \u201d She continued,  \u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s so horrific and so horrendous. Just when you thought it was safe to stop talking about Trump, he unleashes his budget on us. He wants to cut clean water. He wants to stop helping old people and public education so we can all be as dumb as he is!\u201d (  Daily Caller) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562150.9275618}
