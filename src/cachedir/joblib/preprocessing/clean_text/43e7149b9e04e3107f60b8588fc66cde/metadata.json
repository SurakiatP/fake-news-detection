Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it\u2019s all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary.\\nObama\u2019s latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he\u2019s spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it.\\nFrom Judicial Watch :\\nMonths after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it\u2019s dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they\u2019re known as \u201ccitizenship integration grants.\u201d[\u2026]\\nJudicial Watch went on to say\u2026 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. \u201cWe intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,\u201d the agency\u2019s grant announcement states. \u201cIf you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.\u201d Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[\u2026]\\nPractically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing \u201cnew workforce programs\u201d for the \u201cnew Americans\u201d and the Department of Education is promoting \u201cfunding opportunities\u201d to assure that the immigrants \u201care provided the tools they need to succeed.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on \u201cimmigrant-focused career-pathways programs.\u201d The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have \u201cmeaningful access to housing programs\u201d subsidized by American taxpayers.\\nObama likes to pretend that he\u2019s doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it\u2019s just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.\\nSource: End the Fed \\nMore from Breitbart\u2026 Schweizer: Obama\u2019s DOJ \u2018Transferring Money to Left-wing Groups\u2019 \u2018to Influence This Election\u2019 By John Hayward\\nOn Wednesday\u2019s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM , Clinton Cash author and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer discussed the latest GAI report about the Obama Justice Department\u2019s funneling of money to left-wing groups using fines levied against financial institutions. Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described the report as exposing the Justice Department of \u201cquite literally extorting companies to fund left-wing activists.\u201d\\n\u201cWhen I first joined Breitbart,\u201d Schweizer recalled, \u201cThere was a scandal called Pigford where the federal government was basically taking taxpayer money and giving it to people who were claiming to be victims who were not victims and giving them billions of dollars. This is in that tradition.\u201d\\nHe explained:\\nWhat\u2019s really happening here is simple. You\u2019ve got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you\u2019ve got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, \u2018You committed these offenses, you\u2019ve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.\u2019 Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that.\\nNow, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you\u2019re supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers.\\nThe problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups. They do it under the guise of, \u201cWell, you know, if this bank discriminated against lenders racially, we\u2019re going to give this money to these left-wing quote-unquote housing groups to help deal with the problem.\u201d\\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on. These housing groups are advocacy groups. They\u2019re left-wing organizations. They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth. And they specifically target what they call quote-unquote progressive voters.\\nSo this is taking the Department of Justice, which we\u2019ve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration, even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to left-wing groups \u2014 in an effort, frankly I think, to influence this election.\\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\\nLISTEN: \\n\\nSource: Breitbart \\n'"}, "time": 1742561784.502361}
