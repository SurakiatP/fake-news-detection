Police had charged Hunter under the suspicion that he broke into the home and ordered the mother and the little girl to strip naked. He then grabbed the girl to molest her, but the child\u2019s mother attacked. Police said Hunter then shot the woman five times. Despite being severely wounded, the enraged mother was able to fight the suspect off and push him out of the home. In court, prosecutors said Hunter left a stocking cap behind after he fled and DNA linked the cap to the suspect. Hunter\u2019s DNA was already in the CODIS system and the match led police to arrest him as a suspect, WLTX 19 reported. Once arrested, police were also able to test a . 40 caliber pistol in his possession and found it matching the bullets recovered at the scene of the home invasion.

Addressing the court, the little girl\u2019s mother said that Hunter had \u201cforever stolen her daughter\u2019s security and innocence. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742563381.8295844}
