[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nAccording to this report, Director Comey\u2019s call to President Putin was in regards to the Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) this past Tuesday advising all Federation security and intelligence organizations to cease all contact and cooperation with the FBI\u2014and that we detailed in our report titled Russia Breaks All Contact With Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cMinistry Of Terror\u201d\u2014Once Called The FBI.\\nWith \u201cmany/numerous\u201d joint terrorism and international criminal investigations currently ongoing between FIS agencies and the FBI, this report continues, Director Comey expressed his concerns to President Putin that the ending of them \u201cwould/could\u201d cause \u201cdangers/alarms\u201d to both the Federation and United States\u2014to which President Putin agreed, and in a bid to ease Russian-US war tensions publically stated after this call ended that \u201cRussia is not going to attack anyone, that\u2019s ridiculous\u201d.\\nThough not the \u201cmain/central\u201d focus of their conversation, this report notes, President Putin did become \u201cannoyed/perturbed\u201d when Director Comey asked him about former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (aka Carlos Danger) while seeming to allege that he was in some way a Russian spy\u2014and that President Putin bluntly replied to by reminding Director Comey that the correct person to ask that question to was former Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) officer Aleksandr Poteyev, whose location could be found by asking the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\\nSVR officer Poteyev, this report details, was the \u201coverseer/director\u201d of a Federation \u201choneypot\u201d intelligence operation operating in the United States whose mission was to \u201cdiscover/unmask\u201d high ranking American elite politicians, bankers, businessmen, etc., preying upon young Russian girls brought to that country to perform pedophile sex acts.\\nOnce these sexually deviant elite Americans who preyed upon these young Russian girl children were identified by the SVR, this report explains, they were put under electronic surveillance\u2014and once being notified of this, many of them volunteered to assist the Federation in \u201cother meaningful ways\u201d.\\nThis highly successful SVR operation was, however, destroyed, this report continues, when SVR officer Poteyev turned against the Federation and became an operative for the American CIA\u2014who this past July, immediately after FBI Director Comey announced Hillary Clinton would face no charges for her crimes, was suddenly declared dead (without any evidence) by the CIA, but that the SVR knows is not the truth.\\nMaster SVR intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko (in the US known as Anna Chapman) just prior to her and other SVR \u201coperatives/specialists\u201d being betrayed to the CIA by Poteyev, this report continues, had identified US Congressman Anthony Weiner as being a pedophile and targeted him for \u201cextreme/radical\u201d electronic surveillance\u2014but whose mission was ended on 27 June 2010 with her arrest by US authorities.\\nThe SVR\u2019s \u201cextreme/radical\u201d electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner was justified, this report explains, due not only to his being a sexual deviant, but, also, because his wife, Huma Abedin, was the top aide to then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2014whom the Federation has long noted is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the entire world.\\nThis report doesn\u2019t mention in its unclassified portions if the SVR continued their electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner, but does allude to the CIA picking up this investigation where intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko left off\u2014and as evidenced by the CIA\u2019s outing him as a sexual deviant 11 months later in May 2011.\\nTo why the CIA turned the SVR\u2019s Congressman Weiner surveillance operation against Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin, this report further notes, was due to Secretary Clinton, in 2011, ordering the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi (and the destruction of Libya)\u2014who was a major CIA asset and had allowed, since 2004, this US spy agency to use his country to interrogate (actually torture) high value Islamic terror leaders.\\nWithin 24 hours of President Putin directing FBI Director Comey to look for answers about Congressman Weiner\u2019s association with Russia by asking Aleksandr Poteyev (really the CIA), this report continues, Director Comey notified the US Congress that his investigation into Hillary Clinton was being re-opened\u2014and was due to the \u201cmysterious/magical\u201d appearance of tens-of-thousands of secret Hillary Clinton emails discovered on the computer of former Congressman Weiner, and that led Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein to state that a \u201creal bombshell\u201d had been discovered otherwise the FBI wouldn\u2019t have dared begin this whole sordid process again.\\nTo how the Obama regimes FBI, CIA and Department of Justice (DoJ) will untangle the Hillary Clinton catastrophe they\u2019ve ensnared themselves, and the American people, into this report doesn\u2019t even venture an opinion on\u2014but it does conclude by noting that the chaos enveloping America right now includes not only their presidential election, but Attorney General Loretta Lynch stunningly pleading the 5th Amendment in a letter to the US Congress this week over the payment of $1 billion in cash to Iran, and a terrifying new US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure set to go into effect on 1 December that will legalize the ability of the US government to hack into computers in any jurisdiction, even in foreign nations.\\nLeading any ordinary American, one would think, to ask of themselves the same thing Donald Trump has been asking: \u201cWhy not vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose?\u201d\u2014after all, with Hillary Clinton having already been caught on tape talking about rigging one election, whose to say she isn\u2019t about to do it again?\\n'"}, "time": 1742561751.010064}
