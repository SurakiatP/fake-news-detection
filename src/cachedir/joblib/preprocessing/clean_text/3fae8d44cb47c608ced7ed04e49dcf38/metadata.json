Racking up   miles (New York to Los Angeles to London to Los Angeles) to woo Oscar voters at    sessions. Giving endless command performances to   reporters who ask the same five (three?) questions on loop. All the hair and makeup. All the gown fittings. And losing the whole time. Nicole Kidman, Naomie Harris, Michelle Williams and Octavia Spencer  \u2014   each nominated for best supporting actress at the coming Academy Awards  \u2014   know this drill all too well: It has been their lives (boohoo, I know) since November, when their fellow nominee, Viola Davis, started to vacuum up prize after prize for her    performance in \u201cFences. \u201d All told, Ms. Davis, who plays a   homemaker in 1950s Pittsburgh, has collected at least 29 trophies in recent months. (\u201cThank you to the Iowa Film Critics Association! \u201d) She walked to bellwether wins at the Golden Globes, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Screen Actors Guild. The oddsmakers at GoldDerby. com have her seizing the supporting actress Oscar in a landslide on Feb. 26. It\u2019s the most   category there is: She\u2019s winning. So why do the other contenders keep going through the motions? That question pops into my head almost every year around this time, when the gracious losing starts to seem like   performance art unto itself.   reporters do their best to keep the Academy Awards feeling like a contest, but at least one category is perennially no contest at all. In 2015, Julianne Moore won best actress on the September day when Hollywood insiders first saw her in \u201cStill Alice\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2012, Ms. Spencer similarly breezed to the Oscar lectern, collecting the supporting actress statuette for her portrayal of a maid in \u201cThe Help,\u201d in which she starred with Ms. Davis. For answers, I spoke to longtime studio executives, publicists, agents and even a few of this year\u2019s   nominees. And some of their responses were surprising. Joe Quenqua, who runs the entertainment practice at DKC Marketing and Public Relations, cleared up one thing right off the bat: No nominees, no matter what they say, concede they are losing until that golden envelope has been opened. \u201cYou can be the longest shot in the history of Oscar nominees,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still have to think you have the teeniest, tiniest,    chance of winning walking into that room. \u201d Mr. Quenqua, who has worked on numerous Oscar campaigns, including one for \u201cThe Help,\u201d said that there are multiple reasons that   contenders cling to hope. Aside from ego  \u2014   and don\u2019t underestimate that factor in Hollywood  \u2014   actors and actresses, from their earliest days auditioning, don\u2019t make it very far if they have a defeatist attitude. Upsets from past Oscars can also contribute to magical thinking nobody thought voters would select Marisa Tomei as best supporting actress in 1993 for her   girlfriend in \u201cMy Cousin Vinny,\u201d but they did. And reporters may play a role. \u201cIt\u2019s not like journalists single out the long shots and say, \u2018Tell me how it feels to be losing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Quenqua said. \u201cInstead, the question asked to everyone is always, \u2018What are you saying in your acceptance speech? \u2019\u201d Guilty as charged. Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hosts a luncheon a few weeks before its prize ceremony to celebrate all the nominees as a group, from major stars down to the sound mixers. The academy peppers the room with reporters. Since the event usually falls at a crucial time in the voting process  \u2014   this year, a few days before ballots went out  \u2014   nominees tend to be very chatty. One of my first stops was Ms. Harris, who played a   mother in \u201cMoonlight\u201d and is vying for best supporting actress against Ms. Davis. \u201cDo you plan to write an acceptance speech?\u201d I asked her. Ms. Harris smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going with Helen Mirren\u2019s advice, which is to always have a speech, even if you know beyond a doubt that you\u2019re not going to win,\u201d she said. I knew I was pushing it, but I said it anyway: \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d With a single facial expression, she seemed to toss all 29 of Ms. Davis\u2019s trophies in my direction. In the end, the affable Ms. Harris offered some insight into how she has approached the Year of Viola Davis, who has never won an Oscar despite two prior nominations (for \u201cThe Help\u201d and for \u201cDoubt\u201d in 2009) making her the most nominated black actress in academy history. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the acknowledgment, which has made a huge difference in my career already, in terms of scripts and projects coming to me  \u2014   it\u2019s quite extraordinary, actually  \u2014   but I\u2019m also happy to be able to come to these events and help get \u2018Moonlight\u2019 to a broader audience,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cI feel a responsibility to get out there and do as much legwork as I can to promote the film. \u201d Perhaps her category mates had similar points of view. Ms. Kidman, nominated for her   adoptive mother in \u201cLion,\u201d has certainly done her best, dating back to the September film festivals, to keep that     in the public eye. Ditto Ms. Williams, nominated for her heartbroken mother in \u201cManchester by the Sea. \u201d Before I could track them down, I stumbled across Ms. Spencer, honored for playing a NASA leader in \u201cHidden Figures. \u201d She caught my eye partly because she was not aggressively working the   room. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d I said to her, after identifying myself as a reporter. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, sitting down at her lunch table. Now it was my turn to make a face. \u201cWell, you can ask me how my day is going,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not doing any press. \u201d Maybe she just wanted to be left alone with her salad. Maybe she was worried that I might drag her into yet another discussion about the #OscarSoWhite controversy. Or maybe, just then, she had stopped going through the motions.'"}, "time": 1742564154.8788188}
