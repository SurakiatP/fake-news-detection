Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. \\nSo far so good, even if one wonders just how active the DOJ will be in a case that has shown an unprecedented schism between the politically influenced Department of Justice and the FBI. \\nAnd yet, something felt odd about this. Kadzik\u2026 Kadzik\u2026 where have we heard that name? \\nOh yes. Recall our post from last week, \u201c Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary\u2019s Benghazi Hearing \u201d in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton\u2019s Benghazi testimony? \\nIt was Peter Kadzik.
