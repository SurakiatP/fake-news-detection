He made the point that increased industry diversity leads to a more productive, creative and innovative society, particularly in relation to the BBC, of which he said \u00e2\\x80\\x98we want to be the most creative organisation in the world\u00e2\\x80\\x99. \\nOgungbesan\u00e2\\x80\\x99s views were reinforced by Vick Bain, CEO of Basca (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors), as she ascribed the survival of British rap music to the essentiality of diversity within composition. \\nTaking a more urgent tone, composer Eleanor Alberga stated that regular inclusion of white composers and young musicians needs to start immediately but also cautioned that we must \u00e2\\x80\\x98make sure this is more than another gesture\u00e2\\x80\\x99. \\nThe conference included a talk on unconscious bias entitled \u00e2\\x80\\x98What does a rap musician look like?\u00e2\\x80\\x99 given by Aesha Zafar, head of talent development at BBC North. It started with a short film in which audience members at a hip-hop concert were asked what a rap musician looked like. A large majority of the audience thought a rapper would be male, of African heritage, often with outlandish clothing and exotic hairstyles. This added to Zafar\u00e2\\x80\\x99s idea that unconscious bias is the result of lots of tiny, nondescript events, which ultimately prove detrimental to the progression of inclusion and diversity. \\nThis is my rewrite of the Report on the Diversity and Inclusion in Composition Conference, which, in its original form, seen below, referred to classical music, not hip-hop. \\nEuropeans are to be allowed nothing of their own, not even a form of music. \\nBritain is diversifying and the classical music industry needs to diversify with it, was the general consensus at Radio 3\u00e2\\x80\\x99s Diversity and Inclusion in Composition conference, which took place at the Royal Northern College of Music on 19 October. \\nThe importance of changing the current methods of inclusion of BAME students was made clear by one of the first keynote speakers, Tunde Ogungbesan, head of diversity and inclusion at the BBC. \\nHe made the point that increased industry diversity leads to a more productive, creative and innovative society, particularly in relation to the BBC, of which he said \u00e2\\x80\\x98we want to be the most creative organisation in the world\u00e2\\x80\\x99.
