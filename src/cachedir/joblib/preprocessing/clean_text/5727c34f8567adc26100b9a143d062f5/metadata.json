In one of the emails, Hillary writes to her campaign adviser John Podesta, \u201cIt is now more than abundantly clear that the only person who can make me win in the election is Donald Trump.\u201d She goes on to add, \u201cBut we cannot sit idly hoping that he would do the job for us on his own. We must actively encourage his campaign. In other words, we must fully bankroll him\u201d. \\nPodesta, in his reply to the e-mail, concurs with Hillary\u2019s line of thinking, \u201cyeah, you have put it way better than we can.\u201d In fact, he goes one step ahead and lays it all brutally down: \u201cIt is only smart that we start funding his campaign before his camp gets all wise and starts funding our campaign. We don\u2019t want a Face/Off kind of situation here where one is the front of the other and vice-versa. As it is, it is difficult telling the two campaigns apart\u201d. \\nAnd as part of the carefully constructed plan, Hillary\u2019s team allowed Russian hackers to not only hack her e-mails but also bank accounts, knowing fully well that the hacked mails and money would eventually find their way from the Russians to the Trump camp. \\nAt one point, Podesta does raise the question what if the Russians pass on only the mails and keep the money themselves. \u201cDo you want to trust the Russians with all the money? Looks like a dangerous gambit. I\u2019m red-flagging it here itself\u201d. \\nBut Hillary, who had worked out her strategy pretty smartly, replies Podesta: \u201cWhen I say money, we are not going to put actual money that Russians would doubtless run away with.\u201d She adds that the plan is to go the Sodexo coupon route. \u201cWe put humongous amount of Sodexo coupons. Russians wouldn\u2019t know to use them and would pass it to Trump\u2019s team. I am pretty sure they will lap it up, as I am even more pretty sure that Trump wouldn\u2019t have given lunch and dinner allowance to his team\u201d. \\nUnderstandably, the latest e-mail reveals have caused further confusion in a campaign that has never been short of that. The Trump campaign managers lashed out Hillary and her team and accused them \u201cof (metaphorically) sneaking into enemy\u2019s room and poisoning his drink and food\u201d. \\nTrump\u2019s spokesperson said \u201cthey have used our hands to poke our eyes, which anyway we ourselves were doing. This reveals their desperation. But we aren\u2019t fazed. We will continue to do what we have been doing without anybody\u2019s bidding.\u201d \\nTrump himself, in a speech to his supporters, thundered, \u201cso you now get the real picture. All my gaffes, stupid remarks and silly antics have all been the fault of that woman. The ridiculous things that I say on a daily basis is all the work of Hillary.\u201d \\nHe added: \u201cThe crazy things I come up with at all meetings, the media has been there always. I know. I have seen them. Why did they not find out that it was all Hillary\u2019s fault\u201d. \\nTrump also said that those claiming that I have not paid my taxes have a clear answer now. \u201cHow can I pay taxes for Hillary\u2019s money?\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s parting words were: \u201cHillary and her conspiracies are a conspiracy of China. She could be the effect of global warming\u201d. \\nMeanwhile, the Hillary campaign team responded to the allegations by saying, \u201cit is more than a real possibility that the Trump\u2019s team might be using Hillary Clinton\u2019s body double to create her emails and money accounts.\u201d \\nHillary\u2019s aide, in a non-hacked e-mail response, said, \u201cTrump campaign team is financing Hillary\u2019s body double and funding themselves. It doesn\u2019t take much to figure this out. It is not rocket science. Just do your math.\u201d \\nThe aide added: \u201cWe have also reasons to believe that the Trump campaign team is using a Trump body double to address his meetings so that they will have less embarrassment to manage later\u201d. \\nElsewhere, in a totally understandable development, a latest media poll suggested that 100 per cent of Americans would prefer Hillary\u2019s body double to Hillary and Trump\u2019s body double to Trump. \u201cThe body doubles are assured of a landslide victory\u201d, revealed the poll.'"}, "time": 1742628305.378063}
