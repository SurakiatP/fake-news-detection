Pneumonia  \u2014   which leads to infiltration of fluid into the lungs, leaving a patient short of breath and often feverish but still able to function  \u2014   can become serious or even fatal if it is not properly treated, doctors said. The illness can be caused by viruses, bacteria or, less often, fungi or damage from toxic fumes. Without extensive testing, which is not normally needed, it is impossible to know what caused Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s doctor released a statement saying that the illness was diagnosed on Friday morning and that she was advised to \u201crest and modify her schedule. \u201d Her team has released very little information about her condition: exactly how it was diagnosed what antibiotics she is taking the results of any blood work, chest   or other diagnostic tests that may have been performed or whether she has any underlying condition that made her vulnerable to the illness. On Monday, a campaign spokesman said that more medical information would be released this week and that those records would show she had \u201cno other undisclosed condition. \u201d As a result, doctors asked about her case said they could only speculate. \u201cHillary is sick, but she had two days of activities after she was diagnosed, so she\u2019s not that sick,\u201d said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the chief of infectious diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said he doubted she was infected with \u201cthe really serious bacteria that put you in a hospital. \u201d It is not uncommon for a doctor to diagnose pneumonia merely after listening to a patient\u2019s chest through a stethoscope and hearing \u201crales,\u201d which sound like tissue paper being crinkled, said Dr. William Schaffner, the chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School. A doctor can also order a chest   a sputum sample and blood tests, \u201cbut she could be getting perfectly good medical care even if these things were not done,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. Normally, patients are started on antibiotics immediately, and the test of whether the diagnosis and treatment were right is whether they quickly improve. Elevated white blood cell counts could indicate a bacterial infection, and a sputum sample and nasal swab can be taken to see what bacteria are present. But growing bacteria in culture can take days, \u201cand in half of all pneumonia cases, even with tests, we aren\u2019t able to identify the cause,\u201d said Dr. Charles S. Dela Cruz, a lung specialist at Yale medical school. If a patient does not get better after taking antibiotics, more testing should begin, Dr. Schaffner said. Only then do doctors begin to worry about a more serious underlying cause, such as leukemia. Several doctors said they did not think Mrs. Clinton posed any infection risk to others. Adults \u201care very, very rarely carriers of bacterial pneumonia,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said.   outbreaks in rare cases occur in close quarters like submarines and prisons, but adults do not normally carry pneumonia bacteria in their noses and throats as children do. \u201cThat\u2019s why patients admitted to hospitals with   pneumonia aren\u2019t put in isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. \u201d Dr. James M. Musser, the head of pathology at the Houston Methodist Medical System, said, \u201cMost people are not infectious if they have pneumonia, and being on antibiotics makes them even less infectious. \u201d Dr. Dela Cruz differed, saying he felt patients should limit contact with others the first few days of treatment when the source of a pneumonia is unknown. Dehydration, which Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team blamed for her apparent collapse at Sunday\u2019s memorial service, could be caused by a combination of standing outdoors on a hot, humid day and any fever she might have had, Dr. Schaffner said. Like sweating during exercise, fever causes the body to lose moisture, which can lower blood pressure and cause fainting. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s normal blood pressure is   according to a description of her  health released July 28, 2015, by Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, her internist. That is on the low side of a normal range, and could contribute to a tendency to faint, Dr. Schaffner noted. Allergies, which typically cause sneezing, not coughing, rarely trigger pneumonia, experts said. \u201cIn retrospect, that coughing episode looks more like a possible viral infection,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said, noting that on the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has come close to many people and has shaken many hands. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just warned doctors that flu season appeared to be starting unusually early this year, he added. Since both are over age 65, Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, should be getting annual flu shots and should also have had two shots against pneumococcal pneumonia, experts said. Although \u201cpneumo shots\u201d protect against several bacterial strains that are the most common causes of pneumonia, they do not protect against all of them.'"}, "time": 1742628582.1085227}
