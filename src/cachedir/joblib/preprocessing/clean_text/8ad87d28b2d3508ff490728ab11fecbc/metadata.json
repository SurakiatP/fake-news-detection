The representative, Robert Pittenger, a Republican whose district includes parts of Charlotte, was interviewed on a British Broadcasting Corporation show, BBC Newsnight, when he made the comment. In response to an interviewer\u2019s question about the demonstrators\u2019 grievance, Mr. Pittenger said: \u201cThe grievance in their mind is the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and they\u2019re not. I mean, yes, it is, it is a welfare state. We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and we\u2019ve put people in bondage so they can\u2019t be all that they are capable of being. \u201d The comment drew criticism on social media. Grier Martin, a Democrat who is a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, on Twitter called the comment \u201cone of the most ignorant statements I have ever heard. \u201d Within hours, Mr. Pittenger, 68, apologized and tried to explain himself in a series of posts on Twitter. He said his \u201canguish\u201d about what was happening in Charlotte prompted him to respond to a question \u201cin a way that I regret. \u201d He apologized and said he hoped \u201cwe can bring peace and calm to Charlotte. \u201d He added that he was trying to discuss a lack of economic mobility for   \u201cbecause of failed policies. \u201d Mr. Pittenger appeared on CNN on Thursday night to defuse the criticism, but not all were convinced it was effective.'"}, "time": 1742564394.2759159}
