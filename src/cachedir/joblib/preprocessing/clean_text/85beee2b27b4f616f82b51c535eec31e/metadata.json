Think about it), and vote for Hillary Clinton despite the way the cards fell. It\u2019s a dumb petition and you shouldn\u2019t sign it. It\u2019s never, never, ever going to happen that way. And furthermore, because of the way the numbers stack up, there are more Republican than Democratic electors \u2014 they want him elected. It\u2019s never going to happen. \\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019m all for democratizing the presidential election process. Want the popular vote to pick the president? I\u2019m right there with you . However, this petition isn\u2019t going to accomplish that, and not so deep down, I think you know that. \\nWhat it is going to do is make you feel a little bit better about not doing anything to actually make it happen. That\u2019s all online petitions typically do, unless there is a pledge for personal action attached. That\u2019s not the solution here \u2014 especially since there is a REAL solution to the problem of the electoral college on the table. The petition being passed around is going to make people feel complacent, and less likely to call a state legislator, which is the real way to go about this. The electoral college won\u2019t stop this \u2014 in fact, the electoral college needs to go. \\nThere is a movement and bill in the works that binds individual states\u2019 electors to casting electoral votes along with the national popular vote. All you need is enough states to agree to have 270 votes, and boom! Popular vote wins. No, it\u2019s not going to make Hillary Clinton the president. It\u2019s really too late for that. But instead of despair and pointless petitions, you should begin acting for the future you want, today. \\nAs I wrote for Addicting Info, \\nEleven states have already signed on to the National Popular Vote bill, which is an interstate compact agreeing to cast the votes of those states (165 in all) to whoever wins the popular vote in the general election. If more states sign on, specifically 105 votes\u2019 worth, it\u2019s decided \u2014 the popular vote will determine who wins the general election. \\nIf you live in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Washington, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Hawaii, or DC, your district is already on board with truly democratic elections. Although those states are mostly blue, not all of the legislative branches are, so there\u2019s hope! \\nIf you do not live in one of those states, you can pressure your state legislators to pass a bill joining the cause. You can find the progress made in your state already at this link , or find out more behind the movement in general here . \\nIf you don\u2019t like the fact that a Wyoming Republican\u2019s vote counts for four times as much as a Democrat\u2019s in California, see how far along your state is on accepting truly democratic elections. Don\u2019t sign a dumb petition and then forget about it. \\nFeatured image via change.org'"}, "time": 1742628475.042748}
