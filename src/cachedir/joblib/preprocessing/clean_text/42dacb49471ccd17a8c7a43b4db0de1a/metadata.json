[\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t know all there is to know about what Susan Rice was doing,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson ( ).  Rice is accused of \u201cunmasking\u201d the names of American citizens associated with Trump in intelligence reports. Those names are deliberately cloaked to preserve the constitutional protections against warrantless monitoring enshrined in the 4th Amendment. \u201cWhat we do know about Susan Rice is you can\u2019t believe what she says, and that is pretty obvious, so we need to get her under oath,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest that the former administration would utilize the awesome power of the government \u2014  they did it with Lois Lerner and the IRS, using the IRS as a political weapon against their political opponents,\u201d he said. If the Obama administration was willing to use the IRS for political advantage, it is natural for them to use the federal surveillance programs, as well, he said. \u201cWe need to get her under oath in front of the Intelligence Committee and let\u2019s see exactly what we do find out about her,\u201d he said. Johnson said he is not worried that political abuse of surveillance and intelligence gathering programs would jeopardize the actual programs themselves. \u201cIn a responsible person\u2019s hand, it should not be a problem. We do need the ability to gather intelligence. We need the ability to do these things. \u201d The senator said another problem is how intelligence related to Trump made its way into the press. \u201cWe need to keep these pieces of information classified, as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you have classified information and national security interests \u2014  it is how you keep the nation safe. \u201d The senator said there is a difference between national security career professionals and the political appointees, such as Rice. \u201cThe vast majority of people, career folks in the NSA or the FISA courts, these are patriots trying to keep the nation safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have political hacks that potentially use these agencies improperly? That\u2019s the problem. You have to get the political hacks out of the process. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628429.170187}
