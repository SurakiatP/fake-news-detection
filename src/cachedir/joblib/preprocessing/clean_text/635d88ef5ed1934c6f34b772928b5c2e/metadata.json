His informal endorsement of Hillary Clinton shows this clearly. \\nOf course it is hard to say what a \u201clibertarian\u201d is, but it certainly isn\u2019t someone who has supported gun control and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. \\nWeld has \u2026 and is. \\nHe comes from one of the oldest families in America, is a Harvard graduate like many in his family and former governor of Massachusetts. \\nSome of his career was spent with the federal justice system where he sent numerous \u201cwhite collar criminals\u201d to jail. \\nWhy is he the vice presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party? \\nThat\u2019s hard to say. More: \\nThe former Massachusetts governor conceded that a realistic goal for the Libertarian Party in this election would be to win 5% of the popular vote and while he didn\u2019t call for Libertarian voters in swing states to vote for Clinton, he made it clear that he strongly opposes Donald Trump. \\n\u201cI see a big difference between the R candidate and the D candidate and I\u2019ve been at some pains to say that I fear for the country if Mr. Trump should be elected,\u201d Weld said. \u201cIt\u2019s a candidacy without any parallel that I can recall. It\u2019s content-free and very much given to stirring up envy and resentment and even hatred. \\nWeld also said he believes Trump is \u201cpsychologically\u201d unstable, a bully and incapable of \u201ccompetently managing the office of the presidency.\u201d \\nThe article points out that Weld\u2019s criticism of Trump is in contrast to the \u201ckind words\u201d he had for Hillary. It also informs us that Libertarian presidential candidate. Gary Johnson, has criticized both mainstream candidates. \\nWeld is not so even-handed. The article quotes him as saying that he knows Hillary well, has worked with her professionally and believes her to be a \u201cperson of high moral character.\u201d \\nHe also said she is \u201creliable\u201d and \u201can honest person.\u201d He even predicted \u201cchaos\u201d if Trump were elected and said that the continued investigation into Hillary\u2019s emails was just a distraction from more important issues. \\nJust from the public record alone, Weld\u2019s comments on Hillary don\u2019t seem accurate. It seems fairly obvious that Hillary and Bill Clinton have presided over a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d program that funnels donations to the Clinton Foundation in return for political favors they are able to grant or initiate. \\nMeanwhile, the Council on Foreign Relations is evidently America\u2019s most prominent globalist think tank. Weld\u2019s membership certainly implies that he supports a borderless world managed by a technocratic elite using monopoly central banking and global corporatism. \\nLibertarianism certainly implies decentralized power and a lack of a guiding elite, which would seem to be the opposite of what the Council on Foreign Relations obviously endorses. \\nWeld\u2019s presence on the Libertarian ticket is surely more evidence of the meaninglessness of political parties in an era of increase internationalism and high-level homogeneity. \\nInterestingly, while political parties have been neutered from the top down, Trump\u2019s candidacy suggests that there is much different approach among voters who actually have to support these parties. \\nConclusion: Political leadership in modern Western societies usually also doesn\u2019t change much, and Weld\u2019s presence on the Libertarian ticket is testimony to that. However, the current contentiousness in both Britain and America indicate that a change is occurring, though it certainly won\u2019t come from Weld or Hillary. It is not necessarily political change, as it is taking place on a personal level. But over time that will make it even more powerful.'"}, "time": 1742628513.4924836}
