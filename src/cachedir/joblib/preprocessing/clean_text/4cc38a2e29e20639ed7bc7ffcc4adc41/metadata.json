[The charge, strongly denied by the White House, relies on a memo the Times reported was written by Comey shortly after the meeting with Trump, propelling the issue of the fired FBI chief\u2019s credibility to centerstage.   Below, in no particular order, are seven significant problems with Comey\u2019s credibility:     Comey repeatedly failed to seek the recusal of Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch from the Hillary Clinton email probe despite his reported concerns about her partiality. In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials, congressional officials and other government employees, the New York Times reported on numerous major concerns Comey had about Lynch\u2019s intentions toward the Clinton email probe.  According to the report, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Clinton in the email probe. The newspaper reported that \u201cMr. Comey believed (Lynch) had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation. \u201d Adding even more intrigue to the matter, the FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U. S. government\u2019s Clinton email probe, the Times reported. Yet Comey didn\u2019t seek Lynch\u2019s recusal. The Times further reported on Comey\u2019s concerns after Lynch\u2019s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI\u2019s main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general\u2019s plane and reportedly stayed there for about 20 minutes. In a letter sent earlier this month from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired, Rosenstein admonished Comey for failing to seek Lynch\u2019s recusal from the Clinton email probe and instead bypassing the Justice Department to make public pronouncements about the case. \u201cThe Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict,\u201d Rosenstein wrote. \u201cBut the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a   process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. \u201d   Comey violated FBI tradition, bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election. Instead of seeking Lynch\u2019s recusal, as outlined above, Comey decided to go at it alone on the Clinton email probe, taking matters into his own hands and making his public pronouncements about Clinton\u2019s email case without the Justice Department. He did this at an infamous news conference on July 5, 2016 at which Comey criticized Clinton\u2019s private email server as \u201cextremely careless\u201d before finally stating that \u201cno charges are appropriate in this case. \u201d  The Times\u2018 extensive April 22 report cited former Justice officials as \u201cdeeply skeptical\u201d of Comey\u2019s alleged reasoning that he took the public lead because Lynch was compromised: Former Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account. If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised, they say, why did he not seek her recusal? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, former officials said. Mr. Comey\u2019s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation, one they say helps explain his  . But former Justice Department officials say the F. B. I. never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document\u2019s author, and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight. Comey\u2019s injection into the presidential race did not end there. Less than two weeks before the election, the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner. Some of the emails, according to reports, originated on Clinton\u2019s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages. Comey\u2019s decision this time centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case, or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation, which, the Times related, \u201ceveryone acknowledged would create a political furor. \u201d Eventually, Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress. Lynch was against the decision, the Times reported, and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days. The Times added that \u201ceven at the F. B. I. agents who supported their   director were stunned. \u201d \u201cCareer prosecutors and political appointees\u201d at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director, the Times documented. A chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey\u2019s move.   Comey made legal pronouncements about Clinton\u2019s email case. Comey\u2019s July 5 press conference first stated Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with her email server and then took the highly unusual step of declaring that \u201cno charges are appropriate in this case. \u201d With his pronouncements, Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI, which is charged with documenting evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department. The Times, in its April 22 report, cited unnamed \u201cfrustrated\u201d prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them.   Comey reportedly allowed Lynch to persuade him into publicly minimizing the FBI\u2019s criminal investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server. According to the same extensive April 22 report in the New York Times, Lynch, an Obama appointee, convinced Comey to use the word \u201cmatter\u201d instead of \u201cinvestigation\u201d when the FBI director publicly addressed the criminal investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. This despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal investigation. Comey reportedly caved in and called the investigation a \u201cmatter\u201d even though the Times documented his concerns about Lynch\u2019s intentions toward Clinton. The Times reported on a meeting between FBI and Justice officials at which, according to the newspaper\u2019s characterization, \u201cLynch told him (Comey) to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a \u2018matter. \u2019\u201d Continued the Times\u2019 report: Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations. It was a    decision. But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward. As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. \u201cI guess you\u2019re the Federal Bureau of Matters now,\u201d Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there. Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynch\u2019s motivations, he went along and did not call the criminal investigation an investigation. \u201cI am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,\u201d Comey stated mere days after the meeting with Lynch.   Comey denied leaking under oath  \u2014   days before leaks from a    dinner with Trump. In his testimony earlier this month, Comey portrayed himself as someone who does not leak information to the news media, denying he had ever been an anonymous source for news reports related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.  Comey further testified that he never authorized anyone else at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in news media coverage of that investigation or the agency\u2019s probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Nine days later, after Comey\u2019s firing, the New York Times published intimate details allegedly from inside a    dinner at the White House between Comey and Trump that took place seven days after the president was sworn in.  The article quoted liberally from \u201ctwo people who have heard [Comey\u2019s] account of the dinner\u201d in what seems to be a leak from Comey\u2019s camp to fight back after he was fired by Trump. At one point in the article, the Times describes the sources as \u201cassociates\u201d of Comey\u2019s. The White House disputed the Times\u2019 dinner account, which claims that Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty to him. That leak was followed up by another   leak, first published by the New York Times, claiming that Trump attempted during a private meeting to convince Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn.  6 \u2014   Comey was accused of mischaracterizing Huma Abedin\u2019s role regarding emails found by the FBI on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. Speaking under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight, Comey stated that Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin \u201cforwarded hundreds and thousands\u201d of emails to the laptop of her estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner. That mischaracterization prompted the FBI to release a supplement to clarify Comey\u2019s statement. CNN reported on the supplement to Comey\u2019s testimony:  The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \u201chundreds of thousands of emails\u201d that Comey said were \u201cforwarded\u201d from Abedin to her husband\u2019s email \u201cincluded emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding. \u201d   \u2026     While some of those emails may have been sent directly from Huma in order to be printed, officials told CNN, the number was far fewer than the amount Comey described. The FBI confirmed the distinction in its letter Tuesday, which read: \u201cAlthough we do not know the exact numbers, based on its investigation, the FBI believes it is reasonable to conclude that most of the emails found on Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop computer related to the Clinton investigation occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices, with a small number a result of manual forwarding by Ms. Abedin to Mr. Weiner. \u201d 7  \u2014   Comey reportedly allowed the Obama administration to \u201cshut down\u201d a request to publicize the Russia probe last summer, raising questions about political motives. In March, Newsweek reported that Comey first wanted to go public as early as the summer of 2016 about the agency\u2019s information on alleged Russian interference in the presidential campaign. However, Obama administration officials blocked Comey from making public statements, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter speaking to Newsweek. \u201cThe White House shut it down,\u201d one source told the magazine, explaining that Comey had pitched the idea of writing an oped about the subject during a White House Situation Room meeting in June or July. \u201cHe had a draft of it or an outline. He held up a piece of paper in a meeting and said, \u2018I want to go forward. What do people think of this? \u2019\u201d the source said.  The source told Newsweek the meeting was attended by Secretary of State John Kerry, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Continued the report: But many in the room didn\u2019t like the idea, and White House officials thought the announcement should be a coordinated message backed by multiple agencies, the source says. \u201cAn   doesn\u2019t have the same stature. It comes from one person. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
