He was at an internship last December, tutoring at an elementary school, when a student addressed Mr. Lake\u2019s supervisor. \u201cNaivon is smart, right?\u201d the girl had asked. Mr. Lake\u2019s supervisor chuckled and replied that he would not be there otherwise. \u201cIf Naivon is smart, why isn\u2019t he in college?\u201d the girl said. Mr. Lake overheard the conversation, words that rattled him and knocked him into a moment of introspection and unexpected clarity. \u201cI\u2019m not a hypocrite,\u201d Mr. Lake, 20, said. \u201cIf I\u2019m telling her, \u2018You have to go to school and do this,\u2019 I can\u2019t not go to school. \u201d He had graduated from the Benjamin Banneker Academy for Community Development in Brooklyn, but came out with no plans to attend college. He had wandered through school, never fully recovering from the death of his beloved aunt during his sophomore year, but paid just enough attention at school to receive a diploma. \u201cI was always at school, I just wasn\u2019t at class,\u201d Mr. Lake said. Instead, he preferred to hang out with his friends on the courtyard to play soccer. His mother scolded him for his truancy, but it was not enough to improve his attendance. It took a school official to explain to him that the peers he had been skipping class with were going to graduate, but he was not. \u201cIf I don\u2019t graduate, I don\u2019t go to college,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go to college, I won\u2019t get a good job. \u201d He raced to finish assignments for the class credit needed to walk across the stage at graduation. School, after all, was not so difficult, Mr. Lake said. He always had a knack for memorizing information, and was quick to understand math formulas and science theories. He graduated on time, but without a next step in mind. College was a possibility, but not something he had done the work to actually pursue. \u201cI was just lost,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cI figured, I don\u2019t like being idle too long, so I had to get a job. \u201d For the next year, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week at a Duane Reade, hating every shift he clocked in for. In fall 2015, at his mother\u2019s urging, he begrudgingly entered Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow\u2019s Young Adult Internship Program. Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow serves people like Mr. Lake who are considered      and unemployed youths. It is a beneficiary agency of the Community Service Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With its help, Mr. Lake landed a paid internship as a tutor at El Puente Taylor Wythe, which operates an   center and summer camp program. It was rewarding in an unexpected way, he said. \u201cJust being there nurtured me as a whole individual,\u201d he said. \u201cMy patience is way higher than it was before. Tolerance for things is a lot more sturdy. \u201d It was there that he met that inquisitive girl who inspired him to go to college. Earlier this year, he returned to Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow and met with a college counselor. He applied and was accepted into LaGuardia Community College. The Community Service Society used $65 in Neediest funds to pay for Mr. Lake\u2019s college application fee. Mr. Lake is enrolled as a   student, pursuing a major in commercial photography. He has ambitions of starting an event photography business, a passion that developed in high school. He also hopes to eventually pursue a degree in information technology and web design. Yet, Mr. Lake still finds himself fighting boredom with school and struggling to get excited for class, except for his photography assignments. To resist his old habits, he tries to remind himself of the patience and focus he sharpened as a tutor. \u201cI feel like I really matured as a person, after seeing what I\u2019ve gone through and reflecting on it,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to slack off. \u201d He currently works part time as a tutor at El Puente Beacon Leadership Center, where he has motivated many students to complete homework they wanted to put off some later earned perfect scores on those assignments and on tests. They all credit Mr. Lake\u2019s guiding hand with their success. \u201cI really have an impact on someone\u2019s life,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cIt sticks with you. It\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s a powerful thing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562325.0500975}
