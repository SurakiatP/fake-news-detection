Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race has presented some companies with a new challenge: how to find the right balance in their postelection messages to employees and customers. Matt Maloney, the chief executive of the online food delivery company GrubHub, found himself in a clash of business and politics this week after he sent an email to employees on Wednesday that appeared to say that anyone who disagreed with the company\u2019s policy of inclusion and diversity should resign. \u201cAs we all try to understand what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at GrubHub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States,\u201d Mr. Maloney wrote. \u201cIf you do not agree with this statement, then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here,\u201d he said. But on Thursday, in a sign of the new political flash points on the corporate landscape,  a   message was posted to the company\u2019s website with the original email attached. The new message said the message had been misconstrued. \u201cI want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump,\u201d Mr. Maloney wrote. \u201cI would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees. \u201d The footwear company New Balance also encountered a postelection backlash after its vice president for communications, Matt LeBretton, said after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory that \u201cwe feel things are going to move in the right direction. \u201d The remarks were made in an interview with a Wall Street Journal reporter, Sara Germano, who published them on Twitter on Wednesday. The reporter also tweeted that the remarks were made within the context of global trade, noting that New Balance has publicly opposed the   Partnership. New Balance says it makes more than four million pairs of athletic footwear in the United States per year, which represents a limited portion of its sales. Some interpreted the comments as supportive of Mr. Trump, and they drew a backlash. Online, images of New Balance footwear being burned or thrown in the garbage were posted, and there were calls for a boycott. On Thursday, New Balance emailed a message to other news media outlets and Sole Collector, which reports on the sneaker industry and its culture: \u201cAs the only major company that still makes athletic shoes in the United States, New Balance has a unique perspective on trade and trade policy in that we want to make more shoes in the United States, not less. \u201d \u201cNew Balance publicly supported the trade positions of Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump prior to Election Day that focused on American manufacturing job creation and we continue to support them today,\u201d it said. Another New Balance message was published on Twitter on Thursday that also seemed to allude to the controversy, saying it welcomed \u201call walks of life. \u201d Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated Mr. Trump on Twitter on Thursday. Mr. Bezos added that he had an \u201copen mind\u201d and wished Mr. Trump \u201cgreat success in his service to the country. \u201d But comments below the message spoke of canceling Amazon Prime subscriptions and boycotting Amazon altogether, although some were supportive. The New York Times this week examined the views of some business leaders in the postelection climate here. Some   American companies have a tradition of using their unique hold on consumer attention to express support for the causes they believe in. The ice cream company Ben  Jerry\u2019s posted statements on its website advocating for voting rights and climate change action. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, it published an open letter to Mr. Trump on Thursday that it described as a \u201cchallenge\u201d to \u201chear the voices of all Americans. \u201d \u201cWhoa, does your new title sound as weird to you as it does to us?\u201d the letter said, addressing Mr. Trump. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll all get used to it quickly. \u201d \u201cAnd while we recognize that this is the outcome that many wanted, this is also an outcome that leaves half of our country feeling sadness and shock,\u201d it said. \u201cWe want to honor all of our nation\u2019s experience. \u201d Chris Miller, the activism manager at Ben  Jerry\u2019s, said in an interview on Friday that the letter to Mr. Trump had reached about 350, 000 people on the company\u2019s Facebook page and that the feedback had been \u201coverwhelmingly positive. \u201d But he said the letter took longer to draft than the company\u2019s other statements about causes it supports because more \u201ceyeballs\u201d were put on it as the company strove for balance between people who were saddened by the result and those whom \u201cmainstream establishment candidates\u201d did not reach. \u201cWe wanted to be part of setting the tone here,\u201d Mr. Miller said.'"}, "time": 1742563946.1147437}
