You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What\u2019s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). It\u2019s a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And, let\u2019s face it, clich\u00e9s of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It\u2019s a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you\u2019ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. \u201cTravel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place,\u201d said Maureen Towey, the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. \u201cWe ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle, a   balloon or a ski lift, we say yes every time. \u201d On a computer, you\u2019ll also notice a stunning drone video, shot in Tofino, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. \u201cAfter many wet days, there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better,\u201d said Josh Haner, a staff photographer who shot the footage. \u201cAs my drone\u2019s batteries were running out, I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. \u201d And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors, many of whom live overseas or roam the globe, for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First, why now? That is, why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London, Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting, they didn\u2019t make this year\u2019s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting, in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn\u2019t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are, of course, just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. We\u2019d love to hear your suggestions  \u2014   use the #52Places2017 hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours.'"}, "time": 1742628554.7268543}
