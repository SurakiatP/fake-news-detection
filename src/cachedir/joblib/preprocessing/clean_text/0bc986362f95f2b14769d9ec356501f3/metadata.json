Schulte, a marine biologist with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, frowned, withdrew his foot, found another spot nearby and pressed his toe down again. His sneaker sank into the ground, and water pooled around it. \u201cIt\u2019s like that all the time,\u201d Pruitt called out from her back porch. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t dry out anymore. \u201d Schulte looked up at Pruitt, then crouched down to look closer. There were small holes in the ground, spaced about six inches apart, filled with clear water. \u201cFiddler crabs,\u201d he said. He stood up, turned and walked to the periphery of Pruitt\u2019s property, where the yard was rimmed by a thicket of wild,   spartina grasses, matted by wind and salt spray. As I followed Schulte, it felt as if we were walking on a sponge. Every step squished and slurped. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even a yard anymore,\u201d Schulte told me. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s technically more like a marsh, a wetland. \u201d From where we stood, a few hundred feet from the shoreline, the view was  . White fishing boats dotted the Chesapeake Bay under a hazy March sky the eastern shore of Maryland formed a dark, distant stripe on the horizon some 14 miles away. \u201cSometimes I think we were crazy to build a house out here,\u201d Pruitt told me earlier. \u201cBut I guess there are worse places to get stuck. \u201d The real estate market was stalled, she meant, and her family had been unable to sell the property. But it was also the case that she built the house in a place where the bay was steadily advancing on her backyard every year, usually by about a dozen feet. In bad times  \u2014   when a nor\u2019easter stormed through, say  \u2014   great chunks of Tangier were torn off. But even in calmer conditions, the losses were steady and seemingly unstoppable. Week by week, wave by wave, grain by grain, Tangier was washing away. Schulte first visited the island in 2002, when the corps asked him to look into the restoration of some nearby oyster beds. \u201cMy first impression was just how low everything on Tangier was,\u201d he recalled. Most of the island, which consists of several long sandy ridges connected by footbridges and amounts to a little over a square mile, is about four or five feet above sea level. The low elevations and the quiet,   wetlands and tidal creeks produce a sense of living with the water, rather than beside it. Schulte has returned to Tangier several times over the past decade to track its health. Last year, when some money became available at the corps to research the impact of climate change on coastal areas, he and a couple of colleagues began a study on Tangier, believing that this tiny island might also yield insights into the vulnerability of cities and towns all along the Eastern Seaboard. They concluded that Tangier had lost   of its landmass since 1850. To scientists who study the Chesapeake, this was not surprising: Over the past four centuries, Schulte estimates, more than 500 islands have disappeared from the bay, about 40 of them once inhabited. The most striking aspect of the Tangier research, however, was how bleak the island\u2019s future looked. Some of its troubles are the result of the same forces behind   rises everywhere. Warmer global temperatures make oceans bigger  \u2014   a process known as thermal expansion  \u2014   and thus increase sea levels at the same time,   glaciers around the world, along with the ice caps on Greenland and Antarctica, are melting into the ocean. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got it worse here,\u201d Schulte said. Tangier\u2019s location in the center of the bay, along with its friable turf of sand and silt, leaves it dangerously exposed and fragile. What\u2019s more, the land in and around the Chesapeake is sinking, because of lingering effects from geological events dating back 20, 000 years. \u201cThey\u2019re just in a very untenable position,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have any options right now other than something big to turn them around. \u201d A very big construction project, in short. Schulte\u2019s study of Tangier, published online in the journal Nature last year, concluded that the island might have 50 years left and that its residents were likely to become some of the first   refugees in the continental United States. Tangier was not necessarily a lost cause: Schulte outlined a rough engineering plan, costing around $30 million, that involved break waters,   sand and new vegetation that could preserve the island. What his paper couldn\u2019t possibly resolve, though, were the immense economic and political obstacles involved in saving an obscure place from oblivion precisely when big East Coast cities were seeking hundreds of millions of federal dollars for   protection. Indeed, as seas rise and scientists   their projections for an era of floods  \u2014   large parts of Miami Beach, according to some predictions, may be uninhabitable by around 2050  \u2014   Tangier\u2019s situation represents an early glimpse of a problem so enormously complex, so \u201cwicked,\u201d in the argot of social scientists, it seems to defy resolution. There will be dozens of Miamis and thousands of Tangiers. \u201cThe Outer Banks, the Delmarva Peninsula, Long Island, the Jersey Shore  \u2014   they\u2019re in the same boat,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to just take a little longer for them to get to where Tangier is now. \u201d An excruciating question is how we will decide which coastal communities to rescue and which to relinquish to the sea. But a number of other difficulties attend those decisions. How do we   the land, roads and neighborhoods of the places deemed worthy of salvation? How do we relocate residents whose homes can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) be saved? Also, there\u2019s the money problem. A recent study, commissioned by the Risky Business Project, an initiative led by Henry Paulson, Michael Bloomberg and the   billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer, concluded that as much as a   dollars\u2019 worth of coastal property in the United States could be under water by the end of the century. And that figure doesn\u2019t include the cost of further encroachments by flooding. As Skip Stiles, the head of Wetlands Watch, a Virginia nonprofit that focuses on coastal preservation and   rise, puts it, \u201cIs there even enough money in the world to buy out  \u2014   to make whole  \u2014   everybody\u2019s investment that\u2019s going to get soggy?\u201d After we left Marilyn Pruitt\u2019s yard, Schulte and I walked through town together. We dodged resi dents driving golf carts on the narrow roadways  \u2014   there are very few automobiles on Tangier  \u2014   and hopped over a number of large puddles. We made our way to Lorraine\u2019s, the only restaurant open in the colder months. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, from what I see today, that 50 years may be optimistic,\u201d Schulte said. At this rate, he wondered if Tangier had even 25. Renee Tyler, Tangier\u2019s town manager, works in an office next to the airport, in a prefabricated building topped with solar panels. The first thing Tyler said to Schulte when we visited her was: \u201cI wish we could just stick something under the island and just pump it up. You know, inflate it. \u201d She and Schulte discussed how the Army Corps was planning to build a small jetty on the northwestern side of the island in 2018. But it\u2019s a modest project, she told me, and the jetty is not likely to mitigate the worsening floods. So something far more involved, something resembling Schulte\u2019s plan, is needed. The problem is that the island is too poor to fund the work on its own. Tangier  \u2014   population 470  \u2014   is steadfastly working class, with a median household income of about $40, 000. \u201cI started a campaign on generosity. com for donations,\u201d Tyler, a blunt    former Marine, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any billionaires here. \u201d I asked her if the town could borrow money to pay for sea walls or breakers. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019d be able to pay that back,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in our lifetime or our kids\u2019 lifetime. \u201d What about a   tax assessment? Tyler shook her head. \u201cNope. Not here. We\u2019re starting from nothing. \u201d That appears to leave the island at the mercy of the state and federal governments  \u2014   and in particular, the Army Corps of Engineers, which would probably shoulder the burden of any   construction effort. But understanding the process by which the corps gets involved with places like Tangier also helps explain why the island probably faces some rough years ahead. Schulte works out of the corps\u2019s district office in Norfolk, in a squat modern building where I visited him a few weeks before we met on Tangier. He and a number of his superiors made a convincing case to me that the corps is increasingly focused on climate change the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, for instance, recently led the agency to make a thorough assessment of risks to the United States\u2019 North Atlantic coast and to identify potential new   projects. The district commander, Col. Jason Kelly, told me that some of the reflexive tendencies of the corps to build big dams and dikes  \u2014   the old rallying cry, as he put it, of \u201cLet\u2019s get the concrete going!\u201d  \u2014   are now enhanced by holistic (and, often, cheaper) ways of managing floodwaters, by installing natural defenses like marshlands and dunes, say. The corps employs roughly 32, 000 civilians and about 700 military personnel the list of projects it oversees around the country runs to nearly 200 pages. Yet by the standards of federal agencies, the corps\u2019s   budget  \u2014   the money used for the construction, operations and maintenance of domestic, nonmilitary engineering projects  \u2014   is not large, topping off at just under $5 billion last year. Most of that funding goes to maintain navigable waterways, marine ecosystems and dams only a fraction is directed to coastal flood work. Robert Bea, an engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of the agency, told me the corps was \u201calways working on a pretty thin shoestring. And they\u2019re always in this tension between what can be done and what should be done. \u201d The corps does not have complete control over its agenda. Rather, it responds to requests from towns and cities and to the instructions of fed eral lawmakers. Essentially, there are two routes a community can take to initiate the corps\u2019s partici pation, and each takes time. The first is to seek help for smaller projects, under about $10 million each, that are judged important by the corps leader ship and can be funded out of the corps\u2019s annual budget, provided that costs will be shared by a state, county or township. A good example is the small jetty for Tangier, which is meant to preserve a navigation channel and will be paid for by the corps and the state of Virginia. But amid so many other competing state and federal projects, that money has taken decades to secure: The jetty was first proposed in the  . Bigger projects are even more complicated. The week before we met, Kelly said, the corps agreed to conduct a major   study on behalf of Norfolk, which is already suffering so many floods that some of the city\u2019s arterial roads are routinely shut down after storms. Unlike Schulte\u2019s brief scientific assessment on Tangier, major studies like the one for Norfolk need to be authorized by Congress, typically through something known as a Water Resources Development Act bill. After authorization, the study process takes several years and millions of dollars, but it is the crucial step that precedes any large Army Corps construction project. In Norfolk\u2019s case, the eventual work  \u2014   funded jointly by the city and federal governments  \u2014   might take a decade or more and might involve building sea walls, breakwaters, marshlands and pumps. Judging by other big   projects, it might also cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Still, that could prove a bargain for Norfolk if the results significantly reduce the city\u2019s risk of flooding. Compared with the cost of fed eral emergency assistance, along with the potential harm done to the city\u2019s tax revenue, hundreds of millions for   protection isn\u2019t so much. Politics seems to play an outsize role in shaping the corps\u2019s priorities. Every few years, a small number of Washington legislators privately debate a large number of potential Army Corps projects for a new WRDA bill  \u2014   and a powerful member of Congress can often push a pet project to the top of the list. \u201cEverybody jostles and gets in line,\u201d J. David Rogers, a geological engineer at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, told me. \u201cSo if you come out on the top of the WRDA cake, your work gets done. And if it doesn\u2019t, your work doesn\u2019t get done. \u201d Michael Oppenheimer, a professor at Princeton who studies the intersection of climate change and policy, told me that Beltway deals are only part of the problem. The corps exists within a larger government system that focuses more on storm repairs than on preparation and adaptation, and there seems to be no immediate prospect for creating a national organization that can proactively address the coastal problems caused by climate change. \u201cThis is all patchwork,\u201d he says. And our safety web of policies and agencies  \u2014   the corps was founded in 1779  \u2014   predates an age when rising sea levels posed existential threats. To act quickly, wealthy cities like New York have begun to largely   their waterfront defenses. But the United States has more than 88, 000 miles of shoreline roughly five million people and 2. 6 million homes are situated less than four feet above high tide. Considering that the corps already strains under its present workload, it\u2019s hard to know who or what will come to the aid of less affluent towns when sea levels are three or four feet higher than today. Tangier\u2019s prospects seemed to dim even as I listened to Kelly explain his protocol and heard how many cities compete for the corps\u2019s limited funds. \u201cWe know Tangier has to compete with other projects,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cBut we feel  \u2014   I don\u2019t know, is \u2018inconsequential\u2019 the right word? We feel that we\u2019re not a priority, that we\u2019re too small to make a difference. \u201d Tyler said she hadn\u2019t given up, but she was worried. \u201cWe really have not thought of Plan B,\u201d she told me. \u201cOr it may be that Plan B scares me. \u201d Repeatedly she told me, \u201cTime is running out. \u201d And all around Tangier, I had the sense that unlike most seaside towns, where the pace of life tends toward the languorous, clocks were ticking faster than everywhere else. When I walked about the island with Schulte, he was buttonholed by one resident after another and asked a variation of \u201cWhen are you going to start building a sea wall?\u201d Knowing how tricky the funding proc ess can be, he would respond that the soonest anything could happen  \u2014   \u201cat best\u201d  \u2014   might be a few years. He sometimes looked pained as he said it. Later he told me: \u201cI grew up in a   town outside of Pittsburgh. And I remember that feeling when all the steel mills started shutting down, that feeling that there was no viable future. It must be the same here, but on Tangier it\u2019s the land itself that\u2019s the problem. \u201d For any   project, the corps needs to identify what Kelly calls a \u201clegitimate national interest. \u201d The national interest can sometimes be framed in economic and military terms  \u2014   in Norfolk, preserving the city\u2019s shipping port, which also hosts the country\u2019s largest naval base. In other places, crucial ecosystem restoration or, in rarer instances, historical preservation, may justify the corps\u2019s involvement. Schulte\u2019s arguments for saving Tangier are a mix of these. \u201cIt\u2019s the last offshore fishing community in Virginia, literally the last one standing,\u201d he told me over dinner one evening. \u201cWe lose parts of America when we lose places like this. \u201d The island was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Tangier\u2019s community has been there for hundreds of years, Schulte notes  \u2014   the island was mainly settled by several families from Cornwall and Devon, England, in the 1700s and 1800s, and their heritage is still discernible in the residents\u2019 unusual accent, a   Cornwall patois wrapped inside a Virginia twang that has long drawn the attention of linguists and anthropologists. That accent would disappear if the island were lost. Schulte made the economic case too. Tangier\u2019s sea grass (known as subaqueous vegetation beds) and wetlands have significant ecological worth. The subaqueous vegetation beds are where blue crabs reach maturity, and migrating birds rest on the wetlands. The vegetation cleanses the water and air. He has calculated the \u201cecosystem value\u201d of Tangier to be millions of dollars annually. The descendants of the island\u2019s early English settlers continue to work on crab and oyster boats. When the town was founded, its fishermen, known here as watermen, had no idea that ecological disaster would threaten the island. \u201cIt\u2019s not like someone who builds in a floodplain intentionally, knowing that there\u2019s this chance,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cSo I feel that these people should get some help. \u201d He added that the problem was not just a few houses: \u201cIt\u2019s the whole town. \u201d   them on the mainland would be expensive. \u201cLet\u2019s say we do nothing and let the island go away, and then move everybody. How do we deal with that? It\u2019s not going to be a cheap undertaking, and it\u2019s going to be well beyond what the people there can pay. \u201d His bottom line was that bringing the island back to health could be   as well as virtuous. Schulte did not take the challenges of fixing Tangier lightly, though. He brought up the example of Poplar Island, a spot in the Chesapeake some 60 miles north of Tangier, to explain why. Within the small community of engineers and scientists who spend their days thinking about how to save entire islands or coastal cities from vanishing during this century, Poplar looms greatly. In the late 1800s, it was home to Valliant, a small village with a post office, a school and 100 residents. Unfortunately, Valliant also had a sawmill. In cutting down the island\u2019s trees for lumber, the islanders destroyed the root system holding their soil together. By around 1920, Valliant was abandoned. And by the 1990s, Poplar Island shrank from about 1, 200 acres to five acres and was on the cusp of extinction. I went to Poplar, which is about two miles from Maryland\u2019s eastern shore, in late March, accompanied by Justin Callahan, a project manager for the corps\u2019s Baltimore division. He first traveled to Poplar in 1993, when it was just a tiny sandbar. \u201cWe\u2019re at 1, 140 acres now,\u201d he told me during the boat ride over, \u201cand ultimately we\u2019ll be expanding it to a total of 1, 715 acres. \u201d The island is being resurrected, and what you find on Poplar now is a   project on a biblical scale, rising out of the Chesapeake. In 2003, the corps began building a   dike as the island\u2019s new perimeter. This \u201chard\u201d boundary was composed of sand piles covered with a strong textile material and topped with crushed stone and huge,   boulders. Since then, the corps has been filling the pools inside the perimeter wall with silt dredged from the channels leading into Baltimore Harbor and carted here by scow 24 hours a day during active periods of construction. The dredging of the channels would have occurred anyway  \u2014   it\u2019s necessary to keep the port deep enough for large cargo ships  \u2014   but ordinarily the silt would be dumped out in the ocean. By depositing it here, the state of Maryland, which owns Poplar, gets a better harbor and a new island. When it\u2019s finished, in 2040 or so, Poplar will be a wildlife sanctuary devoid of residents. \u201cA lot of what you usually see with the corps is known as \u2018pump and dump,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Callahan said once we reached the island. He was dressed in jeans and work boots, and he quickly borrowed a truck to give me a tour. We drove past a long line of trailers that serve as offices for the roughly 25 workers who come here daily  \u2014   no one stays overnight  \u2014   before turning onto a main dirt road that runs along the spine of the new island. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Pump and dump\u2019 means you dredge it, deposit it and walk away,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut this is different. A tremendous amount of engineering went into this. \u201d Half the island is being sculpted into wetlands, Callahan said, pointing to   areas to my right, which had already been planted with spartina grass and were starting to flourish. The other half of the island will be dry \u201cuplands. \u201d These were on Callahan\u2019s left. Some of the upland hills have already been built to about 17 feet above sea level, on the way to about 25 feet, according to Callahan, a height that should fortify the island. In time, the uplands will be planted with pine trees. The corps will in effect undo the error that the residents of Poplar made 100 years ago. As we drove along, Callahan pointed out a pipe three feet in diameter running alongside the road. It carried dredged material pumped from Poplar\u2019s bulkhead, where ships arrived with the silt carried from Baltimore channels, to the places being \u201cinfilled\u201d on Poplar. Callahan parked at the end of the pipe so we could see the silt pour out into a roadside pool. It was black and viscous. Over the next few weeks, as the dark soup pooled higher and higher, water would drain out, the sediment would dry and settle and the process would then be repeated until the area reached the desired elevation. Surrounded by the dust and the noise of machinery, it was hard to picture the green idyll of the future. The whole place smelled like mud. Poplar will ultimately cost about $1. 4 billion  \u2014   or roughly $800, 000 per acre. Earlier, Tan gier\u2019s town manager, Renee Tyler, told me: \u201cWhat baffles me the most is that no one lives on Poplar. And they spent all this money on it. We have people who live here, as well as sea life and birds. \u201d Yet there are a number of reasons, some of them bureaucratic and obscure, that get in the way of using Baltimore harbor\u2019s silt to build up Tangier. This is Maryland\u2019s mud, not Virginia\u2019s, and Poplar (unlike Tangier) has the good fortune to lie within Maryland\u2019s waters. Another factor that works in Poplar\u2019s favor: the project has a defensible,   appeal. \u201cIf you want to do ecosystem restoration on a large scale,\u201d Callahan told me on the boat ride back, \u201cit\u2019s expensive, so it has to have a big economic driver. \u201d Here, the economic driver involves the effort to preserve the port of Baltimore, \u201cwhich is just a huge regional economic engine. \u201d That\u2019s what makes it difficult for Tangier, he added. No one would dispute that Tangier had a unique fishing culture and history, he remarked. \u201cIt has no harbor project, though,\u201d Callahan said. Then he added, rhetorically, \u201cWhat is the economic driver for Tangier?\u201d One afternoon on Tangier, I stopped by the fire station to visit Anna   a member of the Town Council and also Tangier\u2019s paramedic.   grew up on the island, and as a teenager she thought about leaving. \u201cBut when you get Tangier mud between the toes,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s hard to go. \u201d She lives with her husband and children in her grandparents\u2019 house. For more than 40 years, she said, the house never flooded, but several recent storms brought water in. \u201cWe\u2019ve since had it elevated so it doesn\u2019t flood, and we had our land graded,\u201d she explained. But she sees the land all around Tangier sinking and eroding. Her    son told her that he wants to be a waterman. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that will be possible,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut that\u2019s what he wants. \u201d When I asked if she thought Tangier could provide a future for her children, she said: \u201cIf all of the wheels turn that need to turn, I do believe that we can be saved, and even built back up  \u2014   not necessarily to the size we were 200 years ago. But if you look at projects like Poplar Island, it is possible. \u201d What is vexing for Tangierians is that their local challenges, as difficult as they seem, may pale next to their broader,   problems. \u201cIt will take two things to save the island,\u201d David Schulte says. \u201cOne is to engineer and repair it now. The other is to make sure that the   scenario of climate change doesn\u2019t happen, because I\u2019ve seen what that looks like in the computer modeling, and we don\u2019t want to go there. A lot of Norfolk is under water. Miami is under water. \u201d Tangier, too. For the moment, the world is on course for the   impacts of   rise  \u2014   perhaps up to six feet by 2100, a result of carbon dioxide pushing up temperatures and the polar ice sheets pouring meltwater into the oceans. At the same time, the forces that make the Chesapeake area so vulnerable (the region currently experiences about five millimeters of relative   rise annually, significantly more than the global annual average of three millimeters) will not be getting any better. \u201cThe land is likely to be sinking for many thousands of years,\u201d says Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who has studied the area\u2019s geology. The Gulf Stream presents another problem. At present, this circulation of warm water in the Atlantic Ocean produces variations in sea level. The surface of the Atlantic is about 60 centimeters lower off the coast of New Jersey than it is off Bermuda, according to Robert Kopp, a professor at Rutgers. If the Gulf Stream weakens, Kopp says, as it is expected to do in a warmer climate, then the differences in sea level will equalize. Oceans will be even higher in the   region. This portends trouble not only for the Chesapeake, but also for Long Island and the Jersey Shore. And water will meanwhile be seeping into other urban centers. A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists concluded that several dozen American cities  \u2014   including Boston, New Haven and Savannah, Ga.  \u2014   could suffer more than 50 floods per year by about 2045 if they don\u2019t take serious measures to mitigate the rising tides at least a dozen other places, including Philadelphia and Wilmington, N. C. may flood more than 150 times a year. If federal lawmakers find that hard to believe, they will see proof out the window: Parts of Washington could be inundated 388 times a year. To Chris Moore, a senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, \u201cwe\u2019re not anywhere near the point where we need to write off an entire community. \u201d Still, the science suggests that it may soon be time to consider which towns, islands and cities can (or cannot) be saved. This, in turn, prompts some hard thinking about which criteria  \u2014   economic wealth, population density, natural appeal, historical value  \u2014   should weigh most heavily in those decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sad fact that we can\u2019t spend an infinite amount of money defending the coast,\u201d Michael Oppenheimer, the Princeton professor, says. \u201cAnd the concept of retreat, which is sort of   has to be normalized. It has to become part of the culture. Because there are some places where we\u2019re really going to have to retreat. \u201d I asked Skip Stiles, of Wetlands Watch, if there were reasons to spend vast sums on flood defenses even when   outcomes looked bleak. He surprised me by saying that some kind of investment could be an essential part of a regional or national strategy.   fixes, even expensive ones, could allow residents and governments to make choices about how to help or resettle people a sudden annihilation of hope, on the other hand, could destroy a town\u2019s real estate values and tax base. You\u2019d have a rapid exodus, another Poplar Island. Ben Strauss of Climate Central, a research organization based in Princeton, N. J. seems to agree. \u201cA coastal community can understand that its life can be limited by future   rises,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut that shouldn\u2019t stop it from having a vital presence today. \u201d He also thinks it\u2019s conceivable that if the country\u2019s most threatened communities can address their potential demise as fairly as possible, they could serve as exemplars. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge gift to other communities,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause this is going to be a widely shared problem. \u201d For the moment, though, the notion of managed decline is mostly just an idea. When Schulte\u2019s research on Tangier came out, some of the islanders came up with the idea of distributing   that read \u201cI refuse to become a   refugee. \u201d When Schulte and I went downtown one afternoon to meet with Carol   a native of Tangier who helped create the shirts, she told him: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about climate change. But if calling me a   refugee gets me a sea wall, then go ahead, call me a   refugee. \u201d If the residents of Tangier want to look for insights into how their world might end, they can go to the northern edge of their island, to an area known as Uppards. Though it was connected to the rest of Tangier a century ago, Uppards is now a   parcel of land separated from the inhabited, southern part of the island by a broad navigation channel used by watermen. One day on Tangier, Schulte accepted an invitation from a visitor named Ron Kesner to see Tangier and Uppards by air, in Kesner\u2019s   Cessna, and I tagged along. Kesner is a resident of the Virginia mainland who has been visiting Tangier regularly for several years with his wife, Jodi Jones Smith, a coastal scientist, to study the island\u2019s erosion. On a crisp afternoon with breathtaking visibility, we took off from Tangier\u2019s small airport, climbed to a thousand feet and began to circle the island. From above, it looked like the remains of an island  \u2014   a   triangle with so many small ponds and streams it seemed like a large perforated leaf floating on a glassy green sea. If you looked closely, you could also see sandbars in the shallow waters surrounding it as recently as 50 years ago, some of these were above sea level, and home to houses and beaches. They were now under five or 10 feet of water. \u201cIt\u2019s really been cut to shreds, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Kesner said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re a couple hours past high tide, too,\u201d Schulte replied. He hadn\u2019t seen the island from the air for a decade, he remarked, and the \u201cponding\u201d all over worried him. It suggested that water was not only leaching in from the shorelines but was bubbling up from underneath Tangier too. \u201cWow,\u201d he said, his face nearly pressed to the window. \u201cThey are on the edge. \u201d As we circled the Uppards area just north of Tangier, Schulte asked me: \u201cDo you see that line running along the center?\u201d That was once a road, he said. It had connected a small village known as Canaan, at the northern tip of Uppards, to Tangier village. Canaan is gone. It was abandoned around 1920, when the villagers, roughly 120 of them, left. Rather than physical deterioration, it seems to have been social erosion  \u2014   not enough churchgoers and students, according to a report by the National Park Service  \u2014   that hastened the town\u2019s end. Many of the 35 houses on Uppards were moved to Tangier\u2019s village, where some still remain. A few, however, were left behind to be taken by the sea. Only one photograph of Canaan exists, from a 1910 magazine article. Instead there are recollections, passed down to Tangier residents like Anna   whose   lived in Canaan. A few hours after I saw Uppards from the air, I visited the area by boat with Schulte and Carol   who also traces her roots to Canaan. Over the past few years, she has come to be regarded as its unofficial historian, the keeper not only of shards of information about the inhabitants  \u2014   \u201cIt used to be beautiful green grass, chickens, roses, fig trees,\u201d she told me  \u2014   but also of physical fragments that wash up where the town once stood. She told me that 10 years ago she found an English whiskey bottle from the 1600s. One lingering problem with Uppards is that the remnants of the Canaan cemetery, now half underwater, have proved difficult to collect and move. Though some bodies have been relocated, bones and parts of coffins continue to wash into the tide regularly.   told me that once she was waiting for a ferry on Tangier\u2019s dock and saw a femur on a nearby bank. Canaan  \u2014   and Uppards Island  \u2014   matter to the people of Tangier for two reasons. The first is that even in its tattered state, it protects the rest of Tangier from the erosive northern currents of the Chesapeake. As our boat drew nearer, Schulte told me he thinks Uppards is now losing about 10 feet of shoreline a year. And, he said, \u201cIf you lose Uppards, you lose the town of Tangier, because then the town would be unsheltered. \u201d The second reason residents care about Uppards is that it represents a possible future. \u201cI\u2019m not a pessimist,\u201d   told me. \u201cBut I see what\u2019s happening. Without a sea wall on the east side, or a sea wall on the west side, Tangier will just be in the history books. It will be like this place, like Uppards. \u201d We had come ashore from her small boat. She looked around and spread her arms and said, \u201cBut isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d It was indeed  \u2014   but also windswept, lonesome, strange. She began leading us past tidal pools and along the beach, a mix of silt and peat held together by the thin roots of marsh grasses. The lapping of the Chesapeake was ripping away the peat at the water\u2019s edge. As   narrated, we walked by piles of oyster shells  \u2014   middens, most likely, dating back to Native American settlers  \u2014   and soon came upon a large scattering of red bricks, smoothed and made porous by time and weather, that had probably served as the foundation of Canaan\u2019s homes. Not far away was a large iron ring, sunk into the mud, which marked the top of an old freshwater well. All around us were old bottles and dead bushes and gnarled stumps, including the skeleton of a large fig tree. \u201cThat died three years ago,\u201d   said, blaming the intrusion of saltwater, which made survival for most plants difficult. Beyond the fig tree were a number of weathered marble headstones from the old Canaan graveyard, lying flat on the beach. Schulte began turning them over to read the inscriptions. The familiar Tangier names  \u2014   the old families that had come here from Cornwall hundreds of years ago  \u2014   still echoed: Margaret Pruitt, Polly Parks.   led us farther eastward. Over the next few weeks, I thought of her many times  \u2014   this woman who takes her small boat to Uppards almost every day, weather permitting, to walk the beach, stepping gingerly over fallen headstones while searching for bottles and buttons or taking a moment to appreciate the blooms of a dying rosebush planted by someone (an ancestor?) more than a century ago. Sometimes, she told me, especially in summer, she brings along her grandchildren to help her gather things exposed by the tide, even though, as she put it, \u201cthe sun is so hot you can barely stand it. \u201d She had found toy marbles and old coins and coffin handles she had also discovered arrowheads and a Native American ax head of smoothed stone that must have preceded the settlement of Canaan by many centuries. But every week, she said, there was a bit less land and brush. And every visit was an effort to gather the final, sodden artifacts of a place that would vanish, almost completely, within a few years. We walked for a while more. Eventually, we reached an area beyond the remains of Canaan where the empty beach stretched through mud, marsh grass and scattered oyster shells. Schulte said he wanted to keep going farther, along the eastern shore of Uppards, and   agreed to return later in her boat to pick him up. Schulte said that he thought he might have seen a living pine tree during the flight on the Cessna. \u201cI want to go see if I can find it. \u201d Standing on the beach,   said, \u201cSometimes it\u2019s so hard to imagine this was a town. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like no one ever lived here,\u201d Schulte replied. Then he turned and began walking to find the last tree.'"}, "time": 1742561955.9740107}
