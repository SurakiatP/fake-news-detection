But Muhammad Ali shook the world with more than his electrifying speed and power in the ring. He also shook the world with the power of his convictions: his determination to stand up to the rules of the Jim Crow South, and to assert his freedom to invent himself  \u2014   \u201cI don\u2019t have to be what you want me to be. I\u2019m free to be what I want. \u201d \u201cI am America,\u201d he proudly declared, decades before the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cI am the part you won\u2019t recognize. But get used to me. Black, confident, cocky my name, not yours my religion, not yours my goals, my own get used to me. \u201d He stood with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for freedom and social justice. And he stood up against the Vietnam War, refusing to be drafted in 1967 on religious grounds as a conscientious objector  \u2014   a decision that would cost him his boxing title,     years of his career at the peak of his powers, tens of millions of dollars in prize money and endorsements, and for many years, his popularity. These acts of conscience are part of the reason that older fans, including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, who eulogized Ali, were so deeply affected by his death. As his wife, Lonnie, noted, he also died at a moment when \u201cwe face uncertainty in a world and divisions at home as to who we are as a people. \u201d It\u2019s a moment when racism has infected the presidential race, when many politicians lack the courage to stand up for their own convictions, when radical jihadists have been trying to subvert the peaceful vision of Islam embraced by Ali. Ali\u2019s willingness to speak truth to power outside the ring and his embodiment of many of the political and cultural changes that rocked America in the 1960s are also reasons so many fans spent the weeks after his death watching old videos and reading books about him, of which there are a multiplying number. Ali was a    novelistic figure: not only an incandescent athlete dancing under the lights but also a showman, poet, philosopher, performance artist, statesman and   pioneer, a man compared to Whitman, Robeson, Malcolm X, Ellington and Chaplin. Writers were magnetized by his contradictions: the G. O. A. T. (Greatest of All Time) who vanquished some of the baddest men on the planet but became one of the world\u2019s most revered humanitarians a deeply religious man who loved practical jokes and practically invented trash talk \u201ca radical even in a radical\u2019s time,\u201d as President Obama put it, who became so beloved by Americans across the political spectrum that he was featured in a DC Comics book in which he teamed up with Superman to save the world. He is best remembered today for his boastful doggerel (\u201cAli\u2019s got a left, Ali\u2019s got a   if he hits you once, you\u2019re asleep for the night\u201d) but he also wrote more serious verse: a poem about the Attica prison riots read, \u201cBetter far from all I   To die fighting to be   What more fitting end could be?\u201d Over the years, Ali has also inspired an uncommon amount of stellar writing, from Norman Mailer\u2019s classic account of the boxer\u2019s stunning victory over George Foreman in Zaire in 1974 to David Remnick\u2019s \u201cKing of the World,\u201d a powerful account of Ali\u2019s emergence as a transformative figure in American politics and culture. There are also a plethora of essays about Ali by such gifted writers as Joyce Carol Oates, George Plimpton, Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson and Roger Kahn, many of which can be found in a terrific anthology, \u201cThe Muhammad Ali Reader\u201d (1998). The newest Ali books, recently rushed into print, hardly rise to the top of the stack. \u201cMuhammad Ali: A Tribute to the Greatest\u201d is a hodgepodge of Thomas Hauser\u2019s many essays  \u2014   lackluster in comparison with the author\u2019s valuable 1991 oral history, \u201cMuhammad Ali: His Life and Times. \u201d Tim Shanahan\u2019s \u201cRunning With the Champ,\u201d an old friend\u2019s reminiscences, has its share of touching moments, but proves less revealing than the 2004 book (\u201cThe Soul of a Butterfly\u201d) written by Ali with his daughter Hana Yasmeen Ali  \u2014   an elliptical, collagelike memoir that offered a philosophical look back at his life. Both these books give glimpses of Ali\u2019s dignified,   struggle with Parkinson\u2019s, the disease that cruelly robbed him of the dazzling physical and verbal agility of his youth  \u2014   a struggle that could not help but remind older readers of the passage of time and their own mortality, and boxing\u2019s existential proximity to death (or what Ali once called \u201cthe near room\u201d after his war of attrition with Joe Frazier in Manila in 1975). As for Sports Illustrated\u2019s \u201cMuhammad Ali, \u201d it\u2019s a pretty souvenir of Ali\u2019s life in the ring, with excerpts from that magazine\u2019s voluminous archives and some of the most dramatic sports photos ever taken. They are photos that capture the boxer popping and smoking and throwing lightning bolts in the ring  \u2014   testaments to what the fighter Jos\u00e9 Torres called \u201chis prodigious magic. \u201d The archetypal photo of a victorious Ali, standing over the fallen body of Sonny Liston. A violent action shot of him catching George Foreman with a hard right in the Rumble in the Jungle. And one of him locked in a grim   with an exhausted Frazier in the \u201cThrilla in Manila. \u201d There are also images of a skinny,    Cassius Clay learning to box, and a solemn Ali, surrounded by reporters, explaining his opposition to the Vietnam War. These new books will help younger readers understand just what a long strange trip Ali\u2019s life has been, and how much social and cultural landscape he traversed. \u201cMuhammad Ali was America  \u2014   he will always be America,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote. \u201cHe was our most basic freedoms  \u2014   religion, speech, spirit. He embodied our ability to invent ourselves. His life spoke to our original sin of slavery and discrimination, and the journey he traveled helped shock our conscience and lead us on a roundabout path toward salvation. \u201d These books also prompt us to remember that perseverance was one of the consistent melodies in Ali\u2019s life: coming back after his   exile to reclaim the world championship in 1974 by toughing it out against Foreman in Zaire coming back to beat Frazier twice, after losing their first arduous matchup and coming back against Leon Spinks in 1978 to win the world heavyweight championship for a third time. As Ali once observed: \u201cChampions aren\u2019t made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them  \u2014   a desire, a dream, a vision. They have to have   stamina, they have to be a little faster, they have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill. \u201d When Cassius Clay was growing up in Louisville, Ky. the town was segregated, and even when he returned home from the 1960 Olympics with a gold medal around his neck, he was turned away from a luncheonette when he walked in and ordered a glass of juice. He would return to the Olympics     decades later in Atlanta in 1996 as its final torchbearer. By then, he\u2019d become one of the most revered men in the world  \u2014   \u201ca universal soldier for our common humanity,\u201d in the words of Bill Clinton, who like many in the audience that day, wept watching Ali light the caldron, his hand trembling violently from Parkinson\u2019s disease. This month, Louisville  \u2014   where a young Cassius Clay heard calls of \u201cnigger go home\u201d if he ventured beyond his neighborhood  \u2014   turned out to pay tribute to Ali, as his funeral motorcade made its way through the city. Mourners showered his car with flowers and rose petals and all along the route, The Louisville   reported, lawns had been mowed and driveways freshly swept  \u2014   out of respect for the Greatest on his final journey.'"}, "time": 1742562048.9459546}
