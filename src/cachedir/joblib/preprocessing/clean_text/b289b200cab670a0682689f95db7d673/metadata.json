[In a debate with Breitbart News, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer claimed that Republicans did get funding for a \u201cwall,\u201d pointing to existing photos of fences with bollard style steel construction and \u201clevee walls. \u201d  \u201cThat is called a bollard wall,\u201d he said to Breitbart News, pointing to photos he displayed on a screen. \u201cThat is called a levee wall. \u201d Spicer refused to describe his fence photos as Trump\u2019s promised wall, but assured them that it would be effective in protecting the border. He told reporters that the fencing was endorsed by DHS Secretary John Kelly. Kelly has proposed large bollard fencing to help secure the border, although he has also supported the idea of \u201ca concrete wall\u201d on the border. \u201cThere are places along the border, and I would offer to you, down in the southern Rio Grande valley, where a wall, a concrete wall, makes all the sense in the world,\u201d he told Bloomberg News in April. \u201cThere are other places where a   wall, say a large bollard, if you will, fence, makes a lot of sense. \u201d The House budget agreement specifically cites funding for \u201cborder fencing\u201d and \u201csteel bollard designs,\u201d not a wall, after Democrats insisted that money for border security would not be used to fund Trump\u2019s wall.

In a January interview with Sean Hannity, President Trump mocked existing \u201clittle toy walls\u201d on the Southern border and said \u201cI don\u2019t know why they even wasted their time\u201d on building them.
