However, Cruickshank did say \u201cit must also be noted\u201d there had been a number of \u201cfalse flag plots\u201d orchestrated by \u201c  extremist\u201d in Europe. \u201cWell, obviously a suicide bomber, that would be the hallmarks of an Islamist terrorist plot attack,\u201d Cruickshank replied. \u201cSo, they\u2019ll be looking in that direction tonight if they indeed do confirm there was a suicide bomber involved. There eyewitnessed interviewed in the last few minutes on BBC Radio talking about what they\u2019re describing as nuts all over the floor. And that would be consistent with a kind of   of device, which we\u2019ve seen groups like   and ISIS encourage their recruits to build. So that\u2019s the only way this is pointing tonight. We cannot conclude that for sure at this stage. We are going to have to wait for police to tell us much more in the hours ahead. \u201d \u201cBut given the fact that they\u2019re looking into this real possibility, and it is there would appear some evidence that this was a suicide bombing \u2014   that certainly takes you down the Islamist terrorist direction,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt must also be noted that in recent months in Europe, there have been a number of false flag plots where   extremists have tried frame Islamists for terrorism. We have seen that in Germany in recent weeks. But a suicide bomber does take you down the direction of Islamist terror. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563666.118823}
