We\u2019re going to have to come out of the box with blazing guns. There was a movie or something called \u2018Blazing Saddles.\u2019 We\u2019re going to have to do that if we want to see this law preserved. \u201d Back in 2010, during an appearance on MSNBC, Clyburn said that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s (R) map of some Democrats who voted for Obamacare that had rifle crosshairs was \u201cbeyond the pale. And they need to stop this, because, I can tell you, I\u2019ve seen how these things escalate. People out there in the streets get their signals, or what they think are their signals, from the people in positions like we hold. And so, if we don\u2019t disown that, and go get our people to move beyond that. If we participate in it, either from the balcony, or on the floor of the House, you are aiding and abetting this kind of terrorism, really. \u201d (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564172.0003793}
