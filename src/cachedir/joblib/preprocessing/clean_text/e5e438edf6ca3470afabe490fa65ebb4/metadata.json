Proving just that, she just floated an idea for a potential cabinet member, but it could actually end her once and for all. \\nAt this point, it\u2019s clear that Hillary isn\u2019t in control of her own campaign. If she was, she would have buried herself a long time ago. As we continue to get glimpses of her crooked behavior that she tries to keep behind the curtain, it doesn\u2019t take too much of a genius to know that she doesn\u2019t really have any good ideas of her own. Hillary Clinton \\nProving just that is a potential cabinet member she floated during an interview with Extra . As she didn\u2019t have her strategists whispering in her ear at the time, telling her when to shut up and when to speak, she actually stated that she would love to have Michelle Obama as a part of her team . \\nMichelle Obama is a nobody outside of being married to a president. She\u2019s been nothing more than a freeloader for the past 8 years who has done literally nothing but make the lives of the American people a living hell. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama \\nDespite Michelle\u2019s failed legacies and lackadaisical tendencies, Hillary still thought that she would make a great addition to her team. Then again, both Hillary and Michelle have a taste for the finer things in life and enjoy the fruits of everyone else\u2019s labor. \\nWhen directly asked if she would like Michelle in her cabinet, Hillary simply stated : \\n\u201cShe\u2019s made it pretty clear she wants to focus on important issues like girls\u2019 education around the world \u2013 she and I actually talked about it when we were together in Winston-Salem \u2013 and I want to be the best partner I can be for whenever she wants to be involved in government again.\u201d \\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t quite the end of the thought process as she next went against what President Barack Obama said in that Michelle wasn\u2019t interested in the slightest when it came to furthering herself in the political realm. \u201cI think she wants to take a break from it, but if she ever wants to do anything like that, I would be the number-one person,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how anybody could have done what she\u2019s done for the last eight years with more grace and more of a sense of purpose but inclusivity.\u201d \\nHillary\u2019s sentiments become laughable when she hints to the idea that Michelle actually did anything. Think long and hard about what she did and you\u2019ll come up with nothing. Her lunch policy only left kids hungry and unsatisfied before failing overall when schools systematically began to reject her mandate. Michelle and Barack Obama \\nMaking sure girls are taught everywhere? Well, all we saw was Michelle flying around the globe and taking several vacations while demanding other countries change their ways. Beyond the fact that this does absolutely nothing for the American people (and actually hurts them on account of the cost associated with the several trips), it only ticked people off and made Americans look pretty stupid. \\nOf course, this would be a \u201csmart\u201d choice for Hillary seeing how blind leftists love and support Michelle for some reason. However, all it really equates to are a few more votes in her pocket as she panders to the audience of someone else. Basically, Hillary is trying to whore Michelle out. I wonder how she feels about that.'"}, "time": 1742628583.0154247}
