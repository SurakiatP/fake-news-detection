From 1971 to 1974, he starred in two of the greatest events in the history of American sports, fights with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden and George Foreman in Kinshasa that had names that belonged on a movie studio\u2019s release schedule: \u201cThe Fight of the Century\u201d and \u201cThe Rumble in the Jungle. \u201d In October 1975 came a rematch with Frazier. They called that one \u201cThe Thrilla in Manila. \u201d But with all due respect to Francis Ford Coppola, everyone who saw Ali and Frazier nearly kill each other that oppressively sticky Manila morning knew it was the original \u201cApocalypse Now. \u201d In 1965, the photographer Neil Leifer captured Ali after he had knocked out Sonny Liston two minutes into their match  \u2014   Ali stands over a   Liston, roaring in conquest, making you think the man is playing a totally different sport. To stick with the \u201cJaws\u201d comparison, he was the shark, the ocean and the boat captain, and if he was fighting, you were going to need a bigger bout  \u2014   the biggest. It wasn\u2019t just the matches that were blockbusters. It was Ali himself. He was the most important   figure to survive the deadly tumult of the 1960s and flourish in the 1970s. Ali licked Liston, Frazier, Foreman and dozens of other men. But he was at the center of American culture in part because he had turned boxing into a condition of the American self: Punch or be punched. With him, boxing wasn\u2019t just a sport but a referendum on the state of the country. He had become larger than life, but without forgetting how much black lives matter. The legacy of his bodacious charisma was built to last well beyond his death on Friday. Ali was telegenic, funny, clever, blunt, fearless and, above all, politically principled. His beliefs transfixed and polarized the country: What would he say next where would he take us? The short answer to that second question is \u201con a public journey. \u201d Ali was a politically black Zelig, but instead of merely lurking within the times, he shaped them. He was complicated and contradictory as both a man and an   embracing and shedding radical black Islam, wielding racist imagery to rile opponents, refusing to play the black clown for the press. The journey led the baddest boxer in the world to shake hands with Gerald R. Ford, one of the blander presidents. He acted on Broadway and wrote braggadocio raps that we called poetry because, at the time, we didn\u2019t know what rap was. By the time he lit the Olympic torch for the Atlanta Games in 1996, he was an elder statesman, visibly shuddering with signs of Parkinson\u2019s disease, a powerful, poignant distance from his 1960s self but still  . The day after he upset Liston in 1964, he hooked up with the Nation of Islam and announced that he would no longer be going by his birth name, Cassius Clay. Sure, it was the name of a white abolitionist  \u2014   from Ali\u2019s own Kentucky, no less  \u2014   but it felt like a slave name, too. The news media took its sweet time coming around to \u201cMuhammad Ali. \u201d Many reporters kept calling him Cassius, in a childish,   style. So he had to fight for that, too. By 1977, when LeVar Burton\u2019s Kunta Kinte chose in \u201cRoots\u201d to be whipped for refusing to repeat his new name, you can imagine a portion of the 30 million people who watched exhaling something like, \u201cOh. I get it!\u201d Nonetheless, Ali\u2019s embrace of the     Nation of Islam alarmed the country. Almost overnight, a cocky young fighter became a scary black man. In 1967, he claimed   status and refused the Army induction to fight in Vietnam, saying to the press: \u201cI ain\u2019t got no trouble with them Vietcong. It ain\u2019t right. They never called me \u2018nigger.\u2019 \u201d His defiance brought out competing paradoxes: Until America reconciled its war with itself, how could it ask a citizen to fight somewhere else? He was fined $10, 000, sentenced to five years in prison, stripped of his boxing title and forced to wait three and a half years for the Supreme Court to overturn his conviction. He lost prime fighting years and gained honor. The roaring monster in Leifer\u2019s photo now appeared on the cover of Esquire, in his boxing trunks, his bare chest shot with arrows just like poor, martyred St. Sebastian. Another astonishing transformation: The scary black man had become a national folk hero. Ali\u2019s objection to the war came the same year that Sidney Poitier, long a symbol of the possibilities of racial integration and of turning the other cheek, hauled off and slapped an old white racist in \u201cIn the Heat of the Night. \u201d (He\u2019d finally run out of cheeks.) By the 1970s, Poitier had found a second, less gusty wind, directing and starring in slick comedies that pushed the kind of cultural politics of appearing respectable (if not accommodating) that Ali sometimes espoused. Take this moment from 1974 on \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show. \u201d Douglas asks his guest   Sly Stone, to introduce Ali. And Sly  \u2014   cool, stoned,   enthusiastic  \u2014   brings Ali out like this: \u201cI love Muhammad Ali. \u201d Out strolls Ali. He looks crisp in a great dark suit, white shirt and tie. They shake hands, and Sly, in a       goes in for a hug. Ali has barely taken his seat when Douglas\u2019s joshing sarcasm sets the tone: \u201cYou\u2019re happy again today. I can tell. \u201d The audience laughs, and then Douglas completes his thought: \u201cYou never walk out with a nice smile. You always look troubled,\u201d as if Ali  \u2014   the world\u2019s greatest athlete, least likely sufferer of fools, and most famous living civil right activist  \u2014   was supposed to be Soupy Sales. If Douglas was going there, Ali was going to follow. \u201cI am troubled. We have so many problems in the world,\u201d he says, reclining a bit in his chair, generating suspense with his terrific, meaty Louisville accent, as to whether he would respond with comedy or gloomy candor. With Sly staring at him, he succinctly dispels the suspense: \u201cThese shows are so phony. Everybody\u2019s laughing. Everything is a laugh here in America. Ain\u2019t nobody serious. People hungry, war, all kind of trouble. \u201d Ali questions the complicity of black entertainers in this circus, while Sly mockingly repeats what Ali says and tells him to lighten up: \u201cWe ain\u2019t planning on going to church now. \u201d The more Sly leans toward him, the more Ali seems to lean away  \u2014   it\u2019s the physics of temperament but also of racial disposition. On this day, Ali has everyday black folks on his mind. Sly doesn\u2019t not share the same concerns, but he makes a passable case for the values of peace and love. This isn\u2019t a disagreement over philosophy but of presentation: Ali didn\u2019t want to be seen smiling if he didn\u2019t feel like it. Much of America had probably seen Ali chop it up with Howard Cosell on \u201cWide World of Sports. \u201d But tension between two black men on the subject of their own race wasn\u2019t a regular spice in the   diet. Even in 2016, it\u2019s arresting, especially with two men this outwardly different. Officially, black is a who. But with Ali, it was always a how. How do you use your blackness both for and against? How is it helping? How might it hurt? How is our own blackness being turned against us? When he left boxing after his last fight in 1981, he took the majesty of the sport with him. He took the symbolism and grim spectatorial history, too. Boxing is a   contest. But if Ali was in the ring, so was the rest of the country. After him, blackness as a point of public pride had also drifted away from American popular culture  \u2014   or rather it had been absorbed by the gradual mainstreaming of   and the proliferation of a black middle class. It found shelter in such apolitical spaces as the Huxtables\u2019 Brooklyn home and Will Smith\u2019s adopted Bel Air mansion. But in the last few years, something has changed. There\u2019s been increased political awareness of the inequality of black life and outrage over unjust black death. Technology has given megaphones to previously voiceless people. At the same time, major black artists and stars have reconnected blackness, history and politics  \u2014   from Kanye West and Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar to LeBron James, who in 2012 put the Miami Heat in hoodies for an iconic photo after Trayvon Martin\u2019s death. Even our black president has come further unfettered, not simply addressing race but almost luxuriating in his blackness. He told Howard University\u2019s most recent graduating class to embrace its black identity  \u2014   more or less, as he publicly has. Some of what\u2019s happened in this period has been rightly received as radical. These are hardly boring times we\u2019re living in. But when the country is seen through the prism of Muhammad Ali, words like \u201cradical,\u201d \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201cfame,\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d suddenly feel as if they should come with an asterisk.'"}, "time": 1742562083.3442628}
