[Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald signed an agreement with the federal government which will allow his officers to interview suspected illegal immigrants in police custody and better hand them over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, as Breitbart Texas reported.  The agreement gives Plymouth County law enforcement access to a federal database where they can check if a suspected illegal immigrant is wanted for another crime or has returned to the U. S. after being previously deported. Open border activists from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Brockton Interfaith Community are targeting the local agreement as an effort they claim strips illegal aliens of their rights, despite their immigration status. \u201cNow, literally your local police officer is going to be an ICE official,\u201d ACLU Massachusetts Attorney Laura Rotolo told the Enterprise News. \u201cWhen that happens, people become afraid to call the police. \u201d Similarly, the lead organizer for the Brockton Interfaith Community, Isabel Lopez, said the migrants being targeted \u201chaven\u2019t done anything wrong. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest concern we have, because we have mothers and families who haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d Lopez told the paper. McDonald pushed back against the accusations, saying \u201cI think it enhances public safety. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re out there enforcing immigration law,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is identifying criminal offenders who may also be here illegally. \u201d Lopez said her community group felt betrayed by McDonald because she said he promised not to sign an immigration agreement, though he denies that claim. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to talking with them and hearing what they have to say, and I\u2019m looking forward to informing them, because I think there is a lot of misinformation floating around,\u201d McDonald said. McDonald is not the only sheriff in town to take on new measures to fight off illegal immigration locally. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson also signed the same agreement with the federal government, as he has adamantly supported   Donald Trump\u2019s plan to end illegal immigration. Weeks ago, the Bristol County Sheriff voiced support for Trump\u2019s plan to build a southern border wall, as Breitbart News reported. Hodgson offered county inmates as laborers to help build the wall, saying \u201cI can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
