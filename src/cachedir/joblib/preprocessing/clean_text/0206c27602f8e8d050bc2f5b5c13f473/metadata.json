{"duration": 0.11501955986022949, "input_args": {"text": "'As someone old enough to remember the \u201cStop Pay TV!\u201d campaigns that movie theaters and affiliated parties mounted in the late 1960s  \u2014   \u201cDon\u2019t let Pay TV be the monster in your living room,\u201d blared one such ad  \u2014   I am occasionally amused that paying for televised entertainment is now pretty much a fact of life. As multidevice streaming rapidly evolves into something like the norm, the concept of   has started becoming a reality for some viewers. It\u2019s difficult to find reliable data on how many households have given up cable TV and now get all their television via a streaming   like Roku, Amazon Fire or Google Chromecast. I know two couples who have done this. One of them had a viewing party on election night last November and hoo, boy, things got interesting when a   glitch occurred around 10 p. m. Eastern time. (One thing you should make sure you have before any kind of cable   is reliable   internet, without which there\u2019s no streaming.) In any event, it appears that the situation for many consumers involves keeping cable and shuffling various streaming services. So in addition to all the other monthly bills, we are also, in this scenario, forced to keep up with individual fees for streaming services. Bundling is part of why people opt for cable in the first place, and it\u2019s becoming a feature of certain streaming services Amazon Video is one of several that lets you piggyback various other services, usually at a slightly reduced fee. \u201cWatching TV is more complicated than ever,\u201d a pitchman on a broadcast ad for TV Guide announced in the 1980s. Wherever that fellow is now, I bet he\u2019s terribly confused. With all this in mind, I\u2019ve assembled three discrete monthly streaming \u201cpackages\u201d for dedicated movie watchers to consider. It\u2019s worth remembering that almost all of the services come with   free trials. And with some notable exceptions, almost all the services offer more than just movies. PACKAGE 1: \u2018THE MAINSTREAMER\u2019 Its foundational pillars are Amazon Video ($8. 99) and Netflix ($9. 99). (For the sake of coherence, I\u2019m going to stick to monthly rates, before taxes note that Amazon\u2019s video service comes with Amazon Prime\u2019s $99 annual fee.) Hulu carries more television shows than movies, but it\u2019s not light on movies, particularly popular ones. Unless you like to watch commercials, in which case your Hulu will run $7. 99, the desirable option will be   version at $11. 99. Add HBO Now ($14. 99) Starz ($8. 99) and Showtime ($10. 99). That\u2019s $65. 94 worth of monthly streaming. (Explorers of Amazon   Prime will point out that there\u2019s a good deal of HBO programming already free through the service this doesn\u2019t include movies currently on HBO, or the most recent original programming, including     movies. This is worth considering when determining whether or not to add HBO Now.) But if you want to rent or purchase a film on demand, either a classic or something recently released in theaters, there are also movies available \u00e0 la carte, from $2. 99 to $14. 99, available on Amazon, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes and more. Let\u2019s postulate that each month you spend $2. 99, $4. 99 and $14. 99 on a single movie from one of these  \u2014   that\u2019s $22. 97. So the services and a few potentially     purchases, you\u2019re looking at $88. 91. Not exactly cheap, but were I to pitch it to you with the proviso \u201cLess Than $100 a Month,\u201d you might think, \u201cNot bad. \u201d PACKAGE 2: \u2018THE BUFF\u2019 These are   or   sites that offer cinema of a more artistic, esoteric, possibly obscure bent, and reject American cultural hegemony by, in most cases, going around the world for their fare. I\u2019d say the foundation would be FilmStruck with the Criterion Channel option at $10. 99 a month. It\u2019s $6. 99 a month without Criterion, but you\u2019ll want Criterion, for its smartly chosen array of largely foreign cinematic milestones. Warner Archive ($9. 99) is the odds and ends of a great American studio, not a very global concern but still full of enticing options. Then there\u2019s the   streaming art house Mubi ($5. 99) which has, during special promotions, offered enticing yearly subscription discounts ($34. 99 as opposed to $47. 99). Fandor, an eclectic and often exciting service with thousands of movies ranging from martial arts romps such as \u201cMaster of the Flying Guillotine\u201d to expansive, obscure French brainteasers like \u201cOut 1,\u201d is $10 a month. And the solid indie provider Sundance Now, which also offers original series, is $6. 99. That\u2019s about $44 a month. PACKAGE 3: \u2018THE FRINGE\u2019 If you like genre movies above all, or like digging for cinematic thrills in obscure but not necessarily arty corners, this might be a good option. You\u2019ll need Warner Archive ($9. 99) the blaxploitation service Brown Sugar ($3. 99) and the horror specialist Screamhouse ($4. 99) which runs scary gamuts each with its own menu subheading, including \u201cExtreme,\u201d which has the indeed highly unpleasant \u201cCannibal Ferox. \u201d Shudder, another horror service ($4. 99) recently made waves by offering the controversial Ken Russell    film \u201cThe Devils\u201d finicky horror lovers almost immediately protested on social media that it was not the uncut version. (In fairness to Shudder, the actual provenance of an uncut version of this movie is highly obscure.) Amazon\u2019s video service is rife with noir titles in various states of disrepair or restoration. A lot of genre stuff in the public domain (until a copyright owner can effectively yell \u201cFoul! \u201d) is on YouTube, which is free for the sake of argument, we\u2019ll add YouTubeRed ($9. 99) to this bill of fare. Crunchyroll has an   membership for $6. 95. And the Urban Movie Channel ($4. 99) is not as   as Brown Sugar, but it doesn\u2019t exactly lack, either, especially when it comes to   genre variants like the Southern     2009 thriller \u201cIn the Electric Mist\u201d or the   tale \u201cThe Sickle\u201d (2015). Total: a little over $45 with Amazon added as a digging option, a little under $55. All this of course can be supplemented by free services other than YouTube, like the site of DVD label Shout! Factory and Vimeo. If only there was a service that would allow one to buy leisure time, we\u2019d be all set.'"}, "time": 1742563250.6042042}
