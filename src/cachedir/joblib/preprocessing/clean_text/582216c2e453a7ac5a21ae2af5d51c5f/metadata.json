Not only are the prices low, but he will enforce a strict \u2018if you lose a finger, I\u2019ll be fucked if it\u2019s my fault\u2019 policy. \\nName brands \\nMake sure to buy cheap name brands with the fake CE quality mark. The less it looks like the really trustworthy brand\u2019s logo the better. And if your local firework merchant has the latest \u2018massive yoke and that makes a huge bang and that\u2019 from China, be sure to purchase 10 and strap them together. \\nDon\u2019t go up the North \\nThe drive up can be a hassle, there\u2019s a lad we know, who knows the lad selling them out the back of his van, you\u2019d be mad to buy them in an actual shop. \\nCut the fuse shorter to add a bit of danger into your life \\nThe fuses on fireworks and bangers are notoriously long, the wait for the bang and fizz can be agonising. Why not add the threat of a life changing injury into proceedings and reduce that fuse. \\nStill don\u2019t feel the buzz of the danger? \\nYou could always glue that firework to your hand before lighting it.'"}, "time": 1742561908.26312}
