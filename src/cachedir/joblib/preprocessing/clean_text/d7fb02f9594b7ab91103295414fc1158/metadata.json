Remember Obama used to pal around with terrorists? Well, this guy, I mean, just  \u2014   first of all, a couple of weeks ago, he talked about the maniac in Turkey, who had a plebiscite that basically ended democracy in Turkey, and he gave him a congratulatory call. Great dictating, man. Okay, then we have Putin. He loves Putin, right? That  \u2026    guy in the Philippines.   \u2026     Sisi from Egypt, he had him over at the White House, great guy, because he\u2019s a dictator. And Kim  . This is unbelievable. Kim   puts out a video at the beginning of the week, where, it\u2019s a stimulation of bombs  \u2026    coming over to the White [House].   \u2026     Then, three days later, Trump says, I\u2019d be \u2018honored\u2019 to meet him. \u201d Maher then stated, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate Kim. He wants to be him. He wants to have military parades. He wanted to have tanks in the street for his inauguration. So, my question is, does his love of dictators foreshadow him trying that sh*t here?\u201d He later added, \u201c61% of Republicans think freedom of the press is necessary, which would lead me to believe that about 4 out of 10 think it\u2019s not. \u201d Maher also reacted to Trump\u2019s campaign ad by saying, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s not an ad for a coup, I don\u2019t know what is. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563388.7777393}
