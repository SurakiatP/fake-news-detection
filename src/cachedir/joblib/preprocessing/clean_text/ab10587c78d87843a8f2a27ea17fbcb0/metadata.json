Trump\u2019s complaints that two of the three debates were scheduled to take place during pro football games, after Mr. Trump hedged about whether he would still participate. The Commission on Presidential Debates made the schedule last September after consulting with officials in both parties. The first two debates conflict with National Football League games: on Monday, Sept. 26 (Atlanta Falcons vs. New Orleans Saints) and Sunday, Oct. 9 (Giants vs. Green Bay Packers). A third presidential debate is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 19, and a   debate is set for Tuesday, Oct. 4. The commission stood by its decision, saying it \u201cselects the debate dates a year in advance in order for the television networks to have maximum lead time and predictability in scheduling these extremely important civic education forums,\u201d and added that it \u201cbelieves the dates for the 2016 debates will serve the American public well. \u201d In an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d shown on Sunday, Mr. Trump accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to minimize the audience for the debates, saying her campaign had tried to do the same for debates with Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries  \u2014   and suggested that football fans should view her skeptically. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be against the N. F. L. ,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Separately, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, expressed support on Sunday for Mr. Trump\u2019s position, despite the party having agreed to the debate schedule last fall. \u201cCertainly, we\u2019re not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesn\u2019t agree with,\u201d Mr. Priebus said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d And Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that he planned to \u201csit down with the commission in the next week or so\u201d to make sure the debates \u201chave a broad audience. \u201d But in a statement issued a short time later, the Commission on Presidential Debates said it had started planning the schedule 18 months ago and had worked to pick dates that would avoid holidays, baseball playoff games, N. F. L. games and other events that would compete for voters\u2019 attention. \u201cIt is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cA debate has never been rescheduled as a result. \u201d The Clinton campaign, when asked for a statement on Sunday, directed reporters to a tweet sent by John Podesta, the campaign chairman. \u201cThis is just more Trump debate malarkey,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote. \u201cWe will be at the debates set by the bipartisan debate commission and expect he will too. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561780.3735626}
