[In Sevnica, Slovenia, Melania Trump was born Melanija Knavs before she came to the U. S. eventually marrying future U. S. President Donald Trump. Now, Sevnica, with a population of about 5, 000 people, is enjoying its position of having a connection to one of the world\u2019s most famous women.  \u201cMelania put us on the world map,\u201d Sevnica Mayor Srecko Ocvirk told NPR in an interview. \u201cA lot of people are coming from Europe, Japan, China and the U. S.,\u201d Ocvirk said in the interview. \u201cFrom an anonymous little town, we are now on the world tourist map. \u201d Now, tourists to Sevnica can visit Melania\u2019s hometown elementary school and apartment building, and can take a   walking tour of the neighborhood in which she grew up, for just $90. The    tour is just one of many that tourists can choose from in the tiny town. Also, the Kruhek bakery in Sevnica now offers a   apple pie, known officially as the \u201cFirst Lady Apple Pie. \u201d The bakery also offers a   sweet cake. \u201cWe wanted to do something that is a mix of America and Sevnica,\u201d Maja Kozole Popadic, whose family owns the bakery, told NPR. Additionally, the Kopitarna shoe store in Sevnica has gotten in on the Melania craze, creating \u201cWhite House slippers\u201d that retail for $60 a pair. The designer of the slipper, Maja Stamol, told NPR he has made 300 pairs and is almost sold out at this point. Melania has not gone back to the region in more than a decade, though her parents reportedly still own a home in Sevnica.   John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
