Harris took aim at Rep. Raul Labrador ( ) who took a lot of heat for saying \u201cnobody dies because they don\u2019t have access to health care. \u201d \u201cLike this guy, this congressman, you might as well say, \u2018People don\u2019t starve because they don\u2019t have food.\u2019 What the f*ck is that?\u201d Harris said. Other Democrats have taken to cursing during public speeches. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told an audience in New Jersey in March that \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t give a sh*t about people. \u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( ) also dropped an \u201c \u201d in an interview with New York Magazine in April. \u201cWhich is that we\u2019re here to help people, and if we\u2019re not helping people, we should go the f*ck home,\u201d Gillibrand told New York Magazine.'"}, "time": 1742562702.5481513}
