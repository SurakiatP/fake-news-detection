Putin, articulated a possible legal strategy on Wednesday for scores of Russian athletes preparing to defend themselves in sports doping prosecutions: casting doubt on the chain of custody for their urine samples. \u201cWhen we provided the test samples, there were no complaints,\u201d Mr. Putin said, going on to describe the microscopic scratches on glass sample bottles that investigators said showed that Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service had cracked into them to switch out the athletes\u2019 incriminating urine. \u201cIf there was a problem with scratches of whatever kind, this should have been noted in the relevant reports, but there was nothing of this sort. In other words, these samples were stored somewhere, and we cannot be held responsible for the storage conditions,\u201d he said. The scores of glass bottles in question from the 2014 Sochi Olympics  \u2014   bottles thought to be   before last year\u2019s scandal  \u2014   have been stored by the International Olympic Committee in a secure lab in Switzerland for the last three years. All are being   by the committee. Its ultimate disciplinary decisions, unlikely to come before the spring, are expected to be followed by challenges in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That could push deliberation into next year and further confuse the eligibility of Russian Olympians leading to the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Mr. Putin, who has been largely dismissive of the evidence exposing an elaborate Russian doping operation, also expressed respect for the World   Agency, the global antidoping regulator, and the investigations it had commissioned into Russia\u2019s cheating. \u201cWe must pay heed to what this independent commission says, despite the shortcomings in its work,\u201d he said, referring to a team led by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that concluded in December that 1, 000 Russian athletes were involved in a   doping program. \u201cWe must pay heed to its work and its results, and to WADA\u2019s demands, because we need to acknowledge that there are established and identified cases of doping here, and this is a totally unacceptable situation,\u201d he said. Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks  \u2014   delivered in Krasnoyarsk, a city in eastern Siberia that is preparing to host the 2019 University Games  \u2014   signaled a shift after months of rejecting the basic conclusions of Mr. McLaren\u2019s inquiry. Regulators have said Russia must accept those conclusions or credibly rebut them to return to good standing in international competition. The Russian doping scandal upended global sports last year, months before the 2016 Olympics, when the nation\u2019s former antidoping lab chief, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, delivered an insider\u2019s account of Russia\u2019s   conspiracy to drug surreptitiously and dominate global standings, most notably at the Sochi Olympics, where it controlled the   lab and had an opportunity to break into the bottles overnight. Since Dr. Rodchenkov spoke out and Mr. McLaren confirmed his story, Mr. Putin and Vitaly Mutko, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, have delivered inconsistently conciliatory and defiant responses to the scandal. But with the I. O. C. having begun disciplinary proceedings for doping against 28 Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi, Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks on Wednesday addressed specific facts about the case against his nation\u2019s Olympians. Since leaving Sochi, the doping samples in question have been stored by the I. O. C. in a secure lab in Switzerland. And the University of Lausanne is collaborating with the committee in developing a methodology to scrutinize doping samples, according to Dr. Richard Budgett, the medical and scientific director of the I. O. C. \u201cIt has to be recorded extremely carefully. That\u2019s why it\u2019s taking a couple months,\u201d Dr. Budgett said. While Mr. Putin referred to other shortcomings in the array of evidence assembled  \u2014   including what he described as \u201cinaccurate translations or inadequate evidence\u201d presented by Mr. McLaren to international sports officials  \u2014   his overall message on Wednesday was a broad acknowledgment of institutional failures. \u201cOur existing antidoping monitoring system has not worked effectively, and this is our fault, and is something we need to admit and address directly,\u201d Mr. Putin said. In December, top Russian sports officials acknowledged to The New York Times that \u201can institutional conspiracy\u201d had implicated multiple employees of the government\u2019s sports ministry. They insisted, however  \u2014   as Mr. Putin repeated on Wednesday  \u2014   that the schemes had not been supported by the state, which many officials defined as Mr. Putin and a few of his top associates. Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks came one day after United States lawmakers called a congressional hearing, expressing outrage at Russia\u2019s cheating and what they called global sports officials\u2019 insufficient response to the scandal. \u201cExactly how far and who was involved  \u2014   we don\u2019t yet know,\u201d Dr. Budgett, who testified at the hearing, said afterward. He acknowledged that Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service had played a part and that Russia\u2019s deputy sports minister had been dismissed for his involvement. \u201cThat\u2019s what the commission is doing, getting to the bottom of who was involved within the Russian state and the Russian system. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564384.3286316}
