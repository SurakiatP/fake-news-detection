Ryan had chosen to remain largely silent, hoping that his party\u2019s nominee for president would simply get across the finish line, dragging congressional Republicans across with him. But a 2005 recording made public on Friday of Donald J. Trump speaking in extraordinarily vulgar terms about women became a new bridge too far across a seemingly endless landmass separating civil behavior and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency. Mr. Ryan responded by uninviting Mr. Trump from a rally in his home state, Wisconsin, on Saturday, and said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. But even as many congressional Republicans, including some very conservative House members, pulled away from Mr. Trump on Saturday, Mr. Ryan did not go so far as to withdraw his support for the businessman and former reality TV star. Mr. Ryan\u2019s decision keeps him in the political purgatory of endorsing the Republican nominee for president while continually having to say why he finds his remarks and policy positions despicable. Looking tired and touting the virtues of congressional legislative processes, Mr. Ryan addressed a crowd of supporters on Saturday in Elkhorn, Wis. Some Trump supporters could be heard screaming the candidate\u2019s name in the background. \u201cIt is a troubling situation,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, alluding to the situation with Mr. Trump. \u201cThat is not what we are here to talk about today. Do you know what we do here at Fall Fest? We talk about ideas. \u201d The developments come as Republicans are trying desperately in the final weeks of a campaign season to maintain their control of the Senate and a firm majority in the House. Many are weighing, based on the particulars of their own states and districts and race dynamics, whether now is the moment to move away from Mr. Trump. In many cases, they are looking to Mr. Ryan to be their seer. Mr. Ryan\u2019s tepid backing of Mr. Trump has been less about fear of alienating Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters  \u2014   many Republicans in Congress need his base of white, high   men to win    \u2014   than about worry of signaling to the thousands of Republicans who are ambivalent about Mr. Trump that they need not vote this year. Should those Republicans stay home, they could potentially set off a chain reaction down the ballot. A huge turnout collapse would deeply threaten Senate Republican incumbents and plenty of House members, too. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lewd comments are the latest in a series of remarks he has made ranging from inappropriate to reprehensible that demonstrate why he is unsuitable for the presidency,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cIt was comments like these  \u2014   including the statements he made about John McCain, a disabled reporter, the family of a fallen soldier and more  \u2014   that caused me to decide this summer that I could not support his candidacy,\u201d said Ms. Collins, who is not up for  . If Mr. Ryan were thinking of withdrawing his support from Mr. Trump, as of Saturday, he still had only sent the nominee back to his room to think about his remarks. \u201cI hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. As the most senior elected Republican  \u2014   and the party leader who most publicly agonized over his endorsement of Mr. Trump  \u2014   Mr. Ryan has for much of this year held outsize importance as the role model for how Republicans should deal with Mr. Trump. His reluctant endorsement was pushed by his    but it also beckoned to others to join the \u201cTrump Train. \u201d Now, once again, the speaker\u2019s actions are under intense scrutiny. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a statement even before Mr. Ryan uttered a (prepared) word: \u201cThere have been more than enough \u2018final straw\u2019 moments during this campaign, and Speaker Ryan has continued to unabashedly put party first in supporting the most repulsive candidate for president that our country has ever seen,\u201d Kelly Ward, the group\u2019s executive director, said. \u201cIf Speaker Ryan steps away from Trump, it will be an act of political expedience and desperate   which won\u2019t redeem him or House Republicans in the eyes of voters. \u201d For scores of elected Republicans, Mr. Trump\u2019s  clash with parents who lost a son in combat in Iraq, his call to ban all Muslims from entering the country, his disparagement of a federal judge, his   of nearly $1 billion from his taxes and his derision of a former Miss Universe for gaining weight were not enough to force their hands. But for a growing handful of members of Congress, \u201chot mike\u201d remarks aimed broadly at more than half the electorate were the final blow. \u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, told a local television station Friday night. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine. \u201d But many more continued to ride the line between appalled and resigned. \u201cAs the father of three daughters,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, \u201cI strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape. \u201d Democrats mocked the \u201ctemplate\u201d of that \u201cfather of daughters\u201d construction, pointing to nearly a dozen elected Republicans who used it. For candidates in swing states, the pressure points have become more intense. This is particularly true in the case of Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, who is in what many believe to be the tightest   race in the country. Ms. Ayotte, who has awkwardly bounced between distance from and acceptance of Mr. Trump, found herself in scalding hot water last week by suggesting during a debate with her opponent that Mr. Trump was a role model. \u201cIt is beyond comprehension how Senator Ayotte could continue to support this man for the highest office in the land, let alone call him a role model,\u201d said Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Ms. Ayotte for her seat. On Saturday morning, Ms. Ayotte completed her move away from Mr. Trump by saying she would not vote for him. She was followed by Representative Joe Heck, who is running for an open Senate seat in Nevada. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, last seen in photos looking mildly humiliated as he did phone bank work on behalf of Mr. Trump  \u2014   a former rival who once put Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife in his Twitter cross hairs  \u2014   said on Twitter: \u201cThese comments are disturbing and inappropriate, there is simply no excuse for them. \u201d Mr. Ryan, who many believe wants to run for president himself, has not been actively urging his colleagues to vote for Mr. Trump, and has instead repeatedly talked about the House Republican policy agenda, clinging to a small pamphlet of policy ideas like a talisman in the storm, hoping his image survives.'"}, "time": 1742563524.993316}
