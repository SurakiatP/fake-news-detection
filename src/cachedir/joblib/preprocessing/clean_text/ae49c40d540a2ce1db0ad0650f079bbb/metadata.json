The card featured a reproduction of Mr. Bleckner\u2019s \u201cSea and Mirror,\u201d a work from 1996, when the artist was at the height of his popularity. So began Mr. Baldwin\u2019s love affair with the painting  \u2014   an infatuation that has ended with Mr. Baldwin, who occupies a central role in New York\u2019s cultural life, now pitted in a bitter dispute with two formidable players in the city\u2019s rarefied world of art and money  \u2014   Ms. Boone, a prominent art dealer, and Mr. Bleckner, one of her notable talents. This has, to say the least, become awkward. For years, Mr. Baldwin said he carried the image of \u201cSea and Mirror\u201d in his shoulder bag, alongside a picture of one of his daughters and his father. In 2010, he asked Ms. Boone to find the collector who owned it and pry it away. \u201cThere was a kind of beauty and simplicity\u201d to the work, Mr. Baldwin recalled in an interview this month. Happily, she reported back, the collector would sell  \u2014   but at a premium. Mr. Baldwin put up the $190, 000. \u201cI love this thing so much,\u201d he said in a 2012 speech about support for the arts at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, proudly recounting his quest. \u201cThree months later it was hanging in my house, in my apartment in New York. \u201d But Mr. Baldwin said that something about the painting always gave him unease. The colors weren\u2019t quite the same. It smelled, somehow, new. In fact, he said, just a few months ago he discovered that he had not bought the painting he pined for. Instead, he said, for reasons that remain disputed, Ms. Boone sent him another version of the painting. He claims she passed it off as the original. \u201cI thought she had made my dream come true,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said. Instead, he said he believed that Ms. Boone, frustrated that the collector would not agree to sell, persuaded Mr. Bleckner to take an unfinished work from the same series, finish painting it and sell it to him without saying a word. Mr. Bleckner\u2019s office said he could not be reached for comment. Ms. Boone, through her lawyer, disputed Mr. Baldwin\u2019s account, asserting he was never misled about the identity of the work. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong that the painting is a copy it\u2019s an original and very fine work of art by Ross Bleckner,\u201d Ms. Boone\u2019s lawyer, Ted Poretz, said in a statement. Mr. Baldwin, however, has emails that buttress parts of his account. The Boone gallery also stamped a number  \u2014   7449  \u2014   on the back of the painting it sold to Mr. Baldwin, the same number it had listed next to the work it had said it was pursuing from the collector. Mr. Baldwin said he met with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office this summer but was told that a criminal case could not be made. Ms. Boone\u2019s lawyer declined to address in full the issues raised by the emails or the number next to the painting. \u201cThe gallery never likes to have unhappy clients,\u201d Mr. Poretz said in his statement, \u201cand it has turned cartwheels to try to satisfy Alec Baldwin. It has repeatedly offered Alec Baldwin a full refund, among other things. \u201d The interaction is hardly the first to end badly in an opaque, largely unregulated art market. It raises questions about why works created in one era by an artist, operating under one set of motivations, are sometimes different in value and reputation, compared with works that were perhaps created by the same artist in another era. But to Mr. Baldwin, the concerns are not nearly so esoteric: He contends he was betrayed. \u201cRoss was a kind of friend of mine,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said. He continues to be a Bleckner supporter. Mr. Baldwin\u2019s foundation helped to underwrite an exhibition this month on Long Island that featured Mr. Bleckner\u2019s paintings. He owns five of Mr. Bleckner\u2019s works. Mr. Baldwin said that the flamboyant, outspoken Ms. Boone, from whom he sometimes bought art, admitted this year that she had switched the works. \u201cShe said, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you,\u2019\u201d he said. Mr. Baldwin, who met Mr. Bleckner at parties in the Hamptons, where the actor owns a home, became an admirer of his work in the 1990s. Mr. Bleckner, who had a Guggenheim retrospective in 1995 at 45, had been an ascendant art star of the 1980s. He belonged to a stable of young artists who helped Ms. Boone build her reputation in the \u201980s, though two of her stars from that time, Eric Fischl and David Salle, have since left for rival dealers. Mr. Baldwin bought his first Bleckner from Ms. Boone in 2010, and during that transaction mentioned that he really wanted \u201cSea and Mirror. \u201d The painting had sold at auction at Sotheby\u2019s in 2007 for $121, 000. Ms. Boone told Mr. Baldwin in an email that the collector now sought $175, 000 for it. \u201cThe Gallery normally charges ten to twenty percent for this kind of transaction,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo make this a friendly deal, we would charge you even less  \u2014   $190, 000,\u201d before adding, \u201cI know Ross is so thrilled for you to have a painting and so am I. \u201d Mr. Poretz said that shortly afterward Mr. Baldwin was told that, in fact, he was getting a different version of \u201cSea and Mirror. \u201d \u201cBy the time Alec Baldwin paid for the painting and it was delivered to him, he should not have misunderstood what he purchased,\u201d Mr. Poretz said in his statement. Mr. Baldwin denies he was ever told he would be receiving a different work. He said that when he received the canvas, he noticed the composition lacked a feathery quality in the brush strokes he had admired in the photos of the work sold at Sotheby\u2019s, and seemed brighter. Ms. Boone told him, he said, that it had been newly cleaned as a courtesy. This year, his suspicions growing, he sent emails to Mr. Bleckner and Ms. Boone inquiring about the collector from whom he had bought the painting and about the cleaning. According to copies of the emails, Mr. Bleckner responded that he did not know the name of the collector. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bleckner did not point out that that transaction had never gone through. Mr. Bleckner also discussed how he might have done the cleaning. \u201cI would usually do that,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Baldwin, \u201calthough I don\u2019t actually remember. \u201d Mr. Baldwin finally had a Sotheby\u2019s expert compare his painting to a catalog image from the 2007 auction. The expert said, \u201cThis is not that painting,\u201d Mr. Baldwin recalled. He then confronted Ms. Boone and Mr. Bleckner. He said they acknowledged having given him another work. Mr. Baldwin has an email in which Mr. Bleckner is deeply apologetic but does not directly address about what. \u201cim so sorry about all of this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI feel so bad about this   \u2026     what can I do to make this up to you?\u201d He said Mr. Bleckner told him that he had started the painting in 1996 and finished it in 2010, though he had dated it 1996. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Ross knew,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said. \u201cRoss may have been instructed to make a copy. I don\u2019t know. \u201d This summer, as Mr. Baldwin complained to Ms. Boone, he gave her an ultimatum. \u201cDeliver to me the painting that I bought. The one you sold me,\u201d he wrote in an email. Ms. Boone again asked Sotheby\u2019s to contact the owner of the painting sold at auction in 2007, according to an email supplied by Mr. Baldwin. The collector, whose identity remains a mystery, was still not interested in selling. Ms. Boone\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Poretz, also contacted Mr. Baldwin to try to settle the matter. In an interview, Mr. Baldwin acknowledged that the work he has was created by Mr. Bleckner and that it looks quite similar to the painting he coveted. But he said it was not the work he had fallen in love with  \u2014   not a painting, in his view, created when the artist was at the peak of his fame. Still, he told Ms. Boone in a recent email, he did not want to hurt Mr. Bleckner. \u201cI\u2019m less worried about you, Mary,\u201d he wrote, \u201cas you are more of an armadillo and I\u2019m sure you have been blasting your way out of corners like this on more than one occasion. \u201d Ms. Boone wrote back to say that she was working to get him the work he wanted. \u201cI am not an Armadillo however,\u201d she added.'"}, "time": 1742628596.1683433}
