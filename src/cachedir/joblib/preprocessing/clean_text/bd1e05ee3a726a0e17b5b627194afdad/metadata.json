But neither has he distanced himself from them, with the exception of David Duke , the former Klansman who is running for Senate and whom Mr. Trump disavowed after some initial wavering last winter.

[White nationalists]are now beginning to grapple with how to best harness the energy that his campaign has stirred up.

The aim is to take stock of the presidential campaign \u2014 \u201cwhen our ideas began invading the mainstream\u201d \u2014 and figure out what\u2019s next. In addition to Mr. Spencer, the speakers will include Peter Brimelow, the founder of Vdare.com , an anti-immigration website named for Virginia Dare, the first white baby born in the English colonies. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s Extremist Supporters Feel Like Winners Either Way, By Jonathan Mahler And Julie Turkewitz, The New York Times, November 6, 2016 \\nThat\u2019s better than the way they frequently get it wrong, when they say she was the first white child born in America, but the way we put it is this: \u201cthe first English child to be born in the New World. \u201d That, by the way, is the way a lot of historians put it. \\nHowever, a pre-multicultural poem by Rosemary and Stephen Vincent Benet put it better: \\nPeregrine White \\nWere the first real Americans \\nAnywhere.'"}, "time": 1742562980.925936}
