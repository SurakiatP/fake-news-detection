No politician \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 had ever said anything like that to these executives.\" \\nLest you think Moore has \\'lost his mind\\' and gone over to \\'the dark side,\\' think again. \\nHe mocked Donald Trump Jr. and the \u201cright wing\u201d on Twitter on Wednesday for misconstruing his comments in \u201cTrumpLand\u201d: Hey everyone - Trump, Jr. & right wing thinks my movie called \"TrumpLand\" is pro-Trump! Haha. Pls don\\'t tell them otherwise! #satire #irony pic.twitter.com/difR93uzTg \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 26, 2016 \\nMeanwhile, Hannity continues to sing Moore\\'s praises. Strange bedfellows indeed. Even if one of them is being played. '"}, "time": 1742562604.587992}
