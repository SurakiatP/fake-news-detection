Tom Cotton ( ) commented on a report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice for President Barack Obama was behind the unmasking of the identities of members of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team.  Cotton noted Rice\u2019s involvement in this story and her involvement in what he suggested were other Obama administration foreign policy missteps and likened her to \u201cTyphoid Mary. \u201d \u201cSusan Rice is the Typhoid Mary of the Obama administration foreign policy,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cEvery time something went wrong, she seemed to turn up in the middle of it, whether it was these allegations of improper unmasking, intentional or improper surveillance, whether it\u2019s Benghazi or the other fiascos over the eight years of the Obama administration. \u201d \u201cIf Eli Lake\u2019s reporting is correct, it is hard to square what Susan Rice said in that PBS interview,\u201d he added.
