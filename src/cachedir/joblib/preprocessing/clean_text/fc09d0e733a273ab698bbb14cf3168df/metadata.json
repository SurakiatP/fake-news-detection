Remember Newt Gingrich\u2019s wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media [...] Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce. \\nSo maybe, just maybe, if all of that baggage is on your shoulders, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be the surrogate out there wagging your finger and accusing the woman who was reporting on sexual assault. \\nLet me explain it slowly \u2014 sexual assault and sex are two things. One is unwanted. One is wanted. So maybe they need to understand that to begin with.\u201d \\nNavarro told uber-Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes that Gingrich shouldn't be used by the campaign in any capacity, given his past.
