{"duration": 0.05017995834350586, "input_args": {"text": "'Hey everybody! We  \u2014   Wesley and Jenna  \u2014   are introducing a new podcast today. It\u2019s called Still Processing, and it\u2019s a show about our promiscuous definition of \u201cculture. \u201d We\u2019re both writers at The New York Times, with very different focuses. Jenna is obsessed with Beyonc\u00e9, the evolution of the digital world and all things time travel. Wesley likes to think about the relationship among art, news and life in popular culture. The overlap of that Venn diagram is pretty much our show. We\u2019ll be talking about the TV we\u2019re watching, the movies we saw, the music we\u2019ve heard, the books we\u2019re reading tech etiquette, like how to slide into DMs and whether you should (quick answer: If you have to ask, as Wesley did, then no). We\u2019ll get into the purpose  \u2014   the real purpose  \u2014   of Snapchat, the legacy of stars like Gene Wilder, the actual point of DJ Khaled (is there one?) and whether there ever was such a thing as good hair. But when tragedy strikes and the country threatens to go dark, we\u2019re going to shine a light there, too. Anytime something like the Orlando shooting happens or Trump and Clinton start tussling about who\u2019s a better friend to black voters, we\u2019re going to talk about it. In our first episode  \u2014   out today (!)  \u2014   we discuss the flaps around Colin Kaepernick and Leslie Jones and unpack the repercussions of public patriotism and dissent. And because the two of us have a budding office romance, we decided to invite Tika Sumpter, who plays Michelle Obama in \u201cSouthside With You,\u201d the romantic drama about Michelle and Barack\u2019s first date, to talk about her worst first date. One thing we should note about our dip into the podcasting pool: We like the studio, but we love the world outside of it. We\u2019re taking field trips to museums and restaurants and people\u2019s houses. We\u2019ll also invite on guests: the colleagues we admire at The New York Times, filmmakers, artists, writers, scientists, and regular people in our daily lives, like Jenna\u2019s energy healer (no joke). We\u2019ll debut new episodes of Still Processing on Thursdays, on all the usual places you find podcasts, including iTunes, Google Play Music, Stitcher and The New York Times itself. One more thing: We want to hear from you! You can find us on Twitter (@jennydeluxe @wesley_morris). We also set up a hotline for comments and questions at    but just know that if you leave us a voice mail message, we might have to play it on the show.
