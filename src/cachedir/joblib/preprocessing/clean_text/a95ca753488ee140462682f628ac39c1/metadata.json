Franklin Graham says that it was the \u201chand of God,\u201d rather than Russian hackers, that determined the outcome of November\u2019s presidential election. [\u201cI think maybe God has allowed Donald Trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges,\u201d he said.  The son of renowned Baptist minister Billy Graham, the Rev. Franklin Graham has been invited by   Trump to be one of six clergy to offer the invocation, benediction, and several readings at his   ceremony on January 20. In an interview with Religion News Service Thursday, Graham said that beyond mere human factors, the mysterious hand of divine providence was at work in the elections. \u201cAll I know is Donald Trump was supposed to lose the election\u201d according to all the polls, Graham said. \u201cFor these states to go the way they did, in my opinion, I think it was the hand of God,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hacking. It wasn\u2019t   or whatever. It was God, in my opinion, and I believe his hand was at work, and I think he\u2019s given Christians an opportunity. \u201d While never officially endorsing Trump, Rev. Graham has been a sharp critic of the Obama administration and a vocal opponent of Hillary Clinton, especially for her uncompromising support of   . Shortly before Election Day, Graham declared that the best choice for president \u201cisn\u2019t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian,\u201d in evident reference to Republican candidate Donald Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s two different pictures and two different visions for America,\u201d Graham said in early November. \u201cThe Democratic Party has a vision, Hillary Clinton has a vision, Donald Trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the Republican Party. This isn\u2019t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian. \u201d The evangelist acknowledged that for many, voting for Trump might not have been easy, but he insisted that it was, nonetheless, the better choice and that Trump was a \u201cchanged man. \u201d \u201cYou may have to hold your nose and vote,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI have people that say, \u2018Well I don\u2019t like Donald Trump, I don\u2019t like what he says.\u2019 Well I don\u2019t like what he said either, I promise I don\u2019t like it. But those are things that he said 11 years ago, not something that he said today. \u201d \u201cI think Donald Trump has changed,\u201d Graham added. \u201cI think God is working on his heart and in his life. But people have to make up their own mind. \u201d In a Facebook post some weeks earlier, Graham had stated that \u201cthe difference between the candidates is night and day. \u201d \u201cSome candidates have entire political ads talking about how they spent their career fighting for the rights of children,\u201d he said. \u201cYet they spent their entire career fighting against the rights of unborn children!\u201d Graham said Hillary Clinton\u2019s progressive agenda was \u201cgodless\u201d and could not be defended. Following WikiLeaks revelations, the preacher denounced the \u201cdepth of corruption\u201d in Washington politics, calling for its eradication. \u201cWikiLeaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Graham wrote, calling it \u201ca swamp that needs to be drained. \u201d \u201cOur political system is broken, and it will take strong, tough leadership to begin fixing some of this,\u201d Graham said. Regarding the inauguration ceremony, Graham says he still has not decided which Scripture passage to read. \u201cI\u2019m taking time just to pray and ask God to give me wisdom and guidance because it\u2019s a responsibility that I take very seriously,\u201d he said.
