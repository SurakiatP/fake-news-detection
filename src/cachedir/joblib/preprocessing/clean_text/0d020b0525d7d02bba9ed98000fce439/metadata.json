Proving just that is the bad news Barack Obama just got after the FBI exposed the damning thing he quietly did to Hillary Clinton \u2013 and it means trouble for everyone involved. \\nAs many Americans were made aware on Friday, the FBI has reopened the investigation into Hillary\u2019s email scandal. However, a few theories circling the web indicate that the recent turn of events points to something much darker. \\nIn fact, as Internet sleuths have more time to dig around the deepest corners of the web, it seems as though FBI Director James Comey\u2019s hand may have actually been forced when it comes to the investigation. Seeing how both Wikileaks and famed hacker Kim Dotcom have Hillary\u2019s 33,000 emails and are intent on releasing them in the upcoming week, the FBI was forced to make a move \u2013 but things only get more interesting the further down the rabbit hole we go. \\nAt this point, the media is taking Wikileaks very seriously, and considering who could be implicated in the leak, something had to be done. In short, the theory suggests that several high-ranking officials up to and including Barack Obama are actually involved in Hillary\u2019s little scandal.

In fact, it seems that Obama may actually be responsible for the FBI pressing forward on the investigation. \\nWith the theory picked up by Rush Limbaugh , a recent caller expounded on the belief a bit more, saying that Obama was facing a time crunch. In essence, knowing he would be implicated if the full email leak was made public, it would show his complicity in Hillary\u2019s illegal behavior, meaning that he has a pretty serious bullet to dodge.

As more came out, Obama realized the only thing he could do to save his own skin would be to have Comey come forward and say that they \u201cmiraculously\u201d found new emails pertinent to the investigation. \\nIn order to do this, Obama and the other Democrats involved must have made a joint decision to throw Hillary under the bus. When all is said and done, America will be so focused \u2013 with many extremely pleased \u2013 that no one will even think twice about what\u2019s in the rest of those emails.

Those emails are going to come out either way. Although Obama would like to divert your attention elsewhere, justice should come to all of those who break the law.

We all know that there is no loyalty in politics unless it directly benefits the person giving it. \\nBarack Obama was endorsing Hillary Clinton, but it only stands to reason that the moment he was threatened, he\u2019d throw her under the bus in the name of self-preservation. The jig is up and the Democratic party is going down. Let\u2019s just hope the FBI decides to sink those final nails in Hillary\u2019s coffin before the election and announce official charges against her. We the people are fed up, and just as Hillary once said, \u201cNo one is too big to jail.\u201d Those words are coming back to bite her in the end.'"}, "time": 1742563586.197682}
