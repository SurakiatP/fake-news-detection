Neither was my interview with the former congressman, mayoral candidate and apparent sexting recidivist, which appears in this weekend\u2019s Talk feature of the magazine. I spoke to Weiner for about 90 minutes on the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last month. Because of the early deadlines and long lead times of our print edition, almost three weeks elapsed between our discussion and publication  \u2014   during which The New York Post reported (last weekend) that Weiner seemed to be engaging in more of the kinds of online dalliances that ended his career in Congress in 2011 and blew up his campaign to become mayor of New York in 2013. This time, according to The Post, Weiner was apparently flirting with a college student posing as a female named \u201cNikki. \u201d (Weiner reportedly boasted to Nikki that he was \u201cdeceptively strong . . . like a mongoose. \u201d) When I asked Weiner in Philadelphia whether he was still engaging in the activities that got him in trouble, he waved me off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that,\u201d he said. (He demurred again when I contacted him this week following the Post report.) O. K. fine. But Weiner was eager to engage on all manner of other matters. What follows is a bonus rendering of our encounter. We convened in the lobby bar of the Logan Hotel a few hours before Hillary Clinton would be giving her acceptance speech to the convention that night. Weiner had recently been in a heavy exposure phase, in a more traditional sense. He had appeared that week as a guest on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d and \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher. \u2019\u2019 He was also engaging in spirited political arguments across many platforms. \u201cI get pleasure  \u2014   I don\u2019t think it\u2019s perverse pleasure, but good, honest, wholesome pleasure  \u2014   by infuriating these Trump trolls,\u201d Weiner told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a hornet\u2019s nest I don\u2019t mind kicking at all. \u201d Weiner was in the news a day earlier: Donald Trump had called Clinton a security risk, citing among other things her close relationship with Weiner\u2019s wife, Huma Abedin, a top adviser. Abedin, Trump said, is \u201cmarried to Anthony Weiner, who\u2019s a sleazeball and pervert. . . . I don\u2019t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets. \u201d I asked Weiner what it has been like to have Huma dragged into these   . \u201c\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a staffer targeted like that. I don\u2019t engage on that at all. \u201d After about 20 minutes in the hotel bar, Weiner was summoned by an aide, and we boarded a van that would shuttle us to the Wells Fargo Arena. We pulled out of the hotel driveway and promptly plowed into a parked limousine  \u2014   with a loud crunching sound. No one was injured, though Weiner\u2019s volunteer driver for the D. N. C. a local college student named Tim, was clearly shaken and upset. Weiner, who had been talking to his    son, Jordan, over a speakerphone, jumped out of the van to direct traffic around the mishap. He evinced the   demeanor of a man who was accustomed to handling things, someone very much in his element amid chaos. Weiner comforted both drivers and oversaw the exchange of insurance information. At one point, he instructed Tim to back up the van, which nearly resulted in a second collision, this time with a police car. \u201cNow, Tim, if you would have gone into reverse, and hit that guy, which you almost did, that would be a legitimate lifelong   story,\u201d Weiner told Tim as the nervous volunteer maneuvered the     van toward the arena. One subject I was interested in discussing with Weiner was \u201cWeiner,\u201d the critically lauded documentary about his disastrous mayoral campaign. Weiner\u2019s campaign melted down following reports of countless instances of the candidate\u2019s tweeting dirty pictures of himself  \u2014   the fallout from which was captured by the filmmakers in excruciating    detail. Weiner said neither he nor his wife had seen the film and had no plans to. When he agreed to participate, he obviously envisioned a movie that would have a much happier ending, ideally starring Mayor Weiner and First Lady Huma. And his comeback triumph would be immortalized on screens much bigger than the   ones that brought him down. For what it\u2019s worth, Weiner\u2019s   made for a much better movie, at least for viewers. But I was still curious: Why, after the scandal broke, given the personal and embarrassing nature of it, didn\u2019t Weiner just stop allowing access to the \u201cWeiner\u201d cameras? Weiner mentioned that one of the filmmakers, Josh Kriegman, was a friend and former aide, and he felt a degree of loyalty to him. \u201cI generally wasn\u2019t going to pull the plug,\u201d he said. I asked Weiner whether his wife got a vote on this. \u201cUm, so here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cI haven\u2019t told  \u2014   I haven\u2019t gone here yet with anybody. So, they violated the agreement not to use her. \u201d The filmmakers had told Weiner that they would not include Abedin in the film without her permission, he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a release,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe had to grant permission, which she didn\u2019t. \u201d Kriegman is traveling on vacation and could not be reached. Lisa Califf, spokeswoman and counsel for the film, disputed that any agreement had been breached. \u201cAs is clear in the film, the filmmakers had consent from everyone who appears in the film, including Anthony and Huma,\u201d said Califf via email. Weiner said Kriegman had assured him verbally and in emails that he would not use Abedin in the film without her consent. Both Weiner and Abedin were infuriated when they learned the film would go forward, and prominently feature    footage of Abedin. (In a   phone conversation, Califf said she could not discuss details relating to any discussions that took place between Kriegman and Weiner.) I asked Weiner if he had any plans to sue the filmmakers. \u201cI mean, who knows what happens in the future,\u201d he said. Is Kriegman still his friend? \u201cLook, I like him,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cI just think this was a venal thing by someone who\u2019s not venal. I mean, maybe I\u2019ll get over it, maybe I won\u2019t. \u201d Weiner said he and Abedin are rarely in the same place these days. She is off traveling with Clinton much of the time, and he is spending the bulk of his in New York, often taking care of Jordan. He said he had been back to Washington only twice since leaving Congress five years ago. He does not miss it, but allowed that there\u2019s a good chance his wife could wind up back in D. C. if Clinton wins. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figured that out yet,\u201d Weiner said of his plans for after the election. \u201cI mean, talking to Huma about it is like talking to a pitcher in the sixth inning while he\u2019s pitching a  . You don\u2019t want to jinx anything. \u201d As Weiner\u2019s dented van wound through traffic and security checkpoints, we pulled up to a side entrance of the Wells Fargo arena as scores of dignitaries were arriving. Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic whip, emerged from the S. U. V. in front of ours. Weiner approached his former colleague to say hello. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Anthony Weiner,\u201d he said, extending his hand. \u201cI used to be somebody. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562046.3856678}
