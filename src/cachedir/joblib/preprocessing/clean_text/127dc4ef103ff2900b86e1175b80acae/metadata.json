Collections have been shown, after all, on the Great Wall of China, on a   anniversary and in Blenheim Palace in England. Yet Thursday evening in Rome, Fendi managed to add to the canon. How? By having models walk on water, of course. The setting was the Trevi Fountain at sunset, and the occasion was the brand\u2019s 90th anniversary and its second haute fourrure show. Four years ago, Pietro Beccari, then newly appointed chief executive, decided it was in the brand\u2019s best interest to associate itself more intimately with the city of its birth. He added \u201cRoma\u201d to the logo and began a project to sponsor the restoration of the city\u2019s fountains, starting with the one where Anita Ekberg once romped for \u201cLa Dolce Vita. \u201d The Trevi initiative was completed in the fall, and 2. 6 million euros, or $2. 9 million, later, it was payback time. Still, Mr. Beccari said just before the show, \u201cit was a miracle it happened at all. \u201d Politics, after all, waits for no fashion season, and this is a time of uncertainty in Italy. Since Fendi\u2019s original offer to help Rome, the city has had no fewer than four leaders, the most recent  \u2014   from the   Five Star Movement  \u2014   elected just weeks before the show. \u201cWe got the final   at 1 p. m. the afternoon before,\u201d Mr. Beccari revealed in a dinner toast after the event. But that didn\u2019t stop the brand from emptying the fountain, building a glass catwalk almost 200 feet long, and filling it up again  \u2014   or persuading the 97 merchants in its immediate vicinity to close early for the day. It was a good thing, because, in a rare example of contextual alchemy, the conjunction of site and subject gave proof positive of the show\u2019s title, \u201cLegends and Fairy Tales. \u201d As water poured from under Oceanus\u2019s feet, spilling over stone sea horses and Tritons, the first of 46 looks appeared: a   astrakhan princess coat with jeweled embroidery. It was just the start of an   visual discourse on the art of the possible, which ranged from   crocheted mohair gowns inset with fur roses or traced with leather castles and creatures inspired by the early   Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen, to evening capes and coats with whole narratives in their wefts. Even for Fendi, a brand that made its name by demonstrating the multitudinous forms of fur, the clothes were astonishing. \u201cFive or 10 years ago, this could not have been done,\u201d Karl Lagerfeld said before the show. Whether a woman would want to spend enormous amounts of money to wear a fable on her back was almost besides the point (and as for the dresses, the answer is a straightforward \u201cyes\u201d): More relevant was the fact they could be so written. Also, the question of, if Fendi did this for its 90th anniversary, what would it do for 100? \u201cWait and see!\u201d Mr. Beccari said. Beyond the legendary, after all, comes the epic.'"}, "time": 1742628582.1852767}
