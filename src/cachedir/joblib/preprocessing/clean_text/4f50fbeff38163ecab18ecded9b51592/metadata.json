The latest to step forward is an Alaska lawyer who is accusing conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of groping her at a dinner party in 1999. \\n\u201cHe groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit \u2018right next to him. He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him\u201d says Moira Smith, describing how Justice Thomas groped her buttocks at a public event. \\nSmith was 23 at the time and is now a vice president at counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co. Justice Thomas was previously accused of sexually harassing his employee, Anita Hill, in a widely controversial case that ended with the confirmation of Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice and a vicious character assassination campaign against Hill. Hill\u2019s shocking testimony described how : \\nIn lurid detail, she described Thomas as a boss who pestered her for dates and spoke graphically about pornography, bestiality, rape and his skills as a lover. \u201cHe talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts,\u201d she testified. The \u201coddest episode,\u201d Hill said, occurred when he was drinking a Coke in his EEOC office. \u201cHe got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, \u2018Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?\u201d\u2018 \\nThe National Law Journal spoke to three of Smith\u2019s housemates , who all confirm that Smith told them about Thomas\u2019 behavior at the time of the event. Thomas has denied the allegations. \\nSexual assault and the improper behavior of powerful men towards vulnerable employees has dominated this election cycle, beginning first with the wave of allegations against FOX News CEO Roger Ailes by multiple employees and then the accounts of some dozen women recounting the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of Donald Trump. \\nThe prominence of the issue has created a space for women to come forward and tell their tales w ith some degree of confiden ce that they will be heard and taken seriously, bravely risking the backlash of misogynistic victim-blaming that has long defined the American response to a woman\u2019s accusation. \\nFrom the military to scientific acedemia to nursing homes , men abuse women and other men at a horrifying rate. It\u2019s far past time we began giving women the benefit of the doubt and send a message to the predators of America that this appalling behavior will no longer be tolerated. For his part, Justice Clarence Thomas has been nothing but an obstacle to progress, mired in backwards conservatism and following the cues of now-deceased religious extremist Antonin Scalia to a tee. Perhaps Scalia shouldn\u2019t be the only seat we replace once Hillary Clinton takes office.'"}, "time": 1742561914.785496}
