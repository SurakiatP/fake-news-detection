[The \u201cHouse Freedom Caucus members held the line, and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted,\u201d he wrote in a report, titled \u201cAnalytics shows HFC saved GOP on Health Care. \u201d  On Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert predicted any approval of Ryan\u2019s healthcare overhaul would wreck the GOP\u2019s House majority in 2018. \u201cThis bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority   \u2026     [and] If we pass a bill that doesn\u2019t bring down premiums and give the American people hope, and not give more power to the government   \u2026     then we will deserve to be voted out,\u201d he said in a speech on the House floor, according to TheHill.   \u201cWhile full repeal and replace of Obamacare has overwhelming support in these districts, even keeping Obamacare intact was more popular than the AHCA, often by more than a    margin,\u201d said Wilson, who managed Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s voter analysis and tracking efforts in 2016.   The same analysis was applied to 2018 Senate races and concluded that \u201cthe House Freedom Caucus did   \u2026     Republicans\u2019 hopes of expanding their Senate majority, a great service in stopping the [Ryancare] bill before it made it across the Capitol,\u201d Wilson wrote.  But Wilson\u2019s analysis also shows strong public support for an alternative    \u201cplan that allows for the sale of insurance across state lines, expands Health Savings Accounts, incentivizes states to create   pools, block grants Medicaid, and is portable so it can be taken from job to job. \u201d Wilson\u2019s analysis is based a huge national survey, which allows his group to understand the preference of each population subgroup. For example, voters are asked three questions about each issue, he said. Typically, one question is skewed from a   perspective, one question is skewed from the right, and the third question is intended to be unbiased, he said. In turn, the team then used three   models to predict preferences among each politicians\u2019 particular subgroups of voters. In this survey, the models were used to gauge each district\u2019s\u2019 voters preference for three healthcare options  \u2014   continuing Obamacare, establishing Ryan\u2019s \u201cRyancare\u201d replacement, and the third option, \u201cRepeal and replace. \u201d Subsequently, the analysts spend much time check and rechecking the accuracy of the   models in each district, he said, adding \u201cyou\u2019ve got to spend time \u201d Politicians are increasingly using this style of voter analysis to understand their constituents, amid constant pressure from lobbyists and donors, he said.  In the healthcare analysis, Wilson said he didn\u2019t try to gauge why the voters approved or rejected each of the three policy options. \u201cI don\u2019t have the ability to discern or divine the reason why the voters answered as they did  \u2026     that\u2019s the next stage\u201d of development, he added.
