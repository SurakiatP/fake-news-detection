[In an appearance this weekend on MSNBC\u2019s The Last Word, the    Trumpland director encouraged those opposed to Trump\u2019s presidency to join the Women\u2019s March on Washington scheduled for January 21, the day after the presidential inauguration.  \u201cIt\u2019s important that everybody go there,\u201d Moore told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber. \u201cThis will have an effect. We need to throw everything at this. This man is slightly unhinged, if I can say that, and he\u2019s a malignant narcissist. He cares very much about what people think of him. He wants to be the popular guy. And he\u2019s going to be very upset if there\u2019s a lot of people there. \u201d Moore  \u2014   one of the first and only celebrities to predict Trump\u2019s victory  \u2014   also urged protesters to \u201cget up off the couch\u201d and organize during the first three months of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe are gonna be busy, busy, busy,\u201d Moore said, adding a call of support to \u201ca hundred days of resistance. \u201d The filmmaker said he was encouraged to hear the hair and makeup employees at MSNBC talking about going to the Women\u2019s March backstage before he appeared on the program. \u201cThat\u2019s the new Americana. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. And people are going to be relentless about this, so I\u2019m optimistic,\u201d he concluded. Moore worked hard to persuade voters to vote for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the general election. He released a surprise documentary critical of Trump  \u2014   Michael Moore in TrumpLand  \u2014   just weeks before Election Day, but a portion of the film in which Moore extols Trump\u2019s appeal to Rust Belt voters was subsequently cut from the film and posted online, where it went viral among Trump supporters. The filmmaker previously called for protesters to \u201cdisrupt\u201d Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20. Watch Moore\u2019s appearance on MSNBC above.
