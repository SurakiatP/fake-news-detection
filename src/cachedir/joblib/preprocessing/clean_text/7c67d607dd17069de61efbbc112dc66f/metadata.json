[The   international manhunt that ensued after Brady\u2019s jersey went missing eventually brought authorities to the home of Martin Mauricio Ortega, a Mexican journalist and tabloid newspaper boss who, as it turns out, not only had Brady\u2019s jersey from this past Super Bowl but also had Brady\u2019s jersey from Super Bowl XLIX and Von Miller\u2019s helmet from Super Bowl L.  Though, as reported by Robert Klemko and Jenny Vrentas in the Monday Morning Quarterback, this case was about a lot more than a missing jersey. It also had the potential to hurt U. S.  relations. In fact, so concerned were U. S. authorities that they didn\u2019t even want to ask the Mexican police for help. According to the MMQB, \u201cAmerican officials were also cognizant of the charged atmosphere. \u2018We had [Ortega] identified \u2014  that wasn\u2019t the point,\u2019 says a U. S. investigator who worked on the case. \u2018It was now the point of walking that political minefield as delicately as we could to appease everybody. We didn\u2019t want to upset the Mexican authorities, we didn\u2019t want to upset the Mexican people, we didn\u2019t want to upset the U. S. embassy. \u2019\u201d Though Ortega was in possession of more than $500, 000 dollars of property stolen from American citizens in the U. S. the   on the part of U. S. law enforcement over making Mexican authorities \u201cupset,\u201d resulted in American officials only seeking the return of the stolen Super Bowl hardware, as opposed to pressing any charges against Ortega. From the MMQB: Dressed in his pajamas, his stunned wife looking on, Ortega was    with armed federal agents. According to a source in the Mexican government, a deal was presented: Hand over the Super Bowl jerseys and whatever else you\u2019ve stolen, and you will sleep in your own bed not only tonight, but for the foreseeable future. Ortega fished a black trash bag out of a dresser drawer and gave it to the police, who took photos of the transaction to prove Ortega\u2019s cooperation. Agents didn\u2019t tear up the floorboards, toss cabinets or pull kitchen appliances from their wall connections. They didn\u2019t even search the lower floor. They simply asked, Do you have anything else? He did. He made a phone call to a friend who arrived shortly thereafter. (Mexican police on the scene dubbed the physically stout newcomer Gordito, \u201clittle fat one. \u201d) The friend brought with him an     helmet with   scuff marks on the crown: Von Miller\u2019s Super Bowl 50 helmet. The rest is history: Brady got his jersey back, American citizen and   Rob Gronkowski attempted to steal it again, we all had a laugh, and all\u2019s well that ends well. However, if you were wondering why Donald Trump got elected president, it\u2019s pretty well laid out for you here. Here you have a Mexican citizen, in this country as a guest, robbing two U. S. citizens of merchandise totaling more than $500, 000, and American law enforcement seem more concerned over \u201cappeasing\u201d Mexico than they are with securing justice for the Americans who got robbed. Of course, the FBI didn\u2019t have to arrest Ortega for stealing jerseys and a helmet. If the only people we had to worry about crossing the border to commit crimes were Mexican sports memorabilia thieves, then the world would be a far better place. However, the attitude displayed by U. S. law enforcement here, the attitude which prioritizes niceties and appeasement of foreign countries and foreign people over and above justice for Americans citizens, seems to only rear its ugly head when law enforcement is investigating NFL memorabilia thieves and not when they\u2019re investigating murders, drug trafficking, and kidnapping.
