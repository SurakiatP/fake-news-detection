[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \u201cWe conclude that CBO\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\u2019s tax credits, saying, \u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\u2019s advanceable, so it\u2019s available today. \u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561854.1116781}
