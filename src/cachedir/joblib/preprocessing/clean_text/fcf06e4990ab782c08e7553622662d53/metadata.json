One of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue.\u201d \\nLast summer, Iran signed a historic deal with the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany \u2013 the so-called P5+1 group - based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities.
