Whenever a   host upbraids a public figure in a monologue or a pundit bests another in a Twitter fight, onlookers crowd around to declare the loser DESTROYED! or EVISCERATED! or ETHERED! or ANNIHILATED! But alongside these symbols of destruction has risen another, more apt metaphor for the dynamics of the modern media power play. In this one, the defeated party wasn\u2019t killed, but possessed: They got OWNED. When the white nationalist Richard Spencer approvingly posted a song from \u201cCabaret\u201d on Twitter in March, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander swooped in to say: \u201cHey, buddy, that song you love was written by my uncle. He\u2019s been married to my other uncle for 40 years. And he\u2019s a Jew. \u201d A Twitter bystander waded into Spencer\u2019s mentions and observed: \u201cYou get publicly owned with astonishing frequency, it\u2019s really wonderful. \u201d Ownage can be politically urgent or purely irreverent. When the Slate editor Gabriel Roth complained about  \u2019u200bWebster Dictionary\u2019s overly   attitude toward changes in usage  \u2014   \u201cI feel like @MerriamWebster is turning into the \u2018chill\u2019 parent who lets your friends come over and get high,\u201d he wrote on Twitter  \u2014   the account replied: \u201cNo one cares how you feel. \u201d Dozens piled on to rub it in: \u201cYou got owned by the dictionary. \u201d On the internet, where rhetorical victories are so fleeting, the phrase is oddly satisfying: It\u2019s a passing but dramatic staking of argumentative ground. \u201cOwned\u201d is borrowed from hacker slang. If you got owned, that meant some hacker jimmied the lock on a virtual back door, snooped around your property and rifled through your stuff. The word speaks of a literal possession: annexing another person\u2019s virtual space and stealing private information. But \u201cyou got owned\u201d also animates a simple theft with a violent spark. Owning someone isn\u2019t just about taking his things it\u2019s about diminishing him as a person. With enough specialized technical knowledge, you can actually seize control of another human being, or at least the person\u2019s virtual presence. Among hackers, ownage often works as a form of community discipline. In the early aughts, underground online zines like Zero for Owned  \u2014   ZF0 for short  \u2014   emerged as sites for hackers to detail how they broke into the systems of prominent security professionals and fellow hackers to shame them for overstating their skills. \u201cWe believe actions speak louder than words,\u201d the first issue of Zero for Owned announced. \u201cWhile you were talking trash, we were sifting through your files, reading your conversations, owning more boxes\u201d  \u2014   computers  \u2014   \u201con your networks, and you had no idea. \u201d The zines spread around their targets\u2019 website code and personal communications as punishment. By finding gaps in the technological skill of famous hackers, the creators of these zines justified the release of the private information the hackers had failed to protect. Now, as information security has become increasingly central to both global politics and personal relationships, \u201cowned\u201d has migrated from the online underground to the mainstream. There has never been a stronger relationship between who we are perceived to be and what kind of information we have. Recent concerns over \u201cfilter bubbles,\u201d \u201cfake news\u201d and political memes churned out by Russian trolls lay bare the fact that our beliefs are controlled by the data we consume. Information silos make us vulnerable to being owned not only because of our ignorance  \u2014   the things we don\u2019t know  \u2014   but also because of how little control we have over the things we do know. We\u2019re constantly open to exposure. The hacking and release of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and from the Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t reveal any bombshells, but they succeeded in scandalizing through the simple act of making the private public. Now President Trump tweets conspiratorially about \u201cleaks\u201d and \u201cwiretapping,\u201d fixated on the idea that his political rivals have acquired or released his secrets  \u2014   and obsessed with the suggestion that he is somehow an illegitimate president. The threat of getting owned  \u2014   being revealed as oblivious, uninformed or incompetent  \u2014   works like a virtual Panopticon to keep people in a state of anxiety, keen to guard their own insecurities as they poke at other people\u2019s flaws. For thinkers throughout history, owning things was seen not just as useful and pleasant, but also as a source of human virtue. Aristotle argued that \u201cthe meaner sort of workman,\u201d by virtue of his lack of possessions, was \u201ctoo degraded\u201d to participate in politics and contribute to society. Hegel thought that owning things was a way for people to externalize their personal freedom. \u201cIt is in possession first of all that the person becomes rational,\u201d he wrote in \u201cPhilosophy of Right. \u201d And of course there is the obvious strangeness in talking about people \u201cowning\u201d one another online in a nation where, for a very long time, people did own other people  \u2014   and where many of them argued that this was an ennobling endeavor for everyone involved. The antebellum statesman John Calhoun defended owning slaves as a \u201cpositive good. \u201d More recently, our celebration of ownership has pointed inward. We speak approvingly of \u201ccoming into one\u2019s own\u201d or \u201cbeing one\u2019s own person. \u201d To be \u201c \u201d is to be confident and poised. Ownage just turns that   back outward: Now we wield our superior knowledge and skills over our rivals. In the hacking context, owning someone is all about a display of superior technological abilities. When the word migrated from hacking to gaming, \u201cowned\u201d became a mantra for those who had mastered the game play or bested opponents. Now it extends to rhetorical force  \u2014   a   and withering joke or an irrefutable debate line. After the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian Leslie Jones was hacked  \u2014   her private photographs were stolen and spread across the web  \u2014   Complex magazine\u2019s Daniel Barna said that she \u201cowned her hackers\u201d in an \u201cS. N. L. \u201d monologue. Ownage radiates power. \u201cOwned\u201d and its derivative, \u201cpwned\u201d (pronounced any number of ways, but mostly \u201cponed\u201d) are bits of leetspeak  \u2014   \u201cleet\u201d as in \u201celite. \u201d If pidgin languages create a simplified slang to foster   communication, leetspeak deliberately complicates the root language, replacing letters with numbers and symbols and swapping characters. It\u2019s an ideal code for people who believe their mastery of the internet has raised them to a higher plane of existence. \u201cPwnage\u201d creates an   and an   and furthers the fetishization of specialized knowledge down to the level of casual conversation. The mainstreaming of \u201cowned\u201d has always come with a bit of a wink, an acknowledgment that those most eager to lord their superior knowledge over others often have the biggest blind spots. That was the dynamic that fueled the hacker zines, in which the owners got owned. As the usage of \u201cowned\u201d spread, it also was mixed with stereotypes of hackers and gamers as being socially awkward. That underlying paradox of the gamer persona fueled the   web series \u201cPure Pwnage,\u201d which followed a kid named Jeremy who was highly skilled at video games but a failure at real life. Now ownage communicates dominance, but it also belies an underlying impotence. All of this has set the stage for ownage\u2019s latest twist: the rise of the  . If an own exposes another person\u2019s ignorance, a   reveals your own obliviousness. During the campaign, Bobby Jindal tried to insult President Trump on Twitter but ended up suggesting that only fools would donate to Jindal\u2019s campaign: \u201cWe have met. You wrote a check. A fool  his money are soon parted. A fool  his dad\u2019s money are parted sooner. \u201d Jindal owned himself. Recently Trump\u2019s White House communications team circulated a flattering Washington Post article about how great the president\u2019s budget was  \u2014   headlined \u201cTrump\u2019s Budget Makes Perfect Sense and Will Fix America, and I Will Tell You Why\u201d  \u2014   except the article was satirical. That was a presidential  . The most successful ownage finds hubristic targets, people who think they know more than they do. But ownage is itself a hubristic act  \u2014   it turns knowledge into a tool for exploiting another person\u2019s lack thereof. Owning someone sets you up to be owned yourself, sometimes in the same breath. The    \u2014   and a related concept, \u201cYou played yourself,\u201d the refrain of the motivational Snapchat user DJ Khaled  \u2014   is a double entendre. In the   you let yourself down by being so nakedly yourself. You fail, in the end, by being you.'"}, "time": 1742562113.6821895}
