She was 38 years old and five months pregnant, and on her second night there, she miscarried in her hotel room, delivering her son in a torrent of blood that nearly killed her. Her son would not survive, but Ms. Levy detailed in a heartbreaking essay a year later that would win her a National Magazine Award that after she yanked the placenta from her body, crawled to the phone and called a local doctor, she took the boy\u2019s photo. \u201cI worried that if I didn\u2019t,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI would never believe he had existed. \u201d The essay, titled \u201cThanksgiving in Mongolia,\u201d was a brutal read. Ms. Levy wrote of the feeling of her son\u2019s skin, \u201clike a silky frog\u2019s on my mouth,\u201d and of the image of a white bath mat someone had thrown over a bloodstain next to her bed that would slowly darken as her blood seeped through it during the five days that she spent holed up in her hotel room. Back home, she wrote, she sobbed, bled and lactated in an awful storm of hormones and grief. Before the miscarriage, she had considered herself lucky: buoyed by the gains of   feminism, successful at her chosen career, legally married to a woman and carrying a baby made by a friend\u2019s donated sperm. Afterward, as she wrote, she felt buffeted by a different kind of fate, something more Shakespearean or biblical, \u201cthe 10 or 20 minutes I was somebody\u2019s mother were black magic there is no adventure I would have traded them for. \u201d And yet. Not only did she lose her child, but her marriage also fell apart. This felt like a karmic smackdown, and Ms. Levy wanted to interrogate her own responsibility for such a sequence of grim events. That is the intellectual backbone, anyway, of \u201cThe Rules Do Not Apply\u201d: her memoir, out March 14, that lays the groundwork for what happened in Mongolia and picks up where the essay left off, raising, once again, that hoary conceit, the one about women and \u201chaving it all. \u201d \u201cI felt like this very fortunate beneficiary of the women\u2019s movement,\u201d she said during a recent interview in her bright,   walk up in Chelsea. \u201cI got to have all these choices, and the rules\u201d  \u2014   biological, historical  \u2014   \u201cdid not apply. So it was a very shocking experience to find myself, childless and alone at 38. I felt like a complete failure, on the deepest level. \u201cSome of it was like someone in a Jane Austen novel, getting her comeuppance, but some of it, most of it, was feeling like a mother, but where\u2019s the baby? There is no child. Then you\u2019ve got a little identity crisis on your hands. \u201d Ms. Levy bought the apartment during her marriage, when she and her former spouse, now a recovering alcoholic, separated for a time. She lives there alone, attended by two amiable, rotund cats. On a Friday afternoon, she was preparing for an appearance at the 92nd Street Y, where she would be interviewed by her friend Lena Dunham. \u201cThis thinking that you can have every single thing you want in life is not the thinking of a feminist,\u201d Ms. Levy told the audience that night. \u201cIt\u2019s the thinking of a toddler. \u201d \u201c !\u201d Ms. Dunham said, \u201c  for all! Hashtag toddler. \u201d A thoroughly modern memoir, the elements of \u201cThe Rules Do Not Apply\u201d seem plucked not from the script of \u201cGirls,\u201d which has also been exploring reproductive issues of late, but \u201cTransparent\u201d  \u2014   even \u201cPortlandia. \u201d When Ms. Levy, at 30, marries her girlfriend, her   parents are put out not because she is a lesbian, but because they are against the square traditions of marriage. \u201cAre you impressed with how cool I am about all this?\u201d her father said when she brought home her first girlfriend. She has a gothic affair with a brutish and unhinged transgender man who hacks Ms. Levy\u2019s computer. When Ms. Levy conceives a child with the sperm of a dear friend who is rich enough to pay the child\u2019s college tuition but wants a   relationship to parenthood, you imagine a sort of Michael Cunningham utopia for Ms. Levy and her wife in their house on Shelter Island. Or perhaps a reality show. Simon Doonan and Jonathan Adler, colorful exemplars not just of   marriage but also of Manhattan\u2019s creative class, are their neighbors. Of her generation, Ms. Levy writes: \u201cSometimes our parents were dazzled by the sense of possibility they\u2019d bestowed on us. Other times, they were aghast to recognize their own entitlement, staring back at them magnified in the mirror of their offspring. \u201d Ms. Levy, who in person speaks in the vernacular of her era  \u2014   \u201cdude\u201d and \u201cgirl\u201d are her preferred terms of address  \u2014   presents a memoir often festooned with   irony. It\u2019s her second book. \u201cFemale Chauvinist Pigs,\u201d out in 2005, wondered just how liberated the heroines of \u201craunch\u201d culture actually were. She knows she is a different sort of cultural clich\u00e9, a bisexual Wesleyan graduate who never quite learned to mind her pronouns. She wears her   sensibility lightly. Before her wedding, Ms. Levy writes of trying to woo her wife\u2019s Minnesotan mother, whose strongest expression of emotion was the phrase, \u201cOh, honestly. \u201d In conversation one day, Ms. Levy lets loose an \u201cOy vey,\u201d startling her      . As she writes, Ms. Levy had to explain, \u201cThat\u2019s what my people say when we mean, \u2018Oh, honestly. \u2019\u201d She grew up, in Larchmont, N. Y. as an outlier. She was the only child of   parents who didn\u2019t fit in with the suburban ethos of her neighborhood: her father wrote copy for Planned Parenthood, Naral and NOW, among other organizations her mother worked with Down syndrome children and opened an   day care. And there was a family secret hiding in plain sight: Her mother was engaged in a   affair with a   classmate who would appear periodically, camping on blankets in the living room. By her account, Ms. Levy was a brash,   unpopular child who took to her diary for companionship, using a notebook to puzzle her way through a hostile social environment at school and the weirdness at home. \u201cThat was my lifeline,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t like me, I was loud and aggressive. People can take it from a    but when you\u2019re a little kid, and people are like, \u2018You\u2019re loud and awful,\u2019 you think, \u2018I guess I am awful,\u2019 so writing and figuring out how to put things into words was the way I felt better. \u201d Not long after college, she got a job at New York magazine, where she was mentored by the editor John Homans. David Remnick, editor in chief of The New Yorker, hired her away after a lunchtime courtship during which Ms. Levy suffered a bad case of flop sweat. When she tells her father about her new job, he says, \u201cWell, nowhere to go but down. \u201d Ms. Levy has spent much of her career profiling women who are, in her words, \u201ctoo much,\u201d like Caster Semenya, the African runner with elevated levels of testosterone who upended the way the Olympics thought about gender Lamar Van Dyke, a founder of a band of lesbian separatists from the 1970s and Edith Windsor, the octogenarian lesbian whose suit against the United States paved the way for the legalization of   marriage. Last week, Ms. Levy profiled the photographer Catherine Opie, once an SM aficionado and darling of the Whitney Biennial, circa 1995, unpacking her homey radicalism. While a gay or bisexual woman like Ms. Levy would seem to be the ideal image for what is now called \u201cintersectional\u201d or multilayered feminism, Charlotte Shane, a writer for The New Republic, recently accused her of   feminist sins  \u2014   or the \u201cdangerous failures of neoliberal feminism\u201d  \u2014   in a piece headlined \u201cAriel Levy\u2019s Infuriating Memoir of Privilege and Entitlement. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely many black women or Arab women or undocumented women would presume a similar degree of permission and mobility,\u201d Ms. Shane wrote, \u201cregardless of their exposure to Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan. \u201d This line of argument amused more than rankled Ms. Levy. \u201cIf one of my students at Wesleyan tried to take down a writer,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018white and from Larchmont\u2019 is a good start but you need more of a case. \u201d She added: \u201cI think it would be difficult to argue that I\u2019m a   for womenkind. I\u2019ve tried pretty hard to bring in unusual female voices and perspectives. Not just young women and not just white women, either. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m the best target for improvement. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m the problem. \u201d Her friend Mr. Doonan would label Ms. Levy a   feminist, like his own mother, who served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. \u201cShe\u2019s like those fearless viragos,\u201d Mr. Doonan said of Ms. Levy. \u201cShe\u2019s uniquely intrepid. Tremendously grateful for opportunities and never complaining. That isn\u2019t in a way a contemporary thing. People tend to see things through the lens of victimhood, but Ari takes full responsibility and carries on. \u201d Ms. Levy is deferential to her   whose alcoholism arguably tanked the relationship, though Ms. Levy said, \u201cWe made a fine mess together. \u201d She gave her a pseudonym, Lucy, and she also gave her the manuscript to read before she showed it to anyone else. Lucy suggested no changes. \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s your story, I\u2019m not going to censor you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Levy said. (The identity of the baby\u2019s father is even more veiled, in keeping with his wishes, she said.) \u201cI don\u2019t come from addicts,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents never drank. What I did know about was something being amiss in the house, there being a secret, and knowing  \u2014   knowing  \u2014   something\u2019s off. \u201d When she attends an   meeting, reluctantly (because its jargon irritates her) she learns a \u201cprofound concept,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re off the job, that it doesn\u2019t matter if you figure it out, you can try and persuade the person at the center of it that there\u2019s a problem but you\u2019re never going to get anywhere, so just punch your punch card out. You\u2019re done. \u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I have no regrets, but I no longer think, for example, I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Mongolia. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered. People say, \u2018Oh, it would have been better to have miscarried in New York.\u2019 I\u2019m not sure about that. There\u2019s no way your baby is going to die in your hands and you\u2019re going to be, like, \u2018Well, that worked out well! \u2019\u201d When \u201cThanksgiving in Mongolia\u201d landed on his desk, Mr. Remnick said he read it right away, against his habit. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of my chair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I hadn\u2019t known what had happened we had been talking even when she was still there. The world is full of personal essays. My illness. My divorce. My delight. They are everywhere. Arguably there are too many. Among the average ones, there\u2019s a kind of grasping aspect to them. When they connect, as Ari\u2019s did, there\u2019s really nothing like it. \u201d She is a joyful person, and a joyful writer, he added. \u201cNo question she has an absolutely magnetic personality,\u201d he said. \u201cOne imagines Joan Didion hanging around the Doors and   was a recessive presence. Ari ain\u2019t recessive. \u201d As it happens, Ms. Levy\u2019s adventures fit into an older tradition than the   \u201cthe autopathographies,\u201d as James Atlas wrote, introducing the wave of literary memoirs from the early 1990s  \u2014   Mary Karr, Susanna Kaysen, et al  \u2014   that have dominated the form for decades. When her marriage finally ends, Ms. Levy strikes up a correspondence with the handsome South African doctor John Gasson, who had treated her in Mongolia. The memoir ends ambiguously, with Ms. Levy pondering a flight to South Africa. But in real life, she and Dr. J. as she calls him, conducted an epistolary romance through email that continued to blossom. There would be setbacks, as Ms. Levy tried  \u2014   \u201c400, 000 times,\u201d she said  \u2014   to get pregnant through IVF treatments, until \u201cmy heart was broken and I had no money and I was like: \u2018Girl, it\u2019s done. Let it go. \u2019\u201d \u201cNot everybody gets everything, but you get some stuff,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou get other stuff. \u201d She and Dr. Gasson, a rotational doctor whose work schedule at a clinic in Nigeria is five weeks on, five weeks off and who also writes, are engaged. If either one of them can get it together to file the paperwork, she said, they will marry. As to where they will live, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be mobile. The fact that I cannot bear a child works rather well with that. Given that I have no choice in the matter, that\u2019s the upside. \u201d And so, despite all the postmillennial complications of Ms. Levy\u2019s    tale and her sexual fluidity, in the end she gets the guy. Who says modernity killed the marriage plot? Or as Ms. Dunham put it, Ms. Levy \u201cfully is like hitting it with the hot doctor in the book. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562005.7647696}
