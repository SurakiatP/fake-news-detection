Much like the one in Libya. \\nAnd remember McCabe, whose wife\\'s Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Clinton ally? \\nAmid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI\u2019s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. \\nNot a surprise either. \\nThe FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn\u2019t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. \\nFBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. \\nAs prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn\u2019t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. \\nAnd that\\'s what blew up when Team Hillary lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Hillary\\'s DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even McCabe was disgusted. \\nAs a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, \u201cAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?\u2019\u2019 The senior Justice Department official replied: \u201dOf course not.\u201d \\nOf course.'"}, "time": 1742628319.941145}
