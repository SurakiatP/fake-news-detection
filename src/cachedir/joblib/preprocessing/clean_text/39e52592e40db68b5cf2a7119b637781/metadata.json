Just take a look at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s website itself. \\nWow. That is just such a strange coincidence, don\u2019t you think? Right around the same time Hillary Clinton was deciding to retire as Secretary of State and focus on her campaign, this company bought out half the voting machines in the country. \\nAnd if that is not bad enough, one of the top owners of Dominion Voting is none other than the king of corruption himself, George Soros. \\nBut it gets even worse. \\nDominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project. \\nAccording to the project\u2019s own website : \\n\u201c In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections.\u201d \\nThis presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations. \\nAs we previously reported , the Democratic primaries were essentially rigged. So why wouldn\u2019t the general U.S. election potentially be manipulated in favor of the elite\u2019s preferred candidate? \\nIf you think this is as important of information as I do, then share this out immediately. Time is of the essence.'"}, "time": 1742563141.361069}
