Hillary closed her campaign in the state, and has put in tens of millions in ad spending she never expected to need. \\nBut on Election Day, dozens of reports of voting machine \u201cirregularities\u201d are coming in from across the Keystone State \u2014 every single one from Trump voters. \\nBlack conservative Aedonis posted this video from his polling place in a Philly suburb, where his machine would not take his Trump vote : this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN \\n\u2014 \u00e6donis | hotep (@lordaedonis) November 8, 2016 \\nAnd to add insult to injury, before \u201c calibrating \u201d the machine (why wasn\u2019t it already calibrated before the vote??), Aedonis said the poll worker tried to get him to KEEP the vote for Hillary! \\nAnd in Clinton Township, PA \u2013outside of Pittsburgh \u2014 the same thing was reported there!
