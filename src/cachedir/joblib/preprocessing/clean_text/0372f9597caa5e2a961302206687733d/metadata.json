Richard Burr noticed a picture of Clinton hanging in a gun shop and decided the owners should put a \u201cbullseye\u201d on it. \\nSpeaking to GOP volunteers on Saturday , Burr joked that he had recently visited a gun shop and \u201cnothing made me feel better\u201d than seeing a magazine about rifles\u201cwith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.\u201d \\n\u201cI was a little bit shocked at that \u2014 it didn\u2019t have a bullseye on it,\u201d Burr told the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. \u201cBut on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there\u2019s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.\u201d \\nBurr\u2019s comments echo those of his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has called on the \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d to \u201cdo something\u201d about his Democratic opponent. However, Burr is at least pretending that he feels bad about his remarks. \\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee chairman issued an apology on Monday. \u201cThe comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,\u201d Burr said. \\nA Burr campaign official said the Senator\u2019s remark about feeling \u201cbetter\u201d had nothing at all to do with the idea of Clinton being shot. Really. He was just referring to the support other right-wing candidates have gotten from various gun rights groups. Honest. \\nBurr also said that if he is re-elected and Hillary should happen to win the White House, he will do all he can to continue obstructing the appointment of a ninth Supreme Court justice. When asked about the possibility of Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s nominee, being appointed, Burr said, \u201cit isn\u2019t going to happen \u2014 period.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd if Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.\u201d \\nBurr also made it clear that he considers being responsible for the \u201clongest judicial vacancy in history\u201d a badge of honor. \\nYou can listen to Burr fantasize about \u201cbullseyes\u201d on Hillary Clinton, here : \\nFeatured image via Gabriella Demczuk/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563323.574993}
