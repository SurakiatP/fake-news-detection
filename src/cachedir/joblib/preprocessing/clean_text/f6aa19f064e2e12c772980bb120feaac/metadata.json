Badgers, carnivores native to the American West, are generally nocturnal and spend most of their time in burrows. They are known to cache food to eat later  \u2014   squirrels and rabbits, typically. No one has ever seen a badger put away such a large hunk of meat. The scientists had put out seven calf carcasses in an attempt to study scavenging behavior. At one site, the carcass had completely disappeared. A look at video from the camera trap was enough to see what had happened. After burying the carcass, the badger built a den next to his large food supply. No other badger visited the site. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial undertaking,\u201d said Ethan H. Frehner, an associate instructor in biology at the University of Utah.'"}, "time": 1742563592.064401}
