Trump\u2019s journey to the threshold of the presidency has, in the closing weeks of the election, come back to the doorstep of the man who first catapulted him to national fame. But Mark Burnett, the creator of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d does not seem amused. Mr. Burnett, one of television\u2019s most powerful figures, is facing growing demands this week that he release footage from the \u201cApprentice\u201d set that some former crew members say could reveal Mr. Trump acting in vulgar and offensive ways. The outcry has grown to the point where Mr. Burnett, who rarely comments on political matters, felt compelled on Wednesday evening to issue a forceful denunciation of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid, saying he rejected \u201cthe hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign. \u201d Mr. Burnett issued his statement on the same night that several women came forward to say they had been groped or assaulted by Mr. Trump, a flood of accusations that continued on Thursday. Their accounts followed a video released last week from 2005 of Mr. Trump and the television host Billy Bush engaging in vulgar talk about women. Now, the clamor for potentially damning \u201cApprentice\u201d footage has turned into a spectacle worthy of one of Mr. Burnett\u2019s own creations  \u2014   complete with cameos from    personalities like the lawyer Gloria Allred, who led a protest against    this week, and a distinctly Hollywood mixture of political intrigue and corporate  . Mr. Burnett, who has not commented on whether such footage exists, said he did not have the legal right to release \u201cApprentice\u201d tapes M. G. M. the global entertainment conglomerate that now owns Mr. Burnett\u2019s production company and its archive, says the same. A person familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cApprentice\u201d contract, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe confidential terms, said M. G. M. would have to obtain Mr. Trump\u2019s permission before releasing unaired footage of him from the show, part of a clause granting Mr. Trump control over the use of his name and likeness. The clause in Mr. Trump\u2019s contract is not unusual in reality television, and M. G. M. said on Wednesday that it intended to honor its agreements. Few Hollywood studios wish to be at the center of a fevered political dispute, and M. G. M. \u2019s statement did not mention Mr. Trump by name. Still, some critics have wondered if Mr. Burnett  \u2014   whose other hits include \u201cSurvivor,\u201d \u201cShark Tank\u201d and \u201cThe Voice\u201d  \u2014   was simply trying to maintain cordial ties with Mr. Trump, who retains a financial interest in the \u201cApprentice\u201d franchise and whose   skills have generated tens of millions of dollars for Mr. Burnett. (\u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d returns in January on NBC with Arnold Schwarzenegger taking over as host.) Entertainment lawyers interviewed this week wondered if Mr. Trump would have much of a legal case if \u201cApprentice\u201d footage were released. The \u201cname and likeness\u201d clause is typically invoked if a celebrity\u2019s image is used for profit  \u2014   not as documentary evidence in a presidential campaign. Refusing to release footage \u201ccould mean that there are contractual restrictions,\u201d said Jerry Glover, a lawyer in Chicago who has worked on   disputes. \u201cIt could also mean Burnett doesn\u2019t want to get on Donald Trump\u2019s bad side,\u201d Mr. Glover added. That is the suspicion of people like Ms. Allred, who marched outside M. G. M. headquarters and declared that Mr. Burnett had \u201ca civic duty\u201d to open his video vault. Online petitions are demanding that the footage be released UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group, planned to fly a plane over Los Angeles on Thursday with the banner, \u201cM. G. M. NBC, Burnett: Release the Tapes. \u201d Mr. Burnett denied a report in BuzzFeed News that he had threatened \u201cApprentice\u201d employees with litigation if any footage were leaked. In a sign that Mr. Burnett was wary of the effect on his public image  \u2014   particularly in his   entertainment milieu  \u2014   his statement began with an emphatic phrase: \u201cI am NOT  . \u201d Defenders of Mr. Burnett said it was unfair to expect him to step into the role of a journalist, especially if releasing footage meant breaching a contract. There could also be reputational costs: An emergence of damning footage might blemish the valuable \u201cApprentice\u201d brand. And the   industry, with its susceptibility to spoilers and demands for authenticity, is particularly sensitive to issues of discretion and trust. In interviews this week with more than two dozen people who worked on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d many expressed disgust at Mr. Trump\u2019s vulgar conversation with Mr. Bush. But none would speak publicly about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior on the set of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d citing nondisclosure agreements with steep financial penalties. One \u201cApprentice\u201d contract from 2005 obtained by The New York Times included a $5 million penalty for contestants who made unauthorized leaks. Former \u201cApprentice\u201d workers, more accustomed to talk of casting calls than campaign scandals, said they were stunned to find themselves thrust into supporting roles in a presidential election. Many said they were reluctant to discuss their experiences with Mr. Trump out of fear of losing work in an industry where just a whiff of untrustworthiness can persuade a potential employer to call someone else. They also noted a practical problem: There are thousands of hours of footage from \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d most likely stored in hundreds of boxes. Finding scenes with Mr. Trump  \u2014   let alone footage of some kind of damning utterance  \u2014   would be no small task. Mr. Burnett, who has donated to Democratic candidates, is an Englishman who, until now, has been reluctant to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise. Last month, he was seen smiling awkwardly at the Emmy Awards when Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian, needled him about Mr. Trump from the stage. \u201cThanks to Mark Burnett, we don\u2019t have to watch reality shows anymore,\u201d Mr. Kimmel quipped. \u201cWe\u2019re living in one. \u201d But Mr. Burnett\u2019s eye for megahits might still soothe any political misgivings expressed by his peers. \u201cEven if it turns out that Burnett\u2019s sitting on Trump video that the public really ought to see, if he keeps on cranking out monster hits, this town won\u2019t shun him,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, who runs the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cIn this industry,\u201d Mr. Kaplan added, \u201cratings swing a bigger bat than civics. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563807.9801252}
