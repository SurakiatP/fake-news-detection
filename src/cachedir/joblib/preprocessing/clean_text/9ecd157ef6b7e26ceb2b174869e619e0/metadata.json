You can make up a report; you can\u2019t make up an entire bus! \\n\u201cIf the \u00a3122bn figure was true, they would have put it on a bus, of course they would. It\u2019s how the British electorate expects to be told about the economy, dumbass. \\n\u201cShow me a bus that says the country\u2019s finances are \u00a3122bn worse off after voting for Brexit, and then we\u2019ll talk \u2013 but until then, you can piss off.\u201d \\nWilliams went on to explain that Brexit is the best thing that has ever happened to the country, before heading to the Post Office to buy some Euros for a stag do he\u2019s about to attend.
