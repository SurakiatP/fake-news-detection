Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots. \\nNATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time. Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that country\u2019s east, with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries.  \""}, "time": 1742628565.8943317}
