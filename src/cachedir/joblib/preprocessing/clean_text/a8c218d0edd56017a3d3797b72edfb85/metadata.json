What many people do not realize is that if she becomes president, Hillary would ban many of our favorite guns, as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked. \\nIn a recent WikiLeaks dump, we got an inside glimpse into Hillary\u2019s diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president. If you thought Obama\u2019s tyranny with bypassing Congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious, it won\u2019t hold a candle to this woman\u2019s plans. She blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner \u201cmore aggressive than Obama,\u201d while chipping away at our Second Amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws. \\nWhile Hillary likes to pump us full of crap, claiming that \u201claw-abiding Americans wouldn\u2019t be targeted\u201d with her tyranny, her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect Americans with no criminal records, while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals. \\nOne example is Hillary calling for the \u201creinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines.\u201d However, the result of her \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms, including the popular AR-15, while making \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines illegal to even possess. \\nWe all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because Hillary decides to pass a law. \\nHer other Constitution-subverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for \u201cvictims of gun violence\u201d to sue gun manufacturers, which would quickly bankrupt these companies. However, Hillary\u2019s ultimate goal is to ban all guns in America completely by utilizing the Supreme Court. With her hand-picked justice filling Antonin Scalia\u2019s vacancy, she would have the SCOTUS revisit the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling. If successful, the court would eliminate it\u2019s previous affirmation that it is an individual\u2019s Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. \\nWhen you put all the pieces together, Hillary\u2019s plans for America is nothing short of chilling. History taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed \u2014 images of corpses from Nazi concentration camps come to mind. Add Hillary\u2019s gun-grabbing plan to her dream of turning America into a borderless society and flooding our country with Muslim refugees, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. \\nGod help us if this woman is elected. Continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day. Once she\u2019s in office, the America that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a third-world country crap hole, and Hillary\u2019s life-long plans will be complete.'"}, "time": 1742561919.213565}
