I don\u2019t even know where the f**k I\u2019m going, honestly. \\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to learn how to work all these lights and stuff,\u201d Pinney tells the camera. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this for real. I\u2019m driving with my knees right now trying to show you all this.\u201d \\nTulsa police sergeant Steve Stoltz told reporters that the joyride prompted the response of \u201cmultiple agencies\u201d and saw the suspect reach speeds of over 120mph before his arrest. \\n\u201cThe suspect was seen [driving] at high speed towards Sand Springs [Oklahoma] and then went north. The vehicle was eventually located by Skiatook Police Department, who initiated pursuit. The suspect, at high speeds, led them to an address\u2026 turned out that was where the suspect\u2019s parents were,\u201d Stoltz said. \\n\u2014 Annie Chang (@AnnieNewsOn6) November 1, 2016 \\nPinney has since been charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, eluding and resisting arrest, as well as the possession of a firearm.
