It is on us. If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, if we stay home or if we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary\u2019s opponent will win.

Others have swallowed the kool-aid and believe both candidates are the same. But Michelle Obama is right, not voting or voting for a third party candidate is the same as casting a vote for Trump. Quite frankly, there is just too much at stake for that this time around. \\nWatch Michelle Obama give warn Americans about the importance of their vote, here: \\nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562088.1890852}
