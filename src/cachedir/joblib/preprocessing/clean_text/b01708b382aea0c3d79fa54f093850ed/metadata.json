Partial transcript as follows: LIMBAUGH: Hi, friends. This is great. I have been laughing all morning long. I have been laughing starting with last night. Can we agree that Donald Trump is probably enjoying this more than anybody wants to admit or that anybody knows? So he fires Comey yesterday. Who\u2019s he meet with today? He\u2019s meeting with the Soviet, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov! I mean, what an epic troll this is. The Democrat Party is going bananas  \u2014   completely, totally unhinged  \u2014   on the road to literal insanity. Do you realize  \u2026    ? Let me tell you what\u2019s happened here. The Democrat Party has once again thrown Hillary Clinton overboard. Hillary Clinton is the most   woman in America by people in her own party, and it\u2019s happened again. If you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019m talking about, stand by I\u2019m gonna explain all of this. But they have just chosen sides and, once again, Hillary gets thrown under the bus. And not only that, the Democrats are rolling that bus backwards and forwards. She\u2019s finished! She\u2019s over with. The Democrat Party and the media have made it clear that she is fodder. She is irrelevant here. It is amazing. Two days ago, they were all talking about how Comey needs to be fired because of how he was mistreating Hillary, and the Hillary people were running around claiming that Comey\u2019s a bad guy. And now Comey gets fired, and all of a sudden they do a 180! You know, my friends, I\u2019ve often spoke of the connection Donald Trump has with his audience, with his supporters. I understand it because  \u2026     Well, I just understand it. (  Right Scoop) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561665.8011346}
