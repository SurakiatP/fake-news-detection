One, embraced by many in the traditional legacy media, centered on what Mr. Flynn had done that led to his resignation: discussing sanctions against Russia in a conversation with the Russian ambassador, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about it. The other, which developed among the more   news media, focused on the leaks from Washington that had put pressure on Mr. Flynn to step aside, and whether these leaks were intended to damage President Trump. One narrative holds Mr. Flynn, and others who knew about his discussions, accountable. The other portrays Mr. Flynn more as a victim. The focus on leaks intensified on Wednesday, after The New York Times reported late Tuesday that Trump aides and associates had made repeated contact with senior Russian officials during the presidential campaign. Which narrative does Mr. Trump ascribe to? On Tuesday morning, he attributed Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation to \u201cillegal leaks. \u201d On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump again denounced the leaks in a blizzard of tweets. It is not unusual for news media to promote different story angles. And the division between   and   news organizations is certainly not new. But the rift between the mainstream media and more partisan news organizations has grown starker in the nearly four weeks since Mr. Trump took office, reflecting a widening political and ideological rift. The growing division means that some readers are getting their news through an   prism. Americans who get their information predominantly from Breitbart News, a   news and opinion site, for instance, or from the conservative Fox News are getting a very different version of the news from Americans who read The Washington Post or watch CNN. Late Monday night, as the news broke that Mr. Flynn had resigned, news organizations rushed to publish articles. Not Breitbart. For roughly an hour after Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation letter began circulating, Breitbart did not change the main story on its home page, which was about immigration policy. When Breitbart made the Flynn resignation its main story, around midnight, the account hewed closely to the facts of Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation and quoted heavily from his resignation letter. The site also put up a more analytical article that raised questions about the motives behind the government\u2019s monitoring of communications between Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador. \u201cDemocrats are clamoring for a deeper investigation of Russian ties to Trump,\u201d the article said. \u201cBut the more serious question is whether our nation\u2019s intelligence services were involved in what amounts to political espionage against the newly elected government. \u201d The article also raised questions about how the news media got its information, reinforcing a distrust of the press that Mr. Trump and his administration have assiduously tried to foster. \u201cThe fact that the contents of Flynn\u2019s phone conversation  \u2014   highly sensitive intelligence  \u2014   were leaked to the media suggests that someone with access to that information also has a political axe to grind,\u201d the article said. The emphasis on the leaks continued into Tuesday afternoon with an article at the top of Breitbart\u2019s site on the White House briefing and the assertion by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, that the leaks were an overlooked part of the reporting on Mr. Flynn. The narrative gained more steam on Wednesday morning, after the damaging reports Tuesday night: An article on the Breitbart home page seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s early morning tweets attacking the coverage rather than the news about the Russian contacts. Fox News also advanced this   narrative on Tuesday and Wednesday. During one segment on \u201cFox  Friends\u201d on Tuesday, Laura Ingraham, a conservative commentator and Fox News contributor, suggested that the leaks were politically motivated. \u201cThe long knives were out for Flynn almost the moment that he was announced,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this really was the death by a thousand leaks,\u201d Ms. Ingraham added. \u201cThe leaks that were coming out of this administration and the transition, before the administration, were at a level that I don\u2019t remember seeing for quite some time. \u201d Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican, also focused on the leaks during an appearance on the channel. \u201cWho tapped the phones, who was listening to it, who leaked it? I think those are legitimate questions to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d he later said, \u201cleaks of this nature are incredibly damaging to America, to our national security, and we need to look into it. \u201d Tuesday night ended on a predictably outraged note, with Sean Hannity, a Trump supporter, suggesting on his show that the left was \u201cwilling to do anything to stop President Trump from draining the swamp and changing the status quo. \u201d \u201cImpeachment of the president is clearly the end goal for the left,\u201d Mr. Hannity added. \u201cFacts, truth, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Mike Flynn is just a small casualty of that bigger plan. \u201d On Wednesday, the main article on the Fox News home page highlighted the president\u2019s condemnation of the leaks to the media. Journalists at more centrist news organizations, including CNN and NPR, attributed Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation to the strong reporting and investigative journalism that had exposed details of Mr. Flynn\u2019s talks with Russia. Rather than casting aspersion on leaks about Mr. Flynn, these commentators praised their contributions to accountability journalism. Joe Scarborough, a host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d went so far as to call the person who had leaked information \u201ca patriot. \u201d \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re finding out about it now is because a patriot did leak this to The Washington Post, did get this information out there, or else we wouldn\u2019t have even known about it,\u201d said Mr. Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida. The Columbia Journalism Review, a publication that chronicles and analyzes the news media, was perhaps the most pointed. An article on Tuesday  \u2014   with the headline \u201cFlynn resignation shows leaks under Trump are working. Keep \u2018em coming. \u201d  \u2014   described how several recent leaks had ultimately forced the Trump administration to reverse course or make changes. \u201cSome of these leaks have halted a Trump appointment and controversial policies in their tracks,\u201d the article said, \u201cand it\u2019s a lesson showing how   and leaks to the press are vital for democracy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628501.2764266}
