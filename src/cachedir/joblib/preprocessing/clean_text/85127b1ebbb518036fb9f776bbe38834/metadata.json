A. tournament, Albany\u2019s coach suggested that the Huskies were not only the best women\u2019s basketball team in the country but also the fittest. \u201cI think we\u2019re as in shape a team that you\u2019re going to come across,\u201d said the coach, Joanna  . Yet, she added, \u201cAt times they just made us look bad in the way they pushed the ball. \u201d Robust conditioning is a particular imperative, and a stealth weapon, for a UConn team ( ) that rotates only seven players  \u2014   five starters and two reserves  \u2014   as it seeks a fifth consecutive national championship. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, UConn has won 109 consecutive games with an approach that is, in some ways, decidedly  . For instance, the Huskies do not use devices like   monitors, GPS tracking systems or other wearable technology designed to gauge fitness, enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury. \u201cI\u2019m not a big data guy,\u201d UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said, adding with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough. \u201d Instead, the most dominant team in basketball places a premium on rigorous and varied preseason workouts, nutrition, sustained weight training through the season and, especially, on intense practices meant to simulate game conditions. The team relies heavily on the experience and intuition of Auriemma, UConn\u2019s coach of 32 seasons, a Hall of Famer with nearly 1, 000 career wins, in knowing when to push hard in training and when to ease up. He firmly believes that, while weight training and   conditioning are vital, \u201cnothing gets you ready to play basketball like playing basketball. \u201d Auriemma has 11 national championships  \u2014   and is four victories shy of his 12th  \u2014   to validate his theory. UConn faces U. C. L. A. on Saturday in the semifinals of the Bridgeport (Conn.) Regional. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re fit is that we practice at an intensity that no one else does,\u201d said Amanda Kimball, the team\u2019s longtime strength and conditioning coach. \u201cTo maintain that intensity, it\u2019s important to make sure we\u2019re doing the right things in the weight room. \u201d UConn\u2019s brisk,   practices are designed to prepare the regulars to play 30 or more of a game\u2019s 40 minutes and to make quick and correct decisions when they are tired  \u2014   to be able to hit a shot, make an intricate pass and guard the opponent\u2019s top scorer in the closing minutes. \u201cTheir expectations are what you think you can\u2019t do,\u201d said Kyla Irwin, a freshman forward. To speed the pace of practices, a   shot clock is sometimes used instead of the   version used in games. Other times, four defenders hustle to guard six or seven shooters stationed around the perimeter and in the lane. One drill, involving three players at a time, requires each to run the length of the court, make a shot and return to the opposite baseline within 10 seconds. A similar drill, which includes an additional sprint to midcourt and back, must be completed within 17 seconds. As do other top women\u2019s teams, UConn also trains against male players who are not of varsity caliber but who might have had college careers at smaller programs. And there is much less stopping for instruction than when Auriemma, 63, was a younger coach. He now prefers continuous movement, comparing his practices to preparing a car for racing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to push this car to the limit so that when race day comes, we know what the limit is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do that every day. \u201d In the drill UConn calls Kansas, five players run the length of the court four times, rehearsing plays and fast breaks, and when they are winded, they conclude the exercise against a live defense. The drill can be repeated for 15 or 20 minutes. The   drill is a      exercise that lasts for five minutes as players rotate in and out. Afterward, the team runs from sideline to sideline for 30 or 60 seconds and immediately proceeds to a shooting drill called \u201c35,\u201d where the ball is not allowed to touch the court. \u201cWe do things to get us tired, and then when we get tired, we do things that require us to be mentally smart,\u201d said Kia Nurse, a junior guard who has hit a remarkable 15 of 19   attempts in this N. C. A. A. tournament. Compared to practice, Nurse said, \u201cThe game is much easier. \u201d As the fourth quarter begins, she added: \u201cThat\u2019s when your   kicks in that we\u2019re not tired. The other team might give up, but there\u2019s no chance that we are. \u201d Ideally, Auriemma would use eight players in his regular rotation, to keep his team operating efficiently and his stars satisfied with their playing time. A pet saying of his, attributed to Red Auerbach, the legendary Boston Celtics coach, is, \u201cIf you can\u2019t win with eight, you can\u2019t win with 88. \u201d For various reasons, including an N. C. A. A. rule that has required two transfers to sit out this season before becoming eligible, the current UConn team has only seven players whom Auriemma trusts to play regularly. Several began fall practice recovering from injury or surgery. None had been asked until this season to regularly make decisive plays at critical moments. So proper fitness has become even more urgent. Chris Dailey, Auriemma\u2019s top assistant coach for three decades, said the Huskies once tended to lift weights in the preseason and stop when the regular season began. Now, the players lift at least twice a week through the season to build or maintain strength. At this time of year, given the inevitable wear and tear after   games, weight training shifts from a focus on squats to dead lifts, using a chassislike device called a trap bar, to ease the stress on the players\u2019 backs. \u201cThat\u2019s why we always look so good at the end, because we\u2019re still getting stronger, or at least maintaining, where other teams are not lifting, possibly, or they\u2019re backing off because they want to stay fresh for the tournament,\u201d said Kimball, the strength and conditioning coach. Because UConn\u2019s season regularly extends to the Final Four in April, Kimball said, \u201cI can\u2019t detrain them the whole month of March. \u201d Twice a day, at breakfast and dinner, players are required to answer a brief questionnaire on an iPad. How much did you sleep? Are you sore? Where? Did you eat lunch? How difficult was practice? Are you fatigued? Meals are designed by Kimball and catered so that she can make sure players are getting the right nutrients. An hour before each game, players drink a shake with   carbohydrates it is designed to bolster their energy and stabilize   levels. For recovery after weight training, Kimball is a proponent of tart cherry juice to help reduce joint and muscle pain. She is also a massage therapist, which gives her additional interactions with players, and more chances to gauge their fitness. \u201cAll this sports science is going on, but a lot of what we do is art,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cIt comes from basically communicating with players. I see them multiple times a day. \u2018Hey, how are you doing? You feel good? Not so good?\u2019 It\u2019s just a lot of communication, a lot of trust. \u201d For training in the   and preseason, Kimball also has devised a diverse set of workouts: sprints using weighted sleds, spin classes, yoga and pool exercises that include running, plyometrics and relay races. At some point, Kimball wants to incorporate GPS technology, she said, but she noted that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t measure heart and intensity and passion to win. \u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t measure,\u201d she said, \u201cthat these girls might want it more than the other guys. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561664.6434577}
