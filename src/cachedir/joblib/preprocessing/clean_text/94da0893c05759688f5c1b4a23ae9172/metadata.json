Po-ta-toes!\u201d \\nINDIANAPOLIS, IN \u2013 Veterans Day is a time when our country comes together to honor our military service men and women who have sacrificed so much to protect our country. This year was no different at the VA hospital when 87-year-old Vincent Arnold, a veteran of three wars, was offered a complimentary serving of mashed potatoes in the cafeteria as a thank you for his 30 years of military service. \\nNormally, the \u201cPatriot\u201d combo meal includes 2 pieces of fried chicken , a side of mixed vegetables and a 12-ounce drink. On Veterans Day, all veterans are given a scoop of mashed potatoes free of charge. Purple Heart recipients are also given the option of brown or cream gravy as a special recognition for the physical suffering they endured while fighting for our freedom. \\n\u201cWe always make sure our veterans have a very special Veterans Day,\u201d stated hospital administrator Nathan Bishop while opening a box of miniature American flags that will be placed in every patient\u2019s room. \u201cWe pull out all the stops: stickers that say \u2018We Love Our Veterans\u2019; red, white, and blue crepe paper; and lots of smiles!\u201d They may even roll out those patriotic Pyxis machines again. \\nAt press time, witnesses reported seeing a Medal of Honor winner being given a T-shirt adorned with a billowing American flag and three bald eagles. 290 Shares '"}, "time": 1742562261.046054}
