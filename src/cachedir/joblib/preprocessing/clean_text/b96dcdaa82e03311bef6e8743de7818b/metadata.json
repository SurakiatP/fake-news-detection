[Jon Feere, the former legal analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, and Julie Kirchner, the previous executive director for the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR) have both been appointed to senior positions.  Feere, who work with the Trump campaign and transition team on immigration policy, will serve as the senior adviser to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency Director Thomas Homan. Kirchner, a campaign alum as well, will serve as the senior adviser to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. Center for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian told Breitbart Texas that the Trump Administration appointed a person who \u201cknows the ins and outs\u201d of immigration when they chose Feere to serve. \u201cICE needs somebody like Jon because he\u2019s worked on immigration policy for many years,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cAfter eight years of Obama, there were civil servants and people at ICE who weren\u2019t as quite up to date on immigration enforcement. \u201d FAIR spokesperson Ira Mehlman told Breitbart Texas that Kirchner\u2019s appointment is welcome news. \u201cThey\u2019re both people with long experience and deep knowledge and they\u2019re highly qualified for their positions,\u201d Mehlman said. Both the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR have long been advocates for increased border security, a wall, reforming foreign guest worker visas and lower levels of legal immigration to help American wages to rise. The appointments have come with the usual media backlash that the Trump Administration has grown accustomed to. CNN, for instance, has written that Feere and Kirchner\u2019s appointments have \u201calarmed\u201d the open borders lobby. The network propped up opposition to the appointments through the   Southern Poverty Law Center, with Director Heidi Beirich claiming that that the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR publish \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cxenophobic\u201d reports. Krikorian, though, said the open borders lobby is only outraged because they know how effective both nominees could be. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a complaint about qualification,\u201d Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. \u201cJon and these others know what they\u2019re doing and that\u2019s what the   groups are afraid of. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
