[Tamin Rahmani, 37, of Ramsgate (above right) Shershah Muslimyar, 20, of Canterbury, Rafiullah Hamidy, 24, of no fixed abode (above left) and Hamid Mohamadi, 18, from Wye were found guilty of three counts of rape, reports KentLive.  The jury returned their verdicts on Friday the 26th of May on all three charges against all four men. Verdicts were unanimous on all charges apart from two against the owner of the 555 Pizza takeaway, Rahmani, who received a guilty verdict on the two charges with a majority of 11:1. The court had heard that in the early hours of Sunday the 18th of September 2016, the girl, who had just turned 16, went into the takeaway to ask for help.  Owner Rahmani, and the other rapists who worked at 555 Pizza, instead led her to Hamidy\u2019s \u201cfilthy\u201d room above where she was pushed onto a \u201cgrubby mattress\u201d whilst the men physically restrained her and stood by the door \u201cso she knew there was no escape\u201d. The teen was then \u201cpassed around like an entertainment device\u201d by the \u201claughing\u201d men.  \u201cEvery single orifice had been penetrated by the group of men, while others watched, laughed and joined in themselves,\u201d prosecutor Simon Taylor told the court.  Mr. Taylor told the court the four men tried to plot and lie their way out of the evidence held against them.  All the four of the Afghans\u2018 DNA was found at the scene of the rape in Hamidy\u2019s room. Hamidy, an Afghan asylum seeker, claimed the sex with the girl was consensual before he fled to France and Italy after his immigration hearing was cancelled. He was later extradited to the UK.  The youngest rapist, Mohamadi, could be named by the media as it was found he was not 16, as he had claimed, but is believed to be 18.  Senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Richard Vickery said: \u201cThe victim in this case was a vulnerable teenage girl who was taken advantage of and subjected to some of the most horrendous crimes imaginable. \u201cIt was late at night, she was lost and she asked a group of men for directions. Instead they saw an opportunity to fulfil their depraved sexual desires and betrayed the trust she placed in them in the worst possible way. \u201cRape is an abhorrent crime and the victim has suffered a great deal of emotional harm from the ordeal she was forced to endure. She has displayed tremendous courage in reliving what happened to her, and I would like to personally thank her for having the strength to help bring her offenders to justice. \u201cThey clearly pose a significant danger to women and children and are fully deserving of the lengthy prison sentences they will surely now serve. \u201d A date for sentencing has not yet been confirmed but is not expected to be before July 17.'"}, "time": 1742562166.1215668}
