[The Orange County Register reported Wednesday that \u201cofficials suspect that some media outlets aren\u2019t satisfied with footage of naturally occurring shark sightings. \u201d It elaborated:  Long Beach lifeguard officials say they strongly suspect film crews are throwing fish or bait in the water near shore to attract sharks, also known as \u201cchumming. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten some reports from citizens who have seen recreational boats out chumming,\u201d Gonzalo Medina, Marine Safety chief, said. \u201cSome fishing boats too. They\u2019re trying to get video footage of the sharks. Some film crews are reportedly chumming within 100 yards of the shore. One official told the Register that authorities had stopped a National Geographic film crew: \u201cWe had a crew from National Geographic.   \u2026     We talked with them, and they were very receptive. Ultimately, they used rubber fish attached to a line that they could pull back in. \u201d The crew was not issued a citation, the Register reports. In late April, a woman was attacked and severely injured by a great white shark while swimming at San Onofre State Beach in Orange County. Since then, great white sharks have been spotted near the shore in Orange County and in Long Beach. Though it is not rare to see juvenile great whites in Southern California waters, it is unusual to see mature sharks, especially near the shore. The news reports have frightened many swimmers and surfers as the summer season begins. Now, it seems, media companies may be chumming the waters to create the very news they hope to report. Joel B.
