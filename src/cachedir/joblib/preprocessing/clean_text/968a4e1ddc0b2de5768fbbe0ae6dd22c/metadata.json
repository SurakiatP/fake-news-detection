The poll showed that 61 percent of American adults now oppose a ban. That level of opposition is the highest ever recorded. \\nIncreasing opposition to the 1990\u2019s-era gun ban isn\u2019t just limited to Republicans. Gallup\u2019s data show that opposition to the ban has increased across the board. Barely 50 percent of Democrats currently support the ban today, compared to 63 percent support from Democrats in 1996, just two years after the federal ban was signed into law. Less than a third of independents currently support a ban, while Republican support hovers at 25 percent.\""}, "time": 1742563975.3612437}
