Here\\'s the situation as reported by CBS News: An Associated Press analysis of early voting data in North Carolina shows blacks have cast 111,000 fewer ballots than at this point four years ago, when Obama lost the state by about 92,000 votes. Clinton aides note that GOP officials there reduced early voting sites for the initial week of early voting, and they say they can make up the difference by Election Day now that more sites are opening. Black voters\u2019 share of early ballots request is also down a few percentage points in Florida and Ohio, though the Clinton campaign points to strong early turnout in key urban counties with large numbers of blacks and Hispanics. \\nIt\\'s not as if Hillary Clinton is just sitting back, trusting that blacks will show up for her on Election Day. She\\'s attacking her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, calling him a threat to the black community. Again, from CBS News: Her [Hillary Clinton\\'s] campaign is broadcasting an ad on black-audience radio stations hailing the former secretary of state as \u201cfighting for us,\u201d in contrast to Trump \u201cdemeaning our community.\u201d A female voice in the ad says, \u201cListen to how he talks about us.\u201d One audio clip has Trump singling out a black supporter at a rally in California: \u201cLook at my African-American over here,\u201d he said. In another, Trump lambasted Obama as \u201cthe most ignorant president in our history.\u201d \\nThere is evidence, however, that some black voters are focused less on what Trump said about President Obama in a stump speech and more on what Clinton said about African Americans when she thought no one was listening. \\nBlack Conservatives Fund (BCF), a non-profit organization dedicated to representing the views of center-right African American voters, just launched a targeted paid media campaign intended to reach minority millennial voters in swing states who are still considering the qualities of the two major party candidates running for the White House. \\nTheir advertising features two spots highlighting Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s previous comments expressing contempt for black Americans, calling them \u201csuper-predators\u201d and claiming they\u2019d make up her \u201cfirewall\u201d against Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 primary. \\nThe ad, \u201cHillary Hates,\u201d features the candidate\u2019s 1996 comments where she was caught using racially divisive undertones to champion a bill that ultimately locked up a generation of black men. The ad also uses 2016 footage of her run-ins with Black Lives Matter protesters. \u201cWe\u2019re not just the only conservative group going after black voters on television \u2014 we\u2019re the only group, period,\u201d Black Conservatives Fund Senior Adviser Ali Akbar said. \\nWith a television buy in Ohio and North Carolina, the ad is supplemented by a sizable digital buy that spans across Facebook, Instagram, and smaller, highly targeted web publications. The cable time has been reserved across BET, CNN, ESPN, HGTV, and USA networks in these states. \\nThe digital ad buy stretches into at least three other states not being targeted on television. In total, the group has planned a six-figure commitment to their advertising campaign for the remainder of the 2016 general election, hoping to move the needle away from a candidate who, when the election isn\\'t days away, uses language to describe black voters that would cause substantial media furor if such statements were made by a Republican presidential hopeful. \\n\u201cMake no mistake: our aim isn\u2019t to suppress African American votes. Instead, we\u2019re telling black voters to make sure they participate in this election, but they need to remember what Hillary Clinton thinks of them,\u201d Akbar said. \u201cWe are confident that our message will have significant reach, since Democrats have neglected advertising to them this cycle.\u201d \\nAkbar\\'s message might be reaching the right homes, as even the New York Times has reported that early voting among blacks is down in key states and that this electoral anomaly might turn out to be \"canary in a coal mine\" indicating that black voters aren\\'t as monolithic or as easily duped as the Clinton campaign and the DNC thinks they are. From the Times article published on November 1: African-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election, creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Donald J. Trump with Election Day just a week away. As tens of millions of Americans cast ballots in what will be the largest-ever mobilization of early voters in a presidential election, the numbers have started to point toward a slump that many Democrats feared might materialize without the nation\u2019s first black president on the ticket. \\nFor its part, the BCF has not been a backer of Trump from the beginning. In fact, during the primary campaign, the group endorsed, contributed to, and made independent expenditures for Dr. Ben Carson and then Senator Ted Cruz. \\nSubsequently, BCF focused on down-ballot races and driving Hillary Clinton\u2019s negatives higher with black voters. The PAC has been recognized by outlets such as National Review for being one of the most efficient grassroots PACs. \\n\u201cOnce every four years the black community is courted then subsequently abandoned by Hillary Clinton Democrats,\u201d Akbar concluded. \u201cAmid numerous protests by black millennials against Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, the black vote was again taken for granted. No more.\u201d \\nDespite the valiant efforts of the BCF and other constitutionally minded, liberty-loving black voters, it is almost certain that Hillary Clinton will run away with the black vote by a substantial margin. \\nThat isn\\'t the issue, though. The issue is that we may be witnessing the early days of a generational shift by the African American community away from being a Democratic Party \"fire wall\" \u2014 as Clinton dismissively declared them \u2014 and toward being a voting bloc that doesn\\'t turn a blind eye to the disrespectful and dismissive way it has been treated by a Democratic Party that does little to improve the quality of life of this important and politically powerful minority.
