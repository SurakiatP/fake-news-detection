It also contains multitudes, not just of people and locations, but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car, an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that, in lean years, laid off everyone in her department except her. (More\u2019s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime, she shuttled between the province\u2019s pulp and paper mills, doing the job of six people, negotiating contracts for hotels, log loaders, harvesters and more. One year, when I was 25, I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns, and who called her by her English name, Matilda. We set out in her car, exploring the    of Vancouver Island, heading for the northern tip, Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight, the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother\u2019s terrible driving, and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island\u2019s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to \u201csmoke of the world,\u201d was taken into ownership  \u2014   both private and national  \u2014   by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  \u2014   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  \u2014   has meant that much of the community\u2019s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl\u2019s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island\u2019s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of \u201cDo Not Say We Have Nothing. \u201d Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake, halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill\u2019s daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the \u201cprisoners\u201d to fight oppression with noncooperation  \u2014   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake \u201cinvasion\u201d by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps\u2019 explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmers\u2019 unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant \u201c   \u201d with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the \u201980s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher\u2019s Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I\u2019ve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  \u2019s board. When the  \u2019s finances crashed with the   recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  \u2014   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I\u2019d made there and the dreams we\u2019d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the island\u2019s upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color they\u2019re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif. now, and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that I\u2019ve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family.

The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful,   turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, Yukon\u2019s capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape  \u2014   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  \u2014   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed \u201cParis of the North\u201d during the late   Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. \u201cIf you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,\u201d the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger,   chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the river\u2019s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they\u2019d heaved onto the shore, their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, I\u2019d been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we\u2019re a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. It\u2019s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me  \u2014   like most  \u2014   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. \u201cJust picking up my mail!\u201d he called.

His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and Opa\u2019s seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me \u201cSarah Nicole,\u201d while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but \u201cSarah. \u201d At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into \u201c   . \u201d This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane,   in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate Oma\u2019s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they\u2019re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my aunt\u2019s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive, freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that Opa\u2019s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bay\u2019s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, I\u2019d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I\u2019d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town\u2019s   barn, and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who\u2019d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn\u2019t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and others\u2019 looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I\u2019m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot. \u00c9lise Turcotte, a poet and novelist, is the author of \u201cThe Sound of Living Things\u201d and \u201cGuyana. \u201d Translated by Allison M.

J\u2019ai choisi la vall\u00e9e de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l\u2019est en Qu\u00e9bec, parce que j\u2019aimais la signification du nom donn\u00e9 par les Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 la baie: beaucoup d\u2019oiseaux aquatiques. D\u00e9j\u00e0, je voyais des oiseaux partout, dans mes r\u00eaves, autour de ma t\u00eate, derri\u00e8re les fen\u00eatres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger \u00e0 travers les champs de ma\u00efs. Cette r\u00e9gion me ramenait aussi \u00e0 mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon s\u00e9jour, j\u2019avais point\u00e9 mon doigt sur un petit village appel\u00e9 Mystic. Ce nom m\u2019attirait. J\u2019avais aussi d\u00e9couvert une ville homonyme aux   o\u00f9 il y avait, dans un mus\u00e9e, une salle d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les co\u00efncidences pour \u00e9crire. J\u2019inventais d\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 des liens entre Melville et le Mystic qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier lou\u00e9e, et ces d\u00e9fricheurs de territoires r\u00e9els et fictifs que sont les grands \u00e9crivains am\u00e9ricains du 19e si\u00e8cle. J\u2019imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange \u00e0 douze c\u00f4t\u00e9s, et cr\u00e9ais une num\u00e9rologie intime \u00e0 moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route, les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques, les maisons \u00e0 fa\u00e7ade victorienne je pensais \u00e0 la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord, aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine, \u00e0 tous ces immigrants ayant laiss\u00e9 leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu\u2019en m\u2019aventurant plus loin, aux abords du grand lac Memphr\u00e9magog, je penserais aussi aux d\u00e9serteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Ab\u00e9naquis des Premi\u00e8res Nations, qui ont donn\u00e9 les noms aux lacs et aux rivi\u00e8res, \u00e0 notre ignorance. \u00c0   l\u00e0 o\u00f9 mon s\u00e9jour commen\u00e7ait, j\u2019ai compris cependant que j\u2019\u00e9tais sur une route o\u00f9 chaque arr\u00eat menait \u00e0 un autre. Je suis entr\u00e9e dans le bureau du tourisme, j\u2019ai pos\u00e9 mille questions \u00e0 une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 sur la carte o\u00f9 se trouve Chemin   la deuxi\u00e8me plus belle route du Qu\u00e9bec. (Je n\u2019ai pas jamais appris o\u00f9 se situe la premi\u00e8re). Et je ne suis pas rest\u00e9e \u00e0 Mystic: d\u00e8s que j\u2019ai aper\u00e7u le vieux cimeti\u00e8re de Hunter Mills, c\u2019est la zone frontali\u00e8re entre le Qu\u00e9bec et les   qui m\u2019a fascin\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait l\u2019illustration de l\u2019\u00e9tat dans lequel je me trouvais, dans l\u2019esprit de l\u2019errance, \u00e0 la recherche de fant\u00f4mes, les miens, ceux des autres \u00e0 la recherche de mes mots, ma terre promise, ma maison construite pierre apr\u00e8s pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019appel\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u00e9journer dans un petit village, je me suis retrouv\u00e9e \u00e0 ramasser les grains d\u2019un chapelet de hameaux dispers\u00e9s sur le chemin de la fronti\u00e8re. Le d\u00e9cor que j\u2019y ai trouv\u00e9 m\u2019enchante toujours: villages enclav\u00e9s dans l\u2019ombre des montagnes, dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivi\u00e8res fermes et champs de ma\u00efs une Mercedes sur quatre blocs \u00e0 travers le d\u00e9barras devant une maison \u00e0 l\u2019abandon de vieux cimeti\u00e8res   qui surprennent \u00e0 chaque d\u00e9tour des arbres feuillus, \u00e9rables, noyers, \u00eatres, ch\u00eanes, bouleaux quelques croix de chemin d\u2019anciennes gares et \u00e9glises, de vieux postes de fronti\u00e8re et le matin, \u00e0 l\u2019auberge, un petit chat noir perch\u00e9 sur une branche d\u2019arbre \u00e9coutant le bruit des chutes et de la cafeti\u00e8re qui ronronne.'"}, "time": 1742564410.6716254}
