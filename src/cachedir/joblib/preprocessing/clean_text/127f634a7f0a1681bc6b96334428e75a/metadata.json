Mod-kl found this dissertation on the various troll techniques to be quite well written and very education. We think other members of the saker community would also enjoy it. by Anonymous How To Identify Trolls And Forum Spies (Cryptome) Cointelpro Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of an \u2018uncontrolled forum.\u2019 Technique #1 \u2013 \u2018Forum Sliding\u2019 If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum \u2013 it can be quickly removed from public view by \u2018forum sliding.\u2019 In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to \u2018age.\u2019 Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a \u2018forum slide.\u2019 The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a \u2018forum slide\u2019 and \u2018flush\u2019 the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then \u2018replying\u2019 to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting \u2018slides\u2019 down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 \u2013 \u2018Consensus Cracking\u2019 A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at http://www.abovetopsecret.com) is \u2018consensus cracking.\u2019 To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made \u2013 but the critical point is that it has a very weak premise without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is Imperative that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger \u2018evidence\u2019 or disinformation in your favour is slowly \u2018seeded in.\u2019 Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then \u2018abort\u2019 the consensus cracking by initiating a \u2018forum slide.\u2019 Technique #3 \u2013 \u2018Topic Dilution\u2019 Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a \u2018Resource Burn.\u2019 By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a \u2018gossip mode.\u2019 In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to \u2018drive in the wedge.\u2019 By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 \u2013 \u2018Information Collection\u2019 Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a \u2018show you mine so me yours\u2019 posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your \u2018favourite weapon\u2019 and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite \u2018technique of operation.\u2019 From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 \u2013 \u2018Anger Trolling\u2019 Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes \u2013 without the requirement to \u2018stage\u2019 a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to \u2018lead\u2019 the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you \u2018do not care what the authorities think!!\u2019 inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 \u2013 \u2018Gaining Full Con-trol\u2019 It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings \u2013 and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the \u2018ultimate victory\u2019 as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a \u2018honey pot\u2019 gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. Conclusion Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants do not know about them. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.
