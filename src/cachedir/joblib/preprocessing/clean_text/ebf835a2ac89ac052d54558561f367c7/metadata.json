In response, President Obama and members of Congress demanded that military officials more aggressively address the threat and its causes. Yet few military experts went as far as Donald J. Trump did Wednesday, when he suggested that the integration of women into the armed forces was an underlying cause of sexual assault. Speaking at a candidates\u2019 forum, Mr. Trump defended one of his Twitter posts from 2013 concerning the high number of sexual assaults in the military, and said that he had been \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d in posting a message that said, \u201cWhat did these geniuses expect when they put men  women together?\u201d The remarks drew criticism on Thursday from lawmakers and military experts, who said Mr. Trump had displayed ignorance of the Pentagon\u2019s   struggle to curb such assaults and the military justice system that is in place to prosecute them. \u201cThat\u2019s more than victim blaming, and it misunderstands the historical role of women in the military,\u201d said retired Col. Don Christensen, a former chief prosecutor of the Air Force. American women in the military have taken on expanded roles in recent years as the Pentagon has integrated them into more combat positions. But they have worked alongside servicemen since the Revolutionary War, and in significant numbers since World War II, something Mr. Trump did not acknowledge. Their roles have grown over the centuries from nurses, cooks and seamstresses, who maintained the camps of the Continental Army, to fighter pilots, soldiers, sailors and Marines who are battling the Islamic State in the Middle East and Afghanistan. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t run a military without women,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He noted that an argument that the proximity of women was to blame for sexual assault could be applied to women on college campuses and in workplaces, where they are also assaulted. \u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said. As the Pentagon has released more detailed records on the problem, the statistics reveal that sexual assault in the military is not just a problem faced by women. In 2014, the latest numbers available, the Pentagon estimated that 20, 300 servicemen and servicewomen were assaulted that year. \u201cOver half the victims are men,\u201d said Colonel Christensen, who is now the president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group. Of the estimated 20, 300 attacks in 2014 recorded by the Pentagon, roughly 10, 600 of the victims were men, though women faced a higher rate of assault given their lower overall numbers in the armed forces. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed solution of creating a military justice system to deal with sexual assault also puzzled national security experts. A military justice system has been in place in some form since the 1774 British Articles of War. It is an essential and distinct part of the military. \u201cGeorge Washington beat him to it!\u201d said Mr. Graham, who has worked as a military lawyer. That system and its laws, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, have in fact been at the center of a protracted battle in Congress over its role in adjudicating such crimes. One solution was first proposed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. She has pressed for a measure, opposed by top Pentagon leaders, that would take sexual assault cases outside the military chain of command and give military prosecutors the power to decide which cases to try, rather than keeping that authority with the accuser\u2019s own commander, as is the policy now. Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s logic  \u2014   and that of her supporters, including a number of victims\u2019 groups  \u2014   is that more men and women in the military would come forward to report crimes if they did not fear retaliation by those supervising them. The Pentagon\u2019s newest statistics also showed that a majority of victims did not report attacks. The Defense Department said that in 2014, only 6, 131  \u2014   under    \u2014   of attacks were reported. The 2014 statistics, which were based on a study conducted for the Pentagon by the RAND Corporation, a think tank, found that 62 percent of women who reported sexual assault said they had faced retaliation for doing so. The study, released in May 2015 and endorsed by the Pentagon, offered no comparable statistic for men. Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s efforts have been rebuffed in favor of more modest measures, including those written by Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, that stripped commanders of their ability to overturn jury verdicts and mandated dishonorable discharge or dismissal for anyone convicted of sexual assault. Other recent legislation guarantees that every sexual assault victim in the military receives an independent lawyer, known as a special victims\u2019 counsel, and assures a civilian review of any case in which a commander overrules a prosecutor seeking to   an accused offender. \u201cDonald Trump displayed a stunning lack of knowledge about how the military justice system works, the nature of sexual assault in the military or the dozens of systemic reforms that Congress has made to curb such crimes,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said on Thursday. Mr. Trump, pressed on Wednesday about whether his 2013 Twitter post was meant to suggest that women should not serve, said the solution was \u201cnot to kick them out. \u201d \u201cRight now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the report of rape, and nobody gets prosecuted. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on sexual assault in the military, like so many he has made on other topics, became instant campaign fodder. Matt Heinz, who is challenging Representative Martha E. McSally, Republican of Arizona and a former Air Force combat pilot, issued a news release on Thursday morning that said, \u201cVoters deserve to know if McSally will stick to her principles and denounce Donald Trump and his campaign. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564053.812854}
