The Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport said on Sunday that it would insist on modest dress by performers at   musical events after a singer said she was forced to leave the stage for wearing a bikini top at a beachside concert near here last week. The flap over skimpy swimwear here turned Europe\u2019s burkini debate on its head. A flash of skin on a beach in Tel Aviv, a cosmopolitan city on the Mediterranean, is hardly unusual  \u2014   Tel Aviv teemed with women sunbathing in bikinis over the weekend, just as it has for years. At the same time, there were also religious women, Muslim and Jewish, covered nearly entirely, a sight that caused none of the political and cultural uproar seen on the sands of the Riviera lately. But if the French local bans on the    burkinis illustrated an often libertine country\u2019s discomfort with conservative Muslim traditions, the decision by the Israeli authorities to weigh in on the side of more clothing reflected a different kind of cultural debate. With the influence of Orthodox Judaism having grown in the current government, Israel, a country whose culture was long dominated by secular elites, is struggling with its identity and values. The culture minister, Miri Regev, has been a driving force behind the debate, seeking to deny state money for institutions that do not express loyalty to the state and proposing to vet the music played by the army\u2019s radio station for its patriotism. Her ministry said Sunday that it was now acting to respect the sensibilities of those who might be offended by immodest attire at shows financed by the state. \u201cThe ministry\u2019s policy, led by the minister of culture, states that festivals and events which are funded by public money will honor the general public that attends the events, which includes all the various sectors and communities,\u201d Sivan Carmon, a ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement. The ministry intervened after a concert in Ashdod, south of Tel Aviv, on Friday took a surprise turn. Onstage was Hanna Goor, a singer known for her appearance on \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d a   Israeli reality television program featuring new vocalists. As she performed, Ms. Goor was wearing an unbuttoned shirt over a bikini top and shorts when, she said, a man from the production company contracted by the state approached her and told her to cover up. She said she had refused, only to have the man threaten to kick her off the stage. She sang another song anyway, then noticed the production company official return with a security officer, at which point she left the stage to avoid a confrontation. Ms. Carmon, the culture ministry spokeswoman, said by telephone on Sunday that Ms. Goor\u2019s attire was not appropriate for performing in front of the general public. Ms. Carmon denied that the singer had been forced offstage, but said that the program had been running late and that Ms. Goor\u2019s time had been cut short by maybe one song. In an interview on Sunday, Ms. Goor said she was only trying to stay cool in the late summer heat, and was dressed no different from many watching from the beach. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday noon,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is so sunny, so hot, I was only thinking about how tolerable it would be onstage. \u201d She said she was stunned by the objection to her clothing. \u201cThey made it such a big deal, and now there are new regulations they want to put on and force artists to be more modest,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right. I\u2019m against it, and I will speak my mind about it as much as I can. It\u2019s very important for me to sing the way I want to sing and get up on stage dressed how I want to dress. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563975.6195061}
