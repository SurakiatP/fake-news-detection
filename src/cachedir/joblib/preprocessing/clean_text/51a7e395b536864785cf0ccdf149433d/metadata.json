Before the interview began, Mr. Noah requested that the studio audience be polite to Ms. Lahren. \u201cImagine you\u2019re at Thanksgiving again, and your racist uncle walked in,\u201d he joked. Ms. Lahren hosts a nightly show, \u201cTomi,\u201d for The Blaze, a website, TV station and subscription service created by the conservative media personality Glenn Beck. And her reputation  \u2014   among supporters, detractors and her prodigious online following  \u2014   has been built on the commentaries with which she closes each show. A segment from August featuring an incendiary address to the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been watched on Facebook 66 million times. Ms. Lahren criticized Mr. Kaepernick, who had been protesting racial oppression by kneeling during the national anthem before games, pointing at unemployment and homicide rates, and saying that black people should take responsibility for their communities being run \u201cinto the ground. \u201d Ms. Lahren has also been critical of prominent black people like President Obama and Beyonc\u00e9 in commentaries that have gone viral. During the presidential campaign, she became one of the most visible young supporters of   Donald J. Trump, saying that she was using her show to speak for those who live between the coasts and \u201care too timid or too bashful or too busy to voice their own opinion. \u201d It is an approach that has made her a new media star, while also drawing the ire of critics who say her commentaries are often racist. Brendesha Tynes, a professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in addressing social media issues and cyberbullying, initially declined to comment on Ms. Lahren\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d appearance, saying, \u201cWe normalize racism when we give these folks a platform. \u201d She later elaborated, saying Ms. Lahren\u2019s appearance \u201csends a signal to our children and the world that facts don\u2019t matter, that hate is normal. \u201d It is likely that Ms. Lahren\u2019s audience has little crossover with Mr. Noah\u2019s. Ms. Lahren, whose name is pronounced \u201cTommy,\u201d seemed unfazed during her   conversation on politics and race with Mr. Noah, even as the audience booed and laughed at her. \u201cThere were some people in the audience that were just there to razz me,\u201d she said afterward, adding that she did not think she persuaded anyone in attendance with her arguments. At one point, she compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan. The next day, however, footage from the interview was popular online, prompting headlines like \u201cTrevor Noah Expertly Skewers Conservative Tomi Lahren\u201d from The Huffington Post, and \u201cTrevor Noah Thoughtfully Confronting Tomi Lahren on Racism on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 Might Be His Best Work Ever\u201d from New York magazine. There was speculation that Ms. Lahren and Mr. Noah could develop a friendly sparring relationship not unlike that of Bill O\u2019Reilly and Jon Stewart. Many conservative outlets praised Ms. Lahren\u2019s appearance. A headline on RedFlagNews. com read \u201cTomi Lahren Enters the Lion\u2019s Den, Takes On Trevor Noah on His Own Show. \u201d David Dennis Jr. a journalism professor at Morehouse College, was disappointed by reactions to the interview. \u201cPeople talked about it as if they were exchanging ideas and talking about beliefs  \u2014   like they were debating sports,\u201d he said, asserting that Ms. Lahren\u2019s words \u201care literally   to black people. \u201d When she said, for instance, that the Black Lives Matter movement aimed to murder police officers, \u201cpeople hear that and they believe that, and they see me as a threat,\u201d Mr. Dennis said, citing the death of Trayvon Martin. Ms. Lahren has frequently denied being racist. In interviews with The New York Times last week, she condemned the fringe movement known as the   which espouses white nationalism and   calling it \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and said she would never be \u201can advocate, a cheerleader or an apologist for the K. K. K. or any other hate group. \u201d Ms. Lahren, an only child born and raised in South Dakota by parents from ranching backgrounds, studied broadcast journalism and political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, graduating in 2014. She started working at The Blaze in October 2015, after piquing the network\u2019s interest with a viral video criticizing President Obama. In the interviews, Ms. Lahren spoke about issues that inspire her. There are numerous military veterans in her family, she said, including a grandfather who was a paratrooper in World War II and an uncle who was awarded the Purple Heart during Vietnam. Ms. Lahren spoke passionately about the hardships of being a soldier and of being related to one. She does not call herself spiritual  \u2014   \u201cSpiritual sounds like you worship the grass,\u201d she joked  \u2014   but said she believes in God and prays every night and when she runs, often asking \u201cto be a better person. \u201d But she also blasted organized religion as being \u201cabout hierarchy, power, control and greed. \u201d Minutes later, she said, \u201cThe institution of religion is important. \u201d She is   and does not object to gay marriage. She curses regularly, and professes to love junk food and the rappers Pusha T and Kendrick Lamar. She enjoys argument as sport and, as evidenced by her appearance with Mr. Noah, can be a talented sparring partner. She testified to her authenticity  \u2014   \u201cPeople like me because I\u2019m real\u201d  \u2014   but said of Mr. Noah and herself, \u201cWe both know that we have to play these parts. \u201d She mocks liberal \u201csnowflakes\u201d as being overly sensitive to   but says she is bothered when people use the word \u201cretard. \u201d Ms. Lahren says she is surprised when she meets black fans. Charlamagne Tha God, the host of the New   radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d is friendly with her. He does not think Ms. Lahren is racist, but \u201cmisinformed,\u201d he said in a phone interview. He enjoys her show, he said, identifying with Ms. Lahren\u2019s \u201cpolitical incorrectness. \u201d He stressed the importance of Democrats speaking directly to people like her. Still, he said, \u201cI have to remind myself that some of the rhetoric she puts out there is troubling. \u201d He said that in a recent conversation with Ms. Lahren, he questioned what he saw as her contradictory views. For instance, when he asked why she supported Mr. Trump, given the bigotry of some of his supporters, she said that a few bad apples did not represent the movement. \u201cSo you have to have that same respect with the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d Charlamagne recalled telling her. Ms. Lahren said she was an informal adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on its use of social media starting in August, and she appeared on the campaign\u2019s behalf via Facebook Live broadcasts in the final weeks before the election. She has about 3. 5 million followers on Facebook and over 800, 000 cumulatively on Twitter and Instagram. She is open to opportunities beyond The Blaze, including any that might involve Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment. While Ms. Lahren, a fan of the radio host Howard Stern and the rapper Eminem, often seems to enjoy causing controversy, at other times she is more conciliatory. She expressed hope that \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d would show an unfamiliar side. \u201cI find that when people are actually around me, it\u2019s impossible not to like me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople expect me to be angry, bitter. They expect to me be abrasive, aggressive. I\u2019m not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563382.9333572}
