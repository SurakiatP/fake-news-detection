He\u2019s Only a Child. \\nAndrew Anglin October 27, 2016 Click to enlarge \\nAs I\u2019ve said for a long time now, it appears that Neo-Nazi satirists have infiltrated the Jewish media and are using their positions to mock the insane depths to which Jew lies have sunk. \\nSeriously, if I was running the Guardian, I would absolutely run this on the cover: a picture of a 40-something Negro crying, with the headline that he\u2019s a child and a caption saying he\u2019s 16-years-old. \\nIf I was going to push it further than this, I would print the lyrics to Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cTears in Heaven\u201d in the sidebar. And I am predicting now that they are going to use this song in a video about Calais migrants having no where to go now that the French Nazis burned their camp. Or rather, now that they burned their own camp because the French Nazis told them they had to leave and it is \u201ctheir tradition\u201d ( IRL quote from French official ) to burn their homes when they leave them. \\nWould you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven? \\nI must be strong\u2018Cause I know I don\u2019t belong Here in heaven \\nWould you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven? \\nI\u2019ll find my way Through night and day\u2018Cause I know I just can\u2019t stay Here in heaven \\nTime can bring you down Time can bend your knees Time can break your heart Have you begging please, begging please \\nBeyond the door There\u2019s peace I\u2019m sure And I know there\u2019ll be no more Tears in heaven \\nWould you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would you be the same If I saw you in heaven? \\nI must be strong\u2018Cause I know I don\u2019t belong Here in heaven'"}, "time": 1742562630.7559674}
