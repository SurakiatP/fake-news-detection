It\u2019s like using \u201cTrace Route\u201d to map the path of all the packets on the network. In the program Treasuremap NSA has hundreds of trace route programs embedded in switches in Europe and hundreds more around the world. So, this set-up should have detected where the packets went and when they went there. \\nBinney has previously explained to us that a Russian hack would have looked very different, and that he thought the hack may have been conducted by an NSA employee who was upset at Clinton\u2019s careless handling of America\u2019s most sensitive intelligence. \\nThe former intelligence analyst, British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and chancellor of the University of Dundee (Craig Murray) \u2013 who is close friends with Wikileaks\u2019 Julian Assange \u2013 said he knows with 100% certainty that the Russians aren\u2019t behind the leaks. \\nMurray said today: \\n\u201cThe source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all. I discovered what the source was when I attended [a] whistleblower award in Washington. The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow .\u201d \\nProminent investment advisor and economic forecaster Martin Armstrong writes today: \\nAll our indications from behind the curtain are suggesting that there are many within the \u201cintelligence\u201d sector and \u201claw enforcement\u201d sector who are deeply troubled with the Clintons. They are trying to release documents and info to stop the Clinton Inc. Machine. That\u2019s all we can say on this topic right now. Suffice it to say, there is a real internal battle going on in Washington. \\nAnd the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under numerous administrations \u2013 both Democratic and Republican \u2013 (Steve Pieczenik ) said recently that a group of officers from various U.S. intelligence and military agencies have staged a \u201ccounter-coup\u201d to save America from corruption, and are the source of the leaked emails: \\nInteresting times, indeed \u2026'"}, "time": 1742628475.7674117}
