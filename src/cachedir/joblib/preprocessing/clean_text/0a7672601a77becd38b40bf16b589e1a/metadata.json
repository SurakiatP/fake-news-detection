Jewish human rights NGO has praised the Trump administration for taking the Iranian threat against the Jews and the Jewish state seriously as opposed to the Obama administration, which based its policy on \u201cwishful thinking. \u201d[\u201cThe Jewish people have learned the brutal lesson from the Nazi Holocaust, that when a leader threatens you with genocide you take such threats seriously,\u201d Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper  \u2014   the dean and associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center  \u2014   said in a statement. \u201cThe world, including many Jewish leaders, dismissed Hitler\u2019s early threats against the Jewish people as bombast.

This deal represents the same failed approach of the past that brought us to the current imminent threat we face from North Korea. The Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran. \u201d Watch a video of Tillerson\u2019s remarks below: '"}, "time": 1742563359.9741852}
