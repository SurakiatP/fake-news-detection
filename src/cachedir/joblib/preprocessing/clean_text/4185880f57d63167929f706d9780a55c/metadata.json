In her new book there is a poem called \u201cOde to Wattles,\u201d and it is about what you suspect it\u2019s about: the poet\u2019s \u201cface hanging down from the bottom of my face,\u201d the \u201cslackness of the drapery. \u201d In the mirror, Ms. Olds is shocked yet thrilled at her visage. Old age  \u2014   \u201cmy crone beauty, in its first youth\u201d  \u2014   has given her fresh subject matter, which she does not intend to waste. She writes: No one who has kept up with Ms. Olds\u2019s work needs to be told that she loves to be a little disgusting. As a writer, she\u2019s always gotten an illicit thrill from pushing boundaries, whether scrutinizing sex or motherhood or parents or illness (but sex especially). The critic Helen Vendler, not a fan, has called her work pornographic. The nimbleness and electricity of Ms. Olds\u2019s best sex poems, however, will not be denied. These poems declare, as vividly as did Janis Joplin: Honey, get it while you can. Ms. Olds, 73, has been on a fierce   run. Her last book, \u201cStag\u2019s Leap,\u201d about her divorce from her husband of many years, deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize in 2013. At around the same time, Ms. Olds took a small detour. She composed for Oprah magazine an article titled \u201cHeartbroken? 6 Ways to Pull Yourself Back Up. \u201d (Poets and listicles: no more of these, please.) Item No. 2: \u201cCarry a Power Hankie. \u201d This I hated to see, if only because one of the great things about Ms. Olds\u2019s verse is that she never seems to be carrying a hankie at all, much less a fancy hankie. She avoids sentimentality the way a runner on the beach zigs to avoid the foamy lips of waves. Her new book, \u201cOdes,\u201d picks up where \u201cStag\u2019s Leap\u201d left off, which is to say that it contains some of the best and most ingenious poems of her career. Some are about aging. There is \u201cOde of Withered Cleavage,\u201d for example, and \u201cHip Replacement Ode. \u201d There is also \u201cMerkin Ode,\u201d a merkin being a wig worn in the pubic region. These are on Ms. Olds\u2019s mind because, she writes, Her poems have long found their center of gravity at crotch level. They contain an awareness, too, that as Philip Roth contended in \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d the body\u2019s surface is \u201cabout as serious a thing as there is in life. \u201d Sex, for Ms. Olds, remains at the center of life and art. We have no finer laureate of the clitoris, which she likens in one poem here, in 10 of the more miraculous words that 2016 has produced, to the \u201c  biceps of a teeny goddess who is buff. \u201d She describes the hymen as Her poem \u201c  Ode\u201d performs a service by containing a history lesson for millennials. It begins: She does, of course, go on, and suggests: \u201clet\u2019s take some   the creepiness of how women were   the 1950s. \u201d Ms. Olds has sometimes being criticized for being   for narcissism run amok. I see no logic to this sort of censure, agreeing with Philip Larkin, who said in an interview, \u201cA very crude difference between novels and poetry is that novels are about other people and poetry is about yourself. \u201d Ms. Olds renders the personal universal. There is a good deal of lesser work in \u201cOdes. \u201d When Ms. Olds\u2019s poems miss, they really miss, more so than most poets at her level. Her \u201cOde to the Penis,\u201d for example, contains these lines: \u201cI   you\u2019re lovely and brave, and so interesting, you   like a creature, with your head, and trunk, as if you have a life of your own. \u201d Or perhaps male poets have condescended for so long to the clitoris that this is her revenge. There are other topics besides sex and death in \u201cOdes. \u201d There are odes to buttermilk and composting toilets and other poets (Stanley Kunitz, Galway Kinnell) and pine trees and sick couches and Sloan Kettering. The book\u2019s warmth comes from the intensities of its language and the intensities that emerge from a life that seems well lived. In a poem about her living friends, she writes: \u201cYou were exactly who I\u2019d   looking for, without daring to imagine. \u201d At their best, you can say the same thing of this writer\u2019s poems. No power hankie required.'"}, "time": 1742561675.2279165}
