You seriously need to be put over someone\u2019s knee. \\nYou are running for the highest leadership position in this country and you are carrying on like a spoiled little toddler, stomping your feet and throwing temper tantrums and hollering all over social media. Hollering things like \u201cStop calling me names!\u201d\u201cI hate you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being mean to me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling my mommy!\u201d are not things that an adult man does \u2013 those are things that a toddler does. \\nHere is a prime example : \u201cIn what is now a familiar pattern, Donald Trump took to Twitter following his interview in order to trash the interviewer and whine about how the questions were supposedly stacked against him.\u201d \\nGuess what? Running this country is HARD. It isn\u2019t for whiners. Not once have I heard President Obama whine about you running him through the ringer about his birth certificate. Not once have I heard him whine when people in public office have disrespected him. Not once have I heard him whine when Congress has voted against his programs simply because he is a black man and they don\u2019t like him. Not once in almost seven years has that man whined that Fox News has said something bad about him. Not once. Let that sink in. \\nI ain\u2019t your mommy, but I am a mom. Nothing more \u2013 Just A Mom. I have a normal kid. But for a few minutes here I\u2019m going to pretend you\u2019re my son because you really seem to need a mom\u2019s advice. When my kid has a temper tantrum, she gets sent to her room. When she can talk calmly to adults, she is allowed to come out and we discuss what she did wrong. \\nI\u2019m thinking that maybe no one ever did that for you. No one ever said \u201cNo\u201d to you. You never got a spanking, literally or figuratively. \\nYou are acting like an insufferable ass. The United States is not a dictatorship. It is not a corporation that you can run into the ground and file bankruptcy on. It is a democratic government that is set up with three distinct branches of government. Those three branches of government are designed to act with a series of checks and balances to ensure that no one person has the authority or the ability to make horrid decisions, treat people in a sucky way, and waste our tax dollars on frivolities. \\nHere is a link to a children\u2019s website , where they spell it out at a level that even you should be able to comprehend. \\nBy saying \u201c We\u2019ll see \u201c every time the interviewer reminded you of this system of checks and balances you displayed your ignorance of how our government works. My 12-year-old knows more about government than you appear to. \\nThis is not a media circus for you to use to continue pumping hot air into the atmosphere. Global climate change is already a problem and your constant bloviating is causing more detrimental effects than the farting cows. Stop treating this campaign like your very own little playground. It isn\u2019t. Our government is a democracy \u2013 that means that if hell freezes over and you do somehow manage to gain the presidency you work for us, the people of this country. \\nHere\u2019s a thought \u2013 instead of building a wall that will cost billions, why don\u2019t you propose an amnesty program that could be enacted for a couple million? The sheer cost of deporting millions of people, only to turn around and let them back in \u2018legally\u2019 is an astronomical burden to place on already over-burdened tax payers. It is also the DUMBEST idea I have ever heard. Does having all that money remove any shred of common sense? Do you possess any ability to think reasonably? \\nYou would be amazed at how many cost-cutting things can be enacted if you think about them and come up with common sense solutions. The end goal is what you want to accomplish. \\nSince your fellow Republicans are going to be the biggest stopping block on any type of an amnesty program \u2013 sell them on what they stand to GAIN from doing this as opposed to booting everyone out and building an asinine wall. \\nYou can\u2019t just think about \u201cThe Donald\u201d and how he feels about things. You have to consider each and every person in this country. You have to take our tax dollars and use them in the best way possible to make life better for us. This isn\u2019t all about you. You\u2019re just a potty-mouthed little boy that needs a bar of soap to wash your mouth out and a time-out to reflect on your actions lately. \\nYou can\u2019t act like a spoiled little toddler if you expect to be taken seriously as a GOP presidential candidate. You need to stop that silliness right now. Get your head out of your ass and look around. You have no clue how to run a government. If you want to continue acting like a toddler, no one will ever take you seriously. The voters in this country will not subject themselves to being ruled by a spoiled brat. \\nGrow up, Donald.'"}, "time": 1742562206.3491328}
