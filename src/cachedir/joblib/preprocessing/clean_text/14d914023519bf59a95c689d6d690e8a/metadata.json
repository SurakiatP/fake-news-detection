The meddling will continue as George Soros uses his money to break the United States into factions of fighting, angry and unruly mobs with different pet obsessions. \\nWith enough starter money, and Soros has it, they figure that civil unrest and absolute chaos can be drawn out of the resentment and disenfranchisement already felt by many. The weight of economic collapse, which could come any time that the Federal Reserve chooses to raise interest rates, or through many other catalysts, would add serious fuel to that fire, and make nationwide riots and widespread conflict almost inevitable. Can Trump fend off these destructive tendencies in our nation and its enemies battling from within? \\nSoros and Liberal Mega-Donors are Plotting to Resist Trump Behind Closed Doors \\nby Joseph Jankowski\\nGeorge Soros and other liberal mega-donors are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed-door meeting where they will discuss opposing Trump\u2019s plan for his first 100 days in office. \\nAccording to Politico , the meeting, which began on Sunday night at Washington\u2019s Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club and will include darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison.\\nPolitico reports:\\nThe meeting is the first major gathering of the institutional left since Trump\u2019s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in last week\u2019s presidential election, and, if the agenda is any indication, liberals plan full-on trench warfare against Trump from Day One. Some sessions deal with gearing up for 2017 and 2018 elections, while others focus on thwarting President-elect Trump\u2019s 100-day plan , which the agenda calls \u201ca terrifying assault on President Obama\u2019s achievements \u2014 and our progressive vision for an equitable and just nation.\u201d \\nYet the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing their approach to politics \u2014 and the role of the Democracy Alliance, or DA, as the club is known in Democratic finance circles. The DA, its donors and beneficiary groups over the last decade have had a major hand in shaping the institutions of the left, including by orienting some of its key organizations around Clinton, and by basing their strategy around the idea that minorities and women constituted a so-called \u201crising American electorate\u201d that could tip elections to Democrats.\\nThe Democracy Alliance has fed upwards of $500 million toward liberal activist groups and candidates since Soros co-founded the group in 2005.\\nAll members of DA are required to give $200,000 a year to recommended activist groups and pay annual dues of $30,000 to fund the DA staff and its meetings.\\nGara LaMarche, the president of the DA, told donors Sunday evening that some reassessment is in order for the Democratic party. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose an election you were supposed to win, with so much at stake, without making some big mistakes, in assumptions, strategy and tactics,\u201d LaMarche said, according to prepared remarks he provided to Politico .\\nLaMarche would add that the reassessment \u201cmust take place without recrimination and finger-pointing, whatever frustration and anger some of us feel about our own allies in these efforts,\u201d and he said \u201cIt is a process we should not rush, even as we gear up to resist the Trump administration.\u201d\\nWhile focusing on preserving ObamaCare and other achievements of the Obama administration that are threatened by a Donald Trump presidency, the DA\u2019s agenda includes panels on rethinking polling and the left\u2019s approach to winning the working-class vote. The group will also stress funneling cash into state legislative policy initiatives and races where Republicans took over last week.\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said his first 100 days will be dedicated to restoring \u201chonesty, accountability and change to Washington\u201d through the following seven steps:\\nA Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress A hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health) A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated A five-year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service A lifetime ban on the White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections Cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America\u2019s water and environmental infrastructure Billionaire George Soros immediately had fingers of blame pointing at him for the anti-Trump riots and protests that swept the nation since Nov. 9, as his group MoveOn.org has organized most of them .\\nThe billionaire committed $25 million to boosting the Clinton campaign and other Democratic candidates and causes in 2016.\\nThis article was written by Joseph Jankowski and originally published at PlanetFreeWill.com . \\nJoseph Jankowski is a contributor for PlanetFreeWill.com .
