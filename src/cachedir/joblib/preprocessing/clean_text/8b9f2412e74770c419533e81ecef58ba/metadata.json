Moore, like Trump, understands the pulse of the people, though they differ in just about every other way.\\nThis election represents a pivotal point, and an end of the line for the deal that people once held with their leaders. After decades of broken promises and deals to sell them short and sell them out, people have had enough.\\nTHAT\u2019S what this election is about.\\nRight or wrong, Trump represents a rebuke of the system \u2013 as Moore calls it, the ultimate \u201cF\u2013\u2013\u2013 You\u201d ever directed at the system.\\nIf you make this go viral, Trump will win. It\u2019s 4 minutes that makes the choice in this election crystal clear. #EarlyVoting pic.twitter.com/UOgqSfet6a \\n\u2014 Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) October 25, 2016 \\n\\nHere\u2019s some of what he said in an epic rant (reportedly excerpted from his rush-election film Trumpland) that is strangely validating of Trump\u2019s entire campaign:\\nWhether Trump means it or not, it\u2019s kind of irrelevant because he\u2019s saying the things that people who are hurting. And it\u2019s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re not racists or rednecks, they\u2019re actually pretty decent people. So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.\u201d\\n[\u2026]\\nDonald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody\u2019s going to buy them. \\nIt was an amazing thing to see. No politician \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 had ever said anything like that to these executives. It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about.\\nHe is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th \u2014 Election Day \u2014 although they have lost their jobs. Although they\u2019ve been foreclosed on by the bank. Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The car\u2019s been repossessed. They haven\u2019t had a real vacation in years. They\u2019re stuck with the shitty Obamacare bronze plan. They can\u2019t even get a f**king percocet.\\nThey have essentially lost everything they had\u2026except one thing. The one thing that doesn\u2019t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution: the right to vote.\\n[\u2026] So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever \u2014 or felt pen or touchscreen \u2014 and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. \\n[\u2026]\\nThey see that the elites who have ruined their lives hate Trump.\\nCorporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The Media hates Trump\u2026\\nThe enemy of my enemy is who I am voting for on November 8th.\\nTrump\u2019s election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history. \\nAnd it will feel good.\\nWhat red-blooded American, working stiff or laid off schmo wouldn\u2019t want to stick it to the establishment and rebuke the very system that brought them to this point? After all, it is their fault.\\nPeople have been hurting and in decline for eight long years \u2013 and for all his smiles and posturing, Obama hasn\u2019t done a damned thing. And Hillary can\u2019t even pretend.\\nThe people who will be deciding the popular vote in this election want to take down that system and put someone in who will \u2013 once and for all \u2013 stand up for them. Basically, Americans want revenge.\\nWhat the electoral college decides is another matter altogether, of course.\\nRead more: \\nEPIC RANT: Fed Up American Explains Why Trump Will Win: \u201cSomebody With Balls\u201d \\nNo One Can Stop Her\u2026 And She Knows It: \u201cThis Election Won\u2019t Be Fair\u201d \\nProtesters Rage Against the DNC: \u201cHillary Didn\u2019t Get the Nomination.
