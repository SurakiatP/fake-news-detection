According to the Brennan Center , this legislation would also guarantee that voter-registration information is moved on to election officials electronically, which will reduce errors in the voting process. \\nHowever, Merrill says that he stands opposed to this initiative because it \u201ccheapen[s] the work\u201d of civil rights activists, adding that \u201cjust because you turned 18 doesn\u2019t give you the right [to vote].\u201d \\n\u201cThese people fought, some of them were beaten, some of them were killed because of their desire to ensure that everybody that wanted to had the right to register to vote and participate in the process,\u201d Merrill explained in an interview with the voting rights initiative, Answering the Call . \\nHe then went on to reference several civil rights leaders, like Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who Merrill claimed called him a friend. \\nMerrill continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to embarrass them by allowing someone that\u2019s too sorry to get up off of their rear end to go register to vote \u2026 because they think they deserve the right because they turned 18.\u201d \\nThe jackass then went on to say that automatically registering teen voters to be able to exercise their right to vote is \u201cno different than giving them a trophy because they played on the ball team. You only get a trophy if you win!\u201d \\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a sorry, lazy way out and it shows no initiative.\u201d \\nAlabama joins 14 other states who have enacted new voting restrictions ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The Brennan Center says that these actions are designed to \u201ccurtail voting rights.\u201d \\nThe New York Times reported last year that the restrictions Alabama put in place included a photo ID law, which makes having a government issued ID mandatory to participate in the voting process. \\nThe biggest problem with these identification laws is that many older and poorer citizens are faced with hardships when it comes to obtaining the necessary paperwork needed to get a government I.D. Many states also structure the office hours of their DMV services and polling locations to discourage people further from voting. \\nThe bottom line is that Republicans love low voter turn out because they can\u2019t convince the vast majority of Americans that their ideas are good for the country. \\nFeatured image via YouTube .'"}, "time": 1742564262.6339734}
