[\u201cThe Syria situation is one that is fraught with peril, as I see it, for the United States at this particular moment in time,\u201d Gaffney explained. \u201cBecause President Trump seems sorely tempted  \u2014   and I think that tempting is not simply a function of the usual suspects, people who have been horrified by the humanitarian crisis there, the people there who think that it will be resolved, or at least diminished, by bringing Heaven knows how many refugees from Syria here and the like  \u2014   but now from his own national security team that we must get involved, we must inject ourselves into the crisis in Syria. \u201d  \u201cI think that\u2019s folly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m indifferent to the suffering of the people there. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t see a good solution for, frankly, either the people of Syria or their neighbors or for us by making America part of this civil war. \u201d Gaffney said his specific concern is that \u201cthe idea that Assad is Hitler or something akin to him and must go, and Russia must help with that, raises, inevitably, the question: so what do we want there next?\u201d \u201cThe choices, unfortunately, seem to be more of the same. At best, it\u2019s an   supported by the Russians, supported presumably by the Iranians, supported by Hezbollah. Or, alternatively, it\u2019s sharia supremacists of the Sunni stripe supported by the Saudis, supported by the Turks, supported by perhaps   or the Islamic State, or simply the Muslim Brotherhood. All very bad choices, in my judgment,\u201d he said. Gaffney noted Russia has some concrete interests in Syria, including a   port in the Mediterranean.  \u201cThey have had the use of an airfield there as well. It\u2019s been sort of a foothold for most of this period, certainly since \u201967,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been pretty much it for the Russians. They kind of lost their client relationship with the Egyptians. The United States became the dominant power in the Middle East. That base was important, and it remains so today. I think it\u2019s been an incredibly critical vehicle for Putin to   himself, not just into Syria, but into the Middle East more generally during the Obama years. So it\u2019s a big deal, certainly, for the Russians. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s been the difference between holding on to power, perhaps even   his claim to much of Syria, and either death at the hands of the mob, as Qaddafi experienced, or exile for Bashar Assad,\u201d he added. Marlow noted the lack of consistency in comments from various Trump administration sources about Syria, making it difficult to judge if removing Assad from power is an active goal of the United States or how much military involvement with Syria might be on the horizon. \u201cPutting the best face on it, Alex, as you know, Donald Trump indicated that he was going to be unpredictable to our allies, and most especially to our enemies overseas,\u201d Gaffney replied. \u201cHe thought that that was a virtue. And arguably it is, at least in a tactical sense. \u201d \u201cBut what you\u2019re describing is part of what worries me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that in the absence of clarity about what we\u2019re doing, you may well see the president do what he did last week  \u2014   which is on the basis, it seems as much as anything, of the horrific imagery on television of children being gassed, he decided he was going to depart from what he said repeatedly was going to be his policy and inject himself at least in that very tactical way, in retaliation against the gas attack. \u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the kicker: the president is perilously close in some of these comments, particularly by some subordinates, to embracing what the Obama administration actually formally embraced, which is the   \u2018duty to protect\u2019 that is a formula for having the United States essentially become, if not the policeman of the world, the punisher of bad people around the world, without regard for the vital interests of the United States and the other demands on our resources  \u2014   military and economic and so on,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis is a moment for real care to be exercised,\u201d Gaffney advised. \u201cI think, as usual, I find myself much more sympathetic to the views that we\u2019re hearing attributed to Steve Bannon, who seems to be kinda holding back on some of this stuff. But let\u2019s face it, pressure is on from General McMaster, the national security adviser General Mattis, the secretary of defense, and others  \u2014   certainly the whole coterie of Obama holdovers who would love to see this president become embroiled in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. \u201d Marlow asked about rumors that President Trump\u2019s decision to strike the Syrian airbase was influenced by emotional responses to pictures of suffering Syrian children from members of his family. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that that\u2019s not a perfectly responsible and even humane reaction to the horrors that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cIt\u2019s just to say, is it consistent with our national interests? I think keeping people from using weapons of mass destruction is consistent with our national interests, and I think that\u2019s sort of the underlying rationale beyond that humanitarian response. But we\u2019ve got to be thinking more strategically. \u201d \u201cLet me just throw one idea out that I think it\u2019s high time we begin to address,\u201d he offered. \u201cThere is in this mix that I mentioned mostly bad actors. There\u2019s a group that has generally been very responsible, very helpful to us and I think a force for good in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. And that\u2019s the Kurds. \u201d  \u201cI think one of the things that, as the administration thinks strategically about what the end state is that they\u2019d like to see, everything ought to be on the table, as they say. One is redrawing the maps to recognize reality. There is no homeland for the ethnic population that is arguably the largest dispossessed people in that part of the world, namely the Kurds,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cI personally think the President of the United States ought to be thinking about a Kurdistan in at least the parts of Syria  \u2014   and maybe even Iraq or Iran for that matter  \u2014   that are Kurdish, that have the opportunity or the basis for being safe havens for minorities that are currently very much at risk and are being helped by the Kurds,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThis is a place where some creative thinking is warranted and might actually have a strategic value, whereas just responding   to the humanitarian crisis du jour is a formula for squandering resources and lives, probably American ones. \u201d \u201cIf we wind up embracing the Obama and U. N. idea of a \u2018responsibility to protect,\u2019 all bets are off on an America First sort of approach, either to national security or to rebuilding on the home front because there is no end of    people in all kinds of places,\u201d Gaffney warned. \u201cI think the president is now being buffeted by individuals who have come in who apparently do not agree with his priority of defeating radical Islamic terrorism, as he calls it, and who have, instead, have the view that we should align ourselves with people who are the prime movers behind radical Islamic terrorism. That would include, by the way, the Saudis. It would include the Turks. It would include the Qataris and others in the region. I think that\u2019s a grave concern,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the idea that the president is going to transform the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans into benign actors through the force of our diplomacy or through our various emissaries going there and telling them what to do, is unlikely as well,\u201d he judged.  \u201cHis planned and, I think, necessary focus on rebuilding what he called \u2018peace through strength\u2019  \u2014   my old boss Ronald Reagan\u2019s philosophy of how to protect the United States  \u2014   is the way forward. You can begin to perhaps moderate others\u2019 behavior by demonstrating that you have the will, you have the capacity to be a formidable adversary, and not have to use that force or that coercive pressure on the ground,\u201d Gaffney said. He added a prediction that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s visit to Moscow would be \u201can early indicator of: is he going to be approaching that job as he did his last one, which is, essentially, as a guy who\u2019s going to figure out how to do the bidding of the Russians  \u2014   or is he going to be helping the President of the United States really institute this notion that America is a formidable force, and Putin is best advised not to be screwing around with us?\u201d \u201cAgain, the philosophy of peace through strength in practice  \u2014   watch for it, hopefully, in Moscow,\u201d Gaffney concluded.
