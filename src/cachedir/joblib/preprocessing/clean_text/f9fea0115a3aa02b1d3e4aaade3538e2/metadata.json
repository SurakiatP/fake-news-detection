The Federal Government is planning to implement extensive regulations on real estate loans. Among other things, debtors will be required under certain circumstances to repay their loans within a given period. The Federal Government said on Monday that the draft law should be followed by recommendations from the German Committee on Financial Stability. \\nWhile there is no real estate bubble right now, it appears they are concerned about further capital inflows, perhaps caused by the failed euro. The new hurdles to be imposed for new loans may have the negative impact of making sales of property in Germany far more difficult as a whole. Such schemes have tended to have a negative impact upon price.'"}, "time": 1742628440.2005985}
