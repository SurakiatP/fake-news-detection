I guess we can call that progress. Problem is, whatever the size of Bee\u2019s audience, there is still an audience. Which she lied to. Par for the course in leftist circles, but this one needs a rebuttal. Samantha Bee said \u201cPartial birth abortion\u201d is not a thing, while she ranted and raved at Donald Trump for his comments in the final debate . Sorry, Sammy. Partial birth abortion is sadly a thing\u2026 \\nHere\u2019s what I find interesting: Bee\u2019s need to explain away partial birth abortion shows just how unpopular the procedure is. She\u2019s trying to get rid of it. Not unlike a woman hoping to chop shop her unborn baby . Of course she stops short of saying \u201cit\u2019s a heinous, evil thing for people to do to their own children,\u201d by excusing the sick, evil, twisted women (and the \u201cdoctors\u201d who perform the butchery) who make it happen. Sorry, there is no reason to suck the brains out of a partially born baby for the \u201chealth of the mother,\u201d or \u201cif the baby has a terminal disease.\u201d \\nAbortion is always wrong. Like, always. \\nBecause chopping up a baby while it\u2019s partially hanging out of the mother, its head still in the birth canal, because it\u2019s \u201cgoing to die anyway\u201d makes sense. If you agree with killing a baby like this, for any reason, you\u2019re sick. Probably a little bit evil.
