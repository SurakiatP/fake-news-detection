Die #feelingbetrayed,\u201d wrote one livid internet user in English. \\nCalls for a government inquiry to be launched have been growing in momentum this morning with Twitter user @Gra32 summing up everyone\u2019s feelings. \\n\u201cIs this some sort of sick joke?\u201d @Gra32 queried. \\nAt the time of this article\u2019s publication, Col\u00e1iste Lurgan has yet to apologise.'"}, "time": 1742563727.068581}
