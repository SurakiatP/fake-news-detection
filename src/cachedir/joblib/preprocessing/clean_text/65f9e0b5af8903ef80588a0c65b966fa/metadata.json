[\u201cNot only did Obama tap Trump\u2019s phones, he stole the strawberry ice cream out of the mess locker,\u201d King wrote in the first of three Tweets Saturday.  Not only did Obama tap Trump\u2019s phones, he stole the strawberry ice cream out of the mess locker.  \u2014   Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 4, 2017,  Obama tapped Trump\u2019s phones IN PERSON! Went in wearing a Con Ed coverall. Michelle stood guard while O spliced the lines. SAD!  \u2014   Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 4, 2017,  Trump should know OBAMA NEVER LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE! He\u2019s in the closet! HE HAS SCISSORS!  \u2014   Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 4, 2017,  On Saturday, the president claimed that Obama had   the phone in his office in Trump Tower before the election, comparing the alleged incident to Richard Nixon\u2019s conduct during the Watergate scandal. Is it legal for a sitting President to be \u201dwire tapping\u201d a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017,  I\u2019d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017,  How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is  . Bad (or sick) guy!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017,  A representative for Obama has strongly denied the claim. The    author  \u2014   awarded the National Medal of Arts by Obama in 2015  \u2014   has been a frequent and outspoken critic of Trump since well before the election. In December, King tweeted that he would no longer tweet about Trump. \u201cThat anyone in America would even CONSIDER voting for this rabid coyote leaves me speechless,\u201d he wrote then. In May, the Carrie author joined hundreds of other prominent authors in signing an open letter \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemning Trump\u2019s candidacy. The following month, King told Rolling Stone that he was \u201cdisappointed in the country\u201d after Trump claimed the Republican nomination. \u201cI think that he\u2019s sort of the last stand of a sort of American male who feels like women have gotten out of their place and they\u2019re letting in all these people that have the wrong skin colors. He speaks to those people,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cTrump is extremely popular because people would like to have a world where you just didn\u2019t question that the white American was at the top of the pecking order,\u201d he added.
