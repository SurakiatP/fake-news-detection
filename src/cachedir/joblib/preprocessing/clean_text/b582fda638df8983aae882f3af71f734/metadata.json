[Lara Trump\u2019s animal rights partner did 6 y in fed prison 4 harassing  stalking researchers. https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Darren Samuelsohn (@dsamuelsohn) May 29, 2017,   \u201cEric Trump\u2019s wife has publicly aligned with a controversial animal rights group,\u201d Samuelsohn writes, \u201cthe Beagle Freedom Project, whose leadership includes a felon who served a   sentence in federal prison for harassing and stalking researchers. \u201d The connection, he asserts, \u201cbrings political risk. \u201d Said felon, Kevin Chase (n\u00e9e Kjonaas) was sentenced in 2006 and released from prison in 2011. And while there is no defending the acts which led to Chase\u2019s conviction, Samuelsohn employs little more than innuendo to link them to BFP. \u201cLara Trump\u2019s support for the Beagle Freedom Project has alarmed researchers and leaders from the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d Samuelsohn writes, \u201cas well as other animal rights organizations who say studies involving dogs and cats are well regulated by the federal government. \u201d BFP advocates for state laws forcing animal testing facilities to put research animals up for adoption instead of euthanizing them and performing more tissue tests  \u2014   as well as encouraging individuals to rescue said animals. The group has partnered with celebrities such as Maria Menounos, Whitney Cummings, Corey Feldman, Amy Smart, Sia Furler, and Miley Cyrus in the past. Samuelsohn acknowledges that the only controversial element of BFP is Chase\u2019s criminal history. \u201cThe Beagle Freedom Project\u2019s stated goals are more mainstream\u201d than his past groups, the Animal Liberation Front and Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, he writes. He also notes that the org received a $500, 000 contest reward from Microsoft  \u2014   even after critics brought up Chase\u2019s past. Samuelsohn did not answer an email asking if it was his idea or an editor\u2019s assignment to veer from his White House beat to cover the loose association between a   activist and a New     to the President.'"}, "time": 1742628553.152827}
