But when challenges to China\u2019s sovereignty come up  \u2014   like protests in Hong Kong  \u2014   he roars to life. \u201cHe read flatly from the script,\u201d one Western official said of such a meeting. \u201cBut when it got to China\u2019s core interests, these disputes, he put down his notes and spoke passionately. \u201d For anyone puzzling over why China reacted so swiftly and severely to block two   politicians from taking their seats in Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, Mr. Xi\u2019s expansive idea of sovereignty is a good place to start. \u201cHe lets you know that this is what really matters,\u201d said the Western official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a   meeting with Mr. Xi. China\u2019s Communist   National People\u2019s Congress stepped in on Monday and effectively barred the two from taking office, saying they had slurred Beijing in their oath of office. The politicians, Sixtus Leung and Yau   were elected to the Hong Kong Legislative Council in September on a   platform. In taking their oaths last month, they substituted a word for China that is widely seen as derogatory, and Ms. Yau added a common obscenity. There were other, less draconian ways to resolve the impasse. Mr. Leung, known as Baggio, and Ms. Yau, for instance, agreed to retake their oaths properly. The president of the council said it should decide its own affairs. Even Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, a loyal supporter of Beijing, was willing to leave the decision to Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary. But that was not to be. \u201cWhat could have been handled in a moderate fashion,\u201d said Michael C. Davis, a former law professor in Hong Kong who is now a researcher in Washington, \u201cbecame a constitutional crisis, affording Beijing an opportunity to advance its sovereignty agenda. \u201d Or as Richard C. Bush, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, put it, \u201cInstead of ignoring independence and localist sentiment, which Chinese leaders should have done, they shone a spotlight on\u201d it. Beijing decided it had to respond strongly and to make an example of the wayward politicians. \u201cSome people think there was no need to worry, that they could never win independence and their forces are too puny,\u201d Zou Pingxue, a professor of law in Shenzhen, China, said by telephone. \u201cBut there was the dangerous tendency that the Hong Kong independence phenomenon could grow larger and spin out of control. \u201d A punitive response was in character for Mr. Xi, who has waged a blistering campaign against corruption that has jailed thousands of officials. Moreover, a tight grip on Hong Kong comports with his   job as the leader of national rejuvenation, which he sees as a   mission. Even before this   a string of actions since last year showed how Mr. Xi is willing to recast, override or ignore laws and conventions that stood in the way of what he sees as China\u2019s powers over its territory and citizens, wherever they may be. Hong Kong booksellers peddling garish tales about China\u2019s elite were snatched into the mainland. Chinese dissidents on the run were spirited back to their homeland from Thailand, despite United Nations protection as refugees. Beijing has not recognized an international tribunal\u2019s rejection of its claims over much of the South China Sea, although it signed the treaty behind the decision. Covert squads abroad have induced absconding officials to return to China from the United States and other states that have no extradition agreements with Beijing. Beijing has a stronger legal argument for its intervention in Hong Kong, over which it has sovereignty. But under the agreement that returned Hong Kong to China from Britain in 1997, Beijing agreed to allow Hong Kong to maintain its separate system for 50 years. Beijing has long treated Hong Kong as a worrisome bridgehead that allows politically toxic ideas, books and people to seep into the adjoining mainland. But until Mr. Xi took office, China\u2019s leaders were less inclined to intervene in the city, which has its legal autonomy and freedoms enshrined in a   known as the Basic Law. That reluctance has evaporated over the last two years. In 2014, Mr. Xi\u2019s government issued a policy paper on Hong Kong that rattled many in the city who saw it as watering down their legal protections. Then an election plan for the city fell far short of competitive elections that many Hong Kong residents demanded, and protests erupted  that occupied streets in the city center for nearly three months. Those failed protests kindled Hong Kong\u2019s small, youthful   movement. Most residents view their demands as unrealistic or undesirable. But in elections in September, activists gained a foothold in the Legislative Council, which skewed voting rules ensure is dominated by politicians loyal to Beijing. Lawyers disagree over whether Chinese legislators had the power to interpret the Basic Law that is supposed to guard the city\u2019s legal autonomy. Even so, the move has unnerved many in Hong Kong, because it occurred before the city\u2019s courts, with a tradition of independence rooted in common law, decided a case over whether the politicians could take their seats. \u201cIt intrudes upon an ongoing case before the courts in Hong Kong,\u201d said Mr. Davis, the former law professor. \u201cThere is no doubt that it raises concern over both the integrity of the Hong Kong judicial system and Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy. \u201d Now the Hong Kong courts must rule on the case in light of China\u2019s interpretation, which says that even city lawmakers who take their oath of office correctly will \u201cbear legal responsibility\u201d if their sincerity is found lacking. Already, the decision has ignited street protests in Hong Kong, recalling the demonstrations of 2014. But defenders of China\u2019s position said its leaders would not back down as they have done before. \u201cSome people have said the People\u2019s Congress should exercise   that we shouldn\u2019t use powers to their utmost,\u201d Li Fei, a deputy secretary general of the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee, told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe say that the powers must be used. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628427.1871095}
