But unlike the vast majority of them, who have turned against President Park   because they believe she has brought an   corruption scandal on herself, Ms. Kum, 79, sees her as an innocent victim of a friend who has taken advantage of her. \u201cPark   herself is not a bad person,\u201d said Ms. Kum, wielding a small razor blade to whittle off the scraggly roots of scallions at a vegetable stall in Seomun Market, here in the city where Ms. Park was born. \u201cShe has been swindled. \u201d Daegu, a center of textile and machinery industries about 150 miles southeast of Seoul, is the heartland of Ms. Park\u2019s support  \u2014   or what little remains of it, after an   scandal involving a longtime friend and shadowy adviser to the president who has been compared to Rasputin. While her nationwide approval rating has dropped into the low single digits, according to Gallup Korea, she retains higher support in Daegu, especially among people 60 and older. To this stalwart cohort, Ms. Park is a proxy for her father, Park   the divisive Cold War dictator who attended teachers college and taught in Daegu before embarking on a military career. He took over South Korea in a  coup in 1961 and ruled until he was assassinated in 1979. Conservatives who lived through the period of rapid economic growth that he oversaw still revere him as the father of modern South Korea, crediting him not only with lifting the country out of poverty but also with guarding against Communist threats from the North. For a dozen years as a member of the National Assembly, Ms. Park represented a district in Daegu, the country\u2019s   city. When she ran for president in 2012, she received about 80 percent of the city\u2019s vote. Many who voted for her expected her to carry on her father\u2019s legacy. Daegu \u201chas been the source of unconditional support for both Park   and Park \u201d said Jeon   a professor of modern Korean history at Kyungpook National University in the city. Now, Mr. Jeon said, as the Assembly prepares for an impeachment vote on Friday, President Park\u2019s few remaining loyal followers are concentrated among older, uneducated and poor citizens. Across the country, intellectual conservatives are angered by what they see as a witch hunt driven by the news media and opposition parties, yet many of them no longer support Ms. Park personally. Yi   a prominent conservative novelist, said that the news media had failed to differentiate between rumor and fact as the scandal unfolded, and he accused the opposition of instigating public protests. But he called the president \u201cincompetent\u201d and said she had shown poor judgment by associating with the wrong people. \u201cTo be frank, she never satisfied my expectations,\u201d Mr. Yi said during an interview at his home in a writer\u2019s colony in Icheon, about 35 miles southeast of Seoul. Even in Daegu, \u201cmany of the educated older people have left her,\u201d said Yi   (no relation to Yi  ) director of operations for the local constituency office of Ms. Park\u2019s governing party. \u201cDaegu citizens supported Park   more passionately than in other areas,\u201d Mr. Yi said. \u201cThat is why it comes across as such a shock and disappointment. \u201d In what appeared to be a   effort to court her remaining supporters, Ms. Park visited Daegu last week, making a rare public appearance after a fire destroyed parts of Seomun Market. During her brief visit, some supporters shouted her name, but protesters nearby called for her to be impeached or immediately resign. Ms. Park\u2019s office told reporters that after she returned to her car, she wept. Earlier this week, stall owners and shoppers who voted for Ms. Park four years ago expressed a mixture of defiance and disillusionment. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they leave her to run the country for the little time she has left?\u201d said Suh   69, owner of a market stall selling coffee, eggs, crackers, chips and   skewers. \u201cThat is the way to help the country, but they are just saying, \u2018Impeach, impeach.\u2019 \u201d Ms. Suh, who said that she admired Ms. Park and that her father had \u201cbrought the country to where we are today,\u201d said the enormous public protests demanding Ms. Park\u2019s removal showed that \u201cdemocracy has become too excessive. \u201d \u201cPublic opinion can turn even a pretty person into an ugly person,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can criticize a little or criticize a lot, but if you criticize a lot, the false becomes the truth. \u201d But Yi   58, an owner of a stationery store in the market, said that Ms. Park should be impeached because she had abused her power. \u201cWhat she did was very wrong,\u201d he said. The biggest loss, he said, was to Ms. Park\u2019s late father. \u201cHis legacy is being buried,\u201d Mr. Yi said. \u201cIt is being sold off wholesale. It\u2019s guilt by association. If you start to hate one person, you will start to hate the whole team. \u201d Across the city at Kyungpook National University, Kim   25, a chemical engineering student, said the nostalgic older generation had made a mistake in expecting Ms. Park to carry on her father\u2019s legacy in the first place. Mr. Kim, who stood outside in   weather carrying a poster board with the slogan \u201cOut with Park \u201d said his own hometown, Ulsan, had benefited greatly from Park  \u2019s policies. \u201cBut I think it would be superficial and you would be gullible to believe that the daughter would be able to do what Park   did,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562529.121197}
