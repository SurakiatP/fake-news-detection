Shannon Morgan, a resident of Leesburg, N. J. applied for the license plate in November 2013 but was told her application had been denied because the plate \u201cmay carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency,\u201d according to court papers posted online last week. After she received that rejection, Ms. Morgan used the state\u2019s online application form to apply for a plate that said \u201cBAPTIST\u201d and was quickly approved, said Richard B. Katskee, the legal director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group in Washington that acted as her legal counsel. It sued the commission in April 2014. \u201cShe rightly realized that it was a   case of religious discrimination against atheists and nonbelievers,\u201d Mr. Katskee said. The Motor Vehicle Commission rejects that characterization. Mairin Bellack, a spokeswoman for the commission, said the rejection of Ms. Morgan\u2019s initial application was an \u201coversight. \u201d \u201cYes, there was an initial denial, but as soon as it was brought to our attention it was rectified immediately,\u201d Ms. Bellack said. \u201cShe has the right to apply for the plate, and the plate is available to anyone, including this individual. \u201d Under the terms of the settlement agreement, which was dated Aug. 4 but not announced until last Friday, Ms. Morgan will receive the license plate she requested in 2013 once she reapplies and sends in the usual application fee of $50. The commission will also pay $75, 000 for her legal fees. In a statement, Barry W. Lynn, the executive director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said Ms. Morgan wanted the state \u201cto stop disparaging her nonbelief and cease treating her like a   citizen. \u201d \u201cThe lesson of this case is simple: The government should treat believers and nonbelievers equally,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. Ms. Morgan said she was pleased with the settlement but also alarmed by online critics who threatened to vandalize her car if they happened to see her now   license plate. \u201cI am almost hesitant to display my tag,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot wrap my brain around the thought that anyone would vandalize a vehicle simply because they do not share the driver\u2019s belief system. \u201d Atheist drivers will not be the only ones to benefit from the settlement. The Motor Vehicle Commission also agreed to honor license plate applications that contained language related to atheism, feminism or L. G. B. T. people, including phrases like \u201cEQUALITY,\u201d \u201cLGBTQ,\u201d \u201c4WOMEN\u201d and \u201cSECULAR. \u201d Mr. Katskee said Ms. Morgan and her legal team \u201cmade up the list with an eye toward things she might want in the future and that were otherwise at risk of having the same sort of discrimination. \u201d Ms. Bellack, the spokeswoman for the commission, said it had issued   license plates in the past. That offered little relief to Ms. Morgan\u2019s lawyer, however, who said her legal team pursued a lawsuit because it was concerned the commission might reject future license plate applications its employees found distasteful. Ms. Morgan\u2019s application was the second instance in less than two years that the commission had rejected an atheist license plate, Mr. Katskee said. The first was when David Silverman, the president of an organization called American Atheists, applied for a license plate that said \u201cATHE1ST\u201d in 2013. The commission rejected his application because it was deemed \u201coffensive,\u201d Mr. Silverman said, but he appealed the decision in writing and the commission reversed course two days later. \u201cThe issue is not that I was able to get my plate, the problem was that the system discriminated against me and made me appeal,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. He added: \u201cAtheism is not a dirty word. It\u2019s a great word, in fact. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561817.0789328}
