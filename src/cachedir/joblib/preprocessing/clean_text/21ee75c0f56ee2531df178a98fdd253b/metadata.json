The claims were alarming: If Sweden, a   member, signed the deal, the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval NATO soldiers, immune from prosecution, could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges. They were all false, but the disinformation had begun spilling into the traditional news media, and as the defense minister, Peter Hultqvist, traveled the country to promote the pact in speeches and town hall meetings, he was repeatedly grilled about the bogus stories. \u201cPeople were not used to it, and they got scared, asking what can be believed, what should be believed?\u201d said Marinette Nyh Radebo, Mr. Hultqvist\u2019s spokeswoman. As often happens in such cases, Swedish officials were never able to pin down the source of the false reports. But they, numerous analysts and experts in American and European intelligence point to Russia as the prime suspect, noting that preventing NATO expansion is a centerpiece of the foreign policy of President Vladimir V. Putin, who invaded Georgia in 2008 largely to forestall that possibility. In Crimea, eastern Ukraine and now Syria, Mr. Putin has flaunted a modernized and more muscular military. But he lacks the economic strength and overall might to openly confront NATO, the European Union or the United States. Instead, he has invested heavily in a program of \u201cweaponized\u201d information, using a variety of means to sow doubt and division. The goal is to weaken cohesion among member states, stir discord in their domestic politics and blunt opposition to Russia. \u201cMoscow views world affairs as a system of special operations, and very sincerely believes that it itself is an object of Western special operations,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, who helped establish the Kremlin\u2019s information machine before 2008. \u201cI am sure that there are a lot of centers, some linked to the state, that are involved in inventing these kinds of fake stories. \u201d The planting of false stories is nothing new the Soviet Union devoted considerable resources to that during the ideological battles of the Cold War. Now, though, disinformation is regarded as an important aspect of Russian military doctrine, and it is being directed at political debates in target countries with far greater sophistication and volume than in the past. The flow of misleading and inaccurate stories is so strong that both NATO and the European Union have established special offices to identify and refute disinformation, particularly claims emanating from Russia. The Kremlin\u2019s clandestine methods have surfaced in the United States, too, American officials say, identifying Russian intelligence as the likely source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. The Kremlin uses both conventional media  \u2014   Sputnik, a news agency, and RT, a television outlet  \u2014   and covert channels, as in Sweden, that are almost always untraceable. Russia exploits both approaches in a comprehensive assault, Wilhelm Unge, a spokesman for the Swedish Security Service, said this year when presenting the agency\u2019s annual report. \u201cWe mean everything from internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik,\u201d he said. The fundamental purpose of dezinformatsiya, or Russian disinformation, experts said, is to undermine the official version of events  \u2014   even the very idea that there is a true version of events  \u2014   and foster a kind of policy paralysis. Disinformation most famously succeeded in early 2014 with the initial obfuscation about deploying Russian forces to seize Crimea. That summer, Russia pumped out a dizzying array of theories about the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, blaming the C. I. A. and, most outlandishly, Ukrainian fighter pilots who had mistaken the airliner for the Russian presidential aircraft. The cloud of stories helped veil the simple truth that poorly trained insurgents had accidentally downed the plane with a missile supplied by Russia. Moscow adamantly denies using disinformation to influence Western public opinion and tends to label accusations of either overt or covert threats as \u201cRussophobia. \u201d \u201cThere is an impression that, like in a good orchestra, many Western countries every day accuse Russia of threatening someone,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said at a recent ministry briefing. Tracing individual strands of disinformation is difficult, but in Sweden and elsewhere, experts have detected a characteristic pattern that they tie to   disinformation campaigns. \u201cThe dynamic is always the same: It originates somewhere in Russia, on Russia state media sites, or different websites or somewhere in that kind of context,\u201d said Anders Lindberg, a Swedish journalist and lawyer. \u201cThen the fake document becomes the source of a news story distributed on   or    websites,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who rely on those sites for news link to the story, and it spreads. Nobody can say where they come from, but they end up as key issues in a security policy decision. \u201d Although the topics may vary, the goal is the same, Mr. Lindberg and others suggested. \u201cWhat the Russians are doing is building narratives they are not building facts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe underlying narrative is, \u2018Don\u2019t trust anyone. \u2019\u201d The weaponization of information is not some project devised by a Kremlin policy expert but is an integral part of Russian military doctrine  \u2014   what some senior military figures call a \u201cdecisive\u201d battlefront. \u201cThe role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness,\u201d Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, wrote in 2013. A prime Kremlin target is Europe, where the rise of the populist right and declining support for the European Union create an ever more receptive audience for Russia\u2019s conservative, nationalistic and authoritarian approach under Mr. Putin. Last year, the European Parliament accused Russia of \u201cfinancing radical and extremist parties\u201d in its member states, and in 2014 the Kremlin extended an $11. 7 million loan to the National Front, the   party in France. \u201cThe Russians are very good at courting everyone who has a grudge with liberal democracy, and that goes from extreme right to extreme left,\u201d said Patrik Oksanen, an editorial writer for the Swedish newspaper group MittMedia. The central idea, he said, is that \u201cliberal democracy is corrupt, inefficient, chaotic and, ultimately, not democratic. \u201d Another message, largely unstated, is that European governments lack the competence to deal with the crises they face, particularly immigration and terrorism, and that their officials are all American puppets. In Germany, concerns over immigrant violence grew after a      girl said she had been raped by migrants. A report on Russian state television furthered the story. Even after the police debunked the claim, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, continued to chastise Germany. In Britain, analysts said, the Kremlin\u2019s   news outlets heavily favored the campaign for the country to leave the European Union, despite their claims of objectivity. In the Czech Republic, alarming, sensational stories portraying the United States, the European Union and immigrants as villains appear daily across a cluster of about 40   websites. During NATO military exercises in early June, articles on the websites suggested that Washington controlled Europe through the alliance, with Germany as its local sheriff. Echoing the disinformation that appeared in Sweden, the reports said NATO planned to store nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe and would attack Russia from there without seeking approval from local capitals. A poll this summer by European Values, a think tank in Prague, found that 51 percent of Czechs viewed the United States\u2019 role in Europe negatively, that only 32 percent viewed the European Union positively and that at least a quarter believed some elements of the disinformation. \u201cThe data show how public opinion is changing thanks to the disinformation on those outlets,\u201d said Jakub Janda, the think tank\u2019s deputy director for public and political affairs. \u201cThey try to look like a regular media outlet even if they have a hidden agenda. \u201d Not all Russian disinformation efforts succeed. Sputnik news websites in various Scandinavian languages failed to attract enough readers and were closed after less than a year. Both RT and Sputnik portray themselves as independent, alternative voices. Sputnik claims that it \u201ctells the untold,\u201d even if its daily report relies heavily on articles abridged from other sources. RT trumpets the slogan \u201cQuestion More. \u201d Both depict the West as grim, divided, brutal, decadent, overrun with violent immigrants and unstable. \u201cThey want to give a picture of Europe as some sort of continent that is collapsing,\u201d Mr. Hultqvist, the Swedish defense minister, said in an interview. RT often seems obsessed with the United States, portraying life there as hellish. On the day President Obama spoke at the  Democratic National Convention, for example, it emphasized scattered demonstrations rather than the speeches. It defends the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, as an underdog maligned by the established news media. Margarita Simonyan, RT\u2019s editor in chief, said the channel was being singled out as a threat because it offered a different narrative from \u201cthe     establishment. \u201d RT, she said, wants to provide \u201ca perspective otherwise missing from the mainstream media echo chamber. \u201d Moscow\u2019s targeting of the West with disinformation dates to a Cold War program the Soviets called \u201cactive measures. \u201d The effort involved leaking or even writing stories for sympathetic newspapers in India and hoping that they would be picked up in the West, said Professor Mark N. Kramer, a Cold War expert at Harvard. The story that AIDS was a C. I. A. project run amok spread that way, and it poisons the discussion of the disease decades later. At the time, before the Soviet Union\u2019s 1991 collapse, the Kremlin was selling communism as an ideological alternative. Now, experts said, the ideological component has evaporated, but the goal of weakening adversaries remains. In Sweden recently, that has meant a series of bizarre forged letters and news articles about NATO and linked to Russia. One forgery, on Defense Ministry letterhead over Mr. Hultqvist\u2019s signature, encouraged a major Swedish firm to sell artillery to Ukraine, a move that would be illegal in Sweden. Ms. Nyh Radebo, his spokeswoman, put an end to that story in Sweden, but at international conferences, Mr. Hultqvist still faced questions about the nonexistent sales. Russia also made at least one overt attempt to influence the debate. During a seminar in the spring, Vladimir Kozin, a senior adviser to the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank linked to the Kremlin and Russian foreign intelligence, argued against any change in Sweden\u2019s neutral status. \u201cDo they really need to lose their neutral status?\u201d he said of the Swedes. \u201cTo permit fielding new U. S. military bases on their territory and to send their national troops to take part in dubious regional conflicts?\u201d Whatever the method or message, Russia clearly wants to win any information war, as Dmitry Kiselyev, Russia\u2019s most famous television anchor and the director of the organization that runs Sputnik, made clear recently. Speaking this summer on the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Information Bureau, Mr. Kiselyev said the age of neutral journalism was over. \u201cIf we do propaganda, then you do propaganda, too,\u201d he said, directing his message to Western journalists. \u201cToday, it is much more costly to kill one enemy soldier than during World War II, World War I or in the Middle Ages,\u201d he said in an interview on the   Rossiya 24 network. While the business of \u201cpersuasion\u201d is more expensive now, too, he said, \u201cif you can persuade a person, you don\u2019t need to kill him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628452.3254154}
