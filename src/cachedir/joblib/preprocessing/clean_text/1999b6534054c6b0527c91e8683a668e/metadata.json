He also blamed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for patronizing criminal clans in the region.  \\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742562471.1961265}
