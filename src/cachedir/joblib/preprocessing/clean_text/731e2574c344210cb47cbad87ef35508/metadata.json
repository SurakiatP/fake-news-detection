She was avoiding a dog in the middle of the street, and suddenly found her own life in danger. But a complete stranger stopped, got out of his car, helped her to safety, and then drove off, never even telling her his name. advertisement - learn more Why did he do it though? That was the biggest question Marsh found herself asking, and it changed the course of her life. She has since made a career out of understanding the human capacity to care for others; where it comes from; how it develops. Marsh wondered why people do selfless things, and resolved to find out. She soon realized very little work had been done on this topic. Altruism is a voluntary, costly behaviour that benefits only the other. And Marsh wanted to know what made some people more altruistic than others: \\nThe actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behaviour motivated by the desire to help another individual. So it\u2019s a selfless act intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. To really figure it out, she did the opposite of what one might expect, however. She started on the opposite end by analyzing psychopaths. People with this disorder are missing the desire to help other people. They are often cold, uncaring, and antisocial individuals. But they\u2019re not typically insensitive to other people\u2019s emotions, just to the signs that other people are distressed: The part of the brain that\u2019s the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely, and they\u2019re profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths\u2019 amygdalas are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don\u2019t react at all, which may be why they have trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths\u2019 amygdalas are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. advertisement - learn more But in her Ted Talk, Marsh brings us back to altruism. She says that her main interest isn\u2019t about why people don\u2019t care for others, but why they do. \u201c So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy?\u201d she asks. Extraordinary altruists have done things like give a healthy kidney to a complete stranger. But why? \u201cT he brains of these extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics,\u201d she says. \u201c They are better at recognizing other people\u2019s fear. They\u2019re literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part of the brain that we found was underreactive in people who are psychopathic.\u201d \u201cAnd finally, their amygdalas are larger than average as well, by about eight percent,\u201d she adds. What\u2019s intriguing is that, when people were asked why they gave their kidney to a complete stranger, they didn\u2019t know how to answer. They didn\u2019t consider themselves unique or special, but normal, just like everyone else. They just did it, because that\u2019s who they are. Even more intriguing is that the people the donors were giving their kidneys to weren\u2019t in a close circle that somehow already connected them through other loved ones. They were totally removed human beings. And that\u2019s pretty extraordinary: \\nI think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It\u2019s because if there\u2019s no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But the main lesson of Marsh\u2019t talk is even more fundamental than all of this. \u201c I also think that this is a view of the world that\u2019s attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere,\u201d she explains.

Marsh believes that we all have the ability to take ourselves out of the center of the circle and extend the circle of compassion outward, so it brings in even total strangers. It looks like a globe outlined with people from all over the world holding hands in unity, in support, in love.
