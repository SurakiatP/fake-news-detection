[Survivors of the attack said that the ten masked Islamic State militants did not merely open fire on the bus full of Christian pilgrims on their way to the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confesor, but that the victims were made to descend from the bus and asked one by one whether they were Christians before being shot by the assailants.  According to one of the chaplains of the group, Father Rashed, as each pilgrim came off the bus they were asked to renounce their Christian faith and profess belief in Islam, but all of them \u2014  even the children \u2014  refused. Each was killed in cold blood with a gunshot to the head or the throat. In a statement Friday, President Donald Trump said the \u201cmerciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls. \u201d \u201cWherever innocent blood is spilled, a wound is inflicted upon humanity,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut this attack also steels our resolve to bring nations together for the righteous purpose of crushing the evil organizations of terror, and exposing their depraved, twisted, and thuggish ideology. \u201d The attack occurred in the midst of a   state of emergency period in Egypt following twin attacks on Coptic churches on Palm Sunday last month that killed some 46 Christians who were in church honoring the celebrations. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks as well. On Saturday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for Friday\u2019s slaughter through its Amaq news agency.

He also tweeted about the event, requesting prayers for \u201cour Coptic brethren in Egypt\u201d and highlighting the religious motivation behind the assault. Let us pray for our Coptic brethren in Egypt who were killed because they did not want to renounce the faith.  \u2014   Pope Francis (@Pontifex) May 27, 2017,  While European leaders repeatedly stressed the importance of combating \u201cglobal warming\u201d during a recent meeting of the G7 in Taormina, Italy, President Donald Trump stressed the absolute priority of fighting the real and present danger of Islamic terrorism. The President delivered a powerful speech against Islamist terrorism before 55 world leaders from Arab and other   nations in Riyadh earlier this week. In that speech, Trump called for unity in pursuing \u201cthe one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history\u2019s great test \u2014  to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism. \u201d In this unique and preeminent task, Trump said, \u201c  countries must take the lead in combating radicalization. \u201d \u201cEvery time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cTerrorists do not worship God, they worship death. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
