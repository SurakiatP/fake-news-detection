But Clinton was having none of it. Rather than ignoring the man, she issued a stern rebuke. Stabbing her finger at the man, she said: \\n\u201cYou know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump.\u201d \\nThe man continued to shout, waving his sign, and the crowd countered with cries of \u201cHillary! Hillary!\u201d as she said, \\n\u201cIt is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we\u2019re going forward into a brighter future.\u201d \\nThe protester was escorted out by security, and Clinton told the man, and everyone like him, \u201cYou may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. Don\u2019t be used. Don\u2019t be exploited.\u201d \\nSee the protester\u2019s antics here. Note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by Clinton supporters: \\nSadly, all too many angry white Christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by Donald Trump, who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the American dream, a man whom, as Clinton says, has taken everything, and given nothing. \\nLast night, in Florida, Hillary Clinton was taking nothing, and giving everything. \\nPhoto: Screen capture'"}, "time": 1742562296.9017897}
