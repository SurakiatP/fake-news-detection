Juncker beams as he says \u201dslowly but surely English (language) is losing importance in Europe\u201d. pic. twitter.  \u201cSlowly but surely English is losing importance in Europe,\u201d Mr. Juncker announced to a conference in Florence, Italy, before switching into French and drawing applause from his audience of European Union (EU) officials, local leaders, and Italian students.  \u201cI agitated between English and French but I will express myself in French,\u201d he said, concluding: \u201cAnd in France, we have elections on Sunday and I\u2019d like them to understand what I\u2019m saying about Europe and about nations. \u201d He also admitted Europe\u2019s role in the world was diminishing. \u201cWe are losing our economic power and our economic clout. We\u2019re currently down to 25 per cent of global GDP. In ten years\u2019 time, that percentage will shrink down to 15. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a smaller continent, our economies will shrink accordingly, we\u2019ll face a demographic crisis. \u201d Bitter @JunckerEU delivers speech in French as \u201dEnglish is losing its importance\u201d. He needs to stop living in his little European bubble! \ud83c\udf0d pic. twitter.   \u2014   LEAVE. EU  (@LeaveEUOfficial) May 5, 2017,  Later in the speech, Mr. Juncker accused Britain of \u201cabandoning\u201d the European project but also admitted the bloc\u2019s deficiencies played a part in people supporting Brexit. The English language jibe comes as tensions between the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiation team and the UK Government peaked this week. Prime Minister Theresa May accused the EU of attempting to meddle in the UK\u2019s general election, after a series of inflammatory leaks about private meetings last weekend. Reports in the German press claimed Mr. Juncker said Mrs. May was \u201cdelusional\u201d about Brexit and that he was \u201c10 times more sceptical\u201d about a successful deal being reached following a dinner with the prime minister. There were also surprise claims the EU had dramatically increased the size of the \u201cdivorce\u201d bill it is demanding the UK pays before leaving the bloc, to 100 billion euros. Mr. May hit back Wednesday, accusing European officials of threatening the UK in a deliberate attempt to influence the outcome of the June 8th snap election. \u201cWhoever wins on 8 June will face one overriding task: to get the best possible deal for this United Kingdom from Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, in the last few days, we have seen just how tough these talks are likely to be. \u201cBritain\u2019s negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the continental press. The European Commission\u2019s negotiating stance has hardened. \u201cThreats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials. All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election that will take place on 8 June. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628590.4616494}
