Wade, and Clinton\\x92s Future in 60 Minutes Interview. November 14, 2016 Audio\\nLesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.\\nDonald Trump: Thank you.\\nLesley Stahl: You\\x92re president-elect.\\nDonald Trump: Thank you.\\nLesley Stahl: How surprised were you?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--\\nLesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.\\nDonald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, \\x93How are we gonna lose?\\x94 We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, \\x93This doesn\\x92t look like second place.\\x94 So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.\\nLesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?\\n Donald Trump: I think so, it\\x92s enormous. I\\x92ve done a lotta big things, I\\x92ve never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it\\x92s so enormous, it\\x92s so amazing.\\n Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn\\x92t talk?\\nDonald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.\\nLesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.\\nDonald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn\\x92t have been nicer. She just said, \\x93Congratulations, Donald, well done.\\x94 And I said, \\x93I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.\\x94 She is very strong and very smart.\\nLesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?\\nDonald Trump: He did, he called the next day.\\nLesley Stahl: Really? What did he say?\\nDonald Trump: He actually called last night.\\nLesley Stahl: What did he say?\\nDonald Trump: And he-- he couldn\\x92t have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he\\x92s ever seen.\\nLesley Stahl: He said that.\\nDonald Trump: He was very, very-- really, very nice.\\nLesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?\\nDonald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.\\nDonald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I\\x92m sitting here with you now and we\\x92re gonna do a great job for the country. We\\x92re going to make America great again, I mean, that\\x92s what-- it-- it began with that and that\\x92s where we are right now. There are so many--\\nLesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about--\\nDonald Trump: I can\\x92t regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I\\x92m very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.\\nLesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?\\nDonald Trump: Sure.\\nLesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?\\nDonald Trump: 15 max.\\n[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]\\nDonald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--\\nLesley Stahl: Like what?\\nDonald Trump: Well\\nLesley Stahl: Give us some meat.\\nDonald Trump: Well, look I don\\x92t want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that\\x92s tough. It\\x92s a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.\\nLesley Stahl: Uh-huh.\\nDonald Trump: And I like having that because I\\x92m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.\\nDonald Trump:\\x96and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--\\nLesley Stahl: Like--\\nDonald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.\\nLesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.\\nDonald Trump: Well, he didn\\x92t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.\\nLesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--\\nDonald Trump: No, I think I\\x92m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I\\x92m not. I\\x92m actually not. I\\x92m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found\\x97it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.\\n[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]\\nLesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you\\x92ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you\\x92re-- unqualified--\\nDonald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?\\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\\nDonald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other\\x97\\nLesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?\\nDonald Trump: I\\x92ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that\\x92s strange. I\\x92m actually surprised to tell you that. It\\x92s-- you know, a little bit strange.\\n[Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.]\\nLesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?\\nDonald Trump: No, I think it\\x92s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They\\x92ve let \\x91em down on the job front. They\\x92ve even let \\x91em down in terms of the war front. You know, we\\x92ve been fighting this war for 15 years--\\nLesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.\\nDonald Trump: We\\x92ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what\\x92s been taking place over a longer period of time than that.\\nLesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?\\nDonald Trump: You know, I\\x92ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it\\x92s going to be America first. It\\x92s not going to be what we\\x92re doing\\x97we, we\\x92ve lost-- we\\x92re losing this country. We\\x92re losing this country. That\\x92s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.\\n Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?\\n Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don\\x92t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.\\nLesley Stahl: Can you be?\\nDonald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that\\x92s easier. Honestly to do that, it\\x92s easier.\\nLesley Stahl: So let\\x92s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you\\x92re going to do what you said or you\\x92re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?\\n Donald Trump: Yes.\\nLesley Stahl: They\\x92re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?\\nDonald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\\x92m very good at this, it\\x92s called construction.\\nLesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?\\nDonald Trump: Yeah, it could be \\x96 it could be some fencing.\\nLesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?\\nDonald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we\\x92re getting them out of our country, they\\x92re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we\\x92re going to make a determination on the people that you\\x92re talking about who are terrific people, they\\x92re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it\\x92s very important, we want to secure our border.\\n[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]\\nLesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We\\x92re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--\\nLesley Stahl: And you\\x92ve got both Houses?\\nDonald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--\\nLesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.\\nDonald Trump: It\\x92s been a long time since it\\x92s happened.\\nDonald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don\\x92t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.\\nLesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.\\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\\nLesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team\\x97\\nDonald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.\\n Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?\\n Donald Trump: I don\\x92t like it, no.\\n Lesley Stahl: You don\\x92t like it, but your own transition team, it\\x92s filled with lobbyists.\\n Donald Trump: That\\x92s the only people you have down there.\\n Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.\\nDonald Trump: Sure. Everybody\\x92s a lobbyist down there--\\n Lesley Stahl: Well, wait\\n Donald Trump: That\\x92s what they are. They\\x92re lobbyists or special interests\\x97\\nLesley Stahl: On your own transition team.\\n Donald Trump:\\x96we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--\\n Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--\\n Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that\\x92s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we\\x92re going to clean it up. We\\x92re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we\\x92re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren\\x92t happy about, but we\\x92re putting on term limits. We\\x92re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.\\nLesley Stahl: But you\\x92re, but you\\x92re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?\\nDonald Trump: I\\x92m saying that they know the system right now, but we\\x92re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\\n Lesley Stahl: Let\\x92s talk about your cabinet.\\n Donald Trump: OK.\\n Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?\\n Donald Trump: Yes.\\nLesley Stahl: Tell us.\\nDonald Trump: Well, I can\\x92t tell you that, but I have made--\\nLesley Stahl: Oh, come on\\x97\\nDonald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I\\x92ve spoken to many of them and I\\x92ll call the rest of them, but and I said, \\x93Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.\\x94 France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia\\x97and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.\\nLesley Stahl: One of the things you\\x92re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you\\x92ll do that quickly?\\nDonald Trump: Yes. Very important.\\nLesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?\\nDonald Trump: So look, here\\x92s what\\x92s going to happen-- I\\x92m going to-- I\\x92m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They\\x92ll be very\\x97\\nLesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--\\nDonald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They\\x92ll be pro-life, they\\x92ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody\\x92s talking about the Second Amendment and they\\x92re trying to dice it up and change it, they\\x92re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--\\n Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won\\x92t be able to get an abortion?\\n Donald Trump: No, it\\x92ll go back to the states.\\nLesley Stahl: By state\\x97no some --\\n Donald Trump: Yeah.\\n Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they\\x92ll perhaps have to go, they\\x92ll have to go to another state.\\n Lesley Stahl: And that\\x92s OK?\\nDonald Trump: Well, we\\x92ll see what happens. It\\x92s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.\\n Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you\\x92re taking on?\\n Donald Trump: No.\\n Lesley Stahl: Not at all?\\n Donald Trump: I respect it. But I\\x92m not scared by it.\\nLesley Stahl: Now you\\x92re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--\\nDonald Trump: That\\x92s only because they don\\x92t know me. I really believe that\\x92s only because--\\nLesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that\\x92s--\\nDonald Trump: I just don\\x92t think they know me.\\n Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they\\x92re demonstrating against?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--\\n Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are\\x97\\n Donald Trump: Well Lesley\\x97\\n Lesley Stahl: are professional?\\n Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--\\nLesley Stahl: OK, but what about \\x96 they\\x92re in every city.\\nLesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don\\x92t you say to yourself, I guess you don\\x92t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They\\x92re afraid.\\n Donald Trump: I would tell them don\\x92t be afraid, absolutely.\\nLesley Stahl: But that\\x92s not what you\\x92re saying, I said it-\\n Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I\\x92ve been saying it.\\n Lesley Stahl: OK.\\nDonald Trump: Don\\x92t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don\\x92t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, \\x93Oh, that\\x92s a terrible thing.\\x94 And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.\\nIt has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton\\x92s edge in the popular vote, have been significant.\\nWhen we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters.\\nNor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.\\nDonald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--\\nLesley Stahl: But you do hear it?\\nDonald Trump: I don\\x92t hear it\\x97I saw, I saw one or two instances\\nLesley Stahl: On social media?\\nDonald Trump: But I think it\\x92s a very small amount. Again, I think it\\x92s--\\nLesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?\\nDonald Trump: I would say don\\x92t do it, that\\x92s terrible, \\x91cause I\\x92m gonna bring this country together.\\n Lesley Stahl: They\\x92re harassing Latinos, Muslims--\\nDonald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \\x93Stop it.\\x94 If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\\nDuring the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton\\x92s email issue.\\nSo we asked him if he plans to carry that out.\\nThat part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back.\\nOn Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.\\nBetween now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That\\x92s 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.\\nWhen we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.\\nLesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.\\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\\nLesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals\\x97and you said it was unfair.\\nDonald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --\\nLesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you\\x92re upset about just put out there when you\\x92re president?\\nDonald Trump: So it\\x92s a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--\\nLesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?\\nDonald Trump: It\\x92s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I\\x92ll give it up entirely and throw out, that\\x92s a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I\\x92m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I\\x92m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, \\x91cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That\\x92s very tough--\\nLesley Stahl: But you\\x92re going to do that as president?\\nDonald Trump: I\\x92m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I\\x92m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It\\x92s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It\\x92s-- it\\x92s where it\\x92s at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they\\x92re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\\nLesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I\\x92ll tell you what I\\x92m going to do, I\\x92m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we\\x92ve been talking about.\\nLesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--\\nDonald Trump: And get the country straightened away.\\nLesley Stahl: You called her \\x93crooked Hillary,\\x94 said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \\x93Lock em\\x92 up.\\x94\\nDonald Trump: Yeah. She did--\\nLesley Stahl: Do you\\x97\\nDonald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--\\nLesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might\\nDonald Trump: I don\\x92t want to hurt them. I don\\x92t want to hurt them. They\\x92re, they\\x92re good people. I don\\x92t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\\nWith that\\n[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]\\nWe were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She\\x92ll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She\\x92s from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams\\x92 wife Louisa was the first.\\nLesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You\\x92re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--\\nMelania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it\\x92s-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it\\x92s-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I\\x92m very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.\\nLesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she\\x92s going to be?\\nDonald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she\\x92s very warm. And I think she\\x92ll have a platform where she\\x92ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that\\x92s what she wants to do.\\nLesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you\\x92ve already said you\\x92re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.\\nMelania Trump: I think it\\x92s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.\\nIt\\x92s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.\\nLesley Stahl: What about your husband\\x92s tweeting?\\nMelania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.\\nLesley Stahl: So you never say to him, \\x93Come on\\x94?\\nMelania Trump: I did.\\nDonald Trump: She does--\\nMelania Trump: I--\\nMelania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But\\nLesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?\\nMelania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn\\x92t--\\nDonald Trump: I\\x92m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don\\x92t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.\\nLesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?\\nMelania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.\\nLesley Stahl: All the time?\\nMelania Trump: All the time.\\nLesley Stahl: And does--\\nMelania Trump: And--\\nLesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--\\nMelania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He\\x92s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.\\nLesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he\\x92s affected every bit as much. Maybe more.\\nLesley Stahl: Maybe more.\\nDonald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, \\x93I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.\\x94 And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.\\nLesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?\\nMelania Trump: 10.\\nLesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?\\nMelania Trump: He knows. He knows--\\nLesley Stahl: He knows?\\nMelania Trump: --what\\x92s going on. And, he\\x92s very proud of his dad.\\nLesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--\\nMelania Trump: No.\\nLesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?\\nMelania Trump: No. I didn\\x92t feel it.\\nLesley Stahl: Not at all?\\nMelania Trump: No.\\nLesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.\\nMelania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.\\nLesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That\\x92s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?\\nMelania Trump: They\\x92re here.\\nLesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?\\nMelania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.\\nLesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair\\x92s out of place. Are you both prepared for this?\\nMelania Trump: We are used to it.\\nDonald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, \\x91cause I\\x92ve had a lot. But I\\x92ve never had anything like this.\\nLesley Stahl: You won\\x92t be able to walk down the street--\\nMelania Trump: I didn\\x92t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It\\x92s another level, but it will continue.\\nAt that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.\\nLesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?\\nDonald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don\\x92t-- I haven\\x92t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --\\nLesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?\\nDonald Trump: Well, there\\x92s been a lotta leaking, there\\x92s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I\\x92d answer a question like that.\\nLesley Stahl: Sounds like you\\x92re not sure.\\nDonald Trump: Well, sure, I\\x92m not sure. I\\x92d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.\\nLesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?\\nDonald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I\\x92m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn\\x92t care because I won the election very easily. So they don\\x92t care. I never thought they did care.\\nLesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.\\nDonald Trump: I do.\\nLesley Stahl: So do you still think it\\x92s rigged?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.\\nLesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--\\nDonald Trump: You know, it\\x92s--\\nLesley Stahl: --it\\x92s rigged?\\nDonald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--\\nLesley Stahl: Even though you won you\\x92re saying that--\\nDonald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I\\x92m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There\\x92s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there\\x92s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.\\nLesley Stahl: What about vacations? You\\x92re not going to take any vacations? You\\x92ve said that.\\nDonald Trump: We have so much work. There\\x92s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We\\x92re lowering taxes, we\\x92re taking care of health care. I mean, there\\x92s just so much to be done. So I don\\x92t think we\\x92ll be very big on vacations, no.\\nLesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president\\x92s salary?\\nDonald Trump: Well, I\\x92ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I\\x92ll take $1 a year. But it\\x92s a -- I don\\x92t even know what it is.\\nDonald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?\\nLesley Stahl: $400,000 you\\x92re giving up.\\nDonald Trump: No, I\\x92m not gonna take the salary. I\\x92m not taking it.\\nIn a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.\\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America\\x92s ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn\\x92t been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.\\nBut Mr. Trump\\x92s appeal wasn\\x92t just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.\\nHillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didn\\x92t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump\\x92s new and energized coalition.\\nOn Friday Mr. Trump\\x92s four older children \\x96 Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father\\x92s surprising victory.\\nLesley Stahl: Set the scene. It\\x92s election night. Your father-- no one\\x92s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.\\nEric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states \\x96 they\\x92re all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--\\nLesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.\\nEric Trump: --it\\x92s-- it\\x92s--\\nLesley Stahl: --is what I heard.\\nEric Trump: --it\\x92s a moment I\\x92ll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody\\x92s cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.\\nIvanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It\\x92s incredibly exciting. And we\\x92re very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.\\nLesley Stahl: Tiffany?\\nTiffany Trump: I mean I don\\x92t think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that\\x92s worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it\\x92s just \\x96 it\\x92s really awe-inspiring.\\nAt some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in \\x96 including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.\\nLesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?\\nDonald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, \\x93Congratulations. It was an amazing campaign.\\x94 And then I got a call from George and he said-- \\x93Congratulations. It was great.\\x94 And, you know, look, it\\x92s-- it\\x92s a tough situation. I went to war with Jeb. And Jeb\\x92s a nice guy, but it was a nasty campaign. It was a nasty campaign. And, I mean, I\\x92m disappointed in one thing. He signed a pledge and I don\\x92t know how you sign a pledge and then you don\\x92t honor it. It was a rough primary. It\\x92s a rough primary. Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever.\\nLesley Stahl: Ivanka, you said that your father\\x92s changed in the campaign. How has he changed?\\nIvanka Trump: I think it\\x92s impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. You meet-- and in my father\\x92s case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow.\\nLesley Stahl: Do you think your father\\x92s changed?\\nEric Trump: I think as a family, we\\x92ve changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, it\\x92s fighting by our father\\x92s side every single day as you\\x92ve gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.\\nLesley Stahl: Don, did you discover something about your father that you didn\\x92t know before?\\nDonald Trump, Jr.: You know-- we-- we know him pretty well. And we\\x92ve got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know-- the tenacity that he\\x92s always shown-- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, \\x93Well, it wasn\\x92t triage. Which state are we gonna do today,\\x94 it\\x92s, \\x93We\\x92re just gonna do \\x91em all. We\\x92re gonna speak to all of these people.\\x94 And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. And, you know-- it-- it only furthered what I already knew.\\nLesley Stahl: I want to ask you all about something that\\x92s going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They\\x92re really afraid. African Americans think there\\x92s a target on their back. Muslims are terrified.\\nDonald Trump: I think it\\x92s horrible if that\\x92s happening. I think it\\x92s built up by the press because, frankly, they\\x92ll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could\\x92ve been there before. If I weren\\x92t even around doing this, and they\\x92ll make into an event because that\\x92s the way the press is.\\nLesley Stahl: Do any of you want to say anything about this fear that\\x92s out there?\\nDonald Trump, Jr.: I-- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded.\\nLesley Stahl: One of the groups that\\x92s expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You--\\nDonald Trump: And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And--\\nLesley Stahl: You did.\\nDonald Trump: Everybody said, \\x93That was so great.\\x94 I have been, you know, I\\x92ve been-a supporter.\\nLesley Stahl: Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?\\nDonald Trump: It-- it\\x92s irrelevant because it was already settled. It\\x92s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it\\x92s done.\\nLesley Stahl: So even if you appoint a judge that--\\nDonald Trump: It\\x92s done. It-- you have-- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They\\x92ve been settled. And, I\\x92m fine with that.\\nLesley Stahl: One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father\\x92s temperament. And he has himself has said, \\x93If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, I\\x92m gonna strike back.\\x94 And now people are saying, \\x93Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little.\\x94 What-- how do you think he\\x92s going to comport himself as president?\\nEric Trump: I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think that\\x92s what this country elected.\\nDonald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word \\x93Temperament.\\x94 It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn\\x92t work because we\\x92re here and they\\x92re not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we\\x92re going to start winning again. We\\x92re going to win on trade, we\\x92re going to win at the borders, we\\x92re going to knock out ISIS.\\nLesley Stahl: You have said that you\\x92re gonna destroy ISIS. Now, how are you going to?\\nDonald Trump: I don\\x92t tell you that. I don\\x92t tell you that.\\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but what can --\\nDonald Trump: I\\x92m not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- it\\x92s a tough fight because, number one, the people from the --leaders of ISIS have left. What do you-- why do I have to tell you that?\\nLesley Stahl: Troops on the ground?\\nDonald Trump: I\\x92m not gonna say anything. I don\\x92t want to tell them anything. I don\\x92t want to tell anybody anything.\\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about\\x97the American people.\\nDonald Trump: I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals.\\nLesley Stahl: You said you knew more than the generals about ISIS\\nDonald Trump: Well, I\\x92ll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they\\x92ve done. OK, look at the job they\\x92ve done. They haven\\x92t done the job. Now, maybe it\\x92s leadership, maybe it\\x92s something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we\\x92re going to get rid of ISIS.\\nLesley Stahl: Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say you\\x92re going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?\\nDonald Trump: Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.\\nLesley Stahl: You\\x92re going to keep that?\\nDonald Trump: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we\\x92re gonna--\\nLesley Stahl: You\\x92re gonna keep that--\\nDonald Trump: Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but it\\x92s very much something we\\x92re going to try and keep.\\nLesley Stahl: And there\\x92s going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -\\x96 no?\\nDonald Trump: No, we\\x92re going to do it simultaneously. It\\x92ll be just fine. We\\x92re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\\x92re not going to have a two-year period where there\\x92s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we\\x92ll know. And it\\x92ll be great health care for much less money. So it\\x92ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.\\nLesley Stahl: Roles during the administration. Any of you want a job in your father\\x92s administration? Eric Trump: So we have an amazing company. You know, one of, I think, the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander-in-chief. And I think he\\x92s going to rely on us more than ever. And--\\nLesley Stahl: So you\\x92ll stay up here?\\nEric Trump: So we\\x92ll-- we\\x92ll-- we\\x92ll be in New York and we\\x92ll take care of the business. I think we\\x92re going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we\\x92re going to make him very proud.\\nLesley Stahl: People think that you\\x92re going to be part of the administration, Ivanka.\\nIvanka Trump: I\\x92m-- no. I\\x92m going to be a daughter. But I\\x92ve-- I\\x92ve said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them.\\nLesley Stahl: But you won\\x92t be inside--\\nIvanka Trump: Wage equality, childcare. These are things that are very important for me. I\\x92m very passionate about education. Really promoting more opportunities for women. So you know, there\\x92re a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity.\\nLesley Stahl: Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand.\\nIvanka Trump: I don\\x92t think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And-- so th-- I-- I-- you know, that\\x92s the focus.\\nDonald Trump: I think what Ivanka trying to say, \\x93Who cares? Who cares?\\x94 This is big league stuff. This is-- this is our country. Our country is going bad. We\\x92re going to save our country. I don\\x92t care about hotel occupancy. It\\x92s peanuts compared to what we\\x92re doing. Health care, making people better. It\\x92s unfair what\\x92s happened to the people of our country and we\\x92re going to change it. As simple as that.\\n\u0160 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.\""}, "time": 1742564279.7472134}
