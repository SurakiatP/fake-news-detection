Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday. \\nThe F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case \u00e2\\x80\\x94 one federal official said they numbered in the thousands \u00e2\\x80\\x94 potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. \\nIn a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they \u00e2\\x80\\x9cappear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\n\u2026 \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x9cDirector Comey\u00e2\\x80\\x99s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant,\u00e2\\x80\\x9d said John D. Podesta, chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\\x80\\x99s campaign. \\nHe added: \u00e2\\x80\\x9cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nMrs. Clinton, arriving Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, waved at members of the media gathered on the tarmac but ignored shouted questions. \\nHA! \\nShe won\u2019t even take questions! \\nThere was no damage control plan again \u2013 just like when she collapsed on 911! \\nI\u2019m not really sure how it makes sense that Weiner would have these on his phone, or why the FBI would seize the phone of his wife because he was sending dick pics to jailbait (unless he was using her phone to send them, lel) \u2013 but I\u2019ve always said, Weiner is a funny Jew! \\nI never thought he would turn-out to be this funny! \\nOriginal article follows. tfw you just lost the game \\nOH YES YOU READ THAT HEADLINE RIGHT, SIR. \\nYESSIREE DOG. \\nI knew James Comey was a pretty cool guy when a Negro in Congress asked him to investigate me and he was like \u201cYeah, dat nigga hot as a muffuggah. Watchoo want ah invesegate how much azz he be kickin in dem toobs? Get the fug outta here with that shit, dawg.\u201d \\nAnd now: total bro confirmed. \\nRT : \\nThe FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton\u00e2\\x80\\x99s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x9c In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent \u00e2\\x80\\x9d to Clinton\u00e2\\x80\\x99s investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. \u00e2\\x80\\x9c I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. \u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nThe FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesn\u00e2\\x80\\x99t know how long that will take. \\nStocks fell after Comey\u00e2\\x80\\x99s announcement, CNBC reported. \\nMore like the sky just fell. \\nAnd underneath it we see Jesus Christ himself wearing a MAGA hat, smiling like a smug Pepe and whispering \u201clock her up.\u201d Yo dawg, we heard you like America. So we sent Jesus Christ himself to make sure Donald Trump gets elected. \\nSeriously, people. Even if you don\u2019t necessarily believe in Christianity, you have to admit that this is some kind of divine miracle that just happened here. \\nRepresentative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x9cNow that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,\u00e2\\x80\\x9d he said in a statement. \u00e2\\x80\\x9cThe American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d \\nAlmost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September. \\nIn mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least \u00e2\\x80\\x9cfour new hearings\u00e2\\x80\\x9d after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public. \\n\u201cThis is a flashing red light of potential criminality,\u201d Chaffetz said. \\nThe new evidence points to a \u00e2\\x80\\x9cquid pro quo\u00e2\\x80\\x9d arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted. \\nWelp. \\nThat\u2019s it. \\nIt\u2019s over. \\nThere is just no way with an open investigation hanging over her head, and the FBI openly stating that it is so severe they have to act immediately, that she can possibly be elected. \\nI do understand that there is no evidence that Hillary\u2019s own people care if she is a criminal or not when it comes to polling, but this seriously demoralizes them, making them much less likely to vote. At the same time, it is a massive morale boost to the Republicans who aren\u2019t necessarily on the Trump Train but hate Hillary, ensuring that they\u2019ll go out and vote. \\nSeriously guys. I did have my doubts. But this clears them up. We are 11 days away from the election. \\nAnd this drops. \\nAnd I guarantee Team Trump has something to drop next week. The Russian conspiracy might even be memed into reality and Putin might drop the hidden server. Assange still has something big. \\nWe won, guys. \\nHonestly, I\u2019ve got tears in my eyes right now. \\nGod Bless America.'"}, "time": 1742562033.9423742}
