The landmark case, brought by the Philippines, was seen as an important crossroads in China\u2019s rise as a global power and in its rivalry with the United States, and it could force Beijing to reconsider its assertive tactics in the region or risk being labeled an international outlaw. It was the first time the Chinese government had been summoned before the international justice system. In its most significant finding, the tribunal rejected China\u2019s argument that it enjoys historic rights over most of the South China Sea. That could give the governments of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam more leverage in their own maritime disputes with Beijing. The tribunal also said that China had violated international law by causing \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the marine environment, endangering Philippine ships and interfering with Philippine fishing and oil exploration. \u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming victory. We won on every significant point,\u201d said the Philippines\u2019 chief counsel in the case, Paul S. Reichler. But while the decision is legally binding, there is no mechanism for enforcing it, and China, which refused to participate in the tribunal\u2019s proceedings, reiterated on Tuesday that it would not abide by it. Speaking at a meeting with European leaders, President Xi Jinping was defiant, reasserting China\u2019s claim to sovereignty over the South China Sea \u201csince ancient times,\u201d the   People\u2019s Daily reported. His remarks echoed a statement from the Foreign Ministry. The tribunal\u2019s decision \u201cis invalid and has no binding force,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cChina does not accept or recognize it. \u201d The foreign secretary of the Philippines, Perfecto Yasay Jr. welcomed the ruling as \u201csignificant\u201d and called on \u201call those concerned to exercise restraint and sobriety. \u201d The five judges and legal experts on the tribunal ruled unanimously, and the decision was so heavily in favor of the Philippines that there were fears about how the Chinese leadership would react. Many in the region worry that Beijing will accelerate its efforts to assert control over the South China Sea, which includes vital trade routes and fishing waters as well as possible oil and mineral deposits. \u201cXi Jinping has lost face here, and it will be difficult for China to do nothing,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cI expect a very tough reaction from China, since it has lost on almost every point. There is virtually nothing that it has won. \u201d The Philippines filed its case in 2013, after China seized a reef over which both countries claim sovereignty. There has been speculation that Beijing might respond to the decision by building an artificial island at the reef, Scarborough Shoal, a move that could set off a conflict with the Philippines and its treaty ally, the United States. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said Washington expected China to comply with the ruling. \u201cThe world is watching to see if China is really the global power it professes itself to be and the responsible power that it professes itself to be,\u201d he said. The main issue before the panel was the legality of China\u2019s claim to waters within a \u201c  line\u201d that appears on official Chinese maps and encircles as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea, an area the size of Mexico. The Philippines had asked the tribunal to find the claim to be in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which both China and the Philippines have ratified. In its decision, the tribunal said any historic rights to the sea that China had previously enjoyed \u201cwere extinguished\u201d by the treaty, which lays out rules for drawing zones of control over the world\u2019s oceans based on distances to coastlines. The panel added that while China had used islands in the sea in the past, it had never exercised exclusive authority over the waters. The panel also concluded that several disputed rocks and reefs in the South China Sea were too small for China to claim control of economic activities in the waters around them. As a result, it found, China was engaged in unlawful behavior in Philippine waters, including activities that had aggravated the dispute. The tribunal cited China\u2019s construction of a large artificial island on an atoll known as Mischief Reef. China has built a military airstrip, naval berths and sports fields on the island, but the tribunal ruled that it was in Philippine waters. The judges also said that Beijing had violated international law by causing \u201csevere harm to the coral reef environment\u201d and by failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from harvesting endangered sea turtles and other species \u201con a substantial scale. \u201d In an early indication of the regional response, Vietnam  \u2014   which has fraternal Communist ties to China but also significant territorial disputes with it, including over oil exploration rights  \u2014   quickly issued a statement endorsing the tribunal\u2019s decision. China has argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction in the case. Because the sovereignty of reefs and islands in the sea is disputed, Beijing asserted, the tribunal could not decide on competing claims to the surrounding waters. The treaty covers only maritime disputes, not land disputes. In a tough speech in Washington last week, a former senior Chinese official, Dai Bingguo, said that the findings would amount to no more than \u201cwaste paper\u201d and that China would not back down from its activities in the South China Sea even in the face of a fleet of American aircraft carriers. But with the geopolitical stakes high, Mr. Dai also counseled moderation, saying that the situation in the South China Sea \u201cmust cool down. \u201d The issue could have ramifications for domestic politics in China. Mr. Xi has made defense of maritime claims a central part of the governing Communist Party\u2019s narrative that it has restored the nation to global greatness after long periods of humiliation by bigger powers. Any challenge to that narrative is seen in Beijing as a challenge to the party\u2019s rule. On Wednesday morning, an escalating propaganda campaign in China against the tribunal reached a new pitch, with all the major news outlets condemning the decision and trumpeting China\u2019s refusal to be back down. \u201cWe do not claim an inch of land that does not belong to us, but we won\u2019t give up any patch that is ours,\u201d said a   editorial in The People\u2019s Daily, which ridiculed the tribunal as a \u201clackey of some outside forces\u201d that would be remembered as a \u201claughingstock in human history. \u201d Some Chinese commentators have said in recent days that the leadership may respond with immediate military maneuvers in the South China Sea. \u201cWhether it will be significant or large scale I cannot say,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. China is hosting the Group of 20 summit meeting in September, a major international forum that it hopes will proceed without the distraction of conflict. But Mr. Shi said he was not sure the government had \u201cthat kind of patience\u201d to wait until after the gathering before taking some sort of action. In a surprising opinion article on the India Today website over the weekend, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, Shen Dingli, wrote that Beijing needed to \u201crevise its stance\u201d and \u201cemploy a more effective approach\u201d that maintained China\u2019s \u201c  \u2018smiling\u2019 image. \u201d The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has signaled that he will be more accommodating toward China than was his predecessor, Benigno S. Aquino III. The case before the tribunal was filed at the initiative of Mr. Aquino, whose term ended June 30. Soon after the case was filed, China began building artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, much of which is claimed by the Philippines, in a move that many saw as a demonstration of contempt for the international court system. Experts in international law said that negotiations could be the most positive outcome of the case. In 1986, some noted, the United States ignored a ruling from the International Court of Justice that declared its mining of the harbors of Nicaragua to be illegal. Washington had not ratified the Convention on the Law of the Sea, and it still has not. But the ruling 30 years ago by the judges in The Hague emboldened congressional critics to cut funds for the Reagan administration\u2019s campaign against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and it galvanized countries in Central America to seek a settlement of the conflict. China is not expected to vacate or dismantle the artificial islands it has built. That makes the legal arguments important, analysts said. \u201c \u201cThe tribunal rulings will move the goal posts towards the Philippines and the smaller countries,\u201d said Markus Gehring, a lecturer in law at Cambridge University. In Manila, the former foreign secretary, Albert F. del Rosario, who brought the case after years of failed negotiations with China, said the path was now open for a lasting settlement of disputes in the South China Sea. \u201cThe award provides a basis to further talks and cooperation to encompass all parties, including China,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564602.42809}
