Everything shown here is a matter of undisputed public record \u2013 a rare thing in this Presidential campaign I\u2019m not trying to prove a theory here, as I lack the resources to do so. I am merely using informed logic to establish those four things required to build any credible case: behavioural track record, means, motive and opportunity. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that in terms of capability of performing dirty tricks, the Clinton campaign ticks all four boxes. The Clintons\u2019 track record on dirty tricks \\nNegative advertising, smear rumour, making rally halls look more full/empty on TV and innate media bias have all been obvious for many years in Western election campaigns. Not surprisingly, during Presidential campaigns this is heightened by the physically more personal nature of the contest. \\nHuffington Post banned The Slog from commenting in 2012 after I alleged the use of troll swarms by Obama to mess up Republican sites. Three months later, his White House CoS casually confirmed the story. \\nThis is truth bending, and isn\u2019t illegal. But the Clinton track record against Bernie Sanders is of a quite different order. I was given first-hand evidence, for example, of blatant threats to Democratic National Convention (DNC) workers that anyone helping organise Sanders rallies would have no future or place in a Clinton White House. But there is also disturbing evidence of electoral irregularity as well. October 2015 \u2013 over 120,000 voting registrations lost in Brooklyn \u2013 & rock solid Sanders neighbourhood, plus nearly a third of Sanders supporters complaining that, on pitching up to vote, their Party registrations had been changed Over nine straight 2015 primaries, Sanders won seven: in the other two, \u201cmassive voter irregularities\u201d were reported. Hillary won them. The supposedly neutral DNC is stuffed with overt Clinton activists. The private company collecting sensitive poll/registration information NPG van has close ties to Bill Clinton and worked for him in 1992. Leaks from NPG are, to say the least, recurrent. On the eve of the Democratic party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia, a whopping 20,000 emails were made public by Wikileaks showing supposedly \u2018neutral\u2019 senior party officials tried to undermine Mr Sanders\u2019s insurgent left-wing campaign by publicly portraying him as an atheist. Solidly Sanders locations in Arizona\u2019s Maciopa County found their polling booths available reduced from 200 to 60. Odd behaviour during a Primary campaign. Undercover videos just four days ago showed two senior DNC operatives openly admitting to paid interference with Trump rallies and voter registration manipulation. \\nThese days, one talks to Washington pundits who \u2013 sadly \u2013 shrug and say \u201cboth sides are at it \u2013 they cancel each other out\u201d. But what I\u2019ve shown above is just a fraction of highlights compared to the total media exposure of Clinton criminality. Doing a quick count from 78 sites, press titles and broadcasters last night, allegations against the Clinton campaign outnumber all others by 5/2. \\nHowever, it\u2019s at this point that we go beyond even electoral irregularity and into suggestions of Hillary Clinton perverting the course of events at the Department of Justice (DoJ). Here, we segue neatly into \u2018means\u2019. The means to destroy Trump \\nWithout any shadow of doubt, the biggest bubbling-under scandal of the campaign (until complaints about Trump\u2019s locker-room and sex abuse behaviour \u2018surfaced\u2019) was that involving emails sent by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State. \\nThe headline here is this: while heading up State, she only used her own personal and heavily abuse-protected server to send official emails \u2013 rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. On leaving that job, the State Department hurriedly classified all the emails retrospectively. \\nThis suggestive of the fact that Ms Clinton has something to hide. Her behaviour was also highly irregular, and cannot solely be explained by national security concerns: if there are fears about how secure State is, then we may as well all pack up and go home. (There are as it happens; but their security is a hundred times more sophisticated than hers). \\nHillary maintains that her behaviour did not break federal rules, and there are precedents to show that. The hole in her defence is that there are no precedents for all the emails to have produced on her private server. \\nHaving seen the content of some 150 emails, the FBI began by being quite bullish on the subject of an investigation. But then suddenly it wasn\u2019t. An anodyne report was eventually issued in July 2016, criticising her \u201cextreme carelessness\u201d. \\nHer behaviour does not support that finding. Over at the DoJ, Dan Metcalfe, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Information and Privacy (FOIA), said this gave her even tighter control over her emails by not involving a third party such as Google, and helped prevent their disclosure by Congressional subpoena. He added: \u201cShe managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it\u2014perhaps forever\u201d, making it \u201ca blatant circumvention of the FOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better\u201d . \\nBut neither State nor the DoJ did anything. The former issued a report making it clear that Secretary Clinton had lied to employees about the \u2018permission\u2019 she had, and confirmed that permission had never been sought. She also lied to the media about never sending classified material via her own server: a review of the 55,000-page email eventually released found \u201chundreds of potentially classified emails\u201d. \\nThere is a clear \u2013 very clear \u2013 scenario that scopes out here: that of an ambitious wannabe US President conspiring to hide her guilt about stuff in perpetuity. Among the forty emails held back by US security agencies are those assumed to refer to the Benghazi Compound disaster, during which the Ambassador lost his life in the most bestial manner. \\nHowever, the FBI having been quietly told to pipe down, the job facing the Clintons now was to get the DoJ onside. Bill went right to the very top. \\nIn late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her private plane on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Three days later, a Justice Department official categorically told the media that Attorney General Lynch will accept \u201cwhatever recommendation career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director make about whether to bring charges related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email server\u201d. \\nWashington sources confirm that Lynch \u201calready pretty much knew what the FBI would say\u201d. Did the Clintons have a strong motive? \\nNothing is ever conclusive in these areas. But the overwhelming suggestion from these events is that the Clintons most certainly do have the means to influence the activities and output of the Justice Department. \\nHowever, it\u2019s easy to argue that Candidate Clinton had little to fear from Trump; the media almost universally dismissed him as a no-hoper. So why take the risk of, potentially, using the DoJ to put her adversary in a spot? \\nIt\u2019s easy to argue that, but the US media have been wrong about Donald Trump since Day One. And the facts don\u2019t support the argument. \\nLast night, the BBC released this trend map of the poll support for each candidate throughout the campaign: \\nOn this diagram, I have indicated in green ink the two points at which Clinton and Trump are neck and neck. In early to mid July \u2013 following embarrassing email revelations \u2013 Clinton\u2019s support dips, and Trump briefly overtakes her. \\nFrom the word go, the Clinton campaign saw Trump\u2019s financial background, practices and exposure as an obvious weakness. Having pressed hard for his tax returns, once his official election as the GOP presidential nominee was confirmed \u2013 June 19th 2016 \u2013 they began demanding to see his financials. \\nIn fact, they already knew of one unfortunate link: on March 20th, the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal had featured a piece showing Donald Trump\u2019s massive dependence on Deutsche Bank as a credit supplier. The Murdoch press is campaigning solidly for Hillary, and Rupert himself has given substantial donations to her presidential bid. His motives towards her and Deutsche have been detailed by The Slog elsewhere . \\nThe dates here are key \u2013 particularly the dates from which Deutsche Bank ceases to be \u2018troubled\u2019 in the background, and increasingly becomes a foreground, front-page crisis . \\nIn early to mid June, Trump racks up his support and closes the gap with Clinton.Other financial papers pick up on the WSJ story\u2026.despite the fact that Trump\u2019s cash flow and personal salary alone would be enough to pay off all the Deutsche loans. At this point, the International Monetary Fund releases a report saying that Deutsche Bank \u201cappears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks in the global banking system.\u201d \\nThe IMF \u2013 and its boss Christine Lagarde \u2013 are prime movers in aiding Clintonian foreign policy relating to the EU and North Africa. But still Trump\u2019s support leaps from 34-40%. Then early July, S&P Global Ratings lowers its outlook on Deutsche Bank to negative. At the same time, Deutsche Bank\u2019s U.S. unit fails the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. The story filters down into non-specialist media. Clinton consolidates her lead. \\nBut by this time, DB is starting to look like a basket case \u2013 which it has been for years \u2013 and the \u2018ailing\u2019 bank gets kicked out of the STOXX blue-chip Europe 50 index. \\nAnd yet, the Donald starts to recover momentum. By mid September, he\u2019s back to almost neck and neck. It\u2019s now that the DoJ Establishment goes for the throat.The Justice Department chooses this precise moment \u2013 September 16th \u2013 to splash with the news that Deutsche Bank faces a whopping $14.5 billion malpractice fine. Within hours, its shares go into freefall. \\nBetween September 20th and 28th, a broader media blitz and online campaign openly calls Trump \u201cmassively dependent on Deutsche loans\u201d. Counterspin from the Deutsche camp claims negotiations to reduce the DoJ fine are well in hand. Two days later Justice splashes again: no, it alleges, they haven\u2019t even started yet. \\nBut still, general awareness of the Trump-Deutsche link remains low\u2026.and Trump himself steadies his poll ratings. Locker rooms, pussy grabbing abuse allegations suddenly sprout via close Clinton ally David Farenthold. Donald\u2019s poll ratings dive. \\nDonald Trump is just beginning to recover his position. Already pro-Democrat sites are switching tack to say that Trump \u201cis a puppet candidate of foreign banks\u201d \u2013 a silly allegation, given that he only works with one, and it\u2019s more dependent on his business than vice versa. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has Deutsche CEO John Cryan by the balls; as far as the Clintons are concerned, it holds all the cards. Opportunity \\nFor myself, I doubt very much that Hillary & Co will go any further down the \u2018dodgy credit\u2019 road. With only two weeks to go to Election day, an imminent Deutsche collapse would play into Trump\u2019s allegedly wandering hands: it is, after all, the US unit that faces the fine, and Trump\u2019s populism is anti Wall Street. \\nI think an equal (if not bigger) force behind pushing Deutsche Bank into the limelight is that of forcing it into a Middle East role where it can be a Rottweiller controlled by State, its old boss Hillary Clinton, and massive regional investor Rupert Murdoch. \\nBut while the opportunity was there, it\u2019s obvious that Bill Clinton had all the influence his wife needs to help her get elected. Indeed, by being so unpopular in his own Party, Donald Trump has made this a much easier task: nobody but nobody in the US \u00e9lite wants Trump in the White House. \\nAs I endeavoured to stress at the outset, the object in this post is not to prove a conspiracy, but rather to present an avalanche of evidence to support one simple \u2013 and widespread \u2013 observation about the Hillarybillies: as their power has increased, so too has their megalomania inflated to a frightening degree. \\nWhere once there were only crooked land deals and cigars to go on, today it is easy to argue that this creepy couple are operating at the kind of level where the American systems of Law, foreign policy, power separation and democracy itself are being perverted. This much has been obvious for some time; but American voters need to make their minds up by November 8th which they want least \u2013 Donald Trump in the White House, or Mr and Mrs Clinton doing the bidding of corporate globalism\u2026while dragging the US further and further towards geopolitical confrontation. \\nLooked at in that way, while this has probably been the most superficial and childish Presidential contest in American history, it will probably also turn out to have been the most important.'"}, "time": 1742628395.0041957}
