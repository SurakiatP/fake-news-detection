[The German publication told the story of a Moroccan migrant from Tangier named Said al Ghoury who moved with his family to the small Spanish town of Visiedo with his family and claims he \u201crescued\u201d the village from demographic decline.  Since 1998 the number of immigrants flowing into Spain has increased ten times and in the last year alone the figure increased by 12. 2 percent. In real numbers around 4. 6 million people, many from North Africa, have flooded into Spain. The small village of Visiedo is located in the province of Teruel which has experienced a decline in its Spanish population from 136, 000 in 1998 to 123, 000 today and around 14, 000 migrants have moved to the area. Rosario Sampedro, a migration sociologist at the University of Valladolid said in some rural regions of the country the, \u201cpopulation was rejuvenated,\u201d by mass migration but added, \u201cthe situation is still tense in the remote areas. \u201d In Teruel, the population is already ageing with   of the population being over the age of 60. Vicente Gonzalvo of the \u201cNew Ways\u201d program actively promotes the idea of sending migrants to these small villages where they would replace the ageing native Spanish. \u201cWe want to revive the dying villages,\u201d he said adding, \u201cThe native Spaniards in the countryside must realise that they too will benefit when their communities gain new inhabitants. \u201d Hassan Bellahmama is another Moroccan who moved to a small town in Spain, choosing to become a shepherd in the town of Alfambra. \u201cThere are only a few Spaniards who want to do this job. Most cattle farmers in the province employ foreigners,\u201d said Pedro Jos\u00e9 Escusa who employs Bellahmama. In Germany, experts have said that sending migrants into rural communities would not just help the dwindling populations, but would also act as an \u201cintegration laboratory\u201d as well. Wolfgang Borst, major of the Bavarian village of Hofheim sees mass migration as an \u201copportunity\u201d saying, \u201cWe are very satisfied. We are gaining a lot more villagers. \u201d Others like Klaus Poelitz say the main problem is the \u201cprejudice\u201d of the locals in rural communities. The migrant crisis hasn\u2019t been all positive for many small towns as some have been driven into enormous amounts of debt to provide food and shelter for migrants. Some residents have reacted strongly against proposals to house large amounts of migrants in their communities. When Joachim Kebschull, the    mayor of Oersdorf planned to welcome migrants into the town of only 900 several locals beat him unconscious before a meeting of the town\u2019s urban planning committee. In France,   migration mayor of B\u00e9ziers Robert M\u00e9nard was fined 1, 800 euros for mentioning the changing demographics of his town. M\u00e9nard mentioned the theory of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d coined by prolific French author Renaud Camus who said that mass migration will lead to the cultural and demographic transformation of European societies.'"}, "time": 1742628457.710108}
