Peretti, the site\u2019s founder and chief executive, who is based in Los Angeles, travels to the New York offices regularly and often meets with employees to answer questions or outline strategy. But two recent meetings took on greater import, after BuzzFeed told employees two weeks ago that it was formally dividing its news and entertainment divisions. The day the reorganization was announced, Ben Smith, the editor in chief, met with the news staff to reassure them that the company was committed to its news operations. And last Wednesday, Mr. Peretti held a    session and vowed that the company was not planning to sell its news division. Staff members at BuzzFeed said the overhaul provoked curiosity rather than deep anxiety. Still, BuzzFeed\u2019s reorganization seemed a transformative moment for a company staking a big bet on the future of video and entertainment. Already, video represents more than 50 percent of BuzzFeed\u2019s total revenue, compared with 15 percent at the end of 2014. In the next two years, BuzzFeed expects that video will generate up to 75 percent of its advertising revenue, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s operations. The move also reflects a broader shift at media companies that are increasingly turning to video and entertainment news to lure a younger generation and attract online advertising dollars. In April, the website Mashable  made a round of job cuts as it moved away from covering world and political news, and Mic, a site aimed at a young audience, hopes to have 60 percent of the company focused on video by year\u2019s end. Traditional news organizations like The New York Times and Tronc, formerly called Tribune Publishing, are investing heavily in video as well. As video moves from an ancillary pursuit to a more important source of revenue, the shifts in structure and emphasis are causing major changes and some uncertainty in newsrooms. \u201cIn any company, especially one that\u2019s going through rapid scale and one that has geographical disbursement, there are disconnects that come up,\u201d said Ze Frank, who until the recent reorganization was president of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, the company\u2019s video division. Under the new structure, Mr. Smith, who is based in New York, will lead BuzzFeed News, and Mr. Frank, who is based in Los Angeles, will oversee a new division called BuzzFeed Entertainment Group. It no longer made sense, Mr. Peretti said in a memo to employees, for BuzzFeed to have \u201ca single \u2018video department. \u2019\u201d Instead, Mr. Smith\u2019s department will have its own news video team, and Mr. Frank\u2019s division will oversee   video, like Tasty food videos, as well as the lists and quizzes that are BuzzFeed\u2019s bread and butter. \u201cAs digital video becomes ubiquitous,\u201d Mr. Peretti wrote in the memo announcing the change, \u201cevery major initiative at BuzzFeed around the world will find an expression as video. \u201d For years, BuzzFeed has been viewed as a digital success story. Its viral content has been the envy of the media industry and its business model, built on   native advertising rather than display ads, enticed brands that wanted to reach younger demographics. It has expanded internationally, with offices in cities including London, S\u00e3o Paulo and Tokyo. Last year, the company received a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal. But BuzzFeed is facing challenges similar to those faced by both traditional and   media companies. In July, BuzzFeed drew 72 million unique visitors in the United States, the lowest number since August 2014, according to the measurement firm comScore. (Mr. Peretti pointed out that comScore\u2019s data did not accurately reflect how many people viewed BuzzFeed\u2019s content across the web and on mobile platforms.) In April, The Financial Times  reported that BuzzFeed had missed its revenue target for 2015 and had halved its projection for this year. BuzzFeed has disputed the report, but has not provided its own numbers. \u201cThe number we set at the beginning of the year we\u2019ve been ahead of,\u201d Mr. Peretti said, \u201cand we\u2019re happy with where we are as a business. \u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s decision to separate its news and entertainment divisions follows similar moves by media companies like News Corporation and Tribune Company, raising the question of whether BuzzFeed would   or even spin off its news operation. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in legacy organizations the splitting off of what might be deemed to be less profitable news and more profitable entertainment divisions,\u201d said Emily Bell, the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia. \u201cIf you were being very positive,\u2019\u2019 she said of BuzzFeed\u2019s reorganization, \u201cyou might say perhaps they\u2019re going to find a way to make news sustainable in the long term. When you start enumerating what\u2019s very positive about it, you can also see that this isn\u2019t necessarily an    piece of good news. \u201d Ms. Bell added, \u201cWhat this underlines in a way is what everybody else is experiencing, which is that   news can make money, but it\u2019s a real struggle. \u201d Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeed\u2019s executive chairman, dismissed the idea that BuzzFeed was moving away from news. \u201cWe\u2019re completely 100 percent committed to news as much now as ever,\u201d he said. Interviews with nearly a dozen current and former BuzzFeed employees, including Mr. Peretti, Mr. Smith and Mr. Frank, also reveal deeper reasons for the reorganization, including resource allocation, clarity of reporting lines and an undercurrent of tension between Mr. Frank and Mr. Smith. As BuzzFeed News began producing more video, it largely had to rely on Mr. Frank\u2019s team for resources, an arrangement that at times caused friction. In a telephone interview, Mr. Smith, asked about his relationship with Mr. Frank, said: \u201cMy main relationship with Ze is, I wish he was as  \u2014   I\u2019m trying to think of the right word for it that isn\u2019t pejorative  \u2014   I think he\u2019s built the most successful digital studio ever, easily, by far. \u201d Mr. Frank, in an interview in a conference room at BuzzFeed\u2019s office last Tuesday, said of Mr. Smith: \u201cI love him. \u201d He added, \u201cI consider Ben to be a sort of genius in a space that I don\u2019t totally understand. \u201d Mr. Peretti acknowledged that tension existed, but said it was inevitable at a growing media company. \u201cI think that people will sometimes think things are personal rather than organizational,\u201d he said. Mr. Peretti said he thought that there was a period when \u201cthe team in L. A. which was the team that was making all the video, felt that they were part of the cool new thing. \u201d Some employees, including Mr. Peretti, acknowledged there was tension between Tasty, the successful cooking channel overseen by Mr. Frank, and BuzzFeed Food, which was introduced in 2012 and ran under Mr. Smith\u2019s oversight. With the overhaul, Mr. Smith will gain his own news video team, run by one of Mr. Frank\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Henry Goldman. \u201cThere are logistical things that I think this will resolve,\u201d Mark Schoofs, the investigations and projects editor, said. A graduate of the MIT Media Lab and a   of The Huffington Post, Mr. Peretti started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a kind of laboratory for shareable content. Not until late 2011 did BuzzFeed begin building its news side when it announced it had hired Mr. Smith, a star political reporter at Politico. Over the last several years, BuzzFeed has added a business team, a science team and an investigative team led by Mr. Schoofs, a Pulitzer Prize winner. At the same time, it has also pushed aggressively into video and entertainment. One factor in any perceived strain at BuzzFeed is the company\u2019s rapid growth, executives said. It now has more than 1, 300 employees across the globe. Still, several current and former employees said some responsibilities across the company were not clearly defined, and there were complaints that salaries were inconsistent. The company hired a compensation consultant, and many employees on the news and editorial side recently received raises. BuzzFeed has framed the reorganization as an investment in the news division. Mr. Smith said that the company was \u201cdoubling down on news\u201d and that he intended to \u201cstick around as long as they\u2019ll let me. \u201d The company is expanding its newsroom at its new offices near Union Square, where construction signs abound and metal gates cordon off the area. Elsewhere in the building, cat images are pasted to the walls. Conference rooms are named after emojis and internet memes, suggesting that even as BuzzFeed takes stock of its future, it is still very much devoted to the things that made it BuzzFeed from the beginning.'"}, "time": 1742628530.718526}
