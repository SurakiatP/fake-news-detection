To the extent that a Trump Doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this: don\u2019t get roped in by doctrine. In a week in which he hosted foreign heads of state and launched a cruise missile strike against Syria\u2019s government, Mr. Trump dispensed with his own dogma and forced other world leaders to   their assumptions about how the United States will lead in this new era. He demonstrated a highly improvisational and situational approach that could inject a risky unpredictability into relations with potential antagonists, but he also opened the door to a more traditional American engagement with the world that eases allies\u2019 fears. As a private citizen and candidate, Mr. Trump spent years arguing that Syria\u2019s civil war was not America\u2019s problem, that Russia should be a friend, and that China was an \u201cenemy\u201d whose leaders should not be invited to dinner. As president, Mr. Trump, in the space of just days, involved America more directly in the Syrian morass than ever before, opened a new acrimonious rift with Russia, and invited China\u2019s leader for a largely convivial, let\u2019   dinner at his Florida estate. In the process, Mr. Trump upended domestic politics as well. He rejected the nationalist wing of his own White House, led by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, who opposes entanglement in Middle East conflicts beyond fighting terrorism and favors punitive trade measures against Beijing. And Mr. Trump, by launching the strike on Russia\u2019s ally Syria, undercut critics who have portrayed him as a Manchurian candidate doing the bidding of President Vladimir V. Putin after the Kremlin intervened in last year\u2019s election on his behalf. Given his unpredictability, none of this means that Mr. Trump has pivoted permanently in any of these areas. The White House has prepared an executive order that the president may sign in the coming days targeting countries like China that dump steel in the American market. And Mr. Trump is sending Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Tuesday to Moscow, where he will have the additional task of trying to smooth over the rancor of recent days, in addition to exploring whether Russia could be a real partner in battling the Islamic State in Syria. Moreover, the missile strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack, was intended to be a limited,   operation, and the president seemed determined to quickly move on. After announcing the attack Thursday evening, he made no mention of it Friday during public appearances, nor on Saturday during his weekly address. As of Saturday afternoon, the   president had not even taunted President Bashar   of Syria online, although he did thank the American troops who carried out the missile strike and defended the decision not to target the runway at the air base that was hit. \u201cOur decisions,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Saturday address, \u201cwill be guided by our values and our goals  \u2014   and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. \u201d That concept, flexibility, seems key to understanding Mr. Trump. He hates to be boxed in, as he mused in the Rose Garden last week while contemplating the first new military operation of his presidency with geopolitical consequences. \u201cI like to think of myself as a very flexible person,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t have to have one specific way. \u201d He made clear he cherished unpredictability. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say where I\u2019m going and what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. That flexibility was a hallmark of his rise in real estate, and if critics preferred the word erratic, it did not bother Mr. Trump  \u2014   it has since worked well enough to vault him to the White House. But now that he is commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful nation, leaders around the world are trying to detect a method to the man. \u201cThere is no emerging doctrine for Trump foreign policy in a classical sense,\u201d said Kathleen H. Hicks, a former Pentagon official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThere are, however, clear emerging characteristics consistent with the attributes of the man himself: unpredictable, instinctual and undisciplined. \u201d On Syria, Mr. Trump had mocked President Barack Obama for setting a \u201cred line\u201d against the use of chemical weapons and urged him not to launch a punitive strike against Syria after Mr. Assad crossed it in 2013. That attack, with a death toll of 1, 400, dwarfed last week\u2019s toll of 84. And just days before last week\u2019s attack, Mr. Tillerson indicated that Washington would accept Mr. Assad\u2019s remaining in power. Indeed, critics, including Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, argued that Mr. Assad felt free to launch a chemical attack precisely because Mr. Trump\u2019s administration had given him a green light. Russia, critics added, did not constrain Mr. Assad because it has had a blank check from an overly friendly Trump administration. And Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to bar Syrian refugees from the United States, they said, sent a signal that he did not care about them. \u201cPresident Trump seems not to have thought through any of this, or have any kind of broader strategy, but rather to have launched a military strike based on a sudden, emotional decision,\u201d Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in an article for The Huffington Post on Saturday. Mr. Assad is not the only leader testing Mr. Trump. North Korea has   missile after missile in recent weeks, almost as if trying to get Mr. Trump\u2019s attention. So far, he has been measured in his response, urging President Xi Jinping of China during his visit to do more to rein in North Korea. But national security aides have also prepared options for Mr. Trump if China does not take a more assertive stance, including reintroducing nuclear weapons in South Korea. Mr. Trump\u2019s action in Syria was welcomed by many traditional American allies who had fretted over Mr. Obama\u2019s reluctance to take a greater leadership role in the Middle East, and feared that Mr. Trump would withdraw even more. After the missile strike, Israeli news outlets were filled with headlines like \u201cThe Americans Are Back,\u201d and European leaders expressed relief both that he had taken action and that he had not gone too far. \u201cWe have learned that Trump is not so isolationist as many Europeans feared he would be  \u2014   he appears to care about victims of a gas attack in Syria,\u201d said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform in London. \u201cWe have learned that he understands that U. S. influence had suffered from the perception  \u2014   which grew under Obama  \u2014   that it was a power weakened by its reluctance to use force. \u201d That touches on another animating factor as Mr. Trump deals with foreign challenges  \u2014   doing the opposite of whatever Mr. Obama did. Mr. Trump\u2019s first instinct after the Syrian chemical attack was to blame Mr. Obama for not enforcing his red line, never mind that Mr. Trump had urged him not to at the time. Even as he announced the missile strike on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that his predecessor\u2019s handling of Syria had \u201cfailed very dramatically. \u201d Intentionally or not, though, Mr. Trump adopted language similar to that used by Mr. Obama and many other presidents in defining American priorities. While in the past Mr. Trump said the United States did not have a national interest in Syria, last week he said instability there was \u201cthreatening the United States and its allies. \u201d He also said that \u201cAmerica stands for justice,\u201d effectively espousing a responsibility to act in cases of human rights abuses, as other presidents have at times. Until now, Mr. Trump has largely eschewed such language. Just three days earlier, he had hosted Egypt\u2019s authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah   and made no public mention of the thousands of people the Cairo government has imprisoned in a political crackdown. \u201cWhat is striking to me is a subtle yet clear shift away from the rhetoric of pure American   narrowly defined, as espoused by candidate Donald Trump,\u201d said Robert Danin, a former Middle East negotiator who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhat has emerged is a new language of American leadership in the world that we have not heard before from President Trump. \u201d Mr. Grant and others noted that the strike, coming as Mr. Trump shared a meal with Mr. Xi, could resonate in Asia as well, leaving North Korea to wonder whether the president might resort to force to stop its development of ballistic missiles. But Ms. Hicks said Mr. Trump\u2019s flexibility  \u2014   or unpredictability  \u2014   was itself \u201cextremely risky. \u201d If other countries cannot accurately predict what an American president will do, she said, they may act precipitously, citing the example of China\u2019s extending its maritime claims in the South China Sea. \u201cImagine if Donald Trump then took exception in ways they didn\u2019t anticipate and major wars ensued,\u201d she said. \u201cBright lines, derived from clear interests and enforced well, are generally best, and I don\u2019t think Donald Trump likes to be constrained by bright lines. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562441.3391135}
