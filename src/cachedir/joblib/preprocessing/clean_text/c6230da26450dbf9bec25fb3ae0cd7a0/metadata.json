Trump have disagreements with him on policy. There were serious questions, efforts at diversion with humor, and   statements by senators. Overall, though, none of the nominees made any major mistakes, and one of them, James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, was approved as Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary by the Senate Armed Services Committee, 24 to 3. Fun fact: He doesn\u2019t care for the nickname \u201cMad Dog. \u201d \u25a0 Mr. Mattis diverged sharply from his prospective boss on Russia, calling Moscow one of the top threats to the   world order. \u201cI\u2019m all for engagement,\u201d Mr. Mattis said, \u201cbut we also have to recognize reality in terms of what Russia is up to. \u201d \u25a0 Mr. Mattis also put daylight between himself and Mr. Trump on NATO and indicated strong support for the alliance\u2019s principle of collective defense. \u201cMy view is that nations with allies thrive, and nations without allies don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u25a0 Mr. Mattis said he supported the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized. \u25a0 And finally, he said that he had no intention of revisiting the Obama administration\u2019s decisions on social issues at the Defense Department, like the opening of combat roles to women. \u25a0 Representative Mike Pompeo, the Kansas Republican who is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for director of the C. I. A. said the agency would pursue information about efforts by Russia to interfere with the American election, including any possible links to the Trump campaign. \u201cI promise I will pursue the facts wherever they take us,\u201d he said. \u25a0 In a reversal, Mr. Pompeo said emphatically that he would not endorse torture, including coercive methods like waterboarding. Mr. Pompeo had previously said he did not believe waterboarding was torture, and that it was legal. \u25a0 Mr. Pompeo signaled that he agreed with the assessment of United States intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, describing the report that was delivered last week to Mr. Trump and President Obama as \u201csound. \u201d \u25a0 Ben Carson\u2019s confirmation hearing for secretary of housing and urban development was not attended by Mr. Trump. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, directed biting comments at the  . Ms. Warren, while accusing Mr. Trump of hiding his assets, repeatedly asked Mr. Carson if he would commit to keeping taxpayers\u2019 dollars away from Trump businesses. \u25a0 Mr. Carson successfully parried questions about whether someone who had gained acclaim as neurosurgeon was qualified to oversee the vast federal housing agency. Though he has no background in housing, he avoided any major stumbles. \u25a0 Democrats seemed to take it a bit easy on Mr. Carson, with some talking about his young granddaughter attending and others questioning him without being too adversarial.'"}, "time": 1742563141.5129004}
