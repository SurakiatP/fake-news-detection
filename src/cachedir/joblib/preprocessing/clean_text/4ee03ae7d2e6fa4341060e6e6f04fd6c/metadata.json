He added that Trump promoted the first woman to be the head of a construction company. \\nGiuliani then went on to say that it\u2019s Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton who has a problem.   \\n\u201cShe should look in the mirror if she thinks we all have implicit bias. Hillary, I have news for you. I don\u2019t (have bias). Maybe you do. I have no racial guilt.
