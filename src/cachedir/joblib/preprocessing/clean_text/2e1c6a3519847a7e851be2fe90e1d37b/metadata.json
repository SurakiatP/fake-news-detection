On Sunday we got another extended seminar in the art of prisoner breaking, Savior style. This time it was Daryl\u2019s turn, and unlike the zombie fighting, ax fetching and son threatening Rick faced, Daryl\u2019s program involved a steady diet of dog food sandwiches, terribly cheery pop songs and the occasional beating. Despite all of that and his emotional agony about provoking Glenn\u2019s murder, Daryl was not willing to subjugate himself to the Saviors. Which is to say, we learned he was tough. Of course, we already knew that. The creators of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d often talk about wanting to put the audience inside the show  \u2014   they used it to defend the Glenn Dumpster shenanigans, the   gimmickry of the Negan cliffhanger, the appalling violence in the season premiere. After that one, Scott M. Gimple, the showrunner, spoke on \u201cThe Talking Dead\u201d about \u201clooking for a way to break the audience\u201d so they would believe Rick would do Negan\u2019s bidding. While Daryl stayed strong on Sunday, the show definitely broke me with all the dog food and sound torture, though perhaps not in the way it intended. If you put us through a wringer without showing us anything revelatory about the character in question, it just gets annoying and worse: boring. So allow me to say \u201cI\u2019m Negan,\u201d or whomever I need to be in order to avoid more \u201cbreaking\u201d episodes. Sunday\u2019s hour was broadly intended to introduce us to life in the Sanctuary, the Savior stronghold with a general atmosphere signaled by the title of the montage song: \u201cTown Called Malice\u201d by the Jam. We saw Dwight, the former Savior escapee turned conflicted   cuckold, enjoying a spoils sandwich as Negan\u2019s other minions drank and fought. The ballad of Dwight was the other main thread of the evening. You\u2019ll recall that we  \u2014   along with Daryl  \u2014   met him, Sherry and Tina last season during their flight from Negan, with Tina\u2019s insulin in tow. Tina met her end when she flopped onto a pair of walkers. After evading a Savior search party, with Daryl\u2019s help, Dwight and his wife, Sherry, betrayed him, taking his motorcycle and precious crossbow. On Sunday Negan filled in the blanks, explaining to Daryl, at great length, that the couple eventually returned to the Sanctuary and were punished for their crimes: Negan took Dwight\u2019s wife for himself and fried his face for good measure, cowing him into productive subordination. \u201cNow look at him,\u201d Negan told Daryl. \u201cOne of my top guys, and we are totally cool. \u201d That\u2019s what he thinks, maybe. We already knew that Dwight wasn\u2019t thrilled by the trappings of the Sanctuary because he said as much last year. \u201cPeople will do anything for safety,\u201d he told Daryl the first time he met him. We now know what \u201canything\u201d entails  \u2014   lots of kneeling, bullying and being bullied, and, for the most luckless residents, tending or serving on the colony\u2019s wall of walkers. Dwight didn\u2019t look any happier about any of that on Sunday, spending most of the episode emotionally ambiguous at best. Sent to recover another escapee, he offers a halfhearted    defense of the Saviors  \u2014   \u201cwe were losing now we\u2019re not\u201d  \u2014   before shooting the man in the back. And his hostility toward Daryl came across as a combination of   and projected   Daryl\u2019s inner strength a rebuke to the moral compromises Dwight made for his sandwich privileges. \u201cI ain\u2019t never gonna kneel,\u201d Daryl said. \u201cYeah I said that, too,\u201d Dwight said. By the end, Daryl gave Dwight a pass for his choices. But could a day be coming when the   one borrows some of Daryl\u2019s strength and makes a move? \u2022 For the record, that unnervingly upbeat tune of torture was a previously unreleased song called \u201cEasy Street. \u201d (You may know the vocalist, Petra Haden, from bands like That Dog or the Decemberists.) It\u2019s now available on iTunes, in case you hate your neighbors. \u2022 Remember the Polaroid we saw a Savior taking at the end of the premiere? So does Daryl, now that Dwight has given it to him. Playing \u201cCrying\u201d in that scene was a bit on the nose, as they say, though it feels churlish to note it. I didn\u2019t love this episode, but Norman Reedus gave a moving performance throughout. \u2022 As zombie attacks go, I enjoyed the      bit. \u2022 That said, are we supposed to think the motorcycle just falling over caused all that damage? And what are we to make of the shooting? Was it a mercy killing? Or did Dwight shoot the escapee in the back in order to preserve him for the wall? It wasn\u2019t clear to me. \u2022 What did you think? What\u2019s next for Daryl? Will he and Dwight team up? Which song, played incessantly, would break you? (This is mine.) Please feel free to weigh in the comments.'"}, "time": 1742628457.534931}
