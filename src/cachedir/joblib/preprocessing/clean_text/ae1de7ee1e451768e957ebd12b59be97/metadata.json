Trump said on Wednesday that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was still in the running to become his secretary of state despite their bitter differences during the campaign, as he narrowed his choices and planned an announcement next week for the crucial post. \u201cWe had some tremendous difficulty together, and now I think we\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Romney in a telephone interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, where it was announced that Time magazine had named the   its \u201cPerson of the Year. \u201d Mr. Trump said the   selection process and highly publicized flirtation with Mr. Romney was not intended to torment a campaign nemesis but rather to find the right person to serve as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat. \u201cIt\u2019s not about revenge, it\u2019s about what\u2019s good for the country, and I\u2019m able to put this stuff behind us,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Nearly a month after his stunning election upset ended a bitterly divisive presidential race, Mr. Trump flatly refused any responsibility for the rifts, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not president yet, so I didn\u2019t do anything to divide. \u201d But in the interview with Time, Mr. Trump repeated some of the harsh talk that marked his unorthodox campaign, and he declined to criticize or contradict President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who has called President Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and has been accused of waging a campaign of extrajudicial killings of thousands of people suspected of being drug dealers. Told that his promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants who kill and rape Americans echo Mr. Duterte\u2019s talk about annihilating drug dealers and users, Mr. Trump did not dispute the comparison. \u201cWell, hey, look, this is bad stuff,\u201d he told Time. \u201cThey slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl\u2019s forehead, O. K.? What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?\u201d He also rejected the conclusion of United States intelligence officials who had said Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails released on WikiLeaks, saying he thought that conclusion was driven by politics. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said of the Russians. The interview came as Mr. Trump continued to fill out the ranks of his administration with loyalists who will play pivotal roles. He told donors at a private   at the restaurant Cipriani in Manhattan that Terry E. Branstad, the governor of Iowa and an early supporter of his campaign, would be the United States ambassador to China, a crucial post managing a complex relationship that Mr. Trump has indicated he is willing to shake up even further. Mr. Trump also said he would have more \u201cbig announcements\u201d on personnel on Wednesday and Thursday. Another contender for secretary of state, he said on \u201cToday,\u201d is Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, whom he called a \u201cgreat, great gentleman\u201d who has \u201cbuilt a tremendous company over a period of years with great style. \u201d He said he had ruled out \u201cin my own mind\u201d other prominent candidates who have been considered for the post  \u2014   a group that includes Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former C. I. A. director Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations  \u2014   but he declined to say which ones. One day after picking a fight on Twitter with Boeing over the cost of developing the next generation of Air Force One, Mr. Trump said he had spoken to officials at the company and would insist on a   aircraft or cancel the contract. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work it out, but you know that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to negotiate prices, and the planes are too expensive, and we\u2019re going to get the prices down, and if we don\u2019t get the prices down, we\u2019re not going to order them. \u201d He also explained his apparent decision in June, divulged by a member of his transition team on Tuesday, to sell all of his stock holdings, a move he said he made to avoid \u201ctremendous\u201d potential conflicts of interest in the event he won the election. \u201cI don\u2019t think its appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I\u2019m making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Time magazine\u2019s article branded him the president of the \u201cdivided states of America,\u201d a characterization Mr. Trump denounced as \u201csnarky. \u201d \u201cWhen you say divided states of America, I didn\u2019t divide them,\u201d Mr. Trump told NBC. \u201cThey\u2019re divided now, there\u2019s a lot of division, and we\u2019re going to put it back together, and we\u2019re going to have a country that\u2019s very well healed. \u201d In the interview with Time, he suggested he was willing to moderate some of his   campaign stances and adjust others to appeal to a broader portion of Americans. Mr. Trump, whose campaign was fueled largely by promises to build a wall on the country\u2019s southern border and deport those who came in illegally, said he would like to find an accommodation for the undocumented young people  \u2014   often referred to as Dreamers  \u2014   who were brought to the United States as children. After Mr. Obama took executive action to create a program granting them legal status, many of those who came forward to register now worry that they could be easily found and deported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Mr. Trump told Time. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in   land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. \u201d On economic policy, Mr. Trump suggested that a major new infrastructure and tax package could serve as stimulus  \u2014   \u201cYou have to prime the pump\u201d to create jobs and accelerate growth, he told Time  \u2014   just as Mr. Obama\u2019s $787 billion economic recovery package was intended to do when he took office in 2009. Mr. Trump told NBC that he had developed a tight rapport with Mr. Obama, with whom he has had a \u201cvery good dialogue\u201d about policy ideas and personnel choices. \u201cI take his recommendations very seriously,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama.'"}, "time": 1742561983.3545926}
