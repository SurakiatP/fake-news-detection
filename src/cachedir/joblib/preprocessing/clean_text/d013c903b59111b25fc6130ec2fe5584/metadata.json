In the vote on Thursday, European lawmakers played    in their dispute with the United States, demanding restrictions on American travelers unless the Trump administration lifts travel requirements for citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland and Romania. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about citizens from countries, like Poland, with a major diaspora\u201d in the United States, Claude Moraes, the British lawmaker who leads the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the European Parliament, said in a telephone interview on Friday. \u201cYou\u2019re really seeing frustration and anger, and without any timetable, this is becoming increasingly seen as   treatment. \u201d The resolution, while nonbinding, was an important political signal, and it increases pressure on the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive body, to confront the new administration in Washington, even though it may prove to be as intransigent on the matter as the Obama administration, if not more. The European Parliament also warned that it could take the further step of bringing the European Commission to court if it continues not to stand up to Washington. \u201cOnly when the U. S. fully gets that the European Commission is going to act are we going to get any kind of timetable from the United States,\u201d Mr. Moraes said. \u201cAt the moment, the U. S. just believes the commission is not going to act but stick with the pragmatic argument that doing so would create damage that\u2019s just too great. \u201d He continued, referring to Washington, \u201cThere\u2019s no denying heightened concern about the current administration, but that\u2019s more about uncertainty about who\u2019s in charge and how the State Department is working. \u201d Mr. Moraes said the civil liberties committee could still recommend within two months that a case against the commission\u2019s failure to act be brought to the bloc\u2019s highest tribunal, the Court of Justice of the European Union. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of using what options are open to us,\u201d he said, explaining the possible resort to litigation. In the vote on Thursday, the Parliament gave the European Commission two months to take legal measures to impose visas for American travelers to the European Union unless the Americans offered reciprocity to all citizens from the bloc. European officials in Brussels have balked at making travel to Europe more difficult for Americans, saying doing so would have an economic cost and would most likely not even resolve the hurdles facing citizens of the five affected countries. The Parliament\u2019s measure was approved in a show of hands and was not expected to worsen the standoff with the United States. But in the event that the court in Luxembourg were to rule in favor of Parliament, the commission might be forced to impose visa requirements on Americans. The Trump administration, finding itself in a    battle over access, would then almost certainly do the same for travelers from the European Union. In 2014, the European Commission was notified that the United States and four other countries  \u2014   Australia, Brunei, Canada and Japan  \u2014   were failing to provide reciprocal,   travel to citizens of some European Union countries. Australia, Brunei and Japan have resolved differences with the European Union, and an agreement with Canada is expected to take effect in December for all citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, according to a statement from the European Parliament. Margaritis Schinas, the chief spokesman for the commission, appeared to tamp down any expectations that it would impose visa requirements on Americans within two months, as outlined in the Parliament resolution. Instead, he said he advocated \u201ccontinued engagement and patient diplomatic contacts\u201d with Washington. The commission will issue a progress report on discussions with the United States, he added, but not before the end of June.'"}, "time": 1742563193.2101917}
