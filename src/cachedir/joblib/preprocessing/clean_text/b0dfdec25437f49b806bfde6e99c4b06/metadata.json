I repeat this to myself regularly because I believe it; I believe in the power of action. Most people fully understand the importance of action, no matter how unproductive they might be. \\nThe difficulty is often in finding the motivation to initiate action. Not everyone is born naturally motivated, but we all need this driving force behind us if we\u2019re going to succeed in doing just about anything we dream of doing. In fact, much of our life trajectory depends on our ability to harness motivation so that it yields action. Are you killing your own motivation? \\nIf you catch yourself entertaining any of the motivation-zapping thoughts below, stop that unhelpful voice in your head dead in its tracks and reset! What I Want Is For Other People, Not Me. I\u2019ve been an artist all of my life. Ever since I was a child, I wanted to make \u201ca living\u201d out of creating, and thus, all of my life, I occasionally come across people who try to convince me that the life of an artist is one for rich folks or crazy people or beautiful elites or some other kind of person that just isn\u2019t me. Luckily, I haven\u2019t spent much time listening to those people. However, every once in a while, especially if I\u2019m already feeling down, that thought pattern will make its way into my head. Learn this now: no matter your background, you are entitled to the opportunity to work toward what you want. I Don\u2019t Have The Resources. Maybe you think you don\u2019t have the time, the energy, the right space, the money, or any other type of resource or support you need to put your ideas into action. And maybe you\u2019re right. But be honest with yourself: it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re just making excuses. There are solutions to most problems like these, so find them and embrace them. Improve your time management skills, get some help with your other tasks (delegate!), secure the space and equipment you need \u2013 even if you have to borrow it, pinch pennies, find financing, look for a new job, exercise daily for an energy boost \u2013 just do whatever it takes. If the idea is important enough to you, you\u2019ll find a way to uplift it with action. I\u2019ll Do It Eventually. There is no eventually. There is no guarantee that you will be here tomorrow. If you can begin today, get the show on the road! Meet this motivation-zapping thought with rebellion and give your idea the green light today. I\u2019m Not Good Enough. Maybe you think you don\u2019t have the talent, intelligence, or charisma it takes to bring your idea into fruition? Think again. The biggest thing standing between you and your goal is not your raw skill, but your willingness to actively participate in your own idea. As they say, showing up is half of the battle (I think it\u2019s most of the battle). Most people who are good at something didn\u2019t get that way without practice. You have to begin cutting your teeth somewhere! The main reason others might be more skilled than you are at something specific is because they do it regularly and you do not. There are exceptions, of course, but this is usually the case. 3 Common Vegetable Garden Planning Mistakes \\nAre you planning a vegetable garden?
