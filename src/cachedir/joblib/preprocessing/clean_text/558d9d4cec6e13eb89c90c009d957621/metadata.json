But Timothy Trespas, an    recording engineer in his early 40s, was sure he was being stalked, and not by just one person, but dozens of them. He would see the operatives, he said, disguised as ordinary people, lurking around his Midtown Manhattan neighborhood. Sometimes they bumped into him and whispered nonsense into his ear, he said. \u201cNow you see how it works,\u201d they would say. At first, Mr. Trespas wondered if it was all in his head. Then he encountered a large community of   people on the internet who call themselves \u201ctargeted individuals,\u201d or T. I. s, who described going through precisely the same thing. The group was organized around the conviction that its members are victims of a sprawling conspiracy to harass thousands of everyday Americans with   weapons and armies of   gang stalkers. The goal, as one   website put it, is \u201cto destroy every aspect of a targeted individual\u2019s life. \u201d Mental health professionals say the narrative has taken hold among a group of people experiencing psychotic symptoms that have troubled the human mind since time immemorial. Except now victims are connecting on the internet, organizing and defying medical explanations for what\u2019s happening to them. The community, conservatively estimated to exceed 10, 000 members, has proliferated since   cradled by the internet and fed by genuine concerns over government surveillance. A large number appear to have delusional disorder or schizophrenia, psychiatrists say. Yet, the phenomenon remains virtually unresearched. For the few specialists who have looked closely, these individuals represent an alarming development in the history of mental illness: thousands of sick people, banded together and demanding recognition on the basis of shared paranoias. They raise money, hold awareness campaigns, host international conferences and fight for their causes in courts and legislatures. Perhaps their biggest victory came last year, when believers in Richmond, Calif. persuaded the City Council to pass a resolution banning   weapons that they believe could be used for mind control. A similar lobbying effort is underway in Tucson. Dr. Lorraine Sheridan, who is   of perhaps the only study of   said the community poses a danger that sets it apart from other groups promoting troubling ideas, such as anorexia or suicide. On those topics, the internet abounds with medical information and treatment options. An internet search for \u201c\u201d however, turns up page after page of results that regard it as fact. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary for me is that there are no counter sites that try and convince targeted individuals that they are delusional,\u201d Dr. Sheridan said. \u201cThey end up in a closed ideology echo chamber,\u201d she said. In instructional tracts online, veterans of the movement explain the ropes to rookies: \u2022 Do not engage with the voices in your head. \u2022 If your relatives tell you you\u2019re imagining things, they could be in on it. \u2022 \u201cDo not visit a psychiatrist. \u201d The tribe cuts across all classes and professions, and includes lawyers, soldiers, artists and engineers. In Facebook forums and   support groups, they commiserate over the skepticism of their loved ones and share stories of black vans that circle the block or   conscripted into the campaign. They have   dozens of   with titles like \u201cTortured in America\u201d and \u201cMy Life Changed Forever. \u201d In hundreds of YouTube videos they offer testimonials and try to document evidence of their stalking, even confronting unsuspecting strangers. \u201cThey wanted to basically destroy me, and they did,\u201d a young mother in Phoenix says in one video, choking back tears. She lost custody of her daughter and was sent to a behavioral health hospital, says the woman, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy. \u201cBut I am going to fight back for the rest of my life. \u201d She adds, \u201cAnd guess what, I\u2019m not crazy. \u201d Dr. Sheridan\u2019s study, written with Dr. David James, a forensic psychiatrist, examined 128 cases of reported  . It found all the subjects were most likely delusional. \u201cOne has to think of the T. I. phenomenon in terms of people with paranoid symptoms who have hit upon the   idea as an explanation of what is happening to them,\u201d Dr. James said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the community is divided over the contours of the conspiracy. Some believe the financial elite is behind it. Others blame aliens, their neighbors, Freemasons or some combination. The movement\u2019s most prominent voices, however, tend to believe the surveillance is part of a   field test done in preparation for global domination. The military establishment, the theory goes, never gave up on the ambitions of MK Ultra, the C. I. A. \u2019s infamous program to control the mind in the 1950s and \u201960s. A leading proponent of that view is an anesthesiologist from San Antonio named John Hall. In his 2009 book, \u201cA New Breed: Satellite Terrorism in America,\u201d Dr. Hall gave his own account of being targeted. Agents bleached his water, he wrote, and bombarded him with voices making murderous threats. The book made a splash because of the messenger: a licensed member of the medical establishment who was telling those who feel targeted that psychiatrists were misleading them. A janitor knows as much about the human mind, he wrote. Dr. Hall, 51, was invited for an interview on \u201cCoast to Coast AM,\u201d a   radio show based in California that is said to reach millions of listeners. After that, he said, \u201cI had probably three or 4, 000 emails from people saying: \u2018It\u2019s happening to me in this state.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s happening to me in Florida.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s happening to me in California.\u2019 \u201d The similarities of the cases spoke to a   campaign, he said. \u201cIf the psychiatrists want to say that this is schizophrenia or delusional disorder, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut every one of these victims have the same story. \u201d While Dr. Hall has faced scrutiny from the Texas Medical Board over his mental fitness, he retains his license. Over time, however, many others who identify as   victims end up out of work. They are mocked by colleagues, tolerated by family. Friends and spouses fall away. The despair that results has led some to lash out in violence. Many in the community, for example, are convinced that Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, was a victim. Mr. Alexis, a former sailor, left behind a document accusing the Navy of attacking his brain with \u201cextremely low frequency\u201d electromagnetic waves. On the side of his shotgun were etched the words \u201cmy elf weapon. \u201d It was unclear when Myron May\u2019s mental distress began, but by the fall of 2014, it had become too much. He quit his job as a prosecutor in New Mexico and traveled to Florida. There, he videotaped a testimonial about how   had ruined his life. \u201cAs you can see right now,\u201d he says into the camera, \u201cI am totally not crazy. \u201d Laying out his case, he describes an episode at a gas station where he believed somebody in dark glasses was mimicking his movements. \u201cIt was really creepy,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I did, he did. \u201d Later in the video, he prays for forgiveness for his future sins. \u201cFather,\u201d he says, \u201cright now I ask that you look down on all the targeted individuals across the globe. Help them to cope with this madness. \u201d On Nov. 20, 2014, Mr. May walked into a library at Florida State University, where he had graduated in 2005, and shot three people, leaving one paralyzed. He dared the police to kill him, then fired in their direction before being fatally shot, officials said. He was 31. The vast majority of people with psychosis never resort to violence. Still, studies suggest that a small number of those experiencing psychotic episodes  \u2014   especially paranoid thoughts, accompanied by voices making commands  \u2014   are more likely to act on hostile urges than people without a mental illness. Many in the T. I. community, as anyone would, have repudiated the shootings by Mr. Alexis and Mr. May. But some also harbor troubling views about their perceived oppressors. They question how people could be so cruel. Karen Stewart of Tallahassee, Fla. believes large numbers of regular people have been brainwashed by the National Security Agency into thinking that she is a traitor or terrorist. Wherever she goes, she says  \u2014   to church, to the grocery store, to the doctor\u2019s office  \u2014   they are there, watching. It baffles her, she said. But worse, \u201cIt makes me angry to see how many people in this country are sociopaths. They are absolute groupthink drones,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even consider them human anymore. \u201d Susan Clancy, a   psychologist who has researched people who believe they\u2019ve been abducted by aliens, said it could be extremely difficult to dissuade patients who have latched onto beliefs that they think explain their delusions. \u201cI think it\u2019s a need for meaning and a need to understand your life and the problems you\u2019re having,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not some meaningless nobody. You\u2019re being followed by the C. I. A. \u201d In that way, Dr. Clancy said, the behavior shares a trait with religious belief: To abandon it would be life upending. Paula Trespas, Mr. Trespas\u2019s mother, said she avoided debating with him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that he was making up,\u201d she said. \u201cHe really felt the way he felt and experienced what he experienced. I got to the point where I was just finally saying to him: \u2018I\u2019m very, very sad that you have to go through this. I wish that there was something that I could do.\u2019 \u201d The big hope is that society will wake up to what\u2019s happening and put a stop to it, those who feel targeted say. In some cases, they do seek psychiatric help. In others, the delusions subside. For the rest, the prognosis isn\u2019t good, psychiatrists say. Many contemplate suicide. Mr. Trespas, now 49, says he went so far as to prepare a rope. Sitting at a coffee shop in Brooklyn last month, he says the stalking has thankfully quieted down. But he says his harassers have also been seeding his body with Morgellons, a painful, insectlike infestation of the skin that many doctors say is psychosomatic. He is gaunt, with weary, sad eyes. It\u2019s been eight years since it all began, he says. He can\u2019t hold a job. His friends have drifted away. The online community has been a crucial support, he says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s happening,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re believing the wrong thing. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I try to keep my mind open about who and what and why and how. \u201d One thing he is certain of though, he says: He\u2019s not crazy.'"}, "time": 1742628402.0631964}
