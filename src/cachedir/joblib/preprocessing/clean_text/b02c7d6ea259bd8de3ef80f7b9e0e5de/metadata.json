According to the Tulsa World report: \\nA warrant has been issued for her arrest and arrangements made for her surrender. \\nKunzweiler filed the charge after reviewing dash cam video and helicopter video that captured the shooting. He also reviewed citizen 911 calls, witness interviews and other evidence, according to a news release from the District Attorney\u2019s Office. \\n\u201cOfficer Shelby, although now charged, is presumed to be innocent under the law until a judge or jury determines otherwise,\u201d the release states. \\nTulsa, OK \u2014 Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot 40-year-old Terence Crutcher Friday night when he experienced car trouble after leaving night classes at Tulsa Community College \u2014 and now, dash cam video of the shooting shows the man\u2019s arms were in the air when Shelby took his life. \\n\u201cHis hands were in the air from all views,\u201d pastor Rodney Goss of the Morning Star Baptist Church, who viewed footage from both dash cams and a police helicopter prior to the public release, told the Tulsa World . \u201cIt was not apparent from any angle at any point he lunged, came toward, aggressively attacked, or made any sudden movements that would have been considered a threat or life-threatening toward the officer.\u201d \\nPolice had thus far claimed Crutcher \u2014 whose SUV broke down in the middle of the road \u2014 approached the officers aggressively while refusing to obey commands to raise his arms, an action the helicopter pilot notes would perhaps be worthy of deploying the Taser. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s got his hands up for her now,\u201d the pilot says of Crutcher, adding a moment later the man appears uncooperative and may need to be tased. \\nOfficer Tyler Turnbough then deployed his Taser against Crutcher, but Shelby fired before the electric jolt could even knock him to the ground. Video from one patrol car\u2019s dash can and that as seen from a police helicopter circling above clearly shows Crutcher not acting aggressively as the cops surround and then murder him. \\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of minutes, it was a matter of moments,\u201d Goss noted. \u201cAs quick as the officer released the Taser from his hand, Terence was falling to the ground having already been shot.\u201d \\nWorse, he explained, the officers seemed not to treat their victim with any concern, and made no moves to provide first aid after the tasing and shooting. \\n\u201cAfter having been shot, a couple minutes it appears, but it seemed like a lifetime, went by before anyone actually checked with him as far as pulse \u2014 as far as whatever the case may be,\u201d Goss said. \\nPolice on scene indeed appear infinitely more concerned with the panicked Shelby than they do with the man they just shot for no apparent reason, and footage bears out Goss\u2019 statement it takes minutes for officers even to approach the dying man. As Crutcher lies mortally wounded on the ground, officers back away like frightened children, supporting Shelby by the arms. As the helicopter circles overhead, audio of the pilot shows he is quite startled by the inexplicable shooting. \\nGoss explained to the World that Crutcher moved slowly and deliberately throughout his brief interaction with the police. \\nBut the cops\u2019 predilection to employ force might have been a forgone conclusion, as he said, one officer is overheard in audio inexplicably describing Crutcher \u2014 the father of four, who was taking a night class in music appreciation \u2014 as \u201cone bad dude.\u201d \\nAs Goss plainly summarized , \u201cThere was a perception problem before there was ever a shooting.\u201d \\nAlthough authorities had refused to say whether or not a weapon was recovered at the scene, Crutcher\u2019s twin sister, Tiffany insists her brother would not have been armed. \\n\u201cOne fact I do know is that my brother was unarmed,\u201d she asserted in a news conference Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m just devastated.\u201d \\nIn a press conference prior to the release of the video he called \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and \u201chard to watch,\u201d Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan finally confirmed, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you right now, right now, there was no gun on the suspect or in the suspect\u2019s vehicle.\u201d \\nCrutcher\u2019s family, their attorneys, local pastors, and several activists were permitted to view the footage before police released it to the public. \\n\u201cWe wanted them to see it before it was released so they wouldn\u2019t be blindsided by it,\u201d Tulsa Police Sgt. Shane Tuell confirmed, according to ABC News . \u201cWe wanted to be able to have that intimate time with them, with their attorney, to see if they had any questions or concerns. \\n\u201cWith something of this magnitude, we\u2019re trying an approach that we believe is necessary to further that transparency.\u201d \\nShelby, on the force since 2011, and Turnbough, an officer since 2009 \u2014 who were named by police on Sunday \u2014 encountered Crutcher\u2019s stalled SUV as they were responding to another call. Both have been given the paid vacation, otherwise known as administrative leave, customarily \u2018rewarded\u2019 after the use of fatal force. \\n\u201cWe have to let justice take its course,\u201d Goss said prior to the announcement the Department of Justice would conduct an investigation into the fatal shooting. \\nActivists gathered outside the Tulsa County Courthouse to protest the killing of Crutcher and the ballooning epidemic of police violence, while community leaders urged the public to remain calm upon release of footage. \\n\u201cProtests are not a problem,\u201d Chief Jordan told the press. \u201cI grew up in the 60s and it\u2019s a very valid way of people to protect their rights.\u201d \\nWhether calm and justice will ultimately prevail hinges on whether or not Shelby receives proportionate punishment for taking the life of a wholly and utterly innocent man whose only crime \u2014 apparently a capital offense \u2014 was having car trouble at an inopportune moment. \\nThis is what complying with police in America looks like. [ Editor\u2019s note: While it was originally reported by multiple sources Terence Crutcher was a pastor , we have yet to confirm that information and have corrected the article to reflect this.] Share \\ni wonder what that cop dropped? Tom Harder \\nHe didn\u2019t drop anything. That was the suspect hitting the ground. Steve Smith \\nfunny how you call the victim a suspect and not a PASTOR Antonio Cruz \\npastor or not, it remain a suspect, until the end of the investigation. grapesodabanked \\nSuspect of what? He was just a random guy whose car broke down and they ran into him on their way to another call. Antonio Cruz \\ni do not know, what he is suspect of, I do know, in legal matters, is just a denomination for anyone, in any circunstance anywhere. Sillywilly \\nso if your wife or your child breaks down on the side of the road they\u2019re suspect of something huh? Antonio Cruz \\nthe answer is; yes anyone anywhere could be a suspect. Sevalo \\nSo, in your mind, inhaling and exhaling makes one a suspect. Antonio Cruz \\nPlease, for your own good, find a dictionary search for the word and then, come back, right now I am just wasting my time trying to make you understand, it is about semantics. Sevalo \\nFrom your posts that are filled with bad grammar and spelling errors, I suggest you consult not only your dictionary but also William Strunk\u2019s The Elements of Style. Antonio Cruz \\nit might be because, english is not my first language, and my disability includes parcial hand movement and aphasia. in your case is just, the inability to understand your own language. Luke Yi \\nIf you are not familiar with terminology in English perhaps you ought neither correct others\u2019 English, nor weigh in about the legal validity of certain language. \\nLawyers are experts in a very particular language. Luke Yi \\n\u201cperson thought to be guilty of a crime or offense\u201d \\nNice try but you ought to learn to use the dictionary yourself Sillywilly \\nsuspect of what?? Having car trouble? billdeserthills \\nYou must know cops refer to themselves as Us and they refer to us as Them\u2013they lump anybody else with the criminals just like the bunch of stupid gang members they resemble Sillywilly \\nnow that I can agree with BigJohnConnor \\nThe answer is that you are a fucking moron who has no concept of the law or what it means to be a free citizen. Luke Yi \\n\u201cCould be\u201d is distinct from \u201cis\u201d Jordan Manicom \\nHe was only a \u201csuspect\u201d to an assembly of fools. Steve Smith \\nHis morality when he joined the force. Butch Taylor \\nClearing Shelby and Turnbough of any wrong doing is promising to be the white wash cover up of all time. supersajin \\nLooks like paid vacation and a GoFundMe page is in those cops future\u2026 TroothFairy \\nDeath penalty for cops who pull shit like this. Reaves \\nWe can start by comparing whatever initial statement they gave to the videos we have. If an officer is intentionally deceptive, that should be a felony in its own right. TroothFairy \\nCompletely agree. Cops need to be held to a much higher standard than ordinary citizens. d marino \\nThey aren\u2019t being held to ANY damn standard in today\u2019s society. They are literally \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d. billdeserthills \\nMuch like our politicians, they both break their oath of office all the time Jan Miller Saylors \\nI think some of the above comments would certainly apply to Hillary Clinton,talk about above the law\u2026\u2026There is no excuse to shoot an unarmed person with his hands up in the air,that is cooperating with the officer. Kevin Rogers \\nBut he wasn\u2019t cooperating with the officer\u2026 Officers don\u2019t follow you to your vehicle when they feel threatened, they tell you to get on the ground. Christopher Pacella \\nthey are they take a oath and there word in a court of law means more then yours d marino \\nThey lie, a lot, even in court. Just like our high officials lie in court and nothing happens to the criminals of power (the cops, the lawyers, the Congressmen, the Judges, the President, etc.). edslides \\nYE and that is NOT discrimination. its called respect. it is expected of citizens, BUT doubly so, righteously so, for a man that swears an oath to uphold the law. accident? accidents have consequences. I kill a guy, i go to jail, period. read a few of your comments lately tooth fairy. you head is bolted on solid. it nauseates me how the cop had more compassion for the stupid fucking cunt that killed an innocent man that he/she/they had for the man they just shot. i AM SO FUCKING PISSED. David Hall \\nI am too, it just makes me want to puke. The sight of all the pussies cuddling up to the cunt that just murdered a man is beyond fucking words. All they cared about was her. The man is dying and they don\u2019t give a fuck. And the low life scumbags wobder why America is against them and wants to kill all of them, every day we see why. This one takes it to a new low, even for the POS cowards and bullies. It really just makes me so fucking mad I could kill all of them POS and never lose a nights sleep. I used to wonder why guys would say when a cop was killed, good riddance\u2026now I know why! What the fuck is the matter with the low IQ POS cops in the U.S. Thank God I don\u2019t live in America. They have a real problem. soulshadow55 \\nDavid, I totally agree with you. Just out of curiosity, what country do you live in? Lliss \\nSpoken by a guy who\u2019s been arrested several times! lol Reinhold Von Kirschmann \\nShe was charged with murder. Where\u2019s your big mouth now? Point \\nHmm\u2026 You sound like someone who would definitely leave a dying person unhelped \u2013 possibly even cause a person to die in the first place. Which makes essentially indistinguishable from the subjects your essay. Luke Yi \\nThat\u2019s not a very careful reading of the text, or the subtext, of david hall\u2019s comment Point \\nI\u2019m not certain there is much subtext to read from Mr. Hall\u2019s post; I take his post as his pure and unadulterated feelings. He states the following: \\n\u201cIt really just makes me so fucking mad I could kill all of them POS and never lose a nights sleep.\u201d \\nIf I ever deliberately caused harm to a person, I know I\u2019d never have a proper night\u2019s sleep again. The idea that Mr. Hall would feel good about the killings of multiple people \u2013 let alone his own proposal to do it himself \u2013 seems to me precisely the mindset that supports the continued killing of people. Justsomeguy151 \\nIt\u2019s called justice, that\u2019s why you hate it. Point \\nOh, that\u2019s justice? Please, tell me more about your beliefs or opinions regarding justice. I am eager to hear them. \\nIt sounds suspiciously though, that if we all agreed to follow your concept of \u201cjustice,\u201d that we would end up with one, solitary, very sad person. The last person, and the only one to actually experience this \u201cjustice.\u201d And frankly, the only reason he\u2019s left is because there\u2019s no one left to blow his brains out. Luke Yi \\nI think that was david halls point by the way\u2013that this cycle of violence, which is being perpetrated in part under the auspices of the law, is leaving families bereaved, helpless, hopeless, sad, and alone. \\nI myself feel this disconnection. I would rather it were any other way. \\nBut people, especially it seems white evangelicals, support \u201can eye for an eye\u201d rather than the love and forgiveness suggested by the black families of the black victims at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church who were murdered by a white supremacist. Jan Honeycutt \\nNo one in my church supports that the goes against the Bible. Luke Yi \\nI didn\u2019t say anything about your church, Jan. I didn\u2019t say anything about all Christians or all white people or all evangelicals. I said something that is true: some Christians advocate an eye for an eye. billdeserthills \\nThat \u2018eye for an eye\u2019 stuff is from the Torah\u2013You need to figure out which bunch of people you are trying to c rap on sonny boy Luke Yi \\nIt\u2019s in \u201cExodus\u201d in the King James Bible. \\nNo one needs you to reinterpret my words \\nBut lies, distortions, and ad hominem as are par for the course aren\u2019t you? Justsomeguy151 \\nEasy, hypocritical POS. You think thee should be zero consequences for pigs murdering civilians for nothing but if pigs got their traitorous heads blown off for murder, THEN its justice. get it, POS? Point \\nI see. So to you, justice is blowing peoples\u2019 heads off? \\nI guess if either of us want to see justice in action, we\u2019re going to have to go somewhere like China. I hear there is lots of justice there. Luke Yi \\nHe stated pretty clearly he\u2019s upset by the situation. He employs the subjunctive tense rather than future tense to indicate a hypothetical. \\nAs I said you\u2019re not reading text or subtext carefully. Subtext requires understanding the background, or where the author is arriving at this point from. \\nDavid never said he was going to kill someone; he said he\u2019s upset. \\nOr perhaps you\u2019re the kind of person who, when you say \u201cI could just kill my brother for doing that!\u201d is actually considering killing him. Justsomeguy151 \\nYou must be fucking stupid to think that. Point \\nWell then I guess you\u2019re right, and I must be fucking stupid. \\nGreat chat, though. \\nI feel the same way, so glad to hear of your impending departure billdeserthills \\nI disagree, you aren\u2019t related to a cop are you? Point \\nNo, I\u2019m not. Should it make a difference? billdeserthills \\nI don\u2019t wanna be calling you a copsucker, if you aren\u2019t one Point \\nWell\u2026 I\u2019m a scientist, so I guess I\u2019d be a sciencesucker. \\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ve made my viewpoints pretty clear in this thread. You\u2019ve reviewed it pretty carefully already, since you\u2019ve replied to several of my comments individually. \\nI suggest that we can talk about the ideas I\u2019ve been representing (which are very interesting), or me (which is considerably less interesting) \u2013 but the topics are quite separate. Which would you prefer to discuss? billdeserthills \\nYou just done sucked the fun right outta this thread Point \\nA draw, then? \\nWho knows, if our viewpoints are so divergent, perhaps we can look forward to another go at it some other time. billdeserthills \\nYou for or against a man\u2019s right to Demand Satisfaction? Point \\nAn interesting question: but I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cdemanding satisfaction.\u201d If it means you get to kill someone\u2019s son because they killed your son, then no. I am against that. If satisfaction means that someone who harms or kills another person must answer for that in a court of law, then I am for it. \\nI would also like to know, if it is a right, where that right is documented? The only rights that I am aware that I have come from my U.S. citizenship, and are bestowed by the U.S. Constitution and the tributaries of law that emanate from it. When I travel outside my country, I\u2019m no longer protected by my constitution. \\nI also believe strongly in the U.N.\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Paris, 1948). While it is not a document with legal status, it serves to guide a fragmented and contentious world stage towards recognizing and acknowledging a series of \u201cfundamental rights\u201d\u2013 an ideal towards which we can strive. \\nOne thing I do know: one does not have a \u201cright\u201d to something just because they claim it\u2019s their \u201cright.\u201d I\u2019m betting that people misunderstanding what their rights are \u2013 and are not \u2013 is a component in many examples of the continuing violence and contention between people now. Luke Yi \\nThose rights are actually not considered by the constitution or our founders to originate with the document or their ideas. \\nThe founders considered these to be natural rights, endowed to us merely by our existence. \\nOf course, they thought only wealthy white males were actually human adults, and everyone else was an object for use, including women, children, and other races. billdeserthills \\nLawyers seem to have made off with my right to \u2018demand satisfaction\u2019 then Point \\n\u2026or, you never had such a right in the first place, and you simply invented it. billdeserthills \\nThe Right to Demand Satisfaction did exist at one time, it seems to have ended in the late 1800\u2019s or early 1900\u2019s as a so-called scientist I am surprised you never heard of it\u2013 I hope you don\u2019t also think dueling pistols are something I made up as well, mr so-called fancypants scientist Point \\nHmm\u2026\u201cThe Right to Demand Satisfaction.\u201d Well, I guess we\u2019ll just have to take your word on it. But honestly, it sounds like something you just made up. And \u201crights\u201d simply don\u2019t work like that. \\nIn regard to \u201cdueling pistols,\u201d I\u2019m afraid the example is not related to your earlier claim of some sort of \u201cright.\u201d In fact, if I\u2019m not mistaken, duels were a matter of a code of honor, and had very little to do with rights. \\nIt\u2019s sort of interesting that you say your \u201cRight to Demand Satisfaction\u201d disappeared in \u201cthe late 1800\u2019s or early 1900\u2019s,\u201d since it wasn\u2019t long after that the modern concept of \u201crights\u201d really began to enter our social consciousness. billdeserthills \\nToo bad the schools don\u2019t do much of a job educating you kids these days Point \\nThat\u2019s fine. We\u2019re done with our chat though, correct? billdeserthills \\nI suppose, you don\u2019t really seem intelligent enough to discuss much\u2013You can\u2019t even remember simple things others write, even when that writing would be easily referred to, you still get it wrong\u2013Sounds like you are just a modern-made problem waiting to happen to your next employer, sucks to be that guy, I suppose Point \\nCheers. billdeserthills \\nI\u2019m thinking you should definitely invest in a helmet, so you don\u2019t fall down and cause yourself some brain damage Sounds like you need to preserve all the brain cells you can get Point \\nThat\u2019s also fine. I thought we were done with our discussion? \\nSince you have had nothing to say regarding our original topic of discussion \u2013 despite your several ongoing comments \u2013 may I suggest that at this time, we allow others to express themselves, and our discussion can become part of the archive of this article\u2019s comments? \\nCheers. billdeserthills \\nThis isn\u2019t a piece of paper, there is plenty of room for saying nothing at all here\u2013besides the mods need something to do. Point \\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem for our friend, Billdeserthills, because he has indicated that a man has \u201ca right to demand satisfaction.\u201d He has also since indicated that \u201csatisfaction\u201d involves blowing someone\u2019s head off. billdeserthills \\nActually I said nothing of the kind. So sad to see modern education at work\u2013 Point \\nMy bad \u2013 the person I intended to refer to is \u201cJustsomeguy151.\u201d billdeserthills \\nSounds like you are getting smarter, I hope it isn\u2019t just more BS Point \\nCheers. billdeserthills \\nTotally unfounded\u2013Hard to believe that You are actually a \u2018scientist\u2019\u2013Real scientist\u2019s use facts, before they shoot off they\u2019re mouths\u2013You should try it sometime\u2013Facts can be your friend Luke Yi \\nWe intentionally do not hire cops with IQs much above the mean. I understand the reasoning employed in that decision but believe it\u2019s a moral error billdeserthills \\nIt\u2019s not just a \u2018moral\u2019 error\u2013The money these so-called \u2018police\u2019 cost taxpayers Every Year could buy us all something real nice\u2013Or even a whole bunch of Real Police Point \\nIn many jurisdictions, it sort of depends on why you killed the guy. Christopher Pacella \\ninnocent??? that nigger had his hands up. that means he was high on crack. Annica \\nWow and your hate is the reason why there\u2019s still racial tension. Unarmed, hands up don\u2019t deserve to be shot dead in cold blood. Period. No human deserves that. No matter their race. Bigot. Justsomeguy151 \\nBigoted fagot, you\u2019re not funny. In fact, you deserve to be brutally murdered by the very same pig\u2019s you suck off. Point \\nHuh\u2026 so you do like blacks, but you don\u2019t like gays? \\nDo you have a list, or something so that we can know ahead of time who\u2019s ok, and who\u2019s not? \\nIt\u2019s sort of weird, because usually people will either dislike both gays and blacks, or they won\u2019t have a problem with either. But \u2013 eh \u2013 there\u2019s no rules about these things. billdeserthills \\nAre You taking notes? Point \\nA list of the people who you don\u2019t like. We\u2019ve got blacks and gays so far. Anyone else? \\nI\u2019m honestly not sure what your argument regarding gays is \u2013 I\u2019ve read your comment a couple times, and it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t like them. What\u2019s the point, though? \\nYou\u2019re welcome to like or to not like anyone you want, in my opinion. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a \u201cright,\u201d per se, but I treat it as though it is. But, if you\u2019re going to say things that aren\u2019t in fact true, then \u2013 if it\u2019s a topic I am familiar with \u2013 I\u2019ll probably say something to you about it. billdeserthills \\nI don\u2019t really know any black or gay people, so I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t like them Point \\nFair enough. Maybe I misinterpreted one of your earlier comments. Justsomeguy151 \\nI don\u2019t dislike gays although I hate what they do and the Gay Agenda. A list for what? Are you an idiot? We are all responsible for own actions and gays always say \u201cI just can\u2019t help it, I was born this way\u201d (even though there are former gays so yes, they can definitely choose), so their perversion should be OK. Well pedophiles say the same thing but not too many people are falling all over themselves to defend them. Luke Yi \\nI\u2019m certain you\u2019re wrong about \u201ckill a guy\u2026go to jail\u201d\u2014 the law has many different ways of treating killers depending on the particular circumstances. \\nThat said I agree with the sentiment behind your expression Jan Honeycutt \\nIf we shoot a criminal on our property we go to jail. Mike List \\nNot sure \u2018much higher\u2019 is good, but the parameters of police conduct need to be communicated and understood in good faith, by police and their clients. Luke Yi \\nWhy wouldn\u2019t higher standards be required of someone who in the course of their duties employs deadly force legally? Messier M41 \\nThey aren\u2019t held to any standard, except whatever one they decide they want to be held to that day. If the military is being honored, then the police will say \u201cwe are just like them and we should be honored like them.\u201d When they shoot unarmed people, the standard is \u201cI was a scared little bitch and I wanted to make sure I got home to my family! How dare you question me!\u201d freewheelinfranklin543 \\nIt is called Obstruction of Justice and it is a felony. Tmoney \\nObstruction of justice is a felony? The obstruction the officer was talking about was not answering questions which is bullshit because you don\u2019t have to answer questions it\u2019s called the 5th amendment. Even if he was charged and even if it went to court that type of obstruction would be a misdemeanor. Obstruction is a broad term and can be a felony, but things like people filming an encounter and interfering with an arrest is misdemeanor obstruction. James \\nI\u2019ve got a better idea. put them in the stocks and subject them to a lifetime of public humiliation and abuse. edslides \\ndeath is too generous. put that useless twat n general population in a state penitentiary, remember how dahmer got justiced? shanked in the terlet. this shit has got to be nipped in the fuckin bud. sooner rather than later. i dont care what color you are, this is just straight up bullshit. looked down the barrel of a cop gun myself twice, once for walking, once for questioning a \u201ccops\u201d authoritah. Jordan Manicom \\nI would have killed the pig billdeserthills \\nNo you wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019ve had many people draw down on me and not all of them cops by a long shot\u2013That \u2018keepin it real\u2019 bs isn\u2019t worth a trip to jail\u2013However you might second my desire to bring back Our Right to Demand Satisfaction? There was honor in that, someone gets slapped with a glove and someone gets killed (maybe) for their beliefs\u2013Next time your politician disappoints you voting for the wrong side\u2013Pistols at dawn scumbag! Or of course they could just run away, and look like dishonorable scum\u2026 Lliss \\nDid all of you guys on his blog get left back in at least one grade? You sound so infantile and dumb! billdeserthills \\nFuck off twat, I wasn\u2019t talking to you Luke Yi \\nOf course pistols were quite inaccurate then. Modern pistols would likely make that a death sentence. Also, the best shot gets their way, rather than the best person. billdeserthills \\nDueling pistols are generally smooth bore, without rifling\u2013They look to be intentionally created to be slightly inaccurate \u2014 Anyhow if you can\u2019t shoot you could always hire someone to be your champion Luke Yi \\nWeapons were never designed to be intentionally inaccurate. Design of weapons has improved dramatically since the 1700s. billdeserthills \\nWhy weren\u2019t the barrels rifled then? At the time rifle barrels were rifled, so the weapon makers knew about the accuracy potential of rifling a barrel\u2013You are so smart, answer me that smarty pants freewheelinfranklin543 \\nDahmer wasn\u2019t shanked. He was beaten(to a bloody pulp) to death with barbells. Lliss \\nAgain, Spoken by a cop hating guy who\u2019s been arrested several times. Shut up Jerome Taylor \\nNo you shut up!! Point \\nNotice the number of people who so easily and blithely call for the death of other people. They\u2019re sort of in the majority. \\nAnd I walk around with these people on the street, every day, people thinking that there are people who need to be killed. And I\u2019m sure some of them think that I need to be killed. \\nWhen I realize how little respect my fellow Americans have for life, it makes me feel like we should have hyper-aggressive cops. \\nIf you\u2019re calling for death, then I\u2019m not even sure it matters why it should be so important whose death your calling for. The cops shot this man \u2013 he never bothered me, but you know what \u2013 there are plenty of people who he would have bothered. For example, America is filled with racists right now. They\u2019ll be pleased. \\nMaybe this week, there will be another attack against police officers. Some people will be happy that some of them died. \\nI do know that there is almost no example where enough people were killed to solve whatever thing they thought was a problem. I know Hitler tried, but he missed some, and so whatever problem he thought existed because of jews, still exists. You \u2013 and a bunch of others \u2013 think that cops should be killed. Well, some folks think the same way, and have gone ahead and killed some cops. Turns out that we still have cop problems. \\nYou know what I don\u2019t like about these cops? That they\u2019re reckless with life. That\u2019s who I don\u2019t trust: people reckless with life. Those who call for violence, who support it, overtly or silently, are the foundation of many complex contemporary social ills. Luke Yi \\nI think you lost track of your point when you called for hyper aggressive cops\u2013wouldn\u2019t they kill people? Doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re calling for killing people, which is the opposite of what you stayed you were for? \\nAnd yes, killing people literally ended Hitler\u2019s reign of terror, so that particular problem was solved in part by killing people. \\nYour message is confused and mixed, you might just want to rewrite that post altogether for posterity. Point \\nQuite fair; my prior comment got a little out of hand. \\nTo speak plainly: I am against all killing and injury of people. Regardless of reason. It\u2019s an ethic I chose, and have developed based on what ultimately has been important to me, and in my honest opinion, to the long-term health of our society. \\nMy confusing post is in response to those who make the argument \u2013 and there are many here \u2013 that the cop should be killed. The essential theme I was attempting to communicate is that there is no situation where killing someone has ultimately lead to a better world. billdeserthills \\nYou are confused, the vast majority of people want to be peaceable and peaceful. Point \\nIf you need it pointed out to you, I\u2019m glad to: the population I\u2019m referring to in reference to the \u201cnumber of people\u201d are those who have commented on this story. Not the general population. Sorry you misunderstood. billdeserthills \\nThat just isn\u2019t true, many people use these forums to blow off steam. I have blocked lots of people and even they had little actual desire to kill anyone. Put a gun in your pocket and you\u2019ll see just how little it likely gets used Point \\nI\u2019m quite sure that your view is the more \u201ccorrect,\u201d or more in-line with the intent of those posters. In fact, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve \u201cblown off steam\u201d in the past also. \\nHowever: I consider that a very harmful steam. I consider it corrosive to the mind that creates the steam; I consider it poisonous to those who read it; and I feel that it is that very steam that \u2013 for a minority of us \u2013 eventually gives us the impetuous to harm another person. \\nAnd \u2013 frankly \u2013 such attitudes tend to be divisive rather than unifying. This really is a problem \u2013 the cops killing people (or \u2013 depending on what flavor steam percolates through your mind, a problem with black people) \u2013 and the solution is even more complex than the problem. Mind you, this site seems to have a bias on the political spectrum. There are other sites where I\u2019m having conversations on this very same topic, only instead of telling people it\u2019s wrong to want to kill \u2013 or wish the death \u2013 of a cop, I\u2019m trying to get racists to tell me, sanely and rationally, their rationale for disliking black people. \\nSee how it almost ruined our friendship? And neither of us blew off any steam \u2013 you and I had contention because of others\u2019 steam. \\nAnyway, I enjoy that we can have this chat. \\nPS \u2013 you\u2019re right, if I put a gun in my pocket, it wouldn\u2019t get used. The same is true for many of us, even the steamy ones. My concern is the minority of folks who will use their gun. Luke Yi \\nDifferent strokes for different folks, no? Sometimes people must express their anger or (as is common for men of my age) suffer stress related illnesses such as heart attack, stroke, or high blood pressure. Luke Yi \\nI\u2019m not convinced they are the majority, by any means. palvadore \\nThe only reason LEOs behave so egregiously is because they are allowed to get away with smaller crimes. \\nAttacking the boot on our collective throat may help a little, but the solution is to look at those enabling the base corruption and immorality. The judges, DAs, Police Chiefs, and lawyers all have blood on their hands. Luke Yi \\nIt is ironic to me that the same folks who believe in arming up to defend themselves from the federal government, simultaneously seem to believe the local (poorly trained) police can do no wrong. Point \\nI\u2019ve always thought that the only people who deserve capital punishment are those who support capital punishment. Aleix \\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that the only people who deserve capital punishment are those who support capital punishment\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always thought\u201d \\nso you support yourself being given capital punishment. \\nThink about that \\nIs deadly ain\u2019t it? billdeserthills \\nYou scientist folks sound backwards and all mixed up Point \\nI wouldn\u2019t know. I only see one other person participating in our chat prepared to seriously discuss these issues, and I have no idea what he does for work. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s associated with science. Perhaps anthropology \u2013 he\u2019s got a strong, strong insight to the human psyche. billdeserthills \\nSo how is it that a \u2018scientist\u2019 such as yourself never heard of the scientific method? Point \\nYour question doesn\u2019t really make any sense, I\u2019m afraid. \\nI\u2019m also getting a little bored with you. If you want to talk about me, it\u2019s a very different topic. Start it elsewhere. I\u2019ll remind you that the original topic addresses the desire of a rather sociopathic-sounding individual to see more people die in response to people dying. I think that\u2019s a more interesting topic. billdeserthills \\nYou can quit talking anytime you like Tmoney \\nCan anyone sync up the helicopter video with the ground audio with the shot? Police stated they used a taser and then shot him. Could the taser caused him to drop his hand or was he shot and then dropped his hand as a result of that. Even if he dropped his hand his car broke down on the road. How did it even come to being at gun point surrounded by police and a helicopter. These are the questions people should be asking. Freethinker \\nMark my words. She will walk. They are all above the law. More than 1300 people were killed by cops last year. Out of 18 cases in 2015 in the US where cops were charged with manslaughter and or murder guess how many got convicted?\u2026.

Xman3 \\nWhy do you need some 5 officers, a helicopter to respond to a broken down vehicle and then kill the driver? And all of the high speed police cars endangering the public, again for a broken down vehicle? Tulsa obviously has too many police with nothing to do. Sillywilly \\nremember the old days when hanging was all the rage and everyone from miles around would come for a little excitement on a hot Friday night\u2026kinda the same principle. Luke Yi \\nTulsa was the home of the worst race riot in American history, during which whites destroyed an entire black community, literally the wealthiest black community in America, leaving ten thousand people homeless and killing many. \\nNo whites were killed or injured in the riots, and no whites faced criminal punishment for their behavior. \\n6,000 blacks were arrested for trying to protect their homes and families and scores of blacks were killed \\nnever came across that story before \\nthanks \\nYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m still blown away. \\nHere\u2019s a great documentary about the events: billdeserthills \\nCops are bored, they make their own drama\u2013It\u2019s their own version of a snuff film Lliss \\nNo you\u2019re bored that\u2019s why you are on a blog talking about people with real jobs. You would NEVER comprehend what it means to be a cop so just keep writing about shit you don\u2019t understand billdeserthills \\nJust because you are an experienced \u2018useful idiot\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean you actually know anything Luke Yi \\nhttps://youtu.be/2EeJ0U5pVi8 Lliss \\nTulsa is extremely busy. This man was on pcp and that amount of officers is necessary to attempt to diffuse a bad situation and cause the person to rethink their actions and comply. Obviously you know nothing about police work besides what you watch on tv Rena Aleman-Walker \\nWhen did they release the results of there findings from the body and blood? Just because thats what she said it must be true\u2026.. I don\u2019t think so. I have looked on a few news websites and they say that his her claim but IT DOESN\u2019T SAY IT IS A FACT!!! Again you are looking with your rose colored glasses. pray58 \\nLliss stop spreading lies, there has been no results from blood work, so where do you get your information, and you accuse people of excepting false information from the news and then you post hearsay! Luke Yi \\nSymptoms of PCP use, for those who make claims without evidence: \\nThey have dilated pupils. They have developed a temporary speech impediment (This can occur even when they are not on the drug). They do not move from one spot for hours. They are extremely sensitive to sound. They are seeing and hearing things that are not real. Their balance is off and they cannot walk without falling. Their eyes keep rolling back in their head. Their vision is blurry. They continually stare at nothing and are in a stupor state. They are having uncontrollable and irrational behavioral outbursts for no apparent reason KKN4LIFE \\nDAMN so Colin Kaepernick is STILL wrong and disrespectful grapesodabanked \\nKaepernick is just a racist who wants to make everything about black people vs white people. Hugh Culliton \\nActually, I think he just wants to see the law applied evenly, and to not see anymore unnecessary killings. I don\u2019t think that meets the definition of \u201cracist\u201d. billdeserthills \\nI don\u2019t think what he is doing is any more serious than flying the american flag upside down, or lighting it on fire and far as I can tell those things are still legal. obama refuses to place his hand over his heart when the pledge of america is recited, nor will he salute his men, so who is the real disrespectful person here? edslides \\nflying the flag upside down. do you understand why an AMERICAN might do that? billdeserthills \\nIt signals an emergency, far as I know, I bet google has all kinds of reasons It isn\u2019t \u2018sticks & stones\u2019\u2013 it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone Sungoddess \\nI don\u2019t salute the flag either because liberty and justice for all is bullshit ,second the president does salute his soldiers. I am a veteran and you only salute officers. A flag which is a piece of cloth, a song and a pledge to a nation that has screwed over many races of people does not make you a better person, the way you treat fellow human beings is what matters . Lliss \\nWhat Kind of veteran are you? I think you\u2019re lying billdeserthills \\nThat is all the bs I\u2019m gonna read from you, twat\u2013Begone palvadore \\nI agree with his point and I was enlisted and officer. Sungoddess \\nNot that I have to prove anything to you I served in the United States Army. I have no need to lie .what is your point anyway. Luke Yi \\nObama doesn\u2019t refuse to put his hand over his heart during the pledge. In fact, he\u2019s been photographed with hand over heart while reciting the pledge many times. \\nStop reading emails from your crazy great-uncle billdeserthills \\nPlenty of other disrespectful things obama does Luke Yi \\nWell then present the evidence of that, and I will answer that. \\nBut you\u2019re wrong about what you said and now you\u2019ve admitted it, though evidently you will continue to hold your unsubstantiated beliefs. billdeserthills \\nYou don\u2019t find the thousands of lies obama has told to be disrespectful?\u2013I suppose You think obama\u2019s lies are unsubstantiated as well\u2013What a wonderful \u2018useful idiot\u2019 you have become BigJohnConnor \\nYou are a fucking asshole. john \\nJust say you don\u2019t like black people and want us to die. Do you think this pastor deserved what he got? Yes or no KKN4LIFE \\nWhite people have a 400 year head start on racism remember they are the one\u2019s who created it DUH!! How is Kaep\u2019s racism making YOU suffer? Luke Yi \\n/s Yeah, there\u2019s absolutely no history in America of any race or gender dividing the whole country up by race and gender and making laws preventing some races and genders from being able to equally participate in society. /s \\nHonestly, anyone who still feels that way should match the $1,000,000 contribution Kaepernick made edslides \\nI have one word for you bill. A-S-S-I-M-I-L-A-T-I-O-N. if i moved to afghanistan, i would feel remiss if i expected them to respect my freedom of choice. they wouldnt. he can protest all he wants. when an American physically calls him out on his bullshit, will you stand by your comment? this aint the middle east. we dont care how you do it over there. pulll that shit here, you WILL be taken to task. come to my country and disrespect my country , we will kill you. thats our policy. billdeserthills \\nI don\u2019t expect tolerance to intolerant muslim scum, and I don\u2019t see what colin is physically hurting, by donating $1,000,000 towards people who have suffered. Why not put your money where your mouth is, get contributions from all your kkk and fake nazi friends & see if you can top $1,000,000?(mod please put barfing emoticon here) ThomasJefferson \\nI\u2019m still trying to figure out wtf point it was that ed was stressing bill.His analogy, (ASSuming there even IS one) STILL eludes me. But, if indeed you did figure it out, an excellent response I must say. Luke Yi \\nI think there is a whole presidential campaign for that billdeserthills \\nI think you are confused billdeserthills \\nI just keep seeing more and more people the police kill & I\u2019m not seeing anyone Else doing much about it\u2013When You put up a million of your own money to fight this problem I may begin to pay attention. poopiepants \\nthanks for your insight ed. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca3f6ec0bcffbe818b2a7f93e1b48f118316ea463ca54175b44ee47199e6de76.jpg john \\nJust say you hate black people and we can call it a day. Do you defend this video or not? palvadore \\nThis has nothing to do with color. It\u2019s just the latest example the media wants you to see. Cops kill more white men every year than blacks. The media just doesn\u2019t want to show those examples. pray58 \\nWhere is you statistics for that statement, show proof! And I mean innocent white men being killed! palvadore \\nCan you meet your own demand and proove how many \u201cinnocent\u201d Africans were shot by police? And please don\u2019t use FBI statistics or anything that you can JUST fucking GOOGLE! Like the rest of us! \\nI protest police misconduct not because I give a care about the poor, poor, little black man that chose to live life with the evil white man. No! I protest for all the other races! Black lives don\u2019t matter to me at all. Luke Yi \\nThat\u2019s not our policy. Our policy is ensconced in the constitution, and it\u2019s most important amendment, the 1st, which provides freedom of expression FiuToYou \\nI hope you\u2019re being a satirist here! I feel you are. Colin is a patriotic hero!!!! KKN4LIFE \\nHUH? Colin is a WARRIOR! Jerome Taylor \\nMy point exactly!!! Stay tuned!! This ish is getting old, you think? Richard Norgard \\n\u201cThat looks like a bad dude, too. Must be on something\u2019.\u201d \\nI guess that makes it ok to kill him. Whatever happened to protect and serve? billdeserthills \\nThe police protect & serve themselves Lliss \\nThey definitely serves, keeping that dude outa somebody\u2019s back yard Tricornes \\nI\u2019ll take 10 dead idiots who won\u2019t comply with police orders over one decent police officer getting a scratch on his pinkie. Reinhold Von Kirschmann \\nNotice how in the helicopter video, the guy says he looks like a bad guy, and me must be on something.. Guilty till proven innocent. Hope this domestic terrorist goes to jail. She is a murderer plain and simple. Good Canadian Kid \\nHe\u2019s black, so in the eyes of a cop that makes him a bad guy and a drug user. edslides \\nnot that it matters, but male pattern baldness is kind of a white thing. gonna revisit this point, but it doesnt matter. murder is murder. Lliss \\nNo he was considered a bad guy because he wasn\u2019t complying and he was considered a drug user because of his erratic behavior and the drugs found at the scene. Please be fair and stop the cop hating bullshit. Yonnie Pietrovito-Moncrief \\nLiar, liar, pants on fire. The usual excuses for cop killers. Jerome Taylor \\nYou noticed that too, huh?! Four cops with weapons drawn, because they felt endangered and their life threatened!! Now I\u2019m convinced, Cops are pussies!! I\u2019m sure their girlfriends are really proud of them!! ScarletPimpernil \\nIt\u2019s common play \u2013 consider family court, for example. There, a girl says \u201che scares me and I\u2019m afraid for our children. No evidence is provided to support the claim, but the guy is, often, forever ejected from his own children(\u2018s)(s\u2019) lives. billdeserthills \\nWhat erratic behavior or what drugs found at the scene?!! What video are you watching?!! Luke Yi \\nOfficers did report finding PCP in the car, and the victim had a history of addiction. \\nHowever, according to this report, the vehicle had already been secured so officers knew there was no gun inside. \\nSad story all around: it seems a man with a medical problem driving home from a college class in music appreciation died for no good reason. \\nYou surmised all that from what\u2019s not in the video. Good Canadian Kid \\nAnd the helicopter pilot was able to determine this just by looking at him? I\u2019ll stop hating cops when they stop killing people who are having car problems. Sungoddess \\nWhat the hell us your deal are you just somebody who likes to chime in just to insult people with no facts ? Does that make you feel go about yourself you are exactly what I was talking about when I said bitch about not saluting a flag or standing for a song but can\u2019t bother to be a decent human being. bumboclot \\nNobody on the ground would have heard that so it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the shooting. But I did find it an interesting comment. Other than being a big black guy, and ignoring the cop\u2019s commands, what made him a \u201cbad guy\u201d to that helicopter cop? I mean, he wasn\u2019t a robbery suspect, he had a broken down car. I wonder what they were referring to. Lliss \\nThey were referring to the fact that 4 officers were trying to get him to comply with their orders to stop and instead he chose to keep walking away and reaching into his car for god knows what. That\u2019s what they meant by seems like a bad guy. David Boccabella \\nWhen you get 4 excited officers \u2013 all screaming different orders \u2013 which one to you follow. Luke Yi \\nThey could have heard it as all officers have radios on them. Lliss \\nYea, normal people keep walking away from officers and reachin into their cars after being told to stop! He\u2019s a BAD GUY you lame idiot. Keep watching the biased liberal news, increasing their ratings and making them rich off your dumb racist ass when the truth WILL come to light! The news is using all of you to promote their cop hating agenda! Not because they believe it but because it hypes the people and makes them rich!!! Read between the lines. They are biased! using words like \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cgunned down\u201d doesn\u2019t she get her day in court? Isn\u2019t she innocent before proven guilty?\u201d Please you all are so one sided. You don\u2019t want peace! You don\u2019t want justice!! You want to be treated well and to treat others as badly as you feel you\u2019ve been treated. That\u2019s not justice! Keep watching he news. They\u2019ll love you for it. Rena Aleman-Walker \\nYou say that she deserves her day in court but did he get his? No, why? Because he was killed by another cop who for some reson didnt do there job. That\u2019s not justice to be shot in a street, they developed less abrasive measures to bring a person to there knees. Number two did she see why or understand what was going on? NO, that is WHAT IS INJUSTICE.o you shut up because you are looking at the situation just as biase as the rest . So get off your soap box and shut up like you keep telling everyone else. palvadore \\nNo matter the criminality or deprecation of the act, police officers will always find an out for other police officers. Rena Aleman-Walker \\nYou are RIGHT!!! Because they have a alliance, a brotherhood if you will. They are NOT going to break because if one does that one will get SOOO MUCH flack for it. They would make that one LIFE SOO MISERABLE. THEY would NEVER!!!! Rena Aleman-Walker \\nIt is ALWAYS BEEN HARD TO DO THE RIGHT THING!!!! I know that people say anything worth doing is never EASY but i think doing the RIGHT THING in the amidst of OPPOSITION IS EVEN HARDER. ScarletPimpernil \\nWhere is the proof they did not tell him to put his hands on his car and he was complying? Reinhold Von Kirschmann \\nThe window was closed you racist cop appologist. The reaching in the window was a police lie. But you don\u2019t care about that. palvadore \\nA cop apologist doesn\u2019t make someone a racist. Police misconduct is epidemic and against all citizens and non citizen alike. pray58 \\nLliss did he get his day in court, was he innocent before proven guilty, why does she have more rights then he got. Why is it alway deadly force when it comes to black men! Why were they bothering him any ways his car was broke down why all the harassment! Stop trying to justify this madness. Nicholas Hoey \\nWTF! All I am thinking is it shouldnt matter what you do for a living, if you kill anybody you must be judged just like everybody else! Luke Yi \\nWhat do you mean by bad guy? I didn\u2019t hear anyone tell him to stop in any of the video I watched. And the vehicle had already been secured, so officers knew there was no gun. \\nLink the video and tell us the time code for when he is told to stop? \\nhttp://m.tulsaworld.com/news/courts/terence-crutcher-family-attorneys-allege-misinformation-from-police/article_392556ce-f698-54ed-9db9-fa9736493874.html?mode=jqm Reinhold Von Kirschmann \\nSo you stupid idiot, what do you have to say now that she\u2019s been charged with murder huh?

Loser Reinhold Von Kirschmann \\nHow come after she was charged with murder, I don\u2019t hear you flapping your ignorant mouth now. Why so quiet? Fool Susan Miele \\nand so are all the cops with her and in the air above her; they passed judgement, failed to render aid to him and will now stay silent while the cops cook up their story. Rogue cops cost us money \\nFor all of their reckless behavior by these trigger happy fuck ups, It is time to start drug testing all cops. Training may be lacking but I will bet 5o percent of cops are on some type of illegal drug.

Evidence rooms find theft going on by police billdeserthills \\nLarge amount of steroid use going on too ThomasJefferson \\nLOL, unfortunately, they\u2019re usually just drunks or on prescription poisons.One thing\u2019s for sure, if they ALL had a little THC, administered to them before they were inflicted upon the world at the beginning of their shift, much of THIS type of insane tragedy would be avoided. Marc Tremmel \\nWhy is the police chief calling him a suspected? if all that happened was his car broke down???\u2026what is he suspected of doing\u2026the police are INSANE\u2026talk about guilty before innocent\u2026and the sentence is death no matter what the \u201ccrime\u201d is \u2026.Tulsa, ok are you kidding me!?! lmfao like that is a criminal hot bed for terrorists billdeserthills \\nDamage control\u2013 So do all the cops get a paid vacation?

Accelynne Williams, who for decades had comforted and counseled people throughout the Caribbean, retired to Boston six years ago to be near his daughter and to study the Scriptures. On Friday a police SWAT team searching for drugs broke down his apartment door without warning and handcuffed him. Minutes later, the 75-year-old minister was dead of heart failure. \\nThe police, it turned out, had misread a floor plan provided by an informer; they had intended to raid an apartment on the floor above Mr. Williams. sfulmer \\nIt looks like they form a wall to block the view of the camera after the shooting. Guy \\nIn other words. Please don\u2019t riot and burn down our town, while we decide what sort of spin we are going to put on it ! \\nBroken down car in middle of road, = Death Penalty ! John Henry Gunderson \\nI am in no way trying to condone this, but it appeared to me, the man walked to his car, lowered his hands, and attempted to open the door of his vehicle. Good Canadian Kid \\nWatch the video again, their is more than ten seconds between the shot and when he falls to the ground. He lowered his hands AFTER he was shot! John Henry Gunderson \\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit, the cops had no business pulling their guns on this man in the first place, and because of this, they need to be held responsible for what happened. But your the one who needs to watch the video again (I already did, about five times) The man lowers his hands, grabs the door, and then you hear the shot go off. Good Canadian Kid \\nNope, watch it again and compare it to the video shot from the cop car, it sure looks to me like the killer shoots then steps to her right and Terence drops his arm. This is at the beginning of the 22 second mark of the helicopter video. \\nIs there someone out there who can sync up both videos and play them at the same time? John Henry Gunderson \\nOn the dash cam you see him lowering his hands at the 50 sec. mark, then you here the shot fired and see smoke at the 52 sec. mark. Good Canadian Kid \\nWatch this video, it shows both the helicopter and the dashcam side by side, he had his hands up when shot.

Are you on drugs? He was not following orders because he was walking to his car and not getting on the ground. The officers had no idea what he had waiting inside that truck (gun, bomb) or if he would use that truck to ram them. This is BS race baiting media. Jordan Manicom \\nSo when the officers have no idea what is going on, they can shoot first and investigate later? They had no right to draw their weapons in the first place, anyone without their impunity would be charged for brandishing a weapon.

Cornelius Kappabani \\nLooks like one major fucked up accident to me caused by the bullshit training of Officers and Police Protocols. Officer Shelby herself sounds surprised and frightened and I have a hunch she will quit whatsoever facing the reality she just murdered a very nice person and father with no criminal record or anything. And there is no point in demonizing Shelby. Sue the shit out of the City, make the Officials understand that Police Training and Protocols are the cause of innocent people getting murdered by Police. Only then will things change. Only then Officers will become responsible for their actions.

But first, they make some persons more obviously the slave than others, to create the social conditions for breeding the instruments of totalitarianism. \\nAnd, this black men kill more black men argument is just shit for distraction and excuse! \u2013 like what? \u2013 so maybe it isn\u2019t that \u201cbad\u201d that white men kill some too?! Fuck that! These type of arguments use the fallout of systemic racism and poverty, to diffuse responsibility and confuse understanding about what systematic racism really is and how it metastasizes in a society. \\nRacism is a fundamental tool of tyranny \u2013 it excuses and normalizes the unlawful control of portions of a population. It fractures a population and authorizes terror. The purpose is always to maintain the power of the few over the many. The rich establish the roots of tyranny within a society through racism \u2013 it manifests a form of class ownership, ultimately providing the rich with the power and means to control large segments of society, effectively giving them ownership over the many and maintaining their position at the top. \\nThe rich in their endless greed for more \u2013 wendigo spirits ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo ) \u2013 will eventually utilize the mechanisms of control established through the apartheid state to bring all of humanity under their yoke of ownership. \\nThis is called totalitarianism! \\nFighting racism is fighting the systemic roots of tyranny. \\nIn circumstances like we see world wide today, when liberal democracies begin their decent into totalitarianism, by design, through the rise of fanatical nationalist fervour personified through the cult of the populous leader \u2013 classical totalitarianism, or fascism \u2013 or through the inversion of a democratic state into rule by corporate oligarchy \u2013 inverted totalitarianism, you always see the institutions of law and law enforcement radicalized beyond the scope of constitutional law \u2013 they become rogue entities serving the powers of gross ownership, that is the elite. \\nTherefore, I believe in what we see in the growing numbers of flagrant murders by police, is the transmutation of the police forces into the contemporary Gestapo. \\nThere are many subroutines effectively promoting this \u2026 like their training which proposes that police first must establish \u201ccompliance\u201d and that any resistance or suggestion there-off is \u201cdisobedience\u201d of authority legitimizing the use of lethal force. \\nCops are jacked up on the need to establish power and authority which subsequently turns citizens into victims! \\nThe new world order means 1% Masters and the rest Slaves with some slaves given power to be bosses while thinking that they are also masters so they will keep the rest of the slaves under boot! \\nWelcome to the New World Order Moparman \\nThose POS get away with killing innocent people over and over and over again they know they will get away with it so they keep doing it it is total 100% BS Wilfred Bankole Ademokun \\nWhat a BAD BAD NEWS, if we don\u2019t get JUSTICE on this case, and the killer cops are freed, go after the killer cops get them down. an eye for an eye.

However, by injecting emotionally-charged language and patronizing metaphors, you have ostracized those who support a reduction in police powers and authority, and those who demand an increase for it, or otherwise feel that the current operations of police are acceptable. \\nExamples include:\u201cPolice on scene indeed appear infinitely more concerned with the panicked Shelby than they do with the man they just shot for no apparent reason.\u201d \\n\u201cAs Crutcher lies mortally wounded on the ground, officers back away like frightened children\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cBoth have been given the paid vacation, otherwise known as administrative leave, customarily \u2018rewarded\u2019 after the use of fatal force.\u201d \\nUsually, an argument featuring such a degree of bias and hyperbole is something I would ignore. Except I\u2019m also accustomed to it from those whose primary arguments are in support of some form of racism, nationalism, or other form of bigotry. \\nUnfortunately, though I agree with the theme of your article, the arguments presented serve to diminish its utility. Cheri \\nI have so much respect for most police, they lay their lives on the line every day to keep us safe, but this video sure looks like murder, I saw his hands in the air, this must be treated as a murder. John Cokos \\nI\u2019m trying to sift thru the official bullshit scenario that gets presented at every cop related murder. Folks what you saw in that video was a Ritualistic Snuff Movie carried out In Cold Blood by uniformed Sociopaths. The level of cold blooded disregard at someone who\u2019s life was pouring out of him is just about impossible to rationalize. This story has only three outcomes after all the usual spin down and parallel reconstruction of the event\u2019s that took place: They circle the wagon and that bitch goes on getting a paycheck.Tulsa goes the way of Ferguson and all hell beaks loose. They throw her under the bus regardless because she is now a toxic asset. She is found guilty of reckless homicide, gets fired, goes to jail.

She\u2019s get desk duty after coming back from PAID leave and then go back out onto the field. The murderess will continue to patrol and may one day kill again if it happens. \\nThe video shows the officer LIED about how things went down. LIED again when she claimed he was reaching into his vehicle because the video shows the window was CLOSED. Tim G Tim \\nI\u2019ve got to say, I love what the FTP does overall. But seriously, you are really stretching with this one and a few others in recent past. The police have an insanely difficult job (no dispute) and just to keep this simple\u2026. the word \u201cpastor\u201d in the title of your article is strictly for shock value, hands down! It doesn\u2019t matter if this man was a pastor, cartel hit man, or a saint. Do the police on scene know he\u2019s a pastor?? And why in the fucks sake is he walking TO HIS OPEN VEHICLE WINDOW with guns pointed at him???? Just scratch your head with that one for bit. Plain and simple that is NOT an innocent behavior. I carry a concealed pistol and probably would have done the same thing. How could anyone justify walking to their open car window in that circumstance? This is insane. Those officers were justified. You are inciting hate and division and need to check yourself. Guy \\nYou\u2019re wrong there dude ! The drivers side door window was up, proven because of the blood from the lung shot is both on the window and door ! \\nSo is you assumption of \u201cWalking Away From A Cop, With Your Hands Up\u201d Is justification for police murder. Unless, you are okay with the old adage, \u201cI was in fear for my life\u201d is ? \\nJust as the new and improved bandage of words like \u201cTransparency, Building Bridges and Community Trust, are the new spin words of justifiable homicide ! \\nAll that proves one thing. Cops can kill with out remorse, for things as simple as perception of fear, all the while relying on Legal Immunity, Blue Union Membership, DA\u2019s, The Court Legal System Setup and D.O.J.\u2019s backing them up, in killing us ! How is that a good enough reason ? Considering, in the country of England with a population of over 35 million people, there has not been the amount of police shootings in the last 20 years, that has yet to equaled one year here ! Or the 53.000 people put in hospitals and seriously injured as the results of contact with our police, this year alone and the year isn\u2019t over yet ! \\nNo, you are dead wrong about justification of the War that cops are waging against the American People. Why do you carry a concealed weapon ? If you felt safe, you won\u2019t need too, all you would ever need to do is call a cop ! steve_2 \\nYou guys really should watch the video. When he was tazed and shot, his hands were not up, he was not complying with police commands to stop and raise his hands, and he reached inside the vehicle. As usual, obeying police commands is the way to not get shot. Good Canadian Kid \\nYou should really watch this video that syncs the dash-cam with the chopper-cam. His hands were clearly up when he was shot. BTW: his window was closed so I don\u2019t even begin to understand where you come to the conclusion that he was reaching inside his vehicle\u2026 Donna Bohdanyk \\nI want to puke. Joseph Mentor Nichols \\nWell he\u2019s obviously trying to open his car door for some reason. I don\u2019t even know why he\u2019s walking to his car unless they told him to lean against it. Still, why back to his driver seat? I\u2019m so confused. \\nI would hate to think that this dudes lack of common sense got him killed. It would be much more comforting to find out that the police shot him for no reason. Tmoney \\nCan anyone sync up the helicopter video with the shot on the ground video. I believe he drops his hand only after being shot, but if the ground audio was in the helicopter video it would be a better view and catch the timing of the shot. SSJRomance \\nCrutcher was not following officers commands and started walking back to his vehicle. That was his first mistake and made officers nervous. The second mistake was he reached into his vehicle. Do the officers have to wait until he pulls out a gun? \\nThat\u2019s what happened with the NY terrorist. The cop was yelling \u201cshow me your hands\u201d and gave the perp too much time that allowed him to grab his gun and shot the officer 2 times. That is what officers are up against. Damed if you do damed if you don\u2019t. Good Canadian Kid \\nHow do you know he wasn\u2019t following commands, the cop that shot him never bothered to turn on her recorder(s). He was just as likely returning to his vehicle as ordered to get his drivers license / registration / insurance. \\nWhen she shot him, his hands were up, look at this video that syncs the dash-cam with the chopper-cam.'"}, "time": 1742564370.7783422}
