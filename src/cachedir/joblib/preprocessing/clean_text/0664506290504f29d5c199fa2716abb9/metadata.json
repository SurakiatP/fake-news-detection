Driven   by hunger and despair, he rushes into the surf, only to discover that the body, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is lifeless. Or is it? To Hank\u2019s surprise, the corpse breaks wind, loudly and lustily. Moments later, Hank whoops with glee as he pilots the   Mr. Radcliffe across a   ocean. When \u201cSwiss Army Man\u201d had its premiere at Sundance in January, it became one of the festival\u2019s most   films, eventually winning a directing award. But despite positive reviews (Variety said it was \u201cconstantly inventive,\u201d and The Hollywood Reporter called it \u201cbizarrely poetic\u201d) festivalgoers walked out in droves and Vanity Fair wondered if it wasn\u2019t the strangest film in Sundance history. For online commentators who hadn\u2019t seen the film, \u201cSwiss Army Man,\u201d a. k. a. \u201cDaniel Radcliffe\u2019s   movie,\u201d became an easy target. \u201cThe premise kind of lends itself to that,\u201d acknowledged Daniel Kwan, the film\u2019s  . \u201cA lot of the   reactions online have been about how stupid this movie sounds. \u201d Known professionally as Daniels, Mr. Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created some of the most inventive and visceral shorts and music videos of the past decade. Other directors, like Spike Jonze and Antoine Fuqua, have graduated from music videos to feature films, but few have made music videos as unsettling as Daniels\u2019 work. Which was why no one was pounding on their doors to make \u201cSwiss Army Man. \u201d The film, which opens Friday, June 24, is the first feature from Mr. Kwan, 28, and Mr. Scheinert, 29. The two are here in the backyard studio of Mr. Kwan\u2019s Highland Park neighborhood home, which he shares with his fianc\u00e9e, Kirsten Lepore, an   animator. Mr. Kwan\u2019s brother, James, lives here, too he\u2019s an animator and children\u2019s book writer and illustrator (\u201cDear Yeti\u201d). Mr. Scheinert lives less than a   away. \u201cWhen we were editing the film here, I would just walk over with my dog every day,\u201d Mr. Scheinert said. The directors, who often finish each other\u2019s sentences and stories or clarify each other\u2019s points, met in a   animation class at Emerson College in Boston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like each other at first,\u201d Mr. Scheinert said, adding that he overparticipated and that Mr. Kwan underparticipated, coming off \u201clike a \u2018wasting his parents\u2019 money\u2019 film kid. \u201d But they soon bonded after they discovered they shared similarly twisted artistic sensibilities. Mr. Kwan\u2019s final school project was an animated short about an insomniac who undresses people while they sleep and does their laundry for them Mr. Scheinert\u2019s starred a dead boy whose body is piloted by small tigers. They began directing music videos and short films together, fantastical pieces in which small dogs are ridden like skateboards (\u201cDogboarding\u201d) a man kills a red ball after it makes love with his wife (\u201cInteresting Ball\u201d) and a drunk partyer vomits sparks (\u201cPigeons,\u201d by the band the Hundred in the Hands). Several went viral many featured the directors in starring roles. \u201cSwiss Army Man\u201d began as little more than a joke. \u201cIt was Kwan\u2019s idea, originally,\u201d Mr. Scheinert said. \u201cHe pitched me this idea of a guy stranded on a desert island finding a corpse and feeding it beans through a funnel, then riding the farts off into the sunset as beautiful music plays. \u201d The idea was too expensive to film as a short, but the two kept it in their voluminous backlog of weird ideas. And then another idea hit them. Why not make the corpse an amnesiac who must be reminded of the life he left behind to coax him to find his way back to civilization? That could be a feature, they thought. They toyed with various scenarios, and in 2014 the pair entered the Sundance Institute\u2019s Screenwriter Lab. On their off hours, looking for a mental respite from \u201ctalking to all those genius filmmakers about how to make your script better,\u201d they pitched a music video for \u201cTurn Down for What,\u201d a dance track by Lil Jon and DJ Snake. \u201cWe were like, this is the stupidest song we\u2019ve ever been sent,\u201d Mr. Scheinert said. \u201cLet\u2019s pitch the stupidest video we\u2019ve ever pitched. \u201d In the video\u2019s opening moments, Mr. Kwan simulates sex with a neighbor\u2019s TV set, melts a police officer\u2019s face and smashes potted plants against his crotch. \u201cIn my head, I was like, this might be the last music video anyone asks us to do,\u201d he said. Instead, \u201cTurn Down for What\u201d became one of the most popular and critically acclaimed music videos of 2014, landing multiple MTV Video Music Award nominations and receiving nearly half a billion YouTube views. After completing the script for \u201cSwiss Army Man,\u201d Daniels began searching for the two leads. \u201cI was in from the second or third page, from the moment Hank rides the farting corpse across the ocean,\u201d Mr. Dano said. \u201cIt was so funny and absurd and beautiful and glorious, I was like, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Mr. Radcliffe soon followed, and the two began working   days in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco, and in the redwood forests outside Eureka, Calif. \u201cThe atmosphere that the Daniels create on set is like no other I\u2019ve ever worked on,\u201d Mr. Radcliffe said. \u201cThey\u2019re so collaborative. Everyone there had either worked together for years on their music videos, or they\u2019d known since college. \u201d Working with actors of that caliber was a rare treat for the directors. \u201cIt spoiled us,\u201d Mr. Kwan said. \u201cWe\u2019re used to working with bands who\u2019ve never acted before, or with us and our friends, who don\u2019t really act but just happen to be around. \u201d The result is not your typical zombie flick or screwball comedy. If anything, it\u2019s a bromance of the purest sort, even though one of the bros is dead, sort of. It\u2019s also a love story, complete with an underwater kiss and the discovery that Mr. Radcliffe\u2019s penis can be used as a field compass. As teenagers, the directors were subjected to \u201chazing in high school,\u201d Mr. Kwan said. \u201cWe were both very expressive boys, neither of us were that good at sports, and that was just something we lived with and kind of accepted. So it\u2019s funny that we tried to make a survival film, which is the most masculine story there is, but ended up making the least manly survival film ever. The two of them sit in the woods, and they talk about their feelings. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564305.037882}
