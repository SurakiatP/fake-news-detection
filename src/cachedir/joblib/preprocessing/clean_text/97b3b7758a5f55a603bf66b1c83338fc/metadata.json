We have a raging,   fire at the White House. As a former prosecutor, what the president did, in firing James Comey, and then saying he did it to relieve pressure on himself because of the FBI investigation is a classic case of obstruction of justice, a federal crime. Anybody else who did something like this would be facing a federal indictment and a criminal trial. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628402.8303232}
