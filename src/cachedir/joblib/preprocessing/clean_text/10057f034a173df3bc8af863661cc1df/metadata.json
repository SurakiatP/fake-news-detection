More sources prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act than in all previous administrations combined. Journalists such as James Rosen at Fox News and Jim Risen at The New York Times and those of us who worked on the Snowden reporting constantly threatened with prosecution or having our phone records subpoenaed and the like. \u201d \u201cAnd Democratic officeholders in D. C. were virtually unanimous in the idea that people who leak information that\u2019s classified are villains, they\u2019re traitors, they ought to go to prison,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis framework has been created both rhetorical and legal over the last eight years that says that people who leak classified information regardless of how important that information is ought to be punished. That\u2019s the rhetoric and framework that Donald Trump is seizing on. And it the reason it\u2019s been so damaging to have watched Democrats who suddenly love leaks now that it\u2019s helping them have wage such an aggressive war on journalism and investigate reporting over the last eight years. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561850.3157253}
