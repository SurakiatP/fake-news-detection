Anti-EU Britons\u2019 dissatisfaction with the legal system has led to the creation of makeshift courts dealing with everything from witchcraft to disputes over borrowed garden tools. Accountant and people\u2019s judge Roy Hobbs said: \u201cThe court convenes in my living room, with the legal cases argued by our \u2018barristers\u2019 Sandra the local florist and Degsy, an unemployed decorator who\u2019s seen A Few Good Men five times. \u201cOur biggest case so far has been the legality of Brexit. The court came to the unanimous decision that it is totally brilliant and anyone who disagrees deserves a toe up their arse. \u201cYou can accuse anyone of anything. Last week we dealt with 48 cases of people being shortchanged at the local Sainsbury\u2019s, a French spy and an old lady who put a curse on a horse than made it go lame. \u201cPunishments range from the stocks for not wearing a poppy to hanging for more serious crimes, such as men having long hair. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ve got the case of a man who\u2019s guilty of liking Nicola Sturgeon. He won\u2019t be spouting his lies when he\u2019s being hit in the forehead by turnips.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564586.7603083}
