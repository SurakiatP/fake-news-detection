During a session on Thursday with the doctor, she said, \u201cI was able to move the fingers on my left hand. \u201d She called that \u201cthe greatest Christmas present I could have wished for. \u201d Apparently in a good mood and smiling, Kvitova offered thanks for the support she had received from other players, fans, her family, team and doctors. \u201cI never received so many messages in my life at a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI really appreciate that. \u201d The WTA, on its official Twitter account, wished Kvitova \u201ca speedy recovery. \u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see you back on court again,\u201d the Twitter post said. Kvitova, who plays tennis   had damage to the tendons in her left hand, along with injuries to all five fingers and two nerves. Doctors estimated it would take her about six months to return to tennis. Kvitova vowed to come back, sooner or later. \u201cI don\u2019t care about how much time it takes, if three months, six months or a year,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s for sure I want to return one day, and I\u2019ll do all I can to make that happen.

Kvitova did not take questions but said she did not want to look back and talk about the attack. The assailant was still at large. In April 1993, Monica Seles was at the height of her success when she was stabbed in the back during a changeover at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany. A man reached over a courtside railing and stabbed her, leaving an   slit between her shoulder blades. Seles returned to the game two years later and reached the 1995 United States Open final.'"}, "time": 1742562110.6529205}
