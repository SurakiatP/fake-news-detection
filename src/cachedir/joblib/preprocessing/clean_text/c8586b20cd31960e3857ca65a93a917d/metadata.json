The oldest, Akiea Brewer, 19, who identifies as transgender, interrupted to express her doubt. Ms. Parker\u2019s reply was swift and unequivocal: \u201cI was never mad at you for being who you are. What did I tell you? Be who you are. Don\u2019t follow and try to be who someone else is. \u201d Ms. Parker has never been one to mince words. She believes her directness does not dilute her warmth and affection. \u201cSometimes I can be really harsh,\u201d Ms. Parker acknowledged. \u201cSometimes you just have to say what you have to say. You can\u2019t pussyfoot with kids. \u201d An unwavering dedication to family is what led Ms. Parker, 58, to take custody of many of her grandchildren over the years, stepping up when her children could not. For example, the mother of four of Ms. Parker\u2019s grandchildren who live with her lives in Florida and is dealing with health issues. Ms. Parker credits her ceaseless devotion to the aunt who took her in at age 48, whom Ms. Parker calls her adoptive mother. \u201cShe was just a gem. She was precious,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cI could never ask for a better mother. She loved me as if she birthed me into the world. \u201d Ms. Parker said she had showered her own four children with that same unrelenting affection. Her approach to motherhood was as tough as it was tender. If one of her sons was hanging out with the wrong crowd, she did not hesitate to yank him off street corners. One son\u2019s friends were so worried that his mother was bringing attention to the group that they told him he could no longer associate with them. \u201cI live what I live in front of the children,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see me robbing, stealing, doing all those things. They don\u2019t see those things. \u201d Her parental role extended to several of her children\u2019s friends, whom she welcomed into her home. Even now, her door is open to all. Friends regularly drop by her Bronx apartment to chat and laugh. Children in the neighborhood greet her on the sidewalk. Ms. Parker, a widow, moved to New York from Florida in 2012. She came for love  \u2014   to be with a man she had met on vacation. They are now engaged. Because of the values she has instilled in them, Ms. Parker said, she does not worry for her grandchildren. \u201cI was always told children emulate what they see,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you raise them good and do the best that you can do, and they see this, then somewhere in their heart, it\u2019s going to be stored. \u201d She has long demonstrated her willingness to care for them. That respect is returned to her, and she demands that her grandchildren offer it to their absent parents, too. \u201cA lot of grandparents allow their grandchildren to call them \u2018Mother,\u2019 but that\u2019s not who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m their grandmother. I never allowed them to call me Mother. They have a mother. I\u2019m just taking her place right now, but she\u2019s still your mother. \u201d Health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, prevent Ms. Parker from working. Each month, she receives $630 from Social Security, $123 in survivor benefits and $376 in federal benefits for one of her grandchildren. She also receives $771 in food stamps and $310 in cash from public assistance. Ms. Parker is responsible for paying $246 toward her $1, 541 monthly rent the bulk of it is paid by a Family Eviction Prevention Subsidy provided by New York State. Through the Visiting Nurse Service, Ms. Parker contacted the Family Center, an affiliate of FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. FPWA is one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. A Family Center caseworker noticed that much of the family\u2019s furniture was badly worn. The caseworker applied for a grant from FPWA, and Ms. Parker was approved for a grant for $1, 000 in August to buy new furniture. \u201cIt feels more like home because I didn\u2019t have anywhere for people to sit,\u201d she said. That home is still very close quarters, which leads to the occasional fight. But her family makes the most of it, Ms. Parker said, and has learned to navigate the different personalities in a limited space. Ms. Parker wishes she had moments of calm and solitude. \u201cThere\u2019s never a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cNot even when I take a shower, because somebody\u2019s knocking on the door. Oh, my Lord. \u201d Ms. Parker said her home was brimming with love, giving her reason to anticipate an even brighter future. \u201cI hope the children do well, finish school and my fianc\u00e9 and I get married and sail away somewhere,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742561914.2048547}
