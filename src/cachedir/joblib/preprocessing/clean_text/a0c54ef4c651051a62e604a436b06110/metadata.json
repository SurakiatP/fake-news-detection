Karma is a b*tch, ain\u2019t it Hillary? \\nHillary Clinton thought if there was one person in the world that she could trust, it was her \u201cfriend\u201d Huma Abedin. \\nThanks to a new drop of emails from Wikileaks, it looks like even Huma has turned on Hillary. Her and John Podest apparently sent a ton of emails right before her campaign started about Hillary Clinton\u2019s brain damage. \\nThe most damning of all the emails from Huma read: \u201cShe (Hillary Clinton) is still not perfect in the head.\u201d Email from Huma Abedin \\nThe message was sent as a warning to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign staffers to stick to the notes since Hillary still couldn\u2019t think clearly. \\nNow, I am no doctor, but I\u2019 say if even your closest friends are talking behind your back about you having head problems, that is probably a sign you are sick. Too sick, in fact, to run for president. \\nHowever, I can guarantee you that the second this email got released, Hillary gave the kill order to her media goons to bury this story so deep that it will never see the light of day. \\nIf you want the world to see how Broken Hillary Clinton really is, then do us all a favor and share this out to everyone you know on Facebook. This is our ONLY way to get the truth out there! '"}, "time": 1742561939.7915323}
