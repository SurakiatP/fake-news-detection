[Mr. Durox said the name change, which was talked about on Sunday evening following the defeat of   migration candidate Marine Le Pen, is likely to be Les Patriotes citing the office of vice president of the party Florian Philippot registering the name in 2015.  \u201cI know that the director of the cabinet of Florian Philippot filed the name \u2018Les Patriotes\u2019 in April 2015, perhaps already with the prospect of a name change, but nothing is sure,\u201d he told Breitbart London. He said the legacy of the name Front National still \u201cscared off\u201d  some voters and a name change and rebranding could bring more people into the movement. The Front National, or perhaps soon Les Patriotes, are challenging the establishment parties in next month\u2019s French legislative elections. Mr. Durox, who is standing in Paris, said all the establishment candidates he is facing are old and have out of date ideas. \u201cI shall incarnate the true change of my generation,\u201d said the    who is a history and geography teacher. Durox was dismissive of his opponents saying they \u201chave the presumption to pretend that they represent a real alternative\u201d. The Front National is expected to win a minimum of 15 seats in the upcoming election, though some have forecast they could gain as many as 50 seats in the French National Assembly.  Durox said the party should look toward forming a group in the assembly, which would take at least 15 deputies, in order to be able to have more time to speak in the chamber and have more influence. \u201cIn any case 50 [deputies] would be a good number, especially if we are superior in numbers to the Socialist party,\u201d he added. Currently, the Front National has two members in the assembly, one of which is Marion   Pen who recently announced her resignation from politics following the presidential election.   Pen said she wanted more time to spend with her young daughter away from the stresses of political life. \u201cWhen a brave leader leaves his troops it is always very sad, but she is very young and we are sure that she will come back even stronger,\u201d Durox said in reaction to the news of   Pen\u2019s decision. He added: \u201cThe future belongs to her. \u201d Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com '"}, "time": 1742564613.7901723}
