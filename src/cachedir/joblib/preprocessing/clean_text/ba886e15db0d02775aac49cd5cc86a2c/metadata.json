She would never wake up. \\nThat morning Oswalt took their 7-year-old daughter, Alice, to school and even picked up Michelle\\'s favorite coffee on the way home. \\nAt 9:40 a.m., when Owsalt returned, she was still sound asleep and snoring.

That\u2019s what the paramedics there were saying while I was screaming and throwing up.\u201d \\nThe dangers of the prescription drug Xanax, a brand of benzodiazepines, or \u201cbenzos,\u201d cannot be understated. The medication is meant to treat anxiety, but it can easily be abused . \\nIn combination with alcohol, Xanax (and other benzos) can cause users to experience complete \u201cblackouts\u201d for extended periods of time. \\nIt\\'s incredibly addicting and very easy to overdose on.

It has given him a break from the never-ending grief that comes with the territory of losing such a close loved one. Image Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for The New Yorker \\nThe 47-year-old told The New York Times that going onstage has been: \\n\u201c...a rebuke to grief, an acceptance of the messiness of life. I\u2019ll never be at 100 percent again, but that won\u2019t stop me from living this.\u201d \\nFor now, Oswalt will continue to grow and live with his daughter. With help from a journalist and a researcher, he\\'s determined to solve the \u201cGolden State Murders\u201d on behalf of his late wife\\'s hard work. '"}, "time": 1742562551.4233277}
