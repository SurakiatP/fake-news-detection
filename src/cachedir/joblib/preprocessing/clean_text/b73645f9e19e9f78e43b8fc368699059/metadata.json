Kathie was Kathleen Durst, Ms. Hughes\u2019s younger sister, who at 29 was in the final months of medical school. Her marriage to Mr. Durst, the eccentric scion of a prominent New York real estate family, had splintered under Mr. Durst\u2019s efforts to control her, repeated rounds of quarreling and, finally, violence. No, Ms. Hughes, said she had responded, but I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about Kathie. Mr. Durst cut her off, saying he was going to the police, and abruptly ended the call, she said. Ms. Hughes remembers that as she hung up the phone in her East Side apartment that February evening in 1982, she turned to her husband, Tom Hughes, and said, \u201cI think he killed her. \u201d Today, Mr. Durst, 73, sits in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on a charge of murder  \u2014   not of Kathie, but of Susan Berman, a confidante who, investigators say, knew his secrets and shielded him from newspaper reporters after his wife vanished. John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, claims that Mr. Durst shot Ms. Berman in the back of her head at her Los Angeles home in December 2000, fearing that she would cooperate with a newly revived investigation into Ms. Durst\u2019s disappearance. Mr. Durst was never charged with his wife\u2019s killing, nor was anyone else. (Ms. Durst\u2019s body has never been recovered.) He and his battery of lawyers have insisted that he did not kill Ms. Berman and does not know what happened to his first wife. Ms. Hughes has not paid much attention to events in Los Angeles. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a disaster,\u201d she said, with bitterness, of the coming trial during her first interview in more than three decades, at an Upper East Side apartment building where her sister once lived with Mr. Durst. A large photograph of Kathie Durst dressed in an Annie   dress and a   hat from the Wild West hung over the fireplace. \u201cHollywood and publicity,\u201d Ms. Hughes said. \u201cThey\u2019re not really interested in my sister  \u2014   they\u2019re interested in Bob. I just want to find out what happened to my sister. \u201d The obsession nearly destroyed her. Kathie was the youngest daughter and the fifth child of a telephone company representative, who died in 1966, and a working mother. After graduating from high school in New Hyde Park on Long Island, Kathie trained as a dental hygienist and moved to a building owned by the Durst family on the East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Durst oversaw the building and when the two met, there was an instant attraction. \u201cIt was a mutual attraction, a chemistry,\u201d Ms. Hughes recalled. \u201cHe had a magnetism. Kathie had the same thing. \u201d The Hugheses liked Mr. Durst when he started dating Kathie, then 19, in early 1971. He was nine years older and from another world. His father, Seymour Durst, presided over a Manhattan real estate company whose towers formed the skyline. The Dursts were low key, not the stereotypical    developers. For a while, Ms. Hughes said, her sister was unaware just how wealthy the Durst family was. After their second date, Mr. Durst asked Kathie to move with him to Vermont to run a health food store. But after a short time in Vermont, the couple returned to New York, and Mr. Durst resumed working at the family real estate business. They were married in a private ceremony on his birthday, April 12, in 1973. The couple partied at Studio 54, the   disco that was a haunt for celebrities and others. They sailed on the Mediterranean Sea and traveled to Thailand. Bob and Kathie socialized with Mary and Tom, even buying a racehorse together from a friend who was a breeder. \u201cHe heard it was a tax deduction,\u201d Tom Hughes said. \u201cI think he liked that part of it. \u201d But the Dursts\u2019 relationship took a dark turn after 1976, when Mr. Durst forced his wife to have an abortion. He didn\u2019t want children she did. \u201cThat\u2019s when it went south,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. Ms. Durst sought independence, enrolling in nursing school in Danbury, Conn. The couple bought a cottage nearby, on Lake Truesdale in South Salem, N. Y. in northern Westchester County, but also had a   on Riverside Drive in Manhattan and rented an apartment on the East Side. After graduating from nursing school, Ms. Durst immediately started medical school at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, hoping to become a pediatrician. \u201cShe was excited to be a medical student,\u201d recalled a classmate, Dr. Alicia  . \u201cShe worked hard. She always took a seat in the front row and took notes. \u201d By 1980, the couple quarreled frequently, Ms. Hughes said, adding that her sister often called her with accounts of their latest fight. Ms. Durst contacted a divorce lawyer. She gathered damaging material about her husband and the Durst family, she told friends and her sister. Mr. Durst has long acknowledged his marijuana use, and his wife used cocaine, according to friends and members of her family. Both had affairs, his and her friends and relatives say. Mr. Durst, they say, cut off her credit cards to keep her close. \u201cBob\u2019s possessiveness was escalating into physical violence,\u201d said a nursing school classmate of Ms. Durst\u2019s, Eleanor Joy Schwank, during an interview in 2000. \u201cI never witnessed it, but Kathie would call me saying, \u2018Bobby is really violent. \u2019\u201d Mr. Durst, impatient to leave a McCormack family gathering, yanked his wife\u2019s hair, shocking her family, Ms. Hughes said. On another occasion, he stormed into their East Side apartment, where Ms. Durst was talking with friends, and kicked an acquaintance in the face. The man later settled a lawsuit over the episode with Mr. Durst. Three weeks before Ms. Durst disappeared, she was treated at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx for bruises she suffered during an argument with her husband, according to several friends and medical records later recovered by investigators. Ms. Durst told her sister, her friends and virtually anyone who would listen, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t let Bob get away with it. \u201d Geraldine McInerney, a friend of Ms. Hughes\u2019s, said she had met Ms. Durst at the couple\u2019s East Side apartment on Jan. 29, 1982. Ms. Durst wanted someone she knew to sublet the apartment so that if \u201cthe situation between her and Durst became too threatening, she would have an alternative place to stay,\u201d Ms. McInerney said in a 1983 affidavit. It was the last time Ms. McInerney saw her. A week later, Mr. Durst walked into a Manhattan police station to file a missing person\u2019s report. He carried a copy of New York magazine with his father\u2019s picture and the headline \u201cThe Men Who Own New York. \u201d Mr. Durst told the police that he had put his wife on a train to Manhattan from Westchester County on Sunday night so that she could attend school the next day. He said he had later spoken to her by phone, after she arrived at their Riverside Drive  . Soon, the story was splashed across New York\u2019s tabloids. Mr. Durst, who hired detectives and offered a reward, told his family, friends and the police that his wife might have run away with a drug dealer. Her family found that implausible, since she was only months away from graduating. \u201cShe always wanted to take care of children,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. Decades later, in an interview with the producers of the   HBO documentary \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\u201d Mr. Durst acknowledged that much of what he had told the police was a lie. Why did he lie? \u201cI wanted them to leave me alone,\u201d he explained to Mr. Lewin, the Los Angeles prosecutor, during an interrogation after his 2015 arrest in New Orleans on gun charges. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to somebody questioning my veracity. \u201d Frustrated by what they regarded as a desultory investigation by New York City detectives, Ms. Hughes and a small band of friends became amateur sleuths, tracking sightings of her sister and Mr. Durst and scouring phone records. By March 1982, they were making furtive   visits to what they believed was the scene of the crime, the stone cottage at the edge of Lake Truesdale. On one trip, Mr. Hughes found an ominous list in Mr. Durst\u2019s handwriting in a garbage can: \u201ctown dump, bridge, dig, boat\u201d and \u201cshovel. \u201d They found Ms. Durst\u2019s diamond earrings in her drawer at the Riverside Drive apartment, which Mr. Durst had told the police she was wearing when she disappeared. To this day, Ms. Hughes is shocked that New York City detectives never searched the cottage. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney pored over pages and pages of phone records from the cottage, the apartments and the Durst Organization that they had gotten from the detectives. Night after night, the two women matched the phone numbers to names until they discovered that Mr. Durst had made collect calls to his family\u2019s business from Ship Bottom, N. J. shortly after his wife vanished. The calls, coupled with the list of words, led them to suspect that Ms. Durst might be buried somewhere in the nearby Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney borrowed a car and drove the investigating detectives down to Ship Bottom. But the detectives seemed uninterested, Ms. Hughes said, and the case was no longer generating headlines. Mr. Durst was not charged with any crime. Ms. Hughes and her family wrestled with Mr. Durst in Surrogate\u2019s Court for control of Ms. Durst\u2019s estate, but suffered another defeat in 1983. \u201cI was just so fed up,\u201d Ms. Hughes said. \u201cI broke down. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. \u201d For a long time, she refused to drive a car or even leave her apartment. She focused on her two daughters, whom she had long neglected. In the end, Ms. Hughes was left without answers as to her sister\u2019s fate. But she never lost her conviction about Mr. Durst\u2019s culpability. Ms. Hughes, her husband and Ms. McInerney cooperated with an investigation into Ms. Durst\u2019s disappearance that was started in 2000 by an enterprising State Police investigator, Joe Becerra, only to be disappointed again when the local district attorney did not indict Mr. Durst. In recent years, Ms. Hughes and other members of her family have gone back to Surrogate\u2019s Court to fight Mr. Durst and to have her sister declared dead as of Jan. 31, 1982. Their mother, Ann McCormack, died in May at 102, without knowing what happened to Kathie. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that after 35 years New York has not charged him with murder,\u201d Robert Abrams, whose law firm, Abrams Fensterman, is representing Ms. Durst\u2019s family, said of Mr. Durst. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to do it criminally, we\u2019ll do it civilly. \u201d Whatever happens in Los Angeles, Mr. Durst will return to federal prison to serve the remaining time on a   gun conviction. \u201cWe want some sort of peace, some answers as to where she\u2019s at,\u201d Ms. Hughes said. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he just tell us? He has nothing to lose. He\u2019s going to stay in jail. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563039.8634715}
