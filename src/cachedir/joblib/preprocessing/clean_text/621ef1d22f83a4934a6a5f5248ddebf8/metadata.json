We have never before had Norway on the list of targets for our strategic weapons. But if this develops, Norway\u2019s population will suffer,\u201d he warned. \\n\u201cBecause we need to react against definitive military threats. And we have things to react to, I might as well tell it like it is,\u201d Klintsevitsj added. \\nRussia has on several occasions criticized the plans to deploy 330 US troops at V\u00e6rnes. Norway\u2019s defence minister, Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, has rejected those criticisms and insisted that the deployment does not constitute a US military base but is rather a test run that will be evaluated during 2017. \\n\u201cThere is no objective reason for the Russians to react to this. But the Russians are reacting at the moment in the same way toward almost everything the Nato countries are doing,\u201d S\u00f8reide said. \\nBefore joining Nato in 1949, Norway allayed Russian fears by pledging not to open its territory to foreign combat troops so long as Norway was not attacked or threatened with attack. \\nNorway\u2019s government argues that Nato troops are already training regularly in the country and that the deployment of troops does not equate to the opening of a permanent American base. \\nThe US already has vast amounts of military equipment positioned in Norway \u2014 notably in tunnels dug into mountains \u2014 but no troops. \\nKlintsevitsj\u2019s remarks bring to mind similar Russian comments made about Norway\u2019s neighbour to the south, Denmark. \\nIn March 2015, Russia\u2019s ambassador to Denmark warned that Danish ships will become Russian targets if Denmark joins Nato\u2019s missile defence system. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Danes fully understand the consequences of what will happen if Denmark joins the American-controlled missile defence. If it happens, Danish war ships will become targets for Russian atomic missiles,\u201d Mikhail Vanin wrote in an opinion piece published by Jyllands-Posten.'"}, "time": 1742562138.542128}
