According to the former officer, Alexandra Drake, her supervisor, Michael Masella, a lieutenant with the New Boston Police Department, was sexually threatening multiple female officers and would brag about he preyed on women at traffic stops. \\nDrake blew the whistle about her superior\u2019s behavior and filed a report along with another employee who witnessed his behavior. However, instead of looking into the allegations, the department fired Drake and accused her of lying. \\nAccording to a recent lawsuit , Drake noticed Masella\u2019s disturbing behavior while she was training under him at the New Boston Police department. The department alleges that she was fired for incorrectly filling out a police report, but she says she filed the report exactly as she was ordered to, by her superior, Masella. \\nAccording to the lawsuit, \u201c After completing the stop, he told Drake that he wanted to just take them out and \u2018rape\u2019 them rather than issue a citation. Masella would routinely make comments about female drivers whom he thought found him attractive or good looking. He has apparently developed a \u2018rapability\u2019 scale about female drivers and would test Drake whether a particular driver was \u2018rapable.\u2019 \u201d \\n\u201cMasella spoke very negatively about the two former female employees, which made Drake nervous. Drake was certain that the slightest slip could make her a target of severe harassment, termination of employment or even rape, \u201d it continued. \\nDrake says that Smith made inappropriate advances towards her on several occasions while they were on and off-duty. \\n\u201cMasella arrived in a cruiser while he was on duty wearing a full police uniform. When Drake opened the front door, Masella asked her if she was naked. Drake told Masella she \u2018was not\u2019 at which point Masella stated \u2018Oh, alright I will come back later.\u2019 \u201d the lawsuit stated. \\nCounty attorney Donald Smith denied commenting on behalf of the police department, telling NECN that, \u201c As a policy, the Town of New Boston does not comment on pending litigation. The Town is in the process of preparing a response to the allegations brought forth by Ms. Drake.\u201d \\nIn the statement to the press, Smith denied the charges. \\n\u201cThe complaint contains inaccurate information which will be addressed as part of the ongoing legal process,\u201d Smith said. \\nWhen Drake made a complaint to the police chief about the issue, she was the one who was interrogated instead of Masella, and she was fired shortly after. \\n\u201cDuring this interrogation of Drake, she was subjected to a barrage of questioning lasting for over an hour while the offending supervisor, Masella stood close by,\u201d the lawsuit stated. \\nTo add insult to injury Drake was issued a warning for violating the county\u2019s sexual harassment policy with her termination. \\nUnfortunately, this type of response to good cops, who try to call out corruption in their department is the rule, not the exception. \\nPreviously, the Free Thought Project brought you the story of Laura Schook, who tried to call out corruption in her department. Naturally, they tried to run her through the mud and fire her. \\nPrior to Schook, we broke the story of a cop in Buffalo, NY who was beaten and fired after she stopped a fellow cop from nearly killing a handcuffed man. She is still fighting for her pension. \\nIn Kentucky, a sheriff\u2019s deputy was fired for \u201cinsubordination\u201d after pointing out that the sheriff had planted drugs in another deputy\u2019s car. Even though the sheriff was indicted, the deputy was still fired. \\nIn September of 2014, we exposed the Baltimore police department\u2019s attempt to intimidate a whistleblower officer. Detective Joe Crystal became a target of intimidation for his entire department after testifying against other officers in a misconduct case. Following his testimony, he received threats from other officers and even found dead rats on he and his wife\u2019s cars. \\nThe thin blue line, it seems, is akin to the mafia \u2014 cross it and you will be snubbed out by the rest of the gang.
