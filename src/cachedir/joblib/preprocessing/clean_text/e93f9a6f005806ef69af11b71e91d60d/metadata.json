[\u201cWe have 1. 5 million unemployed, and one million   looking for   work,\u201d the former diplomat and chairman of Migration Watch, Lord Andrew Green, has told the Lords Economic Select Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if the barrel is empty. \u201d  Lord Green emphasised that \u201cstrong public demand to reduce immigration\u201d made achieving a substantial reduction a democratic imperative. The present government remains committed to a target of bringing net immigration down \u201cfrom the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands\u201d which was first set in 2010 but has been missed by a wide margin every year. \u201cI would say that even 100, 000 [migrants] a year would add about nine million to our population over the next   years\u201d Green noted, suggesting that controlling population growth, reducing strain on public services and encouraging community cohesion should be the government\u2019s policy focus. Also providing evidence at the hearing was Philippe Legrain, a visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics European Institute and an adviser to former European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso. Legrain expressed outrage that Lord Green could suggest that   was desirable. \u201c  is clearly feasible,\u201d the economist conceded. \u201cI mean, Robinson Crusoe scraped by on his island. But the idea that it\u2019s desirable is insane!\u201d \u201cWhat is   if not \u2018British jobs for British workers\u2019?\u201d Legrain asked again later, clearly incredulous. Paradoxically, the   \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d has claimed elsewhere that a substantial reduction in the Swedish population between the 1870s and 1910s \u201crelieved pressure on the land, drove up the productivity and wages of those who remained, and helped catapult Sweden from grinding rural poverty to prosperity within fewer than 50 years. \u201d His own favoured policy on migration is global free movement. He argues that any controls at all are \u201ceconomically stupid, politically unsustainable, and morally wrong\u201d. Legrain\u2019s extreme open borders advocacy was briefly picked up by Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, the former Secretary of State for Scotland, at the hearing: \u201cBasically what you\u2019re advocating is a complete  \u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe problem we have is that people can\u2019t get GPs appointments the National Health Service is under enormous pressure there\u2019s huge opposition to building on the green belt. Isn\u2019t this an idealistic economic model which is completely impractical in terms of the real problems that we face?\u201d Legrain countered that \u201cany strains that emerge on public services are not due to [immigration] but rather due to the failure of public services to be flexible or adapt to change\u201d. The hearing comes just week\u2019s after Migration Watch revealed that British businesses would not face a shortfall of workers  .'"}, "time": 1742628601.128612}
