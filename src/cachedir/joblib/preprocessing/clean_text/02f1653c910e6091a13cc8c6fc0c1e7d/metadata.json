The settlement resolves government accusations that Harley sold roughly 340, 000 \u201csuper tuners,\u201d enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified to the Environmental Protection Agency. Harley did not admit liability, and said in a statement that it disagreed with the government\u2019s position, arguing that the devices were designed and sold to be used in \u201ccompetition only. \u201d The company said the settlement represented \u201ca   compromise with the E. P. A. on areas of law we interpret differently, particularly E. P. A. \u2019s assertion that it is illegal for anyone to modify a certified vehicle even if it will be used solely for     competition. \u201d According to the government, the sale of such   defeat devices violated the federal Clean Air Act. Harley was also accused of selling more than 12, 600 motorcycles that were not covered by an E. P. A. certification governing clean air compliance. The announcement comes at a time of greater scrutiny on emissions and defeat devices by regulators in Washington after Volkswagen admitted using illegal software to evade emissions standards in nearly 600, 000 vehicles in the United States. The settlement calls for   to stop selling the super tuners by Tuesday, and to buy back and destroy all such tuners in stock at its dealerships. The E. P. A. said the modified settings increased power and performance, but also increased the motorcycles\u2019 emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Harley, based in Milwaukee, will also spend $3 million on an unrelated project to reduce air pollution, the Justice Department said.'"}, "time": 1742562545.4679677}
