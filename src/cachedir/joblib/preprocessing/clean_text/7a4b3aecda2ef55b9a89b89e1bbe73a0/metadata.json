It is all provided by businesses looking to get a bit of publicity by encouraging everyone to fulfill their civic duty. The only problem? All those giveaways are technically against the law. \u201cThe basic line on this is in an election where a federal candidate is on the ballot, you cannot give anyone any reward  \u2014   anything of any value  \u2014   for turning out to vote,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a civic pride thing or if it\u2019s not about any one candidate. \u201d But companies are rarely penalized for Election Day freebies, he said. That means these kinds of giveaway offers pop up every four years, including today. At some businesses, an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker is your ticket to free things. It will get you a free cookie at Great American Cookies and a red, white and blue   pin at Foot Locker. A sticker was also previously required by Krispy Kreme, which changed its offer (and deleted a tweet advertising it) on Monday evening. Now voters and nonvoters alike can get a free snack from the   which, perhaps reflecting political tensions, told its customers that a robust turnout can ensure that \u201cdemocracy lives on. \u201d Other businesses require you to simply say you voted. Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s will give you a free   pepperoni pizza if you say you voted or use a coupon code. You can also get free chips and cheese dip at California Tortilla by saying one of three   passwords (one is \u201cMake Queso Great Again\u201d another is a more Clintonian \u201cI\u2019m With Queso. \u201d) \u201cThis comes up every election because businesses have this   idea that they can promote their business and be patriotic,\u201d Professor Hasen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intuitively obvious that it\u2019s illegal to give things away to people who exercise their civic pride. I certainly understand the confusion. \u201d Some giveaways are acceptable, however. The big one is transportation: It is common for political groups, churches and others to provide voters a free lift to the polls on Election Day. In that spirit, Uber and Google have teamed up on a feature that lets voters find their polling place and then request a ride there.   Uber users will get $20 off their ride if they use the code \u201cVOTETODAY. \u201d Lyft is offering a 45 percent discount on one ride (because the nation is electing its 45th president) between 7 a. m. and 8 p. m. in almost two dozen cities. Zipcar, a   service, is providing free use of its cars so people can drive themselves to the polls. Arrangements like that shouldn\u2019t pose a legal problem, experts said. But when it comes to an election, everything is up for debate. \u201cYou can have an extended law school class discussion about exactly what is the difference between driving someone to the polls when it would cost them several dollars to get there versus just giving them $5 outright,\u201d said Edward B. Foley, a professor of law and the director of the Election Law Program at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s a slippery slope, to use a term law professors like to use a lot. \u201d Then there is Starbucks. Its civic engagement  \u2014   and unease  \u2014   has been on display since last week, when it released a special edition paper cup meant as a statement of national unity. On Tuesday, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Howard Schultz, sent a   pep talk to all Starbucks employees that began with an admission of his own   anxiety and an elegy for the lost \u201cpromise of America. \u201d He urged his employees to stay positive and be kind to one another and the people around them. \u201cIn the face of this epic, unseemly election and the concern we all share about the direction of our country and the lack of truth and void of leadership, we can still make a difference in the lives of the people we touch and influence every day,\u201d he wrote. But will it be giving anything away? A spokesman on Monday night said the answer was no.'"}, "time": 1742562634.5409007}
