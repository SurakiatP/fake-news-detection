Until recently, tourists paid $50 to visit the crumbling and abandoned former Soviet sites, which served during the Cold War as a defence against naval attack from the Black Sea. \\nNow the bunkers are coming back online. After Russia took control of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, signs went up in the woods around the sites warning visitors against entering a \u201cforbidden zone of the Russian Ministry of Defence.\u201d A resident of a nearby village who said he was employed at the base last year said Russian soldiers had re-occupied the sites and blocked roads leading into the area. He was unable to say when the Russian soldiers arrived. \\n\u201cIt is a functioning military base with an anti-ship missile system,\u201d the villager told a Reuters reporter who visited the area in July. \\nThe bunkers are just one small part of a new Russian programme to militarise the Crimean peninsula. Based on recent site observations by Reuters, accounts from locals, media reports and official Russian data, Moscow has reanimated multiple Soviet-built facilities in the region, built new bases and stationed soldiers there. \\nCrimea sits at the southern end of a line of new and refurbished Russian military facilities that stretches north in an arc through western Russia and ends in the country\u2019s Baltic outpost of Kaliningrad. \\nThe military buildup is echoed in NATO countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, where U.S. forces are beefing up patrols and conducting more frequent exercises. \\nSpurred by years of growing mutual distrust and in particular the conflict in Ukraine, both Russia and NATO are boosting their military capabilities across eastern Europe, prompting officials such as Polish President Andrzej Duda and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to talk of a return to open hostilities. \\n\u201cWe have, in effect, slid into a new Cold War,\u201d Medvedev told a security conference in Munich in February. \\nTo be sure, the scale of the military confrontation is not the same. Disarmament deals in the past three decades have lowered the temperature of the nuclear confrontation. Absent too are the hundreds of thousands of troops who were stationed on either side of the Iron Curtain in eastern Europe during the Cold War. But elements of the conventional military standoff are now returning. \\nCrimea is one of the starkest examples. In a week touring the region, a Reuters reporter saw 18 sites, including naval bases, radar stations and airfields. Some were entirely new, some were old military sites that had been refurbished, and others were in the process of being refurbished. \\nMoscow has made no secret of its buildup in Crimea. But Reuters\u2019 observations, combined with the other information, shed light on its scale. \\nBritain\u2019s Defence Minister Michael Fallon said in September that London was concerned about military buildup in Crimea \u201cand indeed the militarisation of the Black Sea region generally. Both Bulgaria and Romania feel very threatened.\u201d \\nCrimea is now the closest Russian-controlled territory to NATO member Romania, which since May has hosted part of a U.S.-controlled international missile shield. The project is scheduled to become operational in late 2018, when work on a radar installation in Poland \u2013 the other main land-based component in the shield \u2013 is completed. \\nWashington says the shield is designed as a defence against Iranian missile strikes. But Russian President Vladimir Putin says the system and NATO are both threats to Russia\u2019s security, and has promised to retaliate. \\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment about its activities in Crimea. Nor did the regional government in Crimea. RING OF RADARS \\nOne part of Russia\u2019s expansion programme appears to be an attempt to re-create a chain of radar stations on rocky hilltops around Crimea. These stations offer an ideal vantage point for monitoring the Black Sea, and nearby NATO members Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania. \\nOne of the stations \u2013 a facility with four revolving radars each encased in a large white dome \u2013 sits halfway up a mountain near the Crimean seaside town of Feodosiya. Built in Soviet times, the station had been abandoned by the Ukrainian military. \\nNow the Russian armed forces have moved in. In July, two green Russian military vehicles with tall antennas were parked beneath the radars. \u201cThere is a military base here, air defence system and missiles,\u201d said a man who lives in a village about 300 metres from the base. \u201cThere are air defence systems on every cape here.\u201d \\nFurther around the coast, on the outskirts of the port city of Sevastopol, sits another radar station, called \u201cDnepr.\u201d Built by Soviet engineers, the station was out of order for years before the Russian annexation. A Reuters reporter saw dozens of soldiers in Russian military uniforms inside the base and guarding the perimeter. \\nBehind three lines of perimeter fencing were two structures, each around 300 meters long, with sloping sides partially covered by black metal sheets. The structures match archive images showing the Dnepr radar system. A Russian flag flew from the roof of a building near the two radar structures. \\nA sentry said that a nearby lighthouse that used to be a tourist attraction was now part of a military base and off limits to the public. \\nRussian newspaper Izvestiya quoted a military source in May as saying Moscow will restore the Dnepr station so it can \u201cdetect launches of ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles from the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea area.\u201d \\nThe Russian defence ministry did not respond to questions about the radar station. NEW SCHOOLS AND SWIMMING POOLS \\nThe Russian military buildup seen by Reuters goes beyond what existed in Crimea when it was under the control of Kiev, according to soldiers in Crimea, local residents and Ukrainian accounts of deployments before the annexation. \\nAt Perevalnoye, a small village at the foot of a mountain not far from Simferopol in the centre of the peninsula, Russia is transforming an abandoned Ukrainian military facility into two new bases. \\nInside the fenced perimeter of one in August, stood two 500-metre-long green hangars into which military vehicles drove. Nearby, trucks rumbled between a huge concrete plant and a construction site that will become a second base. \\nAccording to documents lodged by the defence ministry on the official website for public procurement tenders, one of the two bases will be for coast guards and the other for artillery units. \\nThe ministry documents, which were lodged from October 2014, indicate the combined projects will include dormitories for more than 1,000 soldiers, residential buildings with more than 300 apartments, an ammunition depot, hangars for more than 500 military vehicles, an artillery range and dining facilities. \\nA new school and a kindergarten with a pool, as well as barracks for a military orchestra, are also planned, the documents show. \\nThe ministry did not respond to questions about the Perevalnoye base. BASES EXPANDING \\nBefore Russia annexed Crimea, Moscow leased facilities from the Ukrainian state to house its Black Sea fleet, which has been based in Crimea for more than two centuries. Those facilities, mainly around Sevastopol, are now being expanded. \\nIn one bay on the outskirts of the city, according to procurement documents, the Russian military is building a training centre for navy divers. There will also be a mooring area and an aircraft runway that has been unused for 20 years will be brought back into service. \\nFrom the perimeter fence, a Reuters reporter saw concrete taxiways, large cranes, and work underway to reinforce the shoreline. \\nThe ministry did not reply to questions about the plans for that site. \\nMost of the expansion in Crimea is being carried out by the Russian navy and ground forces. But air capabilities are also being beefed up. \\nThe former Belbek civilian airport has been turned into a military air base, according to a Reuters reporter who went to the base. The terminal building has been shut and the entrance to the base is now guarded by a Russian marine. \\nAn Il-76 heavy military transport plane, with the insignia of the Russian air force, was parked on the airfield when Reuters visited. \\nTwo other military airfields that were abandoned by the Ukrainians are also now in use again by the Russian military. At the Novofyodorovka airfield, in a coastal village to the north of Sevastopol, a Reuters reporter saw half a dozen dark-grey SU-30 fighter jets and light-grey SU-24 frontline bombers. \\nAt the other recommissioned air base, in Djankoy, 40 km south of the de facto border separating Crimea from Ukrainian-controlled territory, Russian servicemen in blue uniform came and went throughout the day. Seven MI-24 attack helicopters were parked on the airfield. \\n\u201cThere were just two airplanes here when Ukraine ruled. And look at this place now, you can see much more here,\u201d a young soldier told Reuters at the checkpoint. \\nThe defence ministry did not respond to questions about the air bases'"}, "time": 1742628451.867755}
