Dania Williams, 23, grew up around crime in East New York in Brooklyn, trying to resist the calls to join a gang and trying to survive the violence that waited outside her front door. Without attentive parents, the temptations were everywhere. \u201cThey weren\u2019t as involved as they should be as parents,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cSo I did what I wanted to do. \u201d That included truancy and the occasional theft and no concerns about securing money in illicit ways. Retail jobs put cash in her pockets, but the work was always seasonal. Selling drugs offered a steadier source of income. \u201cI always had this thing for having stuff that I couldn\u2019t normally have, materialistic things that I didn\u2019t need,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to keep up with the latest fad. \u201d She remembered the warnings to correct the path she had chosen or she would wind up dead or in jail. She dismissed them as harsh judgments and hollow words from people she did not trust. Change seemed impossible. She accepted her fate. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get too deep, but you don\u2019t know how to get out of whatever deep you\u2019re in,\u201d Ms. Williams said. But there was one person in her life whom Ms. Williams could not just brush off: her grandmother. \u201cShe actually put in my head, \u2018You need to change,\u2019\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cBut where do I start? Where do I go? What do I do? Who do I talk to?\u201d In early 2016, she saw a path out. She attended an informational meeting for Green City Force, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people living in   homes for careers in the renewable energy industry. Green City Force is a partner of the Community Service Society, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Lawrence Harris, a program operation manager at Green City Force, was a team leader when he met Ms. Williams, an encounter he remembers vividly. Mr. Harris immediately set out to convince her a better life was possible and to break down her apparent skepticism about changing. \u201cI told her I\u2019d never lie, even if I\u2019m joking,\u201d Mr. Harris recalled. \u201cOnce they find you told them something untrue or not the whole story, they\u2019ll never listen to anything you have to say. \u201d He urged Ms. Williams to give the program a chance and worked closely with her to help build her confidence, holding her accountable for her choices and helping her be more accepting of others. On one occasion, Ms. Williams arrived to the program late  \u2014   punctuality has never been easy for her  \u2014   and was quite hard on herself. Mr. Harris knew then she was changing. \u201cEverything they said, they followed through with,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cThey never told me anything and then it didn\u2019t happen. \u201d After completing the Green City Force training, Ms. Williams began a   plumbing training program. She was also offered a   porter\u2019s job. Community Service Society used $349. 50 in Neediest Cases funds to buy Ms. Williams three months of MetroCards last spring for traveling to her job. \u201cI was never a dummy,\u201d she said. \u201cI was always book smart and street smart. I didn\u2019t use it in a good way. I used it to get money in the wrong way. Now, I\u2019m using it to get money in the right way. \u201d She said she had since quit her illegal activities and was fully focused on getting her plumbing certification and excelling at her porter job. She has even tried to recruit friends into Green City Force. \u201cThey made me want to turn my life around,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cThey said from the jump, we can\u2019t do anything for you, you have to want to do it yourself. You\u2019ll either take it and run with it or you\u2019ll just leave it at the door. So, I ran with it. I\u2019m running far. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628388.3517182}
