[\u201cTerrorism must be stopped in its tracks, or the horror you saw in Manchester and so many other places will continue forever,\u201d he said during his remarks in advance of a NATO summit in Brussels.  Trump called the attacks a reminder of the \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201cvicious\u201d evil that the world faced. \u201cInnocent little girls and so many others were horribly murdered and badly injured while attending a concert,\u201d he said, describing the victims of the attack. \u201cBeautiful lives with so much great potential, torn from their families forever and ever. \u201d Trump made his remarks during an unveiling of the Article 5 and the Berlin Wall memorials, recalling the success of the partnership against communism. The monument includes a section of one of the Twin Tower buildings that were destroyed on   which Trump described as \u201ca painful reminder\u201d of the threat the world still faced. The president again described the terrorists as \u201closers\u201d that should be obliterated from the world. \u201cWherever they exist in our societies, we must drive them out and never, ever let them back in,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563138.0996873}
