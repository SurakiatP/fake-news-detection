The fuss has nothing to do with Zinn\u2019s skill. His playing career yielded some distinctions  \u2014   including his being one of 11 players to steal home twice in a game and appearing as the first batter in Fenway Park. But most of his statistics over five   seasons, including a . 269 career batting average, suggest that he was a very ordinary athlete. The trait that set Zinn apart, and made his baseball card unusually valuable, was his ethnicity. Zinn was Jewish, which all but guaranteed him a following for generations. A fan subculture has long coalesced around Jewish ballplayers, so much so that their cards have a special category on eBay. Jeff Aeder, a Chicago real estate developer, is one of the most prominent figures in that subculture, and a 1914 Zinn card owned by a Maryland man has become, as other collectors describe it, Aeder\u2019s holy grail. It is believed to be the only card of its type still in existence. Aeder offered $125, 000 for the card in 2014 and nearly claimed it. But the deal went sour at the last minute. Aeder balked because, he said, he received a poor appraisal of the card\u2019s condition. The owner, Dan McKee of Baltimore County, refused to renegotiate. \u201cI blocked his email,\u201d said McKee, who bought the card for $2, 500 in 1995 at a show in Fort Washington, Pa. \u201cI don\u2019t do business like that. If you make a deal, you make a deal. \u201d \u201cIf Zinn was not a Jewish player, this card is probably worth $10, 000,\u201d Aeder said. \u201cIf you talk to any dealer or collector, they\u2019ll say McKee\u2019s idea of value is the most overblown, crazy valuation of all time. \u201d So why was Aeder willing, at one point, to pay $125, 000? \u201cIt really is something that if you have the means and the obsession, then someone pays a lot more than it\u2019s worth,\u201d he said. Aeder and McKee, both 54, remain in a bitter standoff that highlights how passions that sprout in childhood can drive the sports memorabilia market. \u201cZinn was not a significant player. The card, and the brouhaha surrounding it, is more interesting than the man,\u201d said John Thorn, the official historian for Major League Baseball. \u201cIf anything, it illustrates something so interesting about the hobby, the acquisitiveness about the fan. There is this transfer of power by owning this thing. \u201d McKee, a software engineer who now works part time, became a collector when he was 7 and ultimately concentrated on unique cards and sets. McKee periodically posts some of his cards on auction websites  \u2014   mostly out of curiosity, he said. He tends to list his items at exorbitant prices because, he said, he loathes parting with any card. \u201cI got stuff up in my eBay store that is actually part of my collection,\u201d McKee said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd every now and then, somebody hits the \u2018buy it now\u2019 button and I\u2019ll scream. \u201d He did sell an 1894 Baltimore Orioles set  \u2014   which was produced by the Alpha Photo Engraving Company  \u2014   for six figures in 2006. McKee said the transaction had helped pay for his current home, but he declined to specify the sales price or the worth of his overall collection, which he called \u201ctoo valuable to admit to. \u201d McKee displays much of his memorabilia in open cabinets and a World War II map case that he received from his Army National Guard unit. The more valuable items, however, are kept in safes. \u201cI keep a   in each one,\u201d he said, then added dryly, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather not use it if I don\u2019t have to. \u201d Aeder also started collecting as a boy, while growing up in a family that, he has said, included Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax in its Yom Kippur prayers to honor his choice not to play in Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on the holiday. When Aeder was in his 30s, he said, he decided to sell his entire collection at a card show. That plan did not work out. \u201cInstead of selling, I wound up spending every penny on me buying new cards,\u201d he said. After completing the sets from his childhood, he turned to collecting the cards of Jewish baseball players. \u201cMany collectors are happy just to get one card of each player,\u201d said Martin Abramowitz of Newton, Mass. whose collection ended up with Aeder after Abramowitz sold it to someone else to help pay for his daughter\u2019s wedding. \u201cJeff is determined to get every card of every Jewish player. \u201d Aeder sees curating such artifacts as an extension of the philanthropy that prompted Chicago Magazine to pick him and his wife, Jennifer Levine, as its \u201cChicagoans of the Year\u201d in 2013. Among other things, the couple founded the Wolcott School for children with learning disabilities and Milt\u2019s Barbecue for the Perplexed, a kosher restaurant that donates all of its profits to charity. In March, Aeder introduced the online Jewish Baseball Museum. \u201cMy idea was to celebrate both the rich history of Jews in America and how baseball was an opportunity to fit in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd today, now that they fit in, it\u2019s an opportunity for them to feel more Jewish. \u201d McKee said he had no idea that Zinn was Jewish when he bought his card more than 20 years ago. McKee valued it for another reason. It was part of one of three sets that appeared as an insert in The Baltimore News and that provided a full season schedule on the back of each card. A 1914 version of these     included the first card ever made of Zinn, who was then in his fourth season and playing for the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League. Unlike the more popular cards of that era, which were produced by the American Tobacco Company, the   were made from relatively thin material  \u2014   like that of a playing card, but without the slick coating  \u2014   and they were mostly discarded at the close of a season. As a result, few exist today. McKee said he had discovered 50 cards from the three   sets some of them turned up as markers in old books. Aeder first spotted the Zinn card in 2014 on McKee\u2019s eBay store, where it was originally listed in 2010 as one of McKee\u2019s \u201cshow and tell\u201d items  \u2014   for $250, 000. \u201cHe wrote me and offered me $10, 000,\u201d McKee said. \u201cHe rubbed me wrong, right off the bat. \u201d At Aeder\u2019s behest, McKee said, he took a vacation day from his job to drive four hours to New Jersey to have the card authenticated  \u2014   or \u201cslabbed\u201d  \u2014   at the Sportscard Guaranty Company. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to try to get a number,\u201d McKee said. But the company also rated the card, giving it a one out of 10. \u201cIt\u2019s a   card,\u201d McKee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s technical grade  \u2014   because of the blue all the way to the edge, it has some chipping, it has a crease, it has some paper loss on the back  \u2014   they\u2019re never going to give it more than a one or a 1. 5. \u201d The final grade disturbed Aeder. \u201cThe pictures he had sent did not look like it was a one,\u201d Aeder said. McKee said Aeder had suddenly begun overstating the importance of the card\u2019s condition. Aeder did ask about it in their first email exchange, McKee said, \u201cand I answered: \u2018The only one known. That\u2019s the only condition you need to know. \u2019\u201d At an impasse, McKee and Aeder parted ways. They say they have not been in contact since. \u201cI\u2019m coming to terms with the fact that I may never own the Zinn card,\u201d Aeder said. \u201cWell, at least, I know I will never buy it from Dan McKee. \u201d But both he and McKee hold out hope that another Zinn   card could still turn up somewhere. \u201cI have hopes that there\u2019s plenty more of those out there,\u201d McKee said. \u201cThat I\u2019m going to find. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628299.0753932}
