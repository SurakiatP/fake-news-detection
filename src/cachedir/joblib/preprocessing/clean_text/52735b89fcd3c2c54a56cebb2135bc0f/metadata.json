Posted at 2:00 pm on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. \\nAs Twitchy reported earlier , the FBI has decided to reopen Hillary\u2019s email case because of recent developments, aka the WikiLeaks email dumps that Americans have been reading through on social media. \\nGuessing the FBI felt stupid that they weren\u2019t the ones actually finding these things \u2026 maybe? \\nAnd as can be expected, just like the big babies they are, the Left \u201ccrapped\u201d themselves immediately; take for example poor Paul Krugman: It\\'s bad enough having the media do the \"raises questions,\" substance-free innuendo thing. Worse when the FBI director does it. Disgraceful \\n\u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) October 28, 2016 \\nDisgraceful! Actually what\u2019s disgraceful is a woman like Hillary Clinton skating by with such blatant criminal acts, but we digress, right Paul. He needs a cat, anyone have a spare one they can loan him. \\nAnd then there\u2019s other \u201cLeftist\u201d outlets: The FBI Director\u2019s letter about the Clinton emails says a lot less than the media wants you to think https://t.co/tayXM9iyKj pic.twitter.com/TLRoW0Un00 \\n\u2014 ThinkProgress (@thinkprogress) October 28, 2016 \\nHA HA HA HA As we overreact to the FBI reopening Hillary email case, can someone please remind me, is James Comey in the tank or not? I can\\'t keep track \\n\u2014 John Ziegler (@Zigmanfreud) October 28, 2016 \\nNo one is overreacting but the media, John. Trending Now that FBI\\'s reopened Hillary investigation, can THIS be far behind? (Hint: Bill, fire up the jet!) \\nAnyone have some Xanax just lying around? FBI Dir also informed u that \u201cthe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant\u201d but that won\\'t burn a witch, right? https://t.co/nOl0BWpxZt \\n\u2014 Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) October 28, 2016 Every news channel reporting that the FBI is \"reopening\" their investigation into Hillary\\'s emails. FBI, however, didn\\'t use that language. \\n\u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 28, 2016 \\nAnything to protect their queen, right? Fun fact: No Democrat has ever served as Director of the FBI. \\n\u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) October 28, 2016 \\nGet the popcorn, these meltdowns are going to be entertaining at least throughout the weekend.'"}, "time": 1742563958.419258}
