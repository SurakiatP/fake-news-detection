[The TV series telling the story of the fictional \u201cfirst female pitcher in Major League Baseball\u201d has been canceled after a single, shortened and   season, Fox has announced.  Executive producer Kevin Falls revealed the network\u2019s decision on his Twitter feed, thanking the \u201cfaithful fans\u201d for \u201ctrying so hard\u201d to save the show. I\u2019m sorry to tell you that @PITCHonFOX will not be getting a second season. #Pitch,  \u2014   Kevin Falls (@KevinFalls) May 2, 2017,  Falls heads up Left Coast Productions, and if \u201cPitch\u201d was any indication, then the \u201cleft\u201d part of that moniker is fitting. Within the first two minutes of the opening scene of the first episode, \u201cPitch\u201d worked in both gay activist and TV host Ellen DeGeneres and former Secretary of State and failed Democrat candidate for president, Hillary Clinton. The first few episodes of the short order, single season also featured Fox Sports 1\u2019s Katie Nolan, who portrayed herself as a TV sports analyst, the same Katie Nolan who took to Twitter to call popular Fox News personality Sean Hannity a \u201cliteral fu**ing moron. \u201d Some say that Fox hurt the series when it rushed the show to air months earlier than its original Spring of 2017 launch date. The network jumped the show into rotation, though, after ABC moved \u201cScandal\u201d to accommodate star Kerry Washington\u2019s pregnancy. Fox thought it could capitalize on audiences looking for a series starring a strong female lead, but audiences didn\u2019t comply with the network\u2019s hopes. Star Kylie Bunbury, who portrayed the titular \u201cPitch\u201d character Ginny Baker, tweeted that her \u201cheart is heavy. \u201d My heart is heavy. \ud83d\udc94 Pitch will not be returning.

The concept was wholly unbelievable, Gwinn said, because \u201cthe fastest pitch ever thrown by a woman was 69 mph, a feat easily reached, and frequently surpassed, by most male high school pitchers. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742561635.367269}
