Love trumps hate. A rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d New Yorker Sarah Klein shared as she boarded a small sail boat, unsure of where she was going, \u201cI have no idea how to sail but I\u2019ll live like Kevin Costner in Waterworld if I have to,\u201d she added. \\nMany people echoed the sentiments of Hillary Clinton\u2019s concession speech in which the Democrat urged everyone to work with Donald Trump and give the man who called Mexicans rapists and murderers and called for a ban on Muslims the benefit of the doubt. \\n\u201cTrump Tower doesn\u2019t look all that structurally sound, we\u2019re talking what? A few sticks of dynamite and the whole thing comes down. Just asking for a friend, obviously,\u201d shared another New Yorker we spoke to. \\nIt is believed the number of people placing their children in pods and launching them into space in the hope they reach a more tranquil planet with a brighter future elsewhere are still in the minority. \\nThe rational and reasoned response was also experienced outside of America where, although people acknowledged the fact they\u2019ve heard every word uttered from the president elect, they suspect everything will be fine. \\n\u201cSure, what difference does it make, be grand I\u2019m sure,\u201d shared Dubliner Rebecca Kelly, fresh from pulling out all of her hair in a panic, and disconnecting her TV, radio and internet for at least four years. \\n\u201cNever felt better,\u201d offered a hooded figure holding a flaming torch in one hand and a rope in the other.'"}, "time": 1742564207.079072}
