I know   seasons are increasingly de rigueur, and lots of European series have even fewer episodes than that, but I still feel a little robbed when season finales come this quickly after season premieres. This is it for \u201cVeep?\u201d We\u2019ve only just begun! This weekend I\u2019ll be watching several   events  \u2014   United States gymnastics championships, swimming and diving trials  \u2014   because I am a total Olympics nut. Televise more, NBC! I\u2019d watch judo. I\u2019d watch preliminary javelin rounds. I\u2019d watch mascot tryouts. If you have any questions you\u2019d like to see answered here (for either me or Watching film writer Monica Castillo) we\u2019d love to hear them: watching@nytimes. com. \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d on Hulu Watch if you like thoughtful, observational comedy and    stories. The show\u2019s creator Josh Thomas stars as a loose version of himself in this extraordinarily lovable Australian comedy about a college student who has just come out. He\u2019s dealing with doofy roommates, a suicidal mother and his own (sweet) awkwardness. If you like \u201cMy Mad Fat Diary,\u201d or if you wish quirky indie movies had more developed stories, try \u201cPlease Like Me. \u201d There\u2019s even a cute dog. Hulu currently has 16   episodes but 26 have aired in Australia. \u201cCenter Stage: On Pointe,\u201d Saturday, 8 p. m. Lifetime. Watch if you like dance movies or Peter Gallagher when he\u2019s angry. When \u201cCenter Stage\u201d came out in 2000, who among us would have guessed it would spawn two     . This one, arriving eight years after \u201cCenter Stage: Turn It Up\u201d aired on Oxygen, follows in its predecessors\u2019   footsteps: It\u2019s heavy on dance and light on convincing dialogue. If you are expecting highbrow greatness, let\u2019s step aside and have a little talk about looking for love in all the wrong places. But if you are in search of several   montages, shot after shot of muscular legs and the kinds of dirty looks you typically only encounter on a   Mexican telenovela, this is your jam. \u201cThe Bureau,\u201d available on iTunes, where the first episode is free. Watch if you like foreign thrillers and slow burns. This French series centers on a spy (Mathieu Kassovitz, \u201cAm\u00e9lie\u201d) who returns home to Paris after six years undercover in Syria. Six years that included a serious love affair with someone he\u2019s not quite ready to say goodbye to. There\u2019s also another agent who has disappeared under strange circumstances, a daughter who\u2019s not sure what to make of her   father and agency   who may or may not be supporting his best interests. My partner and I routinely struggle with what to watch. One of our favorite shows ever was \u201cThe Comeback. \u201d Lisa Kudrow\u2019s   character was nothing short of amazing (and somehow she pulled off being simultaneously funny and sad all at once). Is there any other    show type thing that you\u2019d suggest for us? Or any show with that same awkward sense of humor?  \u2014   Patrick You seek \u201cBoJack Horseman. \u201d And not just because Lisa Kudrow is in Season 2, though there\u2019s also that. The Netflix animated series is about a   \u201890s sitcom star with severe depression and a pathological need to be liked, but from afar like Valerie Cherish, BoJack has this gasping desperation, and it\u2019s not clear how much of that is the fallout from them no longer being famous and how much of it is what made them want to be famous in the first place. The first six episodes of \u201cBoJack\u201d lay the groundwork for what the show grows into, so don\u2019t write it off early. Trust me. In terms of the     there\u2019s a whole Christmas Special that\u2019s an episode of BoJack\u2019s T. G. I. F.  show \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around. \u201d (Watch on Netflix) If you like your comedies with a serious dose of pathos, you might like \u201cGetting On,\u201d about the staff and patients of a hospital\u2019s geriatric wing. It\u2019s less cruel than \u201cThe Comeback,\u201d but just as open with its characters\u2019 frustrations. There\u2019s a British original and an American adaptation, and both are great if you can handle sad humor. (Watch on HBOGo or see the British version on Hulu.) If you like stress humor, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve seen \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm. \u201d So finally, if you like shows that are comfortable with discomfort  \u2014   and don\u2019t mind or maybe even enjoy that internal scream of \u201caaaahhh, no, oh God\u201d  \u2014   try \u201cNathan for You. \u201d The host Nathan Fielder \u201chelps\u201d small businesses by coming up with nutty, often completely absurd marketing schemes, but it\u2019s never totally clear who is on the inside of this inside joke. I\u2019m cringing just thinking about it. (Watch on Hulu.) \u2022 Most soccer fans already know, but the Copa Am\u00e9rica finals will see Argentina facing off against Chile. (8 p. m. Fox Sports 1, Univision, and Univision Deportes) \u2022 The 2013   \u201cDancing on the Edge,\u201d about jazz in 1930s London and starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matthew Goode, makes its way to public broadcasting. (Part 1, 8 p. m. PBS) \u2022 It\u2019s Shark Week. Things kick off with specials about tiger sharks and mako sharks before finally getting to the great whites. (8, 9 and 10 p. m. Discovery Channel) \u2022 \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d all air their season finales. Each show has already been renewed fret not. \u201cVinyl,\u201d on the other hand . .. (9, 10, and 10:30 p. m. HBO) \u2022 \u201cRay Donovan\u201d has its Season 4 premiere. (9 p. m. Showtime) \u2022 Alec Baldwin hosts the latest attempt to revive \u201cThe Match Game. \u201d (10 p. m. ABC) \u2022 \u201cRoadies,\u201d Cameron Crowe\u2019s cloying new show starring Luke Wilson, about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll roadies on tour, premieres. (10 p. m. Showtime) It may be the beginning of summer, but with all of these movies disappearing from HBO and Netflix, I don\u2019t see myself at the beach quite yet. Get around to these titles that have been sitting in your queue before they\u2019re gone late next week.  \u2014   Monica Castillo Netflix (titles expiring July 1) A League of Their Own: Sadly, the Rockford Peaches are ending their season just as the weather is warming up, but this movie is a perennial choice if you\u2019re looking for a   . Geena Davis stars in this fictionalized retelling of the inaugural season of the   Girls Professional Baseball League, with all the heartbreak and good cheer of a classic sports movie. Remember, \u201cthere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d (Watch on Netflix) Best in Show: Focusing his signature mockumentary lens on another wacky realm, the director Christopher Guest (\u201cWaiting for Guffman\u201d) ropes in a large cast of characters for an absurd look at a regional dog show. The dogs prove to be better behaved than their owners, some of who are busy taking their pet to therapy or hiding affairs with their trainer. This is a perfect companion for dog lovers with a sense of humor. Adorable pups  . (Watch on Netflix) The Quiet Man: John Wayne ditches the cowboy hat to go    with a fiery Maureen O\u2019Hara in the Irish countryside. In this 1952 romance, Wayne leaves America for Ireland to reclaim his family home when he falls for the Irish lass next door portrayed by O\u2019Hara. (Watch on Netflix) Also: \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d \u201cBulworth,\u201d \u201cThe Central Park Five\u201d HBO (titles expiring June 30) Malcolm X: Before Ava DuVernay put Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019s story on the big screen with \u201cSelma,\u201d Spike Lee gave King\u2019s contemporary a more sprawling biopic treatment. Denzel Washington would earn an Oscar nomination for his performance as the title character. (Watch on HBO) One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest: If you find yourself feeling a little anarchic and want a movie to match, try this one before it escapes. Jack Nicholson pours all of his manic energy into the character of Randle Patrick McMurphy, a provocateur in a mental institution challenging every authority figure in sight. But he may have met his match in the chilling Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). (Watch on HBO) What We Do in The Shadows: This offbeat mockumentary follows a houseful of vampires as they cope with the modern world. The brainchild of \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d star Jemaine Clement and his frequent collaborator Taika Waititi looks at the lives of the undead with witty, deadpan humor.
