When Jena Jones opened up her absentee ballot, she got more than she expected. Stuffed into the envelope was the actual ballot and several pieces of leftist campaign propaganda, WND reports : \\nJones, will be out of town on Election Day and requested an absentee ballot from the Virginia Department of Elections. She was surprised to what else came with her ballot. \\n\u201cI found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and \u2018help keep Virginia blue\u2019 this year. Then I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot,\u201d Jena explained to WND and Radio America. \\nThe step-by-step letter that Jones is described is called a \u201csample ballot\u201d and it is handed out by campaign workers outside polling places (at a legal distance), telling people how to vote for one particular party or candidate. \\nThere was no material promoting any of the GOP candidates on the ballot or any information on the numerous proposals or propositions. Jones said she is not a registered Democrat and did not request the ballot from the party. \\nAlthough Jones is not a political junkie of any sort, the inclusion of fliers from Democrats but nothing from Republicans struck her as odd. \\n\u201cI was a little confused as to why we didn\u2019t get anything Republican at all, and I wasn\u2019t sure why that was included in my ballot at all,\u201d she said. \\nOn the back of the letter from McAuliffe were lengthy, glowing biographies of Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine and her local congressman, Rep. Gerry Connolly. \\nHer husband, David, was serving as a witness to Jena\u2019s vote. He was even more frustrated by all the pro-Democrat literature while no GOP materials were included. \\n\u201cI also was a little befuddled because I figured that this would be a time that you wouldn\u2019t want to encourage voters to go one way or the other,\u201d David Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like when you walk into the precinct or the polls, they can\u2019t be within a certain amount of feet from the voting booths, and I figure they shouldn\u2019t be able to put a piece of paper in the envelope with your ballot.\u201d \\nDavid was also surprised by the letter from the Governor (Democrat Terry McAuliffe) urging the to \u201ckeep Virginia blue\u201d this year. \\n\u201cIf it was just a letter saying, \u2018Hey we appreciate you voting. Every vote counts,\u2019 that would make sense and I would totally back that. But when there\u2019s a specific flier that says, \u2018Hillary Clinton for President\u2019 and \u2018Tim Kaine for Vice President,\u2019 laying out their platform, to me it was just biased. It was one side.\u201d \\nHere are some images, courtesy WND, of the materials the the Jones\u2019 received in their ballot. Isn\u2019t this against federal law?'"}, "time": 1742563141.571198}
