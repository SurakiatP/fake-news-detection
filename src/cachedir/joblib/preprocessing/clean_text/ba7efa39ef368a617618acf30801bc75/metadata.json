O\u2019Neill was the man in the blue uniform with four gold stars standing, shoulders square, just behind Police Commissioner William J. Bratton in his pressed suits and Herm\u00e8s ties. On Tuesday, Chief O\u2019Neill stepped to the center: Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he would become the next commissioner of the New York Police Department after Mr. Bratton steps down next month. The   uniformed officer in the department, Chief O\u2019Neill, 58, has become an increasingly familiar face on the local news, around the city and at City Hall, ready at news conferences and in private meetings with answers for his boss or the mayor. They often summon him with a familiar call, using just his first name. \u201cI always call him Jimmy,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said while inviting him to the lectern on Tuesday. Chief O\u2019Neill began his career in 1983, in the old Transit Police, and is steeped in the city\u2019s policing culture. Yet as Mr. de Blasio took office vowing to reform many embattled and longstanding police practices, such as stop, question and frisk, Chief O\u2019Neill was also among those eager to embrace change, spearheading the department\u2019s effort at a new incarnation of neighborhood policing. \u201cI know exactly how valuable and how fragile it is at times, this relationship between law enforcement and the community actually is,\u201d he said on Tuesday at the City Hall announcement. \u201cThis is truly a shared effort and shared responsibility. \u201d It was Chief O\u2019Neill who sent a team of officers to Los Angeles to study that city\u2019s community policing program, which influenced the plans the New York Police Department was developing to foster better   relations. He has been at the helm in overseeing security planning for major events, like the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly and the visit last year of Pope Francis. For months, Chief O\u2019Neill\u2019s public profile has been growing as Mr. Bratton appeared to be grooming him to be the face of the department. The two men met in 1990, when Mr. Bratton came to New York from Boston to take over the Transit Police and Mr. O\u2019Neill was a young supervisor running its video unit. Mr. Bratton used the unit to hone his image within the department, producing videos for the rank and file, and producing commercials and public service messages for the public. When Mr. Bratton returned and was reunited with Mr. O\u2019Neill, it was a reunion of mutual benefit. After languishing for nearly a decade as a deputy chief under Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner at the time, Chief O\u2019Neill was promoted twice in short order by Mr. Bratton, first to chief of patrol and then to chief of department. It was a remarkable career turn for Chief O\u2019Neill, who had been pushed out of his post as the commander of the department\u2019s narcotics operations after an internal sting operation found officers paying informants with drugs. Chief O\u2019Neill was one of several commanders transferred amid the scandal, which led prosecutors to dismiss many cases involving the officers implicated. The last two years have been quite different. Commissioner Bratton and Chief O\u2019Neill have enjoyed a warm relationship, with Mr. Bratton occasionally teasing Chief O\u2019Neill at news conferences. Those lighter moments  \u2014   including on Tuesday when Mr. Bratton ribbed Chief O\u2019Neill about his baldness  \u2014   elicit the friendlier side of a chief who can seem, with his starched uniform and military bearing, to be distant and cool. Some elected officials have said that they worked well with Chief O\u2019Neill as chief of department. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, an advocate of criminal justice reform, described the chief as \u201cvery qualified, personable and  . \u201d \u201cChief O\u2019Neill is a good man, who has always had an   relationship with leaders of diverse backgrounds throughout the city,\u201d Mr. Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, said on Tuesday. Late last month, when Mr. Bratton said in an interview with The New York Times that he would be leaving the department before the start of a potential second term for Mr. de Blasio, he talked openly about his admiration for Chief O\u2019Neill and suggested that the chief would be a worthy successor. On Tuesday, the mayor made that a reality. In an earlier interview, Chief O\u2019Neill also said he admired Mr. Bratton\u2019s touch  \u2014   making officers feel that they are being listened to and trusted. \u201cObviously, he wants cops to do a great job. But he also wants them to feel good about themselves and to have that sense of fulfillment,\u201d Chief O\u2019Neill said of Mr. Bratton in January. \u201cThat is different from the prior administration. \u201d As the news came out on Tuesday morning, a group of uniformed officers from various Bronx precincts who had assembled at an outdoor   session greeted the shift with enthusiasm. \u201cHe rose through the ranks, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Officer Dan Conti, of the 47th Precinct, said as he stood with colleagues near the Grand Concourse. Others nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty good boss,\u201d Officer Conti added. Chief O\u2019Neill\u2019s ascension is unusual. Thomas Repetto, author of a history of the department, said a chief of department had not been promoted to commissioner in more than four decades. Rather, mayors have typically reached further down in the leadership, or more often outside the department, for new commissioners. Before moving into senior posts, Chief O\u2019Neill served as a commander of three precincts: the 25th in East Harlem, the 44th in the Bronx and Central Park. He knows what it is like to face high crime and thousands of homicides a year. But now, with crime boiled down to much lower levels, he has embraced the shifts the administration has wrought: focusing on people, places and conditions that drive crime. \u201cFighting crime is what we get paid to do,\u201d Chief O\u2019Neill said in January. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do that unless we have the backing of the community. Unless we have that connectivity, it\u2019s not going to work. \u201d As he spoke on Tuesday in City Hall\u2019s Blue Room, Chief O\u2019Neill, who is separated and has two sons in their 20s, faced his mother, who sat in the front row. He choked up, recalling the advice she gave while he was growing up, one of seven siblings in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. \u201cTo be a sound and moral man,\u201d his mother, Helen O\u2019Neill, told reporters afterward. \u201cAnd to always do the right thing, and he has. \u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said she was in awe of her son, who likes Irish soda bread,   motorcycle rides and discussing with her the books he has read. \u201cHe\u2019s more than what you see,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742562135.7446454}
