The post on the Facebook page for the Medford Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association caused controversy and backlash online over the content and what the was seen being done to crooked Hillary. The post showed Medford Police officers at the Fall Festival in Haines Square on Saturday. The photo was done in fun and captioned, \u201cLook who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today\u2026\u201d This image is an accurate depiction of what we all would like to see: Hillary in handcuffs. As you can plainly see, the photos show police officers with a woman in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed. It appears that they are arresting someone, who wore a mask in the likeness of Hillary Clinton. Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman\u2019s Facebook page \\nIn a second photo, the police officers posed with a person in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, \u201cMaking America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!\u201d Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman\u2019s Facebook page \\nSince a fair amount of overly sensitive pansies made a big deal about the posts, Harry MacGilvray, president of the Medford Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, decided to apologize for making the post. \\n\u201cThese were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way,\u201d MacGilvray said in a statement. \u201cI never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.\u201d \\nThe posts have been removed to avoid hurting the feelings of overly-sensitive liberals. While most of us see the humor in these images and understand how insane it was to apologize for the posts that were clearly done in jest, liberals don\u2019t see things this way. \\nThey go out of their way, looking to be offended. If the police posed with a handcuffed Trump, it\u2019s pretty obvious that there would have been no outrage, because conservatives aren\u2019t easily offended by free speech. However, a liberals sole purpose seems to be finding things to be offended over, and they have done it again.'"}, "time": 1742561739.9104936}
