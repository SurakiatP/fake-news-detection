Comey, put himself enthusiastically forward as the arbiter of not only whether to prosecute a criminal case \u2014 which is not the job of the FBI \u2014 but also best practices in the handling of email and other matters. Now, he has chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness , departing from the department\u2019s traditions. \\nFrom the second piece by notorious mud-slinger Dana Milbank: \\nI\u2019ve long believed in Comey\u2019s integrity. But if he doesn\u2019t step forward and explain his October Surprise, he may inadvertently wind up interfering in the political process \u2014 perhaps even reversing the outcome of a presidential election \u2014 in a way that would have made J. Edgar Hoover gape. \\nAnd the third strike : \\nFBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s stunning announcement that he has directed investigators to begin reviewing new evidence in the Clinton email investigation was yet another troubling violation of long-standing Justice Department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nation\u2019s chief investigative official . \\nBack to the July 7 editorial: \\n\u201cIt appears damage is being done to the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. He\u2019s right, but the FBI director isn\u2019t doing the damage. The wreckers are those who cast baseless aspersions on U.S. law enforcement in the service of their partisan goals . \\nI for one believe that Comey was wrong in July and is right today. He should have pressed for charges against Clinton early on. Using a \u201csecret\u201d private email server for confidential state business is not legal and would have been out of bounds for anyone else. Now possible new evidence was found and must be investigated. It is not Comey\u2019s job to ask if the timing of a renewed investigation is convenient for the potential culprit. He also had to inform Congress because he had reasonably promised to do so. (He also needed to save his ass before anyone else in his department talked to the media.) \\nThe so called \u201celection\u201d of a U.S. president is always a sorry show. But this season\u2019s version has at least some amusing moments. Seeing the hypocrites at Fred Hyatt\u2019s Funny Pages\u2122 squirm is one of them. It makes me smirk.'"}, "time": 1742562242.6240427}
