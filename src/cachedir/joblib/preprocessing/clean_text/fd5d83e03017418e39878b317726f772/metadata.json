But the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer  \u2014   or even taking down the decorations  \u2014   can be overwhelming. So to help motivate you, several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets, beat back the toys taking over the living room and, yes, finally deal with that junk drawer. START WITH THE HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS To keep plastic ornaments and Hanukkah candles organized, use small containers you already have on hand, like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons. Wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper, or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the Container Store. For strings of lights and garlands, use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use (tree lights, porch lights, balcony, bushes, etc. ). Zip ties can also be used on wreaths, so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner. To avoid a stockpile of holiday cards, \u201csave only those that are meaningful and special,\u201d Tova Weinstock, a professional organizer in Brooklyn, said. \u201cFor the others, appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash. \u201d EDIT YOUR CLOSET Eliminating clothes you never wear is easier said than done. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in \u2018If you haven\u2019t used or worn something in a year, get rid of it,\u2019\u201d said Laura Cattano, another organizer in Brooklyn. \u201cHow you want to live moving forward is a much better guide for editing than whether or not you actually have used something in the past. \u201d Focus on the image you would like to project, she said, then start at one end of the closet and review each piece, pulling out those you know you can toss, donate or sell. Try on anything you haven\u2019t worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently. Clothes you have forgotten about could be \u201cyour new favorite thing,\u201d she said, while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired. (If you subscribe to the Marie Kondo method of decluttering, ask yourself, \u201cDoes it \u2018spark joy? \u2019\u201d) Sort clothes by type, grouping pants together, then shirts or blouses, jackets or dresses. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, you won\u2019t wear it,\u201d said Sharon Lowenheim, an organizer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the founder of the Organizing Goddess. \u201cSo remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger. \u201d Arranging shirts by sleeve length, with the shortest at the front, makes them easier to find, said Ms. Lowenheim, who also subscribes to a rotation method: selecting garments to wear from the front of each section, then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned. \u201cIf you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front, that is a signal to you that you just don\u2019t like that item,\u201d she said. \u201cGet rid of it. \u201d Another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store   clothes out of sight, said Faith Roberson, an organizer in Manhattan and the founder of Organize With Faith. When clothes have been put away for half the year and you\u2019ve done fine without them, \u201cit changes your perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can honestly ask yourself, \u2018Do I actually love this piece? And if I don\u2019t, why am I holding onto it? \u2019\u201d TACKLE THE TOYS Organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate. \u201cFinding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child,\u201d said Ms. Lowenheim, whose    daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday, starting when she was a toddler. Before that, Ms. Lowenheim said, she would sneak into her daughter\u2019s room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with. \u201cWhen she was around 3, she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it,\u201d Ms. Lowenheim said. \u201cAt that point, I realized that I had to involve her in the process. \u201d If they cooperate, be sure to respect their decision, Ms. Roberson said, even if they choose something you wouldn\u2019t have. \u201cParents think about the money they\u2019ve spent,\u201d she said, or the sentimental value, which can make them reluctant to let go of that American Girl doll or the train set from Aunt Joan. Another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with, either online or at a garage sale, and keep the proceeds for themselves. Once the toys have been pared down, Ms. Roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage. \u201cThey are stackable, they have dividers, are easy to clean, easy to label, and they come in four different sizes,\u201d she said. To help maintain order, \u201clabel where each toy goes,\u201d said Ms. Lowenheim, who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints, jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf. If your child is too young to read, label the containers with stickers or pictures. If everything has \u201ca home\u201d to return to at the end of the day, she said, cleanup will be easier. AND THAT JUNK DRAWER . .. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece,\u201d Ms. Roberson said. Dump everything onto the floor or countertop, divide it into piles and then ask yourself: Do I want it? Does it work? Does it need to be in the junk drawer? If not, where else could it go? \u201cTake it easy, and go pile by pile,\u201d she said. Put things where they belong (like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag) and discard things you don\u2019t need, like old keys and expired batteries and coupons. To ward off atrophy, buy a drawer organizer, suggested Ms. Lowenheim, who uses expandable drawer organizers from Staples in her own home. \u201cThe key thing is to measure the drawer, then find the organizer that best fits the space,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s too small, it won\u2019t help. \u201d The reward? \u201cKeeping everything sorted by type,\u201d she said, \u201cwill make it easier for you to find something when you need it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562074.8248649}
