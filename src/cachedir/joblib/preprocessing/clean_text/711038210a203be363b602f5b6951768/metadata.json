The woman, Anna Sofia Botha, 74, said she kept getting turned away, even though her credentials were impeccable. With her white helmet hair and kindly air, event officials apparently did not believe that she was a coach of a   holder in one of track\u2019s glamour events. \u201cWe really tried really hard to get on the track,\u201d she said. By Monday afternoon, Botha had the keys to the city  \u2014   or at least to the Olympic Village  \u2014   once word had spread that a most unlikely coach had helped propel van Niekerk to gold. Standing in the plaza, surrounded by reporters while van Niekerk conducted interviews a few yards away, she seemed perplexed that people were suddenly seeking her out for interviews. \u201cThe whole coaching scenario is an everyday way of life for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new, nothing out of the ordinary. \u201d Botha\u2019s profile was measurably lower on Sunday night. Describing her attempts to see van Niekerk after his race, she said, \u201cAt every entrance there was security and they just wouldn\u2019t let me go through. \u201d Finally, Botha said, members of Team South Africa interceded. With their help, she was able to see van Niekerk, whom she has coached for four years, over an hour after he had broken the American Michael Johnson\u2019s 1999 world record of 43. 18 with a 43. 03 clocking. Tears were shed, she said. \u201cWe just hugged each other,\u201d Botha said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary to say anything. We knew in our hearts and in our minds what we thought and what we had achieved. \u201d Before the night was over, another of Bloemfontein\u2019s athletes, Akani Simbine, had finished fifth in the 100 meters. A day later, Botha said, \u201cI\u2019m still struggling to let it sink in. It\u2019s so unreal and unbelievable. \u201d This is Botha\u2019s first Olympics. She competed  \u2014   without distinction, she said  \u2014   in the sprints and the long jump when she was young and began coaching in 1968 while living in her native Namibia, then a territory under the rule of South Africa. Her first athletes were her son and daughter, but when they reached a certain level, she passed them off to other coaches, she said, \u201cbecause I feel that\u2019s not always a good thing as a parent to coach your own children. \u201d The woman who didn\u2019t believe it prudent to coach her own children has earned the trust of her athletes by treating them as family. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t see us as athletes or as people she sees us as her children,\u201d said van Niekerk, who asked Botha in late 2012 if he could train under her at the University of the Free State, where she has been the head track and field coach since 1990. The previous year, an    van Niekerk had won the 200 meters at the South African Athletics Championships with a personal best of 20. 57 seconds. \u201cI was very excited but also humbled and also a little worried,\u201d Botha said, \u201cbecause I knew this is   athlete and there will be a really big responsibility on me to coach him and to bring him along. \u201d Van Niekerk\u2019s favorite event is the 200 meters, but the explosiveness required in the long sprints was hard on his body. He was often injured, and so Botha encouraged him to switch his focus to the 400 meters, reasoning that he could still take advantage of his sprinting abilities but with less wear and tear on his body. In 2015, van Niekerk won the world championship title in the 400, validating Botha\u2019s hunch. \u201cWhen I tell him you have to do this and this and this, he never complains, never,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes he really suffers, then he tells me, \u2018I know what our dreams and goals are and I will do what you tell me to do. \u2019\u201d Her athletes describe her as a benevolent disciplinarian. \u201cWhen I first met her I was scared of her,\u201d Simbine said. When his words were relayed to her, Botha broke out in a laugh so infectious it could draw a solitary aardvark out of its burrow. \u201cI\u2019m really strict in my coaching,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect the moment that we start with training I want the focus and the dedication on the training. \u201d Van Niekerk, 24, described Botha as \u201can amazing woman. \u201d He expressed gratitude for the discipline she has instilled in him. He offered an example that could have been uttered by a Giants football player during the Tom Coughlin regime. \u201cShe\u2019s got a thing where if we\u2019re five minutes early we\u2019re late,\u201d van Niekerk said. Botha appeared for her interview several minutes before the arranged time. She took it in stride when a male reporter asked her if she is always, or only sometimes, coaching van Niekerk. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to be there every day with Wayde or any of my other athletes to see every day if there is a problem,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI have to read my athlete. I have to read his mind and read his body and listen to what his body tells me. I think I have the ability to know my athlete inside out. \u201d She took it in stride when another male reporter asked her if she knew what van Niekerk\u2019s splits were in his   race. It was like asking a carpenter if he knew the measurements for the table he had just carved out of pine wood. \u201cAt 300 meters,\u201d she said, \u201che was faster than what we had planned for. \u201d Van Niekerk won the race from Lane 8, considered a disadvantageous position. Botha said it didn\u2019t bother her that he was in an outside lane. \u201cBecause every lane is the same distance,\u201d she said. What did she say to van Niekerk before the race? \u201cWe didn\u2019t really talk,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe more empty the mind is the more focused he is on what he has to do. \u201d Botha said she has other talented athletes in her training group. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI have two girls and another boy. \u201d She will turn 75 later this year, but has no plans to slow down. \u201cI still love coaching and I still love my athletes,\u201d Botha said, \u201cso I can\u2019t see a reason why I would go and sit down and play with my fingers. That\u2019s not in my nature. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562713.209332}
