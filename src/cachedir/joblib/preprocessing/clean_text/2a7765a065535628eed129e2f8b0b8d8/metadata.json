Donna Brazile thinks Democrats can turn THIS state blue (hint: no way in Hell) Posted at 11:01 am on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. \\nAs we near the election (only 11 days now, thank God) Donna Brazile must be feeling a tad cocky because she was blathering on about turning a specific and very red state, blue. \\nWe laughed a LOT before actually writing this piece, especially when we read this tweet: One of the things I've wanted to do as party chair is invest in states across the country. We're ready to turn Utah blue. #ForwardTogether \\n\u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 27, 2016 \\nHA. Utah. One of the reddest most conservative states in the UNION. The state hasn\u2019t supported a Democrat in over 50 years (the last time the state went for the Democrat was 1964) and yet Donna thinks the Democrats can turn it blue. \\nWitch please. @donnabrazile I'll take how DonnaBrazile cheats for her candidate besides stealing questions for them for $500. Alex \\n\u2014 Lalapuj (@lalapuj) October 28, 2016 \\nClearly she\u2019ll do ANYTHING to move that ol\u2019 gray mare forward. Yup. @donnabrazile Nah, it's property of the #mormonmafia now. You'll have to speak to @Evan_McMullin now if you want to operate in his state. \\n\u2014 Hugh Jabdomin (@kransom2) October 27, 2016 @donnabrazile @KenGWalter1 Not happening. #Utah is going for @Evan_McMullin this year. If Dems were thinking strategically, they'd help him. \""}, "time": 1742562792.4161139}
