Hart, the board\u2019s chairman, said, referring to the crash site. Mr. Hart, addressing reporters in Chattanooga, said investigators had not determined whether the driver had previously strayed from his assigned route. The Police Department also said on Wednesday that the death toll in the crash had risen to six children. The Police Department\u2019s announcement on Twitter came hours after the chief executive of Durham School Services, the busing contractor for the school district in Hamilton County, Tenn. offered an emotional apology for the crash, which has prompted rigorous scrutiny of a company that transports more than a million schoolchildren in the United States each day. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom the anguish of the parents whose children were involved in this horrific accident and that involved one of my company\u2019s buses,\u201d the executive, David A. Duke, said in a video that Durham published on YouTube. \u201cNothing that I can say can take away the pain and the grief for these families. What I can say is I\u2019m deeply sorry for the children that were taken from their families with so much life before them. \u201d Until Wednesday, Durham had issued only a terse written statement, and the video did not answer the mounting questions about the company\u2019s safety record or hiring practices. Federal statistics, which were published last month, showed that Durham\u2019s drivers had been involved in 142 injury crashes in 24 months, but the government\u2019s figures did not say whether the company\u2019s employees had been at fault in the wrecks. Mr. Duke, whose company is headquartered near Chicago, said Durham would \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s inquiry into the accident in Chattanooga, a city of about 177, 000 people. The Chattanooga police are conducting a separate criminal investigation, and the bus driver, Johnthony K. Walker, has already been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, as well as reckless driving and reckless endangerment. The police said Wednesday evening that they intended to file an additional count of vehicular homicide. Mr. Walker, whom some parents said they had complained about in the months before the wreck, had \u201cno trace\u201d of alcohol or drugs in his system at the time of the crash, Sgt. Austin Garrett of the Chattanooga police said at a news conference on Wednesday. Sergeant Garrett, whose department did not identify the child who died on Wednesday, said that local investigators had begun reviewing video footage from the bus\u2019s cameras. But he said that officials had not interviewed any of the children who were aboard Bus No. 366 when it crashed along Talley Road not long after leaving Woodmore Elementary School carrying 37 students. In an arrest affidavit that was released on Tuesday, a police officer said that Mr. Walker, 24, had been driving \u201cat a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 m. p. h. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628546.5334973}
