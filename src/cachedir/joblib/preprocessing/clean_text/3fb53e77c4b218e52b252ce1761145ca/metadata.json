Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestinians, raised the specter of \u201capartheid\u201d and called for \u201cconcrete measures in order to save the   solution. \u201d A White House official, in remarks to reporters on the eve of President Trump\u2019s meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday, said the Trump administration would not push the   solution, an apparent retreat from decades of American policy. In his news conference with Mr. Netanyahu in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Trump directly broke with diplomatic tradition on the issue by saying his concern was the \u201cdeal,\u201d not whether that included a state for Palestinians. \u201cI\u2019m looking at two states and one state,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI like the one that both parties like. I can live with either one. \u201d Some Palestinians and Middle East experts reacted with alarm, saying that such a policy change would undercut the chances, already slim, of progress toward reconciliation between the two sides. \u201cThis is going to give Israel a free hand to do what it wants,\u201d said Mosheer A. Amer, an associate professor at the Islamic University here in Gaza City. \u201cAt least Obama had some control over Netanyahu. \u201d Israel captured and occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem 50 years ago, in 1967, and the status of the former Jordanian territories has been a source of conflict ever since. (So has the Gaza Strip, which had formerly been administered by Egypt.) Many Palestinian leaders, especially those in the West Bank, hold strongly that a   solution is the only acceptable resolution of the conflict. There is also considerable diplomatic weight behind the goal of having two viable states living in peace side by side. In December, with the Obama administration\u2019s tacit support, the United Nations condemned Israeli settlements on occupied land as obstacles to the   solution. But lately the chances of achieving it have been dimming. Many Israelis and Palestinians have begun to doubt whether it is possible or even desirable. Many Israelis argue that the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are too divided among themselves to ever be able to permanently accept two states. Some in the Israeli right advocate annexing all or part of the West Bank, and some rightists warned Mr. Netanyahu not to raise the possibility of two states in his meeting with Mr. Trump. At the same time, many Palestinians say the line has already been crossed  \u2014   that Israeli settlements have already eliminated the possibility of creating a contiguous Palestinian state. Instead, they advocate a single state encompassing both Israel and the occupied territories  \u2014   a secular state where Palestinians and Israelis would live together with equal rights. At a news conference on Wednesday in the West Bank, Mr. Erekat said the only alternative to what he called Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s \u201capartheid\u201d vision was \u201cone single secular and democratic state with equal rights for everyone, Christians, Muslims and Jews, on all of historic Palestine. \u201d That is opposed by many Israelis, who want Israel to remain a Jewish state. Some Israelis say that the deep divisions between the Palestinian factions that control the West Bank and Gaza are another reason that it will be impossible to reach an agreement on two states. The Fatah faction in the West Bank has tried to cooperate with the Israeli authorities on some levels, while Hamas, the group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, is more actively hostile to Israel. Hazim Kassim, a spokesman for Hamas, said on Wednesday, \u201cWhat Trump said is new, but whatever he says, we in Hamas still believe that resistance is the only way to liberate our lands from the Israeli occupation. \u201cIt is now clear that the U. S. has provided a cover for aggression, occupation and the confiscation of Palestinian land,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe U. S. is never serious when it comes to Palestinians\u2019 human rights. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561811.3125517}
