[\u201cI guess one of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s sons is expecting a new baby,\u201d Handler tweeted. \u201cJust what we need. Another person with those jeans. Let\u2019s hope for a girl. \u201d  I guess one of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s sons is expecting a new baby. Just what we need. Another person with those jeans. Let\u2019s hope for a girl.  \u2014   Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 20, 2017,  Handler had apparently attempted to use the word \u201cgenes. \u201d Donald Trump Jr. replied to Handler\u2019s post to correct the mistake, writing: \u201cJeans? ?? I guess I\u2019m not at all surprised  \u2026     but really? !?! #genes\u201d Jeans? ?? I guess I\u2019m not at all surprised  \u2026     but really? !?! #genes https:  .   \u2014   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 20, 2017,  A short time later, Eric Trump  \u2014   who announced earlier Monday that he and wife Lara are expecting a boy in September  \u2014   also replied to correct the tweet and remind Handler he is expecting a son. Somewhat ironically, Handler mocked Melania Trump\u2019s English skills in a recent interview at Sundance, during which she said she would never interview the First Lady on her Netflix talk show. \u201cNo. Melania? To talk about what? She can barely speak English,\u201d she told Variety in January. The First Lady, who was born in Slovenia, reportedly speaks five languages. Handler apologized for the spelling error in a   tweet Monday evening, saying she was a \u201clittle stoned. \u201d Sorry about spelling mistake. I meant \u201dgenes,\u201d not \u201djeans.\u201d I\u2019m a little stoned. What\u2019s your excuse?  \u2014   Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 20, 2017,  The    Chelsea star  \u2014   who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race  \u2014   has been a vocal critic of Trump since well before the November election. In April, the comedian posed   with the phrase, \u201cTrump is a butt hole\u201d scrawled across her back. \u201cIt\u2019s always a good thing to be able to look at somebody and be like, \u2018That\u2019s the worst thing that could happen,\u2019\u201d she told Variety in September. \u201cAnd I think we should keep him in the spotlight. Not as president, obviously, but, you know, as The Apprentice or whatever that show is called. \u201d In January, Handler led the Women\u2019s March on Main in Park City, Utah, a sister march of the larger   Women\u2019s March on Washington that occurred simultaneously in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWomen are under a   political assault, and I intend to fight back with all my might against a Republican president, a Republican Congress, and the radical, religious right who are drooling to defund Planned Parenthood health services nationwide,\u201d she wrote in a guest column for the Hollywood Reporter at the time.
