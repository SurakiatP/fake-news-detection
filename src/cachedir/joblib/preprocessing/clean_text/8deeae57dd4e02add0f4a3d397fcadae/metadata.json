Welcome Celebration\u201d on January 19 in Washington, D. C.[\u201cI was a participant in the civil rights movement and have seen many positive changes and advancement in my 81 years of living in this wonderful country, but I know we must all join hands and work together with our new President,\u201d the Grammy   singer said in a press release. \u201cI honestly believe that if we can accomplish this, the best is yet to come. \u201d  Moore stressed the importance of all Americans rallying behind Trump. \u201cWe all as Americans need to unite behind our new President and give him a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs everyone\u2019s support to make America greater, stronger and an even better country. \u201d Moore joins a   list of inaugural performers, including The Beach Boys, country music stars Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith, and rock band Three Doors Down. Broadway singer Jennifer Holliday and renowned opera singer Andrea Bocelli backed out of singing at inauguration events after facing fierce backlash. Moore said he won\u2019t be bullied by protesters because performing at Trump\u2019s inauguration is the \u201cright thing to do. \u201d \u201cI am not going to let them, the left side, intimidate me from doing what I feel is the right thing to do for the country and that [presidential] seal,\u201d Moore said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cGive the man a shot. He hasn\u2019t even said \u2018I do\u2019 yet. Give him a chance. If you don\u2019t like him after four years, then don\u2019t vote for him next time. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742561661.1197288}
