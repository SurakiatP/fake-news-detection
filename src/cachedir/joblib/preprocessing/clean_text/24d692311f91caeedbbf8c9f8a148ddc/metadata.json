S. for the \u201cunethical\u201d Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements. [Pellegrino was visiting Israel for the first time last week with a group of fellow actors and other professionals from the entertainment industry. The trip, organized by Israel\u2019s Ministry for Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy and America\u2019s Voices in Israel, coincided with Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s controversial address on the   conflict.  The actor, who is best known for playing Lucifer in the Warner Bros. series, lambasted Kerry for condemning Israel in his speech. \u201c[Kerry] was on the wrong side of every historical event and this was no different,\u201d he said in an interview. He further slammed the United States for abstaining from the vote on Resolution 2334, which calls Israeli settlements a \u201cflagrant violation of international law. \u201d \u201cLeave it to the UN to do the absolute wrong thing and save it for posterity\u2019s sake in the form of the resolution,\u201d Pellegrino said. Pellegrino, who was joined by TV stars Meagan Good from Deception and The Walking Dead\u2018s Sonequa   among others, made the decision to come on the trip out of a sense of \u201cobligation to support democracies. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always been a huge supporter of the only democracy in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way things are turning out all around the world, we have an obligation to support democracies. \u201d While Israel continues to be \u201cunder attack from the rest of world,\u201d for Pellegrino as a secular person, the Jewish state is an island of hope in the region for allowing \u201cfull freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and for promoting human prosperity. \u201d Pellegrino said that one of the highlights of his trip was visiting the Western Wall  \u2014   Judaism\u2019s holiest site  \u2014   defined in the resolution as \u201coccupied Palestinian territory. \u201d Despite identifying himself as an atheist, Pellegrino conceded that being at the Western Wall made him \u201copen to the suggestion because of its unique power that prayer goes straight to God. \u201d Pellegrino was also drawn to the rich archaeology of the area, which \u201cprove[s] Israeli existence there for many thousands of years. \u201d But the most profound moment, unexpectedly, was visiting a hospital. The Rambam Healthcare Campus, which has Arab doctors and Jewish doctors working side by side treating Arab and Jewish patients alike  \u2014   and even Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza  \u2014   opened Pellegrino\u2019s eyes to the \u201cwide diversity in Israel. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s symptomatic of a free country, of a culture that respects everybody\u2019s mind and values. Far more so than Arab countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hospital was an entire community devoted to medical sciences, to using science to increase prosperity. It is literally changing the world,\u201d he added. According to Pellegrino, Hollywood has a myopic,   view of the   conflict. \u201cIn my opinion, Hollywood doesn\u2019t know the context. Hollywood sees a David and Goliath story with Israel being cast in the role of Goliath, as the evil aggressor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Palestinians are simply innocent reactors to whatever Israelis are throwing at them. And everything  \u2014   like their economic situation  \u2014   excuses the savagery. \u201d \u201cThose people in the Hollywood community would be served by coming here,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742561901.2300308}
