However, a key US ally isn\u2019t happy about it. \\n\"Turkey doesn\u2019t want to see us operating with the SDF anywhere, particularly in Raqqa. We\u2019re having talks with Turkey and we\u2019re going to take this in steps,\" Townsend told reporters . \"The only force that is capable on any near-term timeline are the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion. We\u2019re going to take the force that we have and we will go to Raqqa soon with that force.\" \\nTownsend underlined the importance of liberating Raqqa, saying US officials believe the city is where the terrorist group plans most of its international attacks. \\n\"We think it\u2019s very important to get isolation in place around Raqqa to start controlling that environment on a pretty short timeline.\" \u00a9 REUTERS/ Nour Fourat US-Led Coalition to \\'Move Soon to Isolate Raqqa\\' \\nAs the eastern flank of the NATO alliance, Turkey is a vital ally to the United States and its Western partners. Tensions have been high through the administration of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Under Erdogan, Ankara has launched a crackdown on Kurdish communities in the country\u2019s southeast. \\nIn what may have been an effort to appease Turkish leadership, US officials stressed that, while the YPG will play a role in the offensive, it will not be directly involved in taking Raqqa. Townsend added that the US will also play a smaller role in the Raqqa operation than it has in Mosul. \"We\u2019ll have fewer coalition troops there, less combat capability there, we\u2019ll have to apply coalition combat support in a different way than we are doing here in Iraq,\" he said. \\nExpected to coincide with the Mosul operation, the Raqqa offensive is expected to begin soon. \\n\"I think it will be within weeks, that\u2019s what I want to say, and not many weeks,\" US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters on Tuesday. ...'"}, "time": 1742628542.308726}
