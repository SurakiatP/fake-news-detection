Trump\u2019s supporters fit into a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d saying it showed she was out of touch with an economically   electorate. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments Friday night, which were a variation of a sentiment she has expressed in other settings recently, came at a   in Manhattan. \u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?\u201d she said to applause and laughter. \u201cThe racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic  \u2014   you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. \u201d By Saturday morning, #BasketofDeplorables was trending on Twitter as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign demanded an apology. His supporters hoped to use the remark as evidence that Mrs. Clinton cannot connect to the voters she hopes to represent as president. \u201cWow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the polls!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Speaking at the Values Voter Summit, a gathering of Christian conservatives in Washington on Saturday, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, said: \u201cHillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans and they deserve your respect. \u201d By Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton had acknowledged her stumble. \u201cLast night I was \u2018grossly generalistic,\u2019 and that\u2019s never a good idea,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI regret saying \u2018half\u2019  \u2014   that was wrong. \u201d She then used the opportunity to double down on her criticism of her opponent. \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia,\u201d she said, \u201cand given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks flipped, for a day at least, the familiar script of the 2016 campaign, in which Mr. Trump slights a large group of people and she quickly rebukes him. They were also out of character given her usual studied care in choosing words. Her campaign slogan is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d and she has built her message around inclusiveness, in contrast to denigrating comments Mr. Trump has made about Mexicans, Muslims, women and other groups. Much of her ad campaign is built around using Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to portray him as an unsuitable leader. But for all the policies she says would lift   wages and alleviate income inequality, Mrs. Clinton has struggled with the perception by many voters that she is not on their side. Asked whether they thought Mrs. Clinton understands the needs and problems of people like themselves, 53 percent of registered voters said she did not, according to a CBS News poll from June. The Democratic National Convention in July and a bus tour in Pennsylvania and Ohio   on   issues seemed to help Mrs. Clinton. In an August ABC   Post poll, 55 percent of Americans said Mrs. Clinton understood the problems of people like them better than Mr. Trump, compared with 35 percent who named him. But Mrs. Clinton devoted much of August to   in the moneyed enclaves of the Hamptons and Martha\u2019s Vineyard. At some of these events, which were closed to the press, she uses the \u201cbaskets\u201d characterization of Trump voters. After barring the press from most   the Clinton campaign has tried to be more open in the   Day sprint. Aides allowed a small group of reporters in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s regular press corps to cover the Friday event, which took place at Cipriani on Wall Street and for a contribution of $1, 200 to $10, 000 included performances by Barbra Streisand and Rufus Wainwright. A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, said what made Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments particularly   was that she made them \u201cin front of wealthy donors\u201d and that the setting and statement, \u201crevealed just how little she thinks of the   men and women of America. \u201d Mrs. Clinton made a similar remark on Israeli television on Thursday, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a kind of paranoiac, prejudicial element within our politic. \u201d But she did not specify how many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters fit into that category. It was the characterization of \u201chalf of Trump\u2019s supporters\u201d on Friday that struck some Republicans as similar to the damning \u201c47 percent\u201d remark made by their own nominee, Mitt Romney, in his 2012 campaign against President Obama. At a private   Mr. Romney, who Democrats had already sought to portray as a cold corporate titan, said 47 percent of voters were \u201cdependent upon government, who believe that they are victims\u201d and who \u201cpay no income tax. \u201d \u201cRomney\u2019s 47% comment was bad. Hillary calling tens of millions of American men  women \u2018deplorable\u2019 is inexcusable and disqualifying,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, an adviser to Mr. Trump and the daughter of Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, wrote on Twitter. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark, which she delivered lightheartedly, also harked back to Mr. Obama\u2019s gaffe at a San Francisco   in 2008 that economically struggling Americans \u201cget bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy towards people who aren\u2019t like them. \u201d That time, it was Mrs. Clinton who seized on her opponent\u2019s comment to paint him as elitist as the two Democrats battled before the Pennsylvania primary, which she went on to win by nine percentage points. Her remarks on Friday were a more pointed version of her earlier criticisms of the movement her opponent has spurred. Last month in a speech in Reno, Nev. Mrs. Clinton devoted an address to criticizing Mr. Trump for \u201ctaking hate groups mainstream\u201d and \u201chelping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. \u201d \u201cShe gave an entire speech about how the   is using his campaign to advance its hate movement,\u201d Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, wrote on Twitter, using a loosely defined term that is often used to describe white nationalist and   sentiment. Other aides and supporters jumped to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defense, noting that after describing the \u201cdeplorables,\u201d Mrs. Clinton went on to sympathetically weave another rhetorical basket of Trump voters: \u201cPeople who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures. And they\u2019re just desperate for change. \u201d \u201cThose are the people,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have to understand and empathize with. \u201d In talking points given to surrogates on Saturday, and obtained by The New York Times, the campaign advised anyone speaking about the \u201cdeplorable\u201d issue in the news media to reiterate that while Mrs. Clinton intended to say \u201csome\u201d instead of \u201chalf,\u201d Mr. Trump, as she had pointed out in the past, \u201chas clearly brought the  \u2019s hate into his campaign and into the mainstream. \u201d The talking points advised that anyone who is pressed on the \u201cdeplorable\u201d remarks should assert that the news media was holding Mrs. Clinton to a different standard than Mr. Trump, with this suggested rejoinder: \u201cAre they going to make more out of this story than they made out of the racist, misogynistic Trump comments that got us here in the first place?\u201d Prof. Jennifer Mercieca, an expert in American political discourse at Texas AM University, said in an email that the \u201cdeplorable\u201d comment \u201csounds bad on the face of it\u201d and compared it to Mr. Romney\u2019s 47 percent gaffe. \u201cThe comment demonstrates that she (like Romney) lacks empathy for that group,\u201d Professor Mercieca said. \u201cTo be fair, she has characterized the group as homophobic, xenophobic, racist, and etc. and those qualities are not ones that we celebrate in America. \u201d It sounded, Professor Mercieca said, as if Mrs. Clinton had written off a large chunk of Trump voters as ones who would never vote for her, a view that might be accurate. \u201cIt likely won\u2019t help her \u2018likability\u2019 with undecideds, but it may help her to mobilize Clinton supporters to more actively participate in her campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that was the goal. \u201d An excerpt from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks Friday night:'"}, "time": 1742563572.6211245}
