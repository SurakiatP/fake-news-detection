Two of them were from companies that have boasted the Trump name. One was Trump University, the real estate sales seminar that Donald J. Trump promoted as a way for average people to profit from opportunities in the housing market. Ms. Lankford said she spent $35, 000 from an Army insurance payment to learn Mr. Trump\u2019s secrets. Another was Cambridge Who\u2019s Who, a vanity publisher promising \u201cbranding services\u201d that seemed to complement the real estate business she hoped to create. She paid thousands of dollars to Cambridge, whose spokesman and \u201cexecutive director of global branding\u201d was Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr. Six years later, Ms. Lankford, who is 44 and has a son, has little to show for the money she spent, aside from a nagging sense that she was taken advantage of. Several friends in her community in San Antonio fell for similar offers, she said, but most are not eager to talk about it. \u201cAs a widow, you find you were so dependent on your husband, and when you make a mistake because of predatory businesses, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Ms. Lankford said. \u201cWe\u2019re an easy target. \u201d \u201cEasy target\u201d might describe the audience for several enterprises stamped with the Trump brand that have been accused of preying upon desperation, inexperience or vanity. Some are well known. Trump University has most recently gained notice because of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the Mexican heritage of the judge overseeing a fraud lawsuit brought by former students. There was also a multilevel   enterprise, the Trump Network, that Mr. Trump had said would give hope to people looking to \u201copt out of the recession. \u201d But intersecting with these was another, largely unexamined, business venture, Cambridge Who\u2019s Who, which generated hundreds of complaints that it deceptively peddled the promise of recognition in a registry, as well as branding and networking services of questionable value. Dozens of people who paid   businesses were also sold products by Cambridge, which benefited from its partnership with Donald Trump Jr. through \u201cleveraging relationships built by the Trump empire,\u201d according to Cambridge. Cambridge was not a Trump company it was operated by Randy Narod, a Long Island, N. Y. nightclub and bagel store owner barred from the securities industry for having had an impostor take his licensing exam. However, Cambridge gained the Trump imprimatur when the younger Mr. Trump came on board in 2010 and began promoting its services as a way for people to distinguish themselves in a tough economic climate. He worked in plugs for Cambridge during interviews on the Fox Business Network and TheStreet. com, did a promotional video and appeared in photos with Mr. Narod. Among them was one with another Trump executive at Trump Tower in New York, where, according to a news release, the three men discussed \u201cstrategies to expand the personal branding and professional networking services offered by Cambridge Who\u2019s Who. \u201d Mr. Narod\u2019s company said on its website that it had embarked on a \u201cglobal expansion with the Trump Organization. \u201d \u201cBranding is the best way to gain recognition and exposure, and nobody knows this more than the Trump Organization,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said in a promotion for Cambridge. Cambridge employees played up the Trump association when pursuing customers. \u201cWe had scripts to read when we made our calls to people, and when Donald Trump Jr. came along, our scripts were changed to include him in it,\u201d said Joy Debono, a former Cambridge telemarketer. \u201cWe would basically say that Cambridge was a good company because Trump was involved in it. \u201d Donald Trump Jr. declined to answer questions about his work for Cambridge. His father\u2019s presidential campaign issued a statement saying the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s role at the company \u201cwas an arrangement made totally outside of the Trump Organization and there was never any commingling of the two corporations at any level. \u201d Mr. Narod said that the younger Mr. Trump worked with Cambridge for a year while also continuing as a top executive with the Trump Organization, and that he had been aware of the complaints against Cambridge, as well as Mr. Narod\u2019s censure by the securities industry. \u201cDon Jr. was hired for a very short time as a spokesperson to help our members with their personal branding, since he and his family build one of the biggest brands in the world,\u201d Mr. Narod said. \u201cWe believed that he could be essential to enhance their online presence. \u201d The \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d industry has a long and dubious history. There are some   companies that publish directories of professionals in various fields, such as lawyers and top corporate executives. But there are many others that target people of little distinction, shower them with accolades and then try to sell them costly \u201chonors\u201d such as placement in a directory or wall plaques. Cambridge and its subsidiary, Worldwide Branding, took the model a step further, adding the promise of branding  \u2014   news releases, video biographies and a personalized web page  \u2014   and networking with other Cambridge customers who paid a membership fee to join. When Donald Trump Jr. joined Cambridge, the company had already had about 400 complaints filed against it with the Better Business Bureau since 2006. Scores more appeared in online consumer forums like Ripoff Report, where customers vented about misleading sales calls, worthless products and difficulties getting refunds. Many of the complaints describe a similar pattern of aggressively steering people into ever more expensive products. A    woman from Kansas reported that she had paid $788 for services she claimed were \u201cnot worth $50 collectively\u201d while she was going through a divorce and \u201clooking for a way to make a living, build a new life and expand my career through this organization. \u201d After she complained to the New York State attorney general\u2019s office, she eventually received a refund. \u201cI felt so stupid,\u201d the woman, identified only as \u201cPepper,\u201d wrote in an online posting. \u201cMy takeaway is this: all is not gold that glitters, and that includes the Trump name. Buyer beware!\u201d In Oregon, Phyllis Fread was in her 80s, dealing with Parkinson\u2019s disease and had been retired from teaching for almost two decades when Cambridge started calling her at home, where she lived alone. Cambridge salespeople telephoned Ms. Fread  \u2014   who did not use the internet  \u2014   42 times trying to sell her networking services, a website and other products she did not need, according to an investigation by the Oregon attorney general\u2019s office. Over a   period, Cambridge charged her $14, 593 for a video biography, calendars, a plaque and other items, including a news release in June 2010 titled \u201cPhyllis J. Fread Reveals Her Secret to a Long Career in Education. \u201d The release included a mention of Donald Trump Jr. saying he \u201cwas eager to share his extensive experience\u201d with Cambridge clients. Eventually, Ms. Fread reached her credit card limit and her son disconnected her telephone to stop Cambridge from calling. In a recorded interview with an investigator from the attorney general\u2019s office, Ms. Fread became emotional as she recalled how \u201cthere were all kinds of things they\u2019d push and I\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t want it at all. \u2019\u201d \u201cI remember saying, \u2018Wait a minute, I don\u2019t need anything, I don\u2019t want anything.\u2019 And then you couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise. I probably should have hung up,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. \u201d Cambridge was accused by the state of \u201cunfair, deceptive and unconscionable practices\u201d and settled without admitting guilt, issuing a refund to Ms. Fread in 2012. She died 18 months later. Mr. Narod said many complaints about Cambridge stemmed from early \u201cgrowing pains\u201d before it transitioned from just a     vanity publisher to one that added branding services. Cambridge  \u2014   which in recent years has shifted its focus to finding customers outside the United States through a related venture called Worldwide Who\u2019s Who  \u2014   has worked to improve its sales techniques and to better address complaints, he said. The latest Better Business Bureau records show close to 100 complaints in the last three years about Cambridge and Worldwide. \u201cIt has been quite some time since Cambridge has received negative comments, and we believe that is a testament to the strength of our products and the work that we did to make necessary operational improvements,\u201d Mr. Narod said. A search of online records, as well as interviews, turned up dozens of members who also paid other companies licensed or endorsed by the Trumps, although Mr. Narod denied that the businesses exchanged customer leads. \u201cWe have never shared or sold our data with the Trump Organization, Trump University or Trump Network,\u201d he said. What they did have in common were sales appeals that had a similar theme of offering help navigating the recession. Ads for Trump University referred to government bailouts for banks, and asked the question, \u201cWho\u2019s helping you?\u201d Similarly, Donald Trump Jr. went on Fox Business and said Cambridge clients \u201care people that the stimulus should be benefitting. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult economy out there, a very difficult job market,\u201d he told TheStreet. com while discussing Cambridge. \u201cAnd you really have to position yourself so you can take advantage of all those things properly. \u201d Ms. Lankford, who heads her local Texas chapter of Gold Star Wives, which represents spouses of fallen soldiers, said she had lost money in the stock market collapse and decided to use an insurance payment from her husband\u2019s death to try to start her own business. Her husband, Jonathan M. Lankford, a command sergeant major in the Army, died in Baghdad in September 2007. In late 2009, she responded to an appeal from Trump University, which promised to \u201cturn anyone into a successful real estate investor\u201d and paid for the full package of seminars. Soon, however, she found they were of little practical value and she began \u201ccalling them and asking for help. \u201d \u201cThey ended up putting me in touch with some fellow out in California who tried to talk me into investing in trailer parks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a joke. \u201d Cambridge, meanwhile, was supposed to help Ms. Lankford \u201ccreate my brand\u201d to promote her real estate efforts, and in some of the many calls she received over several years, the company\u2019s representative cited Donald Trump Jr. \u2019s role, she said. But after spending several thousand dollars  \u2014   which got her, among other things, a wall plaque, a news release and a    web page  \u2014   she said she received no meaningful benefits. Ms. Lankford never filed complaints or pursued refunds, saying that it probably would have been fruitless, and that she was too busy raising her young son on her own and trying to rebuild her life. She came away from her experience believing both businesses were \u201call about taking money from people who don\u2019t have much to begin with. \u201d Besides Trump University, there were other   enterprises that resonated with Cambridge members struggling to get ahead. On one of several Cambridge websites for its members, a chat group created in 2010 titled \u201cMaking Money in a Recession\u201d contained an appeal to join ACN, a multilevel marketer of telecommunications and energy services that was \u201cendorsed by Donald Trump and was featured in an episode of \u2018Celebrity Apprentice. \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure shows that he has collected more than $1 million in speaking fees from ACN, which charged people $499 to sell its products with the promise of profits for bringing in additional members, and has been the subject of numerous complaints. There was also an appeal for the Trump Network, the marketer of vitamins and nutritional supplements to which Mr. Trump licensed his name. Originally called Ideal Health and rebranded in 2009, the Trump Network and its top salespeople lured those hit by the economic downturn, suggesting they could become rich through commissions for bringing in new recruits. Christine Turner, a disabled nurse in upstate New York, said a friend persuaded her to spend \u201cclose to $500\u201d to get started with the Trump Network, but that it \u201cdidn\u2019t pan out\u201d after she struggled to get others involved. She also paid to join Cambridge, attracted to the prospect of networking with other members, but that did not work either. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any good experiences with members coming or approaching me or asking for products,\u201d Ms. Turner said, adding that she did not hold her bad experiences against the Trumps. \u201cI was fine with it, even with losing a little bit of money,\u201d she said. \u201cI really think that Donald Trump is a powerful businessman and I\u2019m actually for him, I\u2019m not afraid to say that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562660.374963}
