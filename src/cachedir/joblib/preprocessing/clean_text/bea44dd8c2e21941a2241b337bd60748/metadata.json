[Claire Perry, a Conservative who represents Devizes, launched the broadside against her colleagues while at the same time lamenting \u201chysterical\u201d language on Brexit.  Comparing fellow Conservatives to Islamic extremists, Ms Perry said: \u201cI have to say that the tone of this debate  \u2014   and we\u2019ve heard a little bit, although it\u2019s starting to calm down  \u2014   sometimes borders on the hysterical. \u201cI feel sometimes I am sitting along with colleagues who are like jihadis in their support for a hard Brexit. \u201d She went on to say: \u201cNo Brexit is hard enough  \u2014   \u2018begone you evil Europeans, we never want you to darken our doors again\u2019. People say: \u2018Steady on, Claire\u2019 but I am afraid I heard speeches last week exactly making that point. \u201cThe point of this is, the more we get this out in the open, the more we are not led by some of the most hysterical tabloid newspapers out there, but actually have an open and frank conversation with each other about what we want to do, the better. \u201d Ms Perry, speaking as the House of Commons, spent a second day deliberating amendments to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which will grant Prime Minister Theresa May the power to trigger the process of leaving the EU. She was one of seven Conservative MPs to rebel against the government and back an opposition amendment forcing the government to give Parliament a bigger say on the final Brexit deal. The amendment was nonetheless defeated after the government announced they intended to do that anyway. MPs will finish debating the bill on Wednesday evening before holding a final vote. If it is passed, it will then go to the heavily   House of Lords for further deliberation.'"}, "time": 1742564135.5612364}
