Trump in the fall, according to administration aides. The conversation, the fifth that Mr. Obama will have had with Mr. Sanders since the primaries began, is to be part of a choreographed series of moves Mr. Obama set in motion this week that are designed to quickly bridge the divide between the two Democratic presidential candidates laid bare in the last few months. The strategy will culminate with the president\u2019s formal endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in the coming days, followed by an appearance with her on the campaign trail soon after. Mr. Obama\u2019s message is intended to be unmistakable: The time has come for Mr. Sanders to harness his formidable constituency in support of his onetime rival even as he continues to press for the progressive policies that animated his base. But it is also clear to the White House that Mr. Obama must broker this particular intraparty peace treaty with patience and respect, or risk angering Mr. Sanders and his millions of supporters. To that end, the president will delay any endorsement of Mrs. Clinton until after the meeting with Mr. Sanders. And a joint appearance is unlikely until after the Democratic primary in the District of Columbia on Tuesday. Mr. Obama will not pressure Mr. Sanders to make a concession before that contest, the final one in the long primary season, advisers said. \u201cWe should be a little graceful and give him the opportunity to decide on his own,\u201d when he wants to leave the race, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said of Mr. Sanders on Wednesday. White House aides said Mr. Obama was eager to help Mr. Sanders find a way to continue elevating the causes he championed for more than a year  \u2014   including addressing income inequality and college tuition affordability, raising the minimum wage and changing campaign finance rules  \u2014   but without the   comments that could threaten the Democratic cause. \u201cYou\u2019ve built this enormous   movement what do you want to do with that?\u201d said Jen Psaki, Mr. Obama\u2019s communications director, describing what was likely to be the tenor of his conversation with Mr. Sanders. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition of the energy and enthusiasm that he built, and that that is going to be needed to win in November. \u201d Finding a way to help guide Mr. Sanders past his disappointment is the president\u2019s chief goal during the next few days, Obama aides said. During a remarkable and at times bruising political campaign, Mr. Sanders has built an enormous list of Democratic voters that would be invaluable to Mrs. Clinton and to Democratic Senate and House candidates. Aides said Mr. Obama would remind Mr. Sanders that he could receive much of the credit for big Democratic wins if he helps redirect his newfound political energy toward helping Mrs. Clinton. Democratic strategists said the president would play a pivotal role in reaching out to Mr. Sanders\u2019s coalition, although Mrs. Clinton will have to make a visible effort to appeal to her former adversary\u2019s supporters  \u2014   much as Mr. Obama did in 2008 after he won a prolonged and at times bitter primary with Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great surrogate among those Democrats who were supportive of him but are less supportive of her, particularly younger Democrats, in making the case as to why consolidating behind her is important and what\u2019s at stake in the election,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaign and his White House. Mrs. Clinton \u201cneeds to approach those folks with open arms, but there is a   reality element of this that he may be better suited for,\u201d Mr. Axelrod added. Some supporters of Mr. Sanders on Wednesday said that they hoped that Mr. Obama would not pressure their candidate to quickly leave the race. \u201cBernie Sanders and the   political revolutionaries behind him have more than earned the time and the space, just as Secretary Clinton and her supporters did eight years ago, to determine the best steps we can take together to help unite our party against Donald Trump in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d said Jim Dean, the chairman of Democracy for America, which endorsed Mr. Sanders in December. Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which stayed neutral in the race, said Democrats should not \u201cguilt trip\u201d Sanders voters by warning them of the risks of electing Mr. Trump, but instead incorporate their ideas, including expanding Social Security benefits and breaking up big banks, into the party platform. In a taped appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d that is to be broadcast Thursday night, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Sanders, saying he brought \u201cenormous energy\u201d and \u201cnew ideas\u201d to the campaign. The president said Mr. Sanders pushed his rival, making her a better candidate. \u201cShe is whip smart, she is tough and she deeply cares about working people and putting kids through school,\u201d Mr. Obama said, citing some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s main concerns about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cMy hope is over the next couple weeks, we\u2019re able to pull things together. \u201d The president said Mr. Sanders and his supporters deserved some time to become used to the fact that he did not win. He said that people who poured their hearts into campaigns often became \u201ca little ouchy\u201d and bruised, and needed time to recover. Asked whether he thinks the Republicans are happy with their choice of Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama joked, \u201cWe are!\u201d He then added, \u201cActually, you know what, that was too easy,\u201d and said he was worried about the Republican Party because democracy works when \u201cyou have two parties that are serious. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562626.1921458}
