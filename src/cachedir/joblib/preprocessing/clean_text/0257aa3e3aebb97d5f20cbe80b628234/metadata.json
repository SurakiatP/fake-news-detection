Trump mastered the New York tabloid terrain  \u2014   and his own narrative  \u2014   shaping his image with a combination of    bluster and    gossip. He\u2019s not in Manhattan anymore. This New   of politicians, now an idiosyncratic,     president, has stumbled into the most conventional of Washington traps: believing he can master an entrenched political press corps with far deeper connections to the permanent government of federal law enforcement and executive department officials than he has. Instead, President Trump has found himself subsumed and increasingly infuriated by the leaks and criticisms he has long prided himself on vanquishing. Now, goaded by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, Mr. Trump has turned on the news media with escalating rhetoric, labeling major outlets as \u201cthe enemy of the American people. \u201d His latest swipe  \u2014   pulling out of Washington\u2019s   nerd prom  \u2014   came via Twitter on Saturday. \u201cI will not be attending the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner this year,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cPlease wish everyone well and have a great evening!\u201d He has made a sharp break from previous presidents  \u2014   and from his own comfortable   tango with the tabloids. \u201cNew York is extremely intense and competitive, but it is actually a much smaller pond than Washington, where you have many more players with access to many more sources,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, who has split his career between New York and Washington, advising former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cIn New York, you can create a manageable set of relationships in a smaller universe,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cIn Washington, that becomes a lot more complicated. \u201d There is another fundamental difference: During his Page Six days, Mr. Trump was, by and large, trafficking in trivia. As president, he is dealing with the most serious issues of the day. They involve the nation\u2019s safety and prosperity, and it is the role of news organizations to cover them. If Mr. Trump\u2019s    relationship with reporters had a model back then, people close to him say, it was the gregarious,    style of Edward I. Koch, the   New York mayor. But his mood in Washington has turned darker, and over the last week he has executed, alongside Mr. Bannon and Mr. Spicer, what amounts to the most sustained White House campaign against the news media since Richard M. Nixon\u2019s second term. \u201cIt\u2019s like Nixonian times again,\u201d said George Rush, a veteran New York gossip columnist who has covered Mr. Trump for decades. \u201cI just thought he would have a thicker skin. \u201d Linda Stasi, who chronicled Mr. Trump\u2019s    marriage to Marla Maples in the 1990s for two New York papers, said she could have predicted the presidential agita. \u201cHe would plant stories and he would get mad if they didn\u2019t come out exactly as he wanted,\u201d she recalled of earlier dealings with Mr. Trump. \u201cIt never occurred to him that he couldn\u2019t control everything. \u201d Now, Ms. Stasi said, \u201che is shocked that he is not in control of the press. \u201d Attacking the news media, which has an abysmal approval rating among Republican voters, is sound politics in the short term. But Mr. Trump\u2019s fury is less strategic than heartfelt. He watches cable TV at night and exhorts aides like Mr. Spicer and his policy adviser Stephen Miller to be tougher, according to White House aides. His anger is compounded by his belief that he should still be able to plant and steer stories. That was a lot easier to do when he was running a   real estate and branding business with an aggressive legal team that demanded that nearly everyone in his orbit sign nondisclosure agreements. For the first time in his life, Mr. Trump is on the public payroll and subject to a tangle of laws and rules no businessman  \u2014   especially one accustomed to overseeing every aspect of a relatively small family business  \u2014   would tolerate. To some extent, the clash with the press was inevitable. Mr. Trump may be noisier and more confrontational than many of his predecessors, but he is being   lessons all presidents eventually learn  \u2014   that the iron triangle of the Washington press corps, West Wing staff and federal bureaucracy is simply too powerful to bully. Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the press during the 2016 campaign was rocky and paradoxical. He was, at times, accessible  \u2014   frequently calling reporters to kibbitz, complain or make news. But as the resentments piled up, his staff, led by Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager, made a point of snubbing journalists it did not like and confining reporters to a small pen at rallies. Mr. Trump quickly realized, aides said, that his attacks on the \u201cdishonest\u201d news media were as popular as his hits on \u201ccrooked\u201d Hillary Clinton. The addition of Mr. Bannon to the campaign team last summer gave the jostling hostility a sharper edge. Last month, Mr. Bannon described the   relationship as \u201ca war\u201d in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cI want you to quote this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe media here is the opposition party. They don\u2019t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. \u201d Things have deteriorated since then. The White House, on the defensive last week after a series of missteps and leaked stories, sought to shift to offense, targeting the news media as an enemy, in the absence of any more formidable foil in a city now firmly controlled by Republicans. Mr. Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood producer who made a fortune from the syndication of TV shows, described the \u201ccorporatist media\u201d as the \u201copposition party\u201d in a speech on Thursday. The next day, Mr. Spicer excluded selected news organizations, including The New York Times, Politico and CNN, from a   version of his daily briefing. Then there was Mr. Trump\u2019s   attack on \u201cfake news\u201d during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, which was met with shouts of approval from the conservative faithful. Reporters back in New York, however, knew that the president\u2019s call for an end to \u201csources\u201d  \u2014   meaning anonymous sources leaking damaging details of his campaign\u2019s relationship with Russian officials  \u2014   did not jibe with his onetime role as a   gossipmonger, trumpeting his business dealings and romantic life in   phone calls. \u201cI\u2019m against the people that make up stories and make up sources,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\u2019s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. \u201d \u201cHe used to be the one leaking!\u201d Ms. Stasi pointed out on Friday from her office at The Daily News, where she is a columnist. \u201cHe was leaking about himself. He would call up with fake accents and pretend it wasn\u2019t him. He would tell us 100 times: \u2018Now listen, I\u2019m going to tell you something, but it didn\u2019t come from me. \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump, who taunted his   critics on Friday  \u2014   \u201cLet \u2019em say it to my face!\u201d  \u2014   hid his own identity to push   stories in the 1980s, posing as his own   man under the fake names John Miller and John Barron. Despite his dominance of social media, Mr. Trump still retains a slightly anachronistic view of the press. He prefers ink to pixels, asking staff members to print out online articles and reviewing the day\u2019s newspapers  \u2014   black Sharpie in hand  \u2014   with Mr. Spicer in the Oval Office at the end of each work day. Mr. Trump reads bylines and remembers them. He also keeps obsessive track of his presence in the press. During an interview at Trump Tower last spring, the future president proudly showed off a boardroom filled entirely with stacks of magazines and newspapers featuring his visage. The publications, which covered an entire conference table, ran the spectrum from The Wall Street Journal to The Hollywood Reporter to Newsweek and Time. Framed copies of Playboy, TV Guide and Variety hung on the walls. It was a living, expanding shrine to his political rise  \u2014   and a physical manifestation of his media fixation. Still, for a sophisticated consumer of news, Mr. Trump retains a brutally simple, almost Manichaean view of his coverage: good stories are good, bad stories are evil. It could prove an untenable attribute for the most scrutinized man in the world. \u201cHe loves the press he lives for it,\u201d Howard Stern, a frequent Trump interviewer and friend, said this month. \u201cHe wants to be liked he wants to be loved. \u201d Being president, Mr. Stern added, is not \u201cgoing to be a healthy experience. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628517.5576046}
