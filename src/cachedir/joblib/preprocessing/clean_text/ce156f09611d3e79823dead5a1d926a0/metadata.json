But he wonders why reporters \u201cdon\u2019t force down-ballot Democrats to take a position on each new Clinton email revelation.\u201d \\nThat would be fine. Although there is nothing we didn\u2019t suspect, thanks to WikiLeaks, we have more details than ever about Clinton venality and political corruption. \\nBut there is a line of questioning that is even more important. \\nWhy shouldn\u2019t other candidates on the Democrat ticket be asked to endorse or disavow Hillary\u2019s regime change wars in Libya and Syria? \\nShouldn\u2019t they be made to own the jihadist-generating carnage she champions? Wouldn\u2019t it be wise to tie political supporters to her war trajectory with Russia as well, so that if she has her way the survivors will know who was to blame? 1:20 pm on October 28, 2016'"}, "time": 1742562092.4870477}
