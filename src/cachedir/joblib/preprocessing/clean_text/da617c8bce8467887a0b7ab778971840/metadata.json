It isn\u2019t. Do not misunderstand the situation. A pre-session is no more a session than the Pope is a Muslim. So don\u2019t try and pull a fast one on teachers. Sure it can\u2019t be a session, there\u2019s no drugs in sight, trust us, we looked. \\n2) Just the one \\nJust going for the one is simply that, an expression of a desire to have a casual catch up with a fellow teacher friend without being unfairly labelled a basket case that can\u2019t go two minutes without recreating their favourite scenes from Trainspotting. And it\u2019s still \u2018just the one\u2019 if it\u2019s an early house, after ambling home from last night\u2019s pre-session. \\n3) Correcting essays \\nSee, it\u2019s not all fun and games and importing four tonnes of class A drugs. Teachers have some serious work to do, and a bottle of wine and a line will certainly make the whole thing go more smoothly. \\n4) Bumping into a student in a nightclub \\nAn awkward encounter many people can sympathise with. What is your favourite pupil Thomas doing in Flannerys at 2.30am? And what\u2019s he eating a Toffee Crisp for? Why is his mother shouting at you? Wait, why does Flanneys now look eerily like a suburban front garden. An easy mistake to make, don\u2019t worry about it. \\n5) Re-lax-ing-the-fuck-out \\nEducating the Nation\u2019s little shits isn\u2019t easy, we can only imagine, which is why teachers often just catch up on their sleep during a midterm. Or if sleep isn\u2019t possible, a trance sleep-like state after necking some Ketamine in a field in Kildare.'"}, "time": 1742563225.1404445}
