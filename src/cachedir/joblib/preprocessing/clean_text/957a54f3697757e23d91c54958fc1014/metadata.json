That\u2019s one thing y\u2019all can take to the bank.\u201d \\nMichelle Obama has become Hillary Clinton\u2019s most effective surrogate on the campaign trail this election season, delivering powerful speeches on behalf of the Democratic nominee whom she hopes will become her husband\u2019s successor. \\nThe First Lady\u2019s success on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton has only led her supporters to push for her to launch her own political career, though she has long denied that she has any desire to run for political office. \\nIndeed, it seems Michelle Obama is much more content living the high life, jet-setting around the world on expensive vacations, using only the most luxurious of accommodations, and paying for none of it herself. That\u2019s for the lowly taxpayers like you and me to do\u2026 \\nWhy hold a job or work to curry favor with the American people when your lavish lifestyle has been handed to you on a silver platter? Considering this, it\u2019s really no surprise Michelle Obama does not wish to run for office after her husband\u2019s term is over, and for that, we are grateful. \\nSHARE this report if you are glad to hear that Michelle Obama will not seek political office after she vacates the White House in the coming months\u2026 Haven\u2019t we had enough of her?!'"}, "time": 1742561942.8255749}
