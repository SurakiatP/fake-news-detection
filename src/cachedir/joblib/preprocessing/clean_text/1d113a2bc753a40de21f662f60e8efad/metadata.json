He was 99. The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Bill Kux, a cousin. Mr. Herz, who worked on other radio and theater productions as stage manager and casting director for Welles\u2019s Mercury Theater company, staked one additional claim to fame. Until about six months ago, he had been a regular customer at Sardi\u2019s restaurant, the   gathering place for celebrities and   tourists in the theater district, for some 82 years  \u2014   beginning in 1933, just six years after it opened. That longevity alone distinguished him as a bon vivant in a shrinking cadre of original Broadway personalties. But he was also singled out periodically in the wider world as a relic of a bygone era, when a bogus radio news broadcast could provoke panic as war was brewing in Europe  \u2014   however much that hysteria may have been overstated then and since. Welles\u2019s CBS show \u201cThe Mercury Theater on the Air\u201d presented an adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d for its Halloween episode on Sunday, Oct. 30, 1938. The live hourlong program began with an updated prelude to the original novel eerily warning that superintelligent beings had been coveting \u201cthis Earth with envious eyes. \u201d Then music, a weather report and other regular features were interrupted by simulated news bulletins and fake feeds from   operators in the field. Mr. Herz, playing Operators Three and Five, took part in this exchange: Operator Three: This is Newark, New Jersey.   \u2026     This is Newark, New Jersey.   \u2026     Warning! Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes. Reaches South Street. Gas masks useless. Urge population to move into open spaces.   \u2026     Automobiles use Routes 7, 23, 24.   \u2026     Avoid congested areas. Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard.   \u2026     Operator Four: 2X2L   \u2026     calling CQ   \u2026     2X2L   \u2026     calling CQ   \u2026     2X2L   \u2026     calling 8X3R   \u2026     Come in, please.   \u2026     Operator Five: This is 8X3R   \u2026     coming back at 2X2L. Operator Four: How\u2019s reception? How\u2019s reception? K, please. (Pause.) Where are you, 8X3R? What\u2019s the matter? Where are you? John Houseman, Welles\u2019s producer, wrote in his 1972 memoir, \u201c \u201d: \u201cOur actual broadcasting time, from the first mention of the meteorites to the fall of New York City, was less than 40 minutes. During that time men traveled long distances, large bodies of troops were mobilized, cabinet meetings were held, savage battles fought on land and in the air. And millions of people accepted it  \u2014   emotionally if not logically. \u201d (Mr. Houseman went on to a distinguished career in theater and Hollywood.) Mr. Herz also read Welles\u2019s part, that of a Professor Pierson at a New Jersey observatory, during rehearsals. He said he was surprised by the public\u2019s response to the radio show. \u201cDuring the broadcast, outside, policemen were coming,\u201d he told CBS News in 2013. \u201cThey were told on the radio that the Martians were coming, the Martians were coming!\u201d (Later scholarship about the incident suggested that the broadcast provoked far less fear among the public than has been popularly portrayed.) In a 2010 profile in The New York Times, Mr. Herz was quoted as saying: \u201cI had done Orson\u2019s part in the dress rehearsal, and after I did it, I thought to myself, \u2018Nobody\u2019s going to believe this in a million years.\u2019 Boy, was I wrong. \u201d William Herz Jr. was born in Detroit on Aug. 2, 1916, the son of Harold William Herz, a girdle salesman, and the former Fannie Lichtig. (Bill Herz called himself Jr. even though he wasn\u2019t one.) He graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh before moving to New York. He was briefly married to Susanne Guettel, whose brother Henry was a producer and film executive. No immediate family members survive. Mr. Herz had met Welles in Pittsburgh, where Welles, a young director at the time, had stopped while touring with a production of \u201cRomeo and Juliet. \u201d They discovered that they had a common acquaintance in the actress Edith Meiser, a friend of Mr. Herz\u2019s parents. Mr. Herz started working for Welles as a gofer. He later moved into Welles\u2019s Manhattan home  \u2014   Mr. Herz had been living with an aunt in Brooklyn  \u2014   so that he could constantly be on call. They worked together on \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d \u201cThe Cradle Will Rock\u201d and \u201cToo Much Johnson. \u201d Mr. Herz joined the Army Air Forces during World War II, managed a summer theater in Connecticut and produced and managed several plays in New York (including a few flops, one inauspiciously titled \u201cThe Strangler Fig\u201d). After one failure, Vincent Sardi Sr. the founder of Sardi\u2019s, generously invited him to keep an open tab in good times and bad. Another advantage to eating there was that Mackey\u2019s Ticket Agency next door, where Mr. Herz later worked, had no restroom. Ivan Lesica, Sardi\u2019s ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel, said on Thursday that Mr. Herz would eat there once or twice a week and sit at Table Four, to the left of the dining room entrance, under his caricature. He would have coffee delivered in his own white mug, and typically order the chicken potpie or, appropriately enough for an habitu\u00e9 whom his cousin described as a confirmed curmudgeon, the crab meat sandwich.'"}, "time": 1742561706.5092773}
