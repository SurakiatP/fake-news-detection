But in its latest episode, the program expressed confidence that he\u2019ll be in office until at least 2018, long enough to see America decimated by an alien invasion force from the planet Zorblatt 9. After a palpable absence last week, Alec Baldwin returned to play Mr. Trump in the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d cold open, which imagined him in a future year, visiting a military base and trying to dispense words of inspiration while the United States battles with an extraterrestrial adversary. It was an opportunity for a rousing \u201cIndependence Day\u201d  speech. So how did he start? Mr. Baldwin  \u2014   who, outside of \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d has recently been hinting that he does not plan to play Mr. Trump in perpetuity  \u2014   began by asking, \u201cWho here loves Trump?\u201d \u201cI know this guy over here, he loves Trump,\u201d he said, pointing at what turned out to be a charred corpse. A military officer played by the cast member Kenan Thompson told him, \u201cThe aliens are killing us, sir. They have the most advanced weaponized technology we\u2019ve ever seen. What should we do?\u201d The Trump character responded, \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We are going to bring coal back, O. K.? We\u2019re going to have so much coal, you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Where did all this coal come from? I never knew there could be so much coal. \u2019\u201d Informed that the aliens had already vaporized the state of California, Mr. Baldwin answered, \u201cSo then I won the popular vote?\u201d As Mr. Trump, he explained that the aliens had already been secretly living in the United States for hundreds of years. \u201cLook, there\u2019s one right there,\u201d he said, indicating Leslie Jones. \u201cAnd so is the woman next to her, right there,\u201d he said, pointing at Sasheer Zamata. Asked where he was getting his information, Mr. Baldwin replied, \u201cFrom a very reputable source, Infowars. It\u2019s a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You know he\u2019s legit because he\u2019s always taking off his shirt. \u201d When the aliens at last overrun the base and learn that Mr. Trump is president, one creature (played by Bobby Moynihan) declares, \u201cReally? This is going to be so easy. \u201d A filmed segment shown later featured the guest host Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump, in a commercial parody for her own brand of perfume. A narrator pitched the product in a whispery  : \u201cShe\u2019s Ivanka. And a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own. A scent made just for her. Because she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s powerful. She\u2019s complicit. \u201d The narrator added, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t crave the spotlight. But we see her. Oh, how we see her. \u201d (At the same time, Ms. Johansson was shown looking in a mirror and applying lipstick, seeing the reflection of Mr. Baldwin as Mr. Trump, performing the same action.) A final   for Complicit described it as \u201cthe fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won\u2019t. \u201d (\u201cAlso available in a cologne for Jared,\u201d the narrator said, in a reference to Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner.) During a   segment on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d Kate McKinnon reprised her role as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, seated side by side with Senator Al Franken (Alex Moffat) the Minnesota Democrat and \u201cS. N. L. \u201d alumnus who has said that Mr. Sessions may have perjured himself in his responses to Mr. Franken\u2019s questions at his confirmation hearing. As Mr. Sessions, Ms. McKinnon said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize this, but Al and I are actually great friends. \u201d In the past, she said, she took him   rafting, and, in return, \u201cAl showed me Jew stuff. \u201d (\u201cWe had lunch at a deli, Jeff,\u201d Mr. Moffat replied in an imitation of Mr. Franken\u2019s dry delivery.) Mr. Moffat tried to get Ms. McKinnon to clarify her testimony: \u201cI\u2019m just a simple country laaaaar,\u201d she explained. \u201cAre you saying lawyer or liar?\u201d he asked. For good measure, \u201cWeekend Update\u201d concluded with Pete Davidson taking potshots at various people associated with the Trump administration, including the White House adviser Stephen Miller (\u201cHe tries to project strength,\u201d Mr. Davidson said, \u201cbut he looks like Fredo Corleone had been even sicker as a child\u201d) and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary (whom Mr. Davidson called \u201cone of those sweet Southern girls that you marry if you\u2019re gay\u201d). Last week, the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. responded playfully to his portrayal on \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d writing in an Instagram post, \u201cif you ever need a Don Jr fill in I\u2019m available. \u201d There were no immediate responses to this week\u2019s episode from President Trump or the population of Zorblatt 9.'"}, "time": 1742561686.0081708}
