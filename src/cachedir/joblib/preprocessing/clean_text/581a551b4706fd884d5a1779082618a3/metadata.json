Bernie Sanders had a message for California\u2019s Democrats on Saturday: \u201cPlease lead the country and pass the   bill. \u201d[Sanders was speaking in Beverly Hills, according to the Sacramento Bee, where he was accepting an award from Consumer Watchdog, a   organization devoted to consumer advocacy.  Democrats, who hold a   majority in the state legislature that allows them to pass bills virtually at will, are currently considering a \u201c \u201d health care system, also called \u201csocialized medicine,\u201d in which the state would cover the cost of health insurance and health care for everybody in California. The \u201cHealthy California Act,\u201d SB 562, promises: \u201cto guarantee that every resident of California will receive comprehensive healthcare services. It\u2019s like Medicare for All. \u201d The legislation took a step towards passage late last month with a hearing in the State Senate. The Senate Health Committee voted   to approve the bill, which will now continue its circuitous pass through the State Senate before proceeding to a final vote. Town halls and rallies have been staged across the state to support the legislation, which has the backing of the powerful California nursing unions. However, Governor Jerry Brown is opposed to the idea, which he said in March was too costly. \u201cWhere do you get the extra money? This is the whole question,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times. Sanders\u2019s home state of Vermont recently tried to implement a   system  \u2014   and failed. Sanders was evidently undeterred by the experience. \u201cThe great state of California can send a message that will be heard all over this country, and all over the world if you pass   here,\u201d he said on Saturday.
