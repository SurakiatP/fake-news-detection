I\u2019m here every day. It\u2019s all I do. I have a   focus on what I\u2019m trying to build. \u201d Ms. Paltrow had invited me to Goop\u2019s stylish headquarters here to discuss an initiative: A clothing line called Goop Label  \u2014   based on everyday items in her closet and \u201cfashion archives,\u201d including a trench coat she bought in the eighth grade  \u2014   will arrive on Goop. com on Monday. But our chat, like Ms. Paltrow herself, moved in multiple directions at once, starting with a rash of recent articles that found her consciously uncoupling from the polarizing lifestyle brand, which she founded in 2008. The   arose when Ms. Paltrow spoke at a Chicago conference and said that Goop\u2019s \u201cscalability is limited if I connect to it. \u201d She added at the time, \u201cMy dream is that one day no one will remember that I had anything to do with it. \u201d Tabloids decided that meant a departure (\u201cGoop riddance\u201d) but what she had meant was this: To thrive over the long term, brands like Goop must stand on their own. Tightly trading on a single persona is the surest route to degeneration. (Just ask Martha Stewart.) But striking that balance is tricky, with Goop Label as the latest example. The new clothing line  \u2014   initial prices start at $195 for a chambray   shirt and go up to $695 for a gray tweed belted blazer  \u2014   is not particularly captivating because it comes from Goop, which already sells a wide variety of designer clothes. The effort is interesting because it comes from her. Ms. Paltrow, 43, tried to split the difference during our    playing down her role in the Goop Label design process. \u201cIt was a collective effort, and I am not positioning myself as a designer,\u201d she said. But she also came alive when talking about the inspiration for certain items. \u201cI have kept an archive of my most influential fashion pieces, things that came to mean something to me,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cIt encompasses a lot of different time periods, lovers, countries. \u201d The clothing line arrives during a transitional time for her quirky company, which some women love for its    mix and others find ludicrous for the same reason. In   Ms. Paltrow said she had raised $10 million from three venture capital firms, an amount she described as \u201cenough runway to get us to profitability. \u201d Goop, which has about 60 employees (up from 15 two years ago) is also relocating its headquarters to California from New York. Lisa Gersh, who became Goop\u2019s chief executive two years ago after a stint at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, is stepping down as part of the move, although she will remain an adviser. At least for now, Ms. Gersh will not be replaced. \u201cI definitely need help with operations and finance, but I haven\u2019t really made a decision on it yet,\u201d said Ms. Paltrow, whose title is chief creative officer. Being a (nearly)   businesswoman  \u2014   she greatly scaled back her movie commitments a couple of years ago  \u2014   has been energizing, Ms. Paltrow insisted, even though her move away from Hollywood has puzzled some fans. \u201cI felt that I had achieved a lot in the acting world, and I really was ready for a totally different challenge,\u201d she said. But she acknowledged some internal struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s something, to be totally honest, that I\u2019m still wrestling with, because acting was such a huge part of my identity, and I don\u2019t know what it means if I fully stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that do to my perception of myself as an artist and as a woman?\u201d While still unprofitable, Goop is growing quickly. Revenue tripled in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2015, according to a spokeswoman new lines of business include organic cosmetics called Goop by Juice Beauty. But the success of Goop Label is important if Ms. Paltrow wants to keep up with some of the   brands that have sprouted in Goop\u2019s shadow. The Honest Company, founded four years ago in part by Jessica Alba and focused on   products, already has more than 500 employees and is worth an estimated $1. 7 billion. \u201cI\u2019ve always really taken my time with Goop,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said. \u201cYou have to understand: I am on the steepest learning curve of my life. Every day that I\u2019m here, I\u2019m learning what I don\u2019t know, which is tons. \u201d As for competition with women like Ms. Alba and Reese Witherspoon, who is pushing a Southern lifestyle brand called Draper James (\u201cIt\u2019s tailgating time, y\u2019all\u201d) Ms. Paltrow smacked that ball back into my court. \u201cIn the past, the media has tried to pit us all against each other, and it\u2019s so sexist and so absurd,\u201d she said. Visiting Ms. Paltrow at Goop headquarters was simultaneously nothing like I envisioned and everything I envisioned. Going in, I worried that she would take one glance at my   Eastland shoes, the ones with cat hair stuck in the laces, and have me escorted from the building. Be gone with this tacky man! She would then shake her head and think these words, which I once read in a Goop newsletter: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more disheartening than the sight of love handles spilling over your pants or a pooched belly. \u201d She was, of course, nothing like that. She came out to greet me  \u2014   Goop\u2019s new offices are in   wooden buildings built as part of a brick factory  \u2014   and told me she liked my name. (From now on, I\u2019m on board with Apple.) As a squadron of millennial women pecked at laptops outside her office, we talked for bit at her desk (metal top, computer, stacks of books and folders) and were soon gabbing like girlfriends as she tried on that Goop Label blazer. \u201cIt\u2019s chic, right?\u201d she said. Goop Label will roll out slowly, with up to five new items made available each month. (The first installment has four: the jacket, the chambray shirt, a pair of culottes and an oversize cotton canvas tote with a leather bottom.) Once pieces sell out  \u2014   only \u201cdozens\u201d of each are available  \u2014   they will not be restocked. \u201cI\u2019m worried because I think we underordered by a lot,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said, noting that she is using the same Italian factories as luxury brands like Azzedine Ala\u00efa and Dries Van Noten. How did she choose the offerings? \u201cI looked at the analytics  \u2014   what sold the best, as in hundreds of units, on our site,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were exclusive pieces that you couldn\u2019t buy anywhere else, they were priced under $1, 000 and they were    . \u201d Working with a team of designers and consultants, she then looked through her closets to find \u201ctimeless, essential, luxurious basics\u201d that she\u2019s never been able to replace. And then she tweaked them. \u201cI would look at something and think to myself, \u2018I love the little puff sleeve, but I wish that the sleeves were   I wish it had a collar, I wish it had buttons,\u2019 whatever,\u201d she said. I nodded, but my brain was still stuck on the word \u201canalytics. \u201d Here was an   actress, one of the world\u2019s most glamorous women (she was wearing an Atlantique Ascoli ensemble when we met) and she was interested in   \u2026     spreadsheets? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a weird move, and I understand why people are curious,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I know is that I feel so incredibly on fire professionally here at Goop, in ways that I don\u2019t think I ever felt when I was acting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563214.6085443}
