Love, as Thomas Pynchon wrote, reviewing Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s novel \u201cLove in the Time of Cholera\u201d in The New York Times Book Review in 1988 and quoting Mickey and Sylvia\u2019s 1956 hit single, love is strange. Elif Batuman\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d is in part about the unlikely and consuming crush that Selin, the daughter of Turkish immigrants, develops on an older mathematics student from Hungary during her freshman year at Harvard. It is unclear, for hundreds of pages, whether this crush is requited. Meanwhile the reader, palm crushed into forehead, thinks, \u201cPoor Selin, what are you doing to yourself?\u201d \u201cThe Idiot\u201d is set in 1995. Blues Traveler plays on Discmans. Mixtapes are still units of emotional currency. Students type with green cursors on black screens. Email is new, and Selin intuits its power. \u201cEach message contained the one that had come before, and so your own words came back to you  \u2014   all the words you threw out, they came back,\u201d Batuman writes. \u201cIt was like the story of your relations with others, the story of the intersection of your life with other lives, was constantly being recorded and updated and you could check it at any time. \u201d Anyone who has followed Batuman\u2019s work will not be surprised to learn that Selin first falls for Ivan, the Hungarian student, because she adores his email messages. Batuman is a language freak and geek. You can imagine one of her characters becoming attracted to someone, as did a woman in Norman Rush\u2019s last novel, \u201cSubtle Bodies,\u201d because he was \u201cverbal looking. \u201d Herself the daughter of Turkish immigrants and a graduate of Harvard, Batuman is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of \u201cThe Possessed: Adventures With Russian Books and the People Who Read Them\u201d (2010). That book was a witty and melancholy tour de force about reading and love and the pleasures of travel as against tourism. That same voice is poured into \u201cThe Idiot. \u201d It\u2019s memorable to witness Selin, via Batuman, absorb the world around her. Each paragraph is a small anthology of   observations. Only Batuman would send a character in search of new clothes and have her think, \u201cwhat was \u2018Cinderella,\u2019 if not an allegory for the fundamental unhappiness of shoe shopping?\u201d Selin notes the \u201cdeath roar\u201d of an institutional toilet. She observes how, lighting a cigarette, \u201cwhen the flame came into contact with the paper, it made a sound like the needle coming down on a record player. \u201d Small pleasures will have to sustain you over the long haul of this novel. \u201cThe Idiot\u201d builds little narrative or emotional force. It is like a beautiful neon sign made without a plug. No glow is cast. We\u2019re told why Selin falls for Ivan. He gives good email. He is also, as one of her friends puts it, \u201ca    Hungarian guy who stares at everyone like he\u2019s trying to see through their souls. \u201d He\u2019s Ivan the enfant terrible. Selin tells us about the force of her longing. \u201cEvery sound, every syllable that reached me,\u201d she says, \u201cI wanted to filter through his consciousness. \u201d But we never feel this longing in our bones. I\u2019m reminded of the acting coach\u2019s dictum that it\u2019s not important that the actor cry it\u2019s important that the audience does. After 100 pages, I was done with Ivan and wanted Selin to be done, too. I wished, as if she were an avatar in a video game, to point her in a different direction. Selin is not done with him. The summer after her freshman year, she travels to the Hungarian countryside to teach English and perhaps to see him on weekends. She consumes a lot of food with sour cream in it. She judges a contest to see which students have the best legs. She frets. Sexual heat is at a minimum. This is too bad, because Batuman has a rich sense of the details of human attachment and lust. Watching Ivan dig into his pockets for coins, for example, Selin thinks: \u201cAn amazing sight, someone you\u2019re infatuated with trying to fish something out of a jeans pocket. \u201d That line beamed me back to my own freshman year at college. \u201cThe Idiot\u201d  \u2014   at the rate Batuman is burning through the titles of Dostoyevsky novels, her next one will be called \u201cNetochka Nezvanova\u201d  \u2014   reminded me of Martin Amis\u2019s complaint about \u201cPride and Prejudice. \u201d That novel\u2019s only flaw, he said, \u201cis the absence of a   sex scene between Elizabeth and Darcy. \u201d There are two things I admire about this novel. One is the touching sense, here as in everything Batuman writes, that books are life. Selin is, convincingly and only slightly pretentiously, the sort of person who buys an overcoat because it reminds her of Gogol\u2019s. She likes learning Spanish because \u201cthe donkey had a place in the national literature. \u201d She delivers this writing advice, after hearing a story about a host placing an unsettling stuffed weasel in a guest room to keep someone company: \u201cIf you really wanted to be a writer, you didn\u2019t send away the weasel. \u201d I also liked Selin\u2019s determination to be \u201csomeone trying to live a life unmarred by laziness, cowardice, and conformity. \u201d She\u2019s an interesting human who, very much like this wry but distant novel, never becomes an enveloping one. Fiction, like love, is strange.'"}, "time": 1742563273.9241033}
