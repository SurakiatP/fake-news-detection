Stephen Malley, a golden retriever, said: \u201cI use Doggr to meet other dogs who I might like to casually hump while I\u2019m out and about. \u201cI\u2019m in a committed relationship with a chew toy, but there\u2019s such a thrill about meeting some anonymous dog in the park and just going at it in the bushes. \u201cI like to have my owner with me in my profile picture, because it shows I have a sensitive, affectionate side, and bitches love that.\u201d Nikki Hollis, a highland terrier, said: \u201cI like Sniffr, because it matches me with other dogs whose anal glands I want to sniff. Which is all other dogs.\u201d Professor Henry Brubaker, of the Institute for Studies, said: \u201cWe believe users of Doggr only ever swipe right, whether they\u2019re looking at a picture of a dog, an armchair, a human leg, or a cat. \u201cWe have also identified dog Uber, which involves lying down and whining until you\u2019re picked up and carried home.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563755.9663093}
