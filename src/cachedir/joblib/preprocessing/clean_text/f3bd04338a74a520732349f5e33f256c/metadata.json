He never came. so he\u2019s ignorant of that chapter of American history, and these people that are claiming that \u201cStar Trek\u201d is racist genocide or whatever they\u2019re calling white genocide, don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re equal to the president of the United States. I think the president is as foolish and as uninformed and as ignorant as these trolls are. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563139.6037326}
