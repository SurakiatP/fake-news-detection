The agency enacted a pay-to-play rule that applied such a restriction to state and local officials. The rule, however, was structured in a way that effectively exempted federal agencies from its restrictions \u2014 and it was created even though a major federal agency had just been plagued by an investment-related influence-peddling scandal. \\nIn practice, the gap in the rule allows BlackRock executives to raise big money for presidential candidates who \u2014 if they win \u2014 will appoint the officials that run the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which awards contracts to manage retirement assets for nearly 5 million current and former federal employees. The loophole also allows Wall Street executives to give cash to presidential candidates, even as those executives\u2019 firms get deals to manage \u2014 and earn fees from \u2014 investments for the federal government\u2019s separate pension insurance agency, which is run by presidential appointees. \\nIn all, the loophole in the SEC rule effectively leaves nearly a half-trillion dollars of retirement assets unprotected by the nation\u2019s major anti-corruption measure. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign has raised more than $1 million from financial firms that are contracted to manage those assets.'"}, "time": 1742562086.5282695}
