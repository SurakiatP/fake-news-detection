Redstone\u2019s epic career has become the stuff of   conversation, especially among those who knew the man when he was perhaps the most powerful figure in Hollywood. Peter Bart, a former producer and film executive who served as the editor of Variety from 1989 to 2009, was dining recently with friends at Off Vine, a quiet Hollywood restaurant housed in a     bungalow, when the inevitable came up. Others at the table included an   actress who knew Mr. Redstone well. \u201cAnd they wondered, \u2018How could Sumner get himself into this situation? \u2019\u201d Mr. Bart said. \u201cIt is very sad. \u201d Details about the    tycoon\u2019s private life surfaced during a   lawsuit, which fizzled in court last week. The story that emerged fell somewhere between film noir at its sleazy best and \u201cKing Lear. \u201d Mr. Bart said the billionaire\u2019s plight was coming up a lot lately among   people. \u201cIn some cases, there were expressions of empathy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is impatience with Sumner, too, that he couldn\u2019t keep his private life private. \u201d The legal proceedings revealed an aging lion who craved sex and steak, although he was too ill to leave his Beverly Park mansion and took his meals through a feeding tube. Court papers described him as \u201ca living ghost\u201d and told of female escorts making visits to his bedside while a nurse sometimes looked on. As Mr. Redstone\u2019s former lover and onetime   caretaker, Manuela Herzer, 51, battled his daughter, Shari Redstone, 62, for control of his daily care  \u2014   not to mention what she saw as her rightful place in his will  \u2014   this   melodrama had it all: wild shopping sprees,   excursions, whispers of a sex tape and, in a bit part, an angry   who seemed like a character out of a Coen brothers movie. Hollywood dynasties have long run into complications in the final reel. In the 1950s, a philandering Jack L. Warner undercut his brother Harry for control of the family\u2019s Warner Bros. studio, and the two never spoke again. In the early 1970s, Darryl F. Zanuck was ousted from 20th Century Fox in a coup, which his wife orchestrated to avenge her husband\u2019s treatment of their son. While those spectacles drew their share of press attention and loose talk, today\u2019s corporate, almost bloodless entertainment industry seems less tolerant of executives who depart from the script. Sure, the stereotype of the hardhearted,   executive persists. But Mr. Redstone\u2019s eccentricities  \u2014   he once boasted that he shaved poolside in the nude  \u2014   and the recent disclosure of his sexual exploits seem out of step with the airbrushed culture of   Los Angeles. \u201cSumner is caught in a time warp,\u201d Mr. Bart said. The legal fracas has changed Mr. Redstone\u2019s public image from a firebrand whose business acumen and ruthlessness won him control of Viacom, Paramount Pictures and CBS, a $40 billion empire, into something quite different. In the local parlance, he lost the plot. The hubris that precedes a fall was evident in 2009, when he told Larry King, \u201cI have no intention of ever retiring or of dying,\u201d and once again in 2014, when Mr. Redstone told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cI\u2019m not going to die. \u201d Recent press attention has deflated such boasts. And secrets Mr. Redstone might have taken to the grave he reserved for himself in Massachusetts, where he was born in 1923, became the stuff of Internet chatter when Ms. Herzer  \u2014   whom he banished from his Beverly Park home last year  \u2014   filed suit. \u201cThis is all very Shakespearean, with the family, all the people taking over the kingdom,\u201d said Michael Medavoy, a producer who knows Mr. Redstone. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. But my question is, is it a tragic comedy or is it a tragic drama?\u201d After Judge David J. Cowan of Los Angeles County Superior Court tossed the case last Monday, Ms. Herzer filed a new lawsuit against Ms. Redstone. There is talk that Mr. Redstone\u2019s lawyers may pursue a suit, too, meaning the situation could drag on. Mr. Redstone has long been known for his volatility. Across the decades, he has collected enemies the way residents in nearby Malibu pick up sea glass along Carbon Beach. The executives he has crossed include Tom Freston, David Geffen, Mel Karmazin and Barry Diller. In 2006, he split with Tom Cruise over the actor\u2019s erratic behavior and stumping for Scientology, ending Mr. Cruise\u2019s production deal at Paramount. (The star got some measure of revenge with his caustic,    portrayal of a character said to be based on Mr. Redstone in the Hollywood satire \u201cTropic Thunder. \u201d) \u201cHe was a   man,\u201d Mr. Medavoy said. \u201cBut those guys can be difficult. You have to look at it all in context. The great scions of industry, the guys who made a zillion dollars, are tough guys. Those folks don\u2019t make a lot of friends. \u201d On a recent evening, Christine Peters was nursing a Moscow mule in the Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, Calif. Ms. Peters, a movie producer, dated Mr. Redstone in the late 1990s and remained friends after he moved to the Beverly Park mansion in 2003. She said she had not seen the   tycoon in two years. Despite his position, Mr. Redstone was not a creature of the scene, she said. He avoided galas and opening nights, preferring intimate dinners at Dan Tana\u2019s, the dimly lit,   Italian place on Santa Monica Boulevard with   booths, waiters in black bow ties and bartenders in red   jackets. If she arrived late for a meal, Ms. Peters said, she would find him alone and impatient, drumming his fingers on the table. Mr. Redstone, who was badly burned in a 1979 hotel fire in Boston, did not like to show weakness, Ms. Peters said, and his closest personal relationships seemed transactional, rooted in business. But his devotion to his empire seems to not have given him much protection against hits taken in the recent imbroglio. \u201cHe would rather be broke than humiliated and publicly embarrassed, his dignity lost,\u201d Ms. Peters said. \u201cCalling him a \u2018living ghost\u2019 is the most hurtful, saying he could not make lucid decisions. That\u2019s where the knife hits hardest for him. \u201d She added that he regarded as his only worthy rival Rupert Murdoch, the    media king who recently married the former supermodel Jerry Hall. A small crowd gathered at the Vibrato Grill Jazz club here in the Bel Air neighborhood at 6 p. m. for Mr. Redstone\u2019s 92nd birthday celebration a year ago. It was one of his last public appearances. The guests included top executives in his employ, including Leslie Moonves of CBS, Philippe Dauman of Viacom, as well as Brad Grey of Paramount. Tony Bennett serenaded him with his 1962 hit, \u201cI Left My Heart in San Francisco. \u201d A figurine on the birthday cake was particularly telling. It depicted Mr. Redstone as a corporate titan in a suit and red tie, phone in one hand, television remote in the other. Next to the miniature Mr. Redstone on top of the cake was a tiny stock ticker that showed the prices of six major media companies, including Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone sat flanked by his caretaker at the time, Ms. Herzer, and his lover, Sydney Holland, who lived at his estate and has figured into his recent convoluted legal troubles. Mr. Redstone reportedly gave Ms. Holland some $70 million in cash and gifts before kicking her out of his house in the days before he turned on Ms. Herzer. At the party, both women wore evening dresses. The details of the tycoon\u2019s private life probably would not have come to light if Mr. Redstone\u2019s two paramours had not participated in a Vanity Fair profile of him in the June 2015 issue. Ms. Herzer was photographed for the article in a shimmering,   gown. Ms. Holland\u2019s glamour shot showed her on a chaise lounge in Pasadena, Calif. Both gushed about the riches their benefactor had bestowed upon them, which did not sit well with Shari Redstone and a former convict named George Pilgrim, who was dating Ms. Holland at the time. Mr. Redstone\u2019s hostile manner of conducting business and his tendency to go it alone may have also contributed to his   predicament. In a town where business relationships and genuine friendships are often one and the same, his story has become a cautionary tale. \u201cMore than one person has said to me, \u2018I don\u2019t want to end up alone, at home and angry,\u2019\u201d said Janice Min, who oversees content for Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a    approach. Now, executives drive their kids to school. \u201d On May 6, an   videotaped deposition of Mr. Redstone\u2019s testimony, shot a day earlier, was played in the courtroom so that the judge could make a determination on whether the media tycoon was mentally fit. Despite his speech difficulties, the nonagenarian used foul language to express his contempt for Ms. Herzer. \u201cI hate her,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI want Manuela out of my life. \u201d For many who read the transcript, it was classic Sumner. \u201cHe was no more likable a person in old age,\u201d Ms. Min said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t softened into a grandfatherly figure. \u201d Further, she added: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a quiet goodbye. He is a ruthless negotiator to the end. \u201d At the Urth Caff\u00e9 on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood on yet another cloudless morning, the patio was crowded with   huddled over bowls of coffee and plates of coconut cake. They were buzzing about their new   or the latest Hulu series. For this generation, a   macher like Mr. Redstone seems as alien as the original Hollywood bosses who built the world\u2019s most glamorous business on this   outpost. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously very wealthy and influential,\u201d said Eric Dahan, a    chief executive of InstaBrand, a   that connects brands with influencers on Instagram. \u201cBut I\u2019m not too familiar with the case, and I don\u2019t think a lot of my generation are. \u201d He called Mr. Redstone an \u201cicon,\u201d but confessed that he and others his age were focused on another businessman lately in the news. \u201cPeople in my social circle care more about Donald Trump and whether he will become president,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563184.6963022}
