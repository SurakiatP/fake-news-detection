[The Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, has partnered with George Soros\u2019s Open Society on numerous projects and has given grants to third parties using the   Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to   causes in the U. S.  The Omidyar Network is also a prominent donor to the International   Network, the project of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies that is helping Facebook to determine whether a certain story is \u201cdisputed. \u201d Poynter\u2019s IFCN is also funded by Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, as well as by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy. In March, the Omidyar Network also provided the   League (ADL) whose chief has baselessly smeared Breitbart News with claims of   associations, with a   seed donation to build a Silicon Valley command center purportedly aimed at combating online hate. Ossoff serves as managing director and CEO of the   Insight TWI (The World Investigates) which describes itself as producing \u201c  documentary films and television programmes, specializing in fresh, daring factual content and   journalism. \u201d Continues a company description: \u201cInsight\u2019s   Peabody, and BAFTA   team has decades of experience working safely in   environments and a focus on immersive storytelling that makes the important interesting. \u201d The company\u2019s leaders produced \u201cBlood on the Stone,\u201d a documentary that accompanied the DVD for the   \u201cBlood Diamond\u201d movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Insight TWI collaborated with with Al Jazeera English to produce an \u201cAfrica Investigates\u201d series. In 2014, the Omidyar Network provided Ossoff\u2019s Insight TWI with a $350, 000 investment, listing Ossoff specifically on the award announcement posted on Omidyar\u2019s website. Regarding the Facebook   project, the   International   Network recently drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook announced it will work with \u201c  fact checking organizations\u201d that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the \u201cfact checking organizations\u201d determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, \u201cthere will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. \u201d Omidyar also provided the seed capital for the ADL\u2019s new Silicon Valley command center reportedly aimed at combatting online hate. According to the ADL\u2019s press release announcing the Omidyar grant, the ADL will work with tech sector leaders to look into   options for reducing \u201conline harassment,\u201d including \u201cartificial intelligence, big data,   reality, and other technologies. \u201d Ossoff, a former aide to Rep. Hank Johnson ( ) was widely touted by major progressive groups for his attempt to win a House race in Atlanta\u2019s conservative suburbs. The Democratic Party excitement surrounding Ossoff\u2019s bid led the Drudge Report to label him the \u201cDem Trump slayer\u201d in a banner headline. Drudge later mockingly crossed out the words \u201cDem Trump slayer\u201d as Ossoff\u2019s chances for victory seemed to have faded. The Washington Post reported on the latest results of Ossoff\u2019s bid: Unofficial returns showed that Ossoff had earned less than 50 percent of the vote, the threshold needed to declare an outright victory. Instead, with 48. 3 percent, Ossoff was headed to a runoff against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and the top GOP   in a special election to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District. In a statement early Wednesday, Ossoff acknowledged that he had fallen short: \u201cThis is already a remarkable victory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
