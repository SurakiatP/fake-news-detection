[The meeting, which will involve both House and Senate Democrats, is scheduled for 9:30 am on Wednesday on Capitol Hill and is expected to last one hour.  Throughout the presidential campaign,   Donald Trump repeatedly claimed he would repeal and replace Obamacare, although has since confirmed that he would like to maintain some aspects of the program. Republicans, who will retain a majority in both the House and Senate, are expected to vote to repeal the healthcare law in the very early stages of Trump\u2019s presidency, although they have yet to outline a replacement plan. In light of Trump\u2019s plans, various Democrat leaders, including Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi, have called for a \u201cday of action\u201d. \u201cRallies will be held across the country to vigorously oppose the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it and throw our health care system into chaos,\u201d a letter signed by a number of Democratic Party leaders states. Donald Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of Health, Georgia Congressman Tom Price, is a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act. In October, he described the program as \u201cnear total collapse,\u201d adding that Republicans were putting forward \u201ca bold vision to bring America\u2019s healthcare system into the 21st century. \u201d You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742628449.9267323}
