Steve Scalise ( ) in critical condition. Levin said about the rise in violence on the left: The language is violent, the conduct is violent, and that it is getting increasingly more dangerous. Now, of course, the point is that you have kooks out there. You have people who are on the edge. When you dumb down or mainstream violence, these people become violent and they act out. Breitbart News compiled a list of 15 episodes of leftwing celebrities envisioning violence against President Donald Trump, including comedian Kathy Griffin\u2019s shock \u201cbeheading\u201d photo of the president, Madonna\u2019s statement that she has \u201cthought a lot about blowing up the White House,\u201d Joss Whedon\u2019s tweet that he wants a \u201cRhino to F*ck Paul Ryan to Death,\u201d and Shakespeare in the Park\u2019s stabbing \u201cTrump\u201d to death during a performance of Julius Caesar.

The host showed video of violent leftwing protests, including one in November in which Los Angeles protesters burned Trump in effigy as they shouted, \u201cNot my president. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of that happening with Obama, or Bill Clinton,\u201d he added, asserting the left\u2019s use of violent rhetoric and its insinuations and threats of violence are \u201cbeyond the pale. \u201d Levin likened the kind of violence coming from the left now to that during the 1960s, and referred to it as \u201c . \u201d \u201cWhen Barack Obama\u2019s buddies Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn  \u2014   people like that  \u2014   these underground movements that poisoned our universities and so forth took place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll notice they\u2019re violent, they\u2019re   they\u2019re  .
