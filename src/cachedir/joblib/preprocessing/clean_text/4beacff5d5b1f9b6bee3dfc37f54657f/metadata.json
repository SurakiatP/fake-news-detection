It all stems from an alleged affair Bill Clinton had with a black Arkansas prostitute, which produced a son. Now, after years of trying to find out the truth about his biological father, the rumored son\u2019s cause is being taken up by a black rapper, and they have a really bad surprise for Hillary. Rapper \u201cFreenauts\u201d wears \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d t-shirt while performing rap song \u201cJustice For Danney Williams\u201d \\nThe BLM rapper \u201cFreenauts,\u201d wearing a \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d t-shirt, put out a video, performing his rap song \u201cJustice for Danney Williams,\u201d referring to Bill Clinton\u2019s alleged lovechild. The video has just over 100,000 views, but now that it is the last week before the election, Donald Trump supporters, as well as Black Lives Matter supporters, are posting it all over social media. \\nThe plight of Arkansas resident Danney Williams has been around for years, and in the past, Hillary\u2019s henchmen put out disinformation to the press to make it seem as if Williams claims had been proven false. \\nIn fact, Danney Williams has never had a DNA test, and many in the media are now realizing that not only does Williams resemble Clinton but his story rings true. Up until Bill Clinton became president, Williams recalls with great detail the Christmas presents Arkansas troopers would bring to his house from then-Governor Bill Clinton. Growing up, Williams was told by his mother and even his teachers that he was Bill Clinton\u2019s son.

Unfortunately for her, it looks like that may happen after WND made this announcement from Williams: \\nDanney Williams, the man from Little Rock, Arkansas, who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black illegitimate son of former President Bill Clinton, will hold a press conference Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to make an announcement his supporters characterize as a \u201cbombshell that will rock Hillary\u2019s campaign.\u201d \\nOn October 19, WND reported that lawyers representing Williams, in the hours before the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas, announced their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. \\nIt looks like Hillary may be in for a drop in support by African-Americans after Williams describes her as the mean woman who chased his mother away from the Governor\u2019s mansion when he was only a few years old. It may be a day of reckoning for Hillary as everything that can go wrong is all happening at once, and we couldn\u2019t be happier. May Hillary get everything she deserves and then some.'"}, "time": 1742561737.4382453}
