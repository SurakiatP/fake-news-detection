Ms. Vestager announced on Thursday a new round of antitrust charges against the company  \u2014   the third set since early 2015  \u2014   claiming that some of the company\u2019s advertising products had restricted consumer choice. The efforts are part of her continuing  push to rein in Google\u2019s activities in the European Union, where the Silicon Valley company has captured roughly 90 percent of the region\u2019s online search market. \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct, based on our evidence, is harmful to consumers,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. \u201cGoogle\u2019s magnificent innovations don\u2019t give it the right to deny competitors the chance to innovate. \u201d The announcement represents a setback for Google, which vigorously denied any wrongdoing in two previous European antitrust charges linked to Android, its popular mobile operating system, and some of its dominant online search services. It also comes at a difficult time for Europe\u2019s competition authorities, which have been unable to land a knockout punch against Google\u2019s perceived abusive activities in the region, despite investigations that date back to 2010. The stakes are high. Google could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe\u2019s tough competition rules. For months, both sides have been jockeying for position, with Google already filing lengthy legal arguments about why it believes its European activities are lawful. Ms. Vestager\u2019s antitrust charges are just one of a number of regulatory challenges to Google\u2019s activities in Europe, ranging from tax investigations in France and Spain to concerns that Google does not fully protect people\u2019s online privacy rights. The company denies any wrongdoing. Other Silicon Valley technology companies, including Amazon, Apple and Facebook, have also faced regulatory investigations in Europe, raising questions over whether the region\u2019s lawmakers are specifically focusing on these American giants, which have come to dominate much of the digital world. European officials deny any such bias. Google said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide a detailed response to Europe\u2019s latest charges, but it added, \u201cWe believe our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for E. U. consumers and promote competition. \u201d The company has until the fall to respond. American competition officials have also reviewed claims that Google abused its market position to favor its services over those of rivals, though the Federal Trade Commission has yet to find any violations. Europe\u2019s new antitrust charges represent a further ratcheting up of the region\u2019s often frosty relationship with Google. In particular, European antitrust officials are taking aim at some of the company\u2019s online advertising tools  \u2014   the main engine for Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue. They say that the company may have abused its dominant market position when offering some of its search products on   companies\u2019 websites. These businesses  \u2014   including publishers and online retailers  \u2014   can use Google\u2019s search engine on their sites so that people can find information like newspaper articles or promotions. Such agreements with   companies, which date to 2006, also include showing   advertising next to search results, often provided by Google. Ms. Vestager said on Thursday that the technology company may have abused its dominance  \u2014   it holds roughly an 80 percent market share in this type of niche   search  \u2014   by forcing companies to sign onerous contracts that limited competition and reduced consumer choice. Since 2009, Google has made it easier for advertising rivals to show their offerings alongside its services. But Europe\u2019s competition chief said that Google still required   companies to show a minimum number of   ads on their site. The Silicon Valley company also requires businesses using the service to ask for approval on where some rivals\u2019 ads may be shown on their websites. \u201cAll these restrictions allowed Google to protect its market share and stifle competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said. Europe\u2019s antitrust authorities have also doubled down on a previous competition charge, announced last year, which claimed that Google had diverted traffic from competitors in favor of its own   site. On Thursday, Ms. Vestager said her team had found new evidence to buttress their claims, adding that because of Google\u2019s actions, European consumers may not have access to the most relevant search results when looking online for goods and services. Yet when asked about the failure of European antitrust authorities to order fines or changes to the way Google does business, despite several years of investigations, Ms. Vestager said she aimed to ensure the charges against the company stood up in European courts. \u201cSpeed is of the essence,\u201d but \u201cthe other side of that coin is quality,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Thursday. \u201cSometimes that kind of quality comes at the cost of speed. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563524.26595}
