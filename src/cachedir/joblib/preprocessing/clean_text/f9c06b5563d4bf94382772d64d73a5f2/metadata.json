The survey showed 47 percent of likely US voters backed Clinton while 43 percent said they supported Trump. \\nThe Clinton campaign received a late break with FBI Director James Comey announcing Sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of Clinton\u2019s newly-found emails. \\n\u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,\u201d the FBI chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen. \\nThe development is a major relief to Clinton, who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close Trump\u2019s path to presidency.

She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know,\u201d he said Sunday at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.\u201d \\nBoth Clinton and Trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of Tuesday\u2019s election. \\nTrump will visit Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire and finish the day with a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \\nClinton is travelling to Pennsylvania and Michigan before closing with a midnight-rally in Raleigh, North Carolina.'"}, "time": 1742564298.9570665}
