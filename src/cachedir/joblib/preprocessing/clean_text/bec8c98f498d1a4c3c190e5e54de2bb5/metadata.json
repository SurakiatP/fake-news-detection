Some entrepreneurs have made it work (or are trying) with quirky products whether earnest (like the Star of David tree topper) or mildly subversive (like the Santa Claus yarmulke or a   bong). Some purveyors of these seasonal products, like Neal Hoffman, never expected to be in the Hanukkah business. Mr. Hoffman was shopping in a Nordstrom in 2012 when his son ran up to him holding an Elf on the Shelf, the popular Christmas toy. That turned out to be both complicated and fortuitous: complicated, because Mr. Hoffman is Jewish, his wife is Catholic, and they had decided to raise their children Jewish. And fortuitous because of what happened next. \u201cI was like, \u2018Dude, you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who previously had worked at Hasbro, the toy giant. \u201c\u2018You can have a\u2019  \u2014   and I was like, what would be Jewish I could rhyme with?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get you a Mensch on a Bench. \u2019\u201d After raising more than $22, 000 on Kickstarter, Mr. Hoffman produced his first run of Mensch on a Bench dolls for the next holiday season, and he has been selling them ever since. They come with a storybook that situates the bearded character, who wears a black hat and a Jewish prayer shawl, in the Hanukkah story: He watches over the oil in the Maccabees\u2019 temple to ensure it burns for eight days. \u201cElf on a Shelf is a great product,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cBut they just left the Jewish market sitting there saying: \u2018What about us? What about our kids? \u2019\u201d That first year, 2013, sales of Mensch on a Bench, which retails for $30, reached about $100, 000, mostly through Mr. Hoffman\u2019s own website. In 2014, Bed Bath  Beyond picked up the product and Mr. Hoffman appeared on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d and sales climbed to $900, 000. Revenues were $800, 000 last year and will be about the same this year  \u2014   which suits Mr. Hoffman, who works out of his home and enjoys the lifestyle of a niche product entrepreneur. \u201cWe pull in a   profit, I get to do something I love, and I work maybe 20 hours a week during most of the year,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who this season introduced a plush talking toy, Ask Bubbe. Amy Kritzer, who with her brother Andrew owns Modern Tribe, an online Judaica store with an offbeat edge, said that Hanukkah accounted for about 40 percent of annual revenue. Popular this year is the Emoji Menorah from Rite Lite ($30) with each candle base wearing a different expression, and the Jewdolph Knit Koozie ($12) a bottle sleeve with a   reindeer whose antlers form a menorah, from Freakers. Also on the website is the Yamaclaus, a fluffy    Santa Claus hat in the shape of a yarmulke. Alan Masarsky started Yamaclaus with his boyfriend, Larik Malish. Both grew up in interfaith homes, and both were fans of the 2003 episode of \u201cThe OC\u201d that popularized the term \u201cChrismukkah,\u201d a portmanteau for a merged Christmas and Hanukkah celebration. On the episode, characters wore what they called a yamaclaus. The couple had no inkling of starting a business when, in 2011, they hosted a holiday party and made their guests a crude version of the beanies out of red construction paper and cotton balls. They were a hit, so they checked to see if the trademark for Yamaclaus was available (it was) and if they could raise $2, 500 on Kickstarter to start production (they did). In 2013, Yamaclaus ($11) began selling on the company\u2019s website, which today accounts for about 70 percent of sales. Mr. Masarsky, a marketing manager at Facebook who lives in San Francisco, said    sales had increased 200 percent this year, as it had the previous two, but declined to provide more financial details. Yamaclaus wearers who post photos on social media tend to be in nonreligious settings. \u201cTons of our customers wear them when they\u2019re lighting a menorah,\u201d Mr. Masarsky said. \u201cBut not at shul  \u2014   not at a synagogue. \u201d Michael Krasny, author of \u201cLet There Be Laughter,\u201d a book about Jewish humor, said many jokes make light of Jews\u2019 \u201canxiety of being assimilated and turning into Christians. \u201d Products that intertwine Christian and Jewish culture may be a positive force, he said. \u201cThey can have it both ways,\u201d Mr. Krasny said. \u201cWe can call it an homage to Christians at the same time as it\u2019s bringing to the fore something that\u2019s associated with Jewishness. \u201d Interfaith households are on the rise. From 2005 to 2013, 58 percent of Jews who wed married gentiles (usually Christians) compared with 35 percent who did so from 1970 to 1974, according to the Pew Research Center. Morri Chowaiki grew up in a Jewish home his wife, Marina, grew up in an interfaith one. \u201cShe always wanted a Christmas tree, and I was like, no way,\u201d said Mr. Chowaiki, who in 2005, after they were married about a decade, relented. \u201cI said, \u2018All right, just don\u2019t go crazy  \u2014   if I walk into the front room and there\u2019s a nativity scene there, I might have a little issue with it. \u2019\u201d Ms. Chowaiki bought and decorated a tree, then unveiled it. And her husband was impressed  \u2014   it was festooned with dreidels and blue and silver ornaments. But at the top of the tree: a   star. \u201cI laughed and said, \u2018You couldn\u2019t at least find a Jewish star to put at the top of the tree? \u2019\u201d Mr. Chowaiki said. She told him she had looked  \u2014   and found nothing. By 2009, he had designed and trademarked one, the Hanukkah Tree Topper, and sold about 2, 000. By 2013, the product had been picked up by retailers including Bed Bath  Beyond and SkyMall and sold 35, 000 units  \u2014   and earned Mr. Chowaiki a spot on \u201cShark Tank. \u201d On that episode, Daymond John, the investor who founded FUBU, purchased a 35 percent stake in the business for $50, 000, and Mr. Chowaiki agreed to license out the product to Kurt S. Adler, a wholesaler that specializes in holiday items. There are now several versions of the product available online, starting at about $12. Once the tree topper was licensed, Mr. Chowaiki ceased to be involved in    operations. And in April, Mr. John hired him to head the sales and retail division of his company, the Shark Group. The Menorah Tree grew out of a similar marital dynamic: Michael Patchen, who is Jewish, wanted something festive to suit his wife, Jenny, who is half Catholic and half Jewish. In 2006, Mr. Patchen and his brother, Alex, made a menorah out of wood and artificial pine garland, decorated it with ornaments and lights, and surprised her with it. Now they sell a metal version that is seven feet high, assembles like an artificial tree and sells for $295 on their website. They\u2019ve sold in the \u201clow to  \u201d since introducing the product in 2013, said Alex Patchen, who declined to be more specific. In 2012, David Daily had an idea for how to make the Hanukkah party he and his wife were hosting in Austin, Tex. memorable: a menorah bong. Mr. Daily, who owns Grav Labs, a glass bong and pipe manufacturer in Austin with annual sales of $12 million, made the bong himself. It was about two feet long and had eight bowls with stems that could hold candles. \u201cI definitely had a Jewish experience growing up of enjoying cannabis with all my cousins,\u201d Mr. Daily said. \u201cAnd this menorah bong obviously is meant to be shared. \u201d Their guests were, in every sense, bowled over, but Mr. Daily never planned on marketing the menorah bong. It sat on a shelf in his home for a couple of years. Then an online head shop, 420 Science, borrowed it and made a video of it in action. It garnered about two million views on Facebook and YouTube and has been shared on social media about 100, 000 times. Grav recently produced 100 menorah bongs. At 14 inches, they are less cumbersome than the original. They cost $700 from retailers including 420 Science. But Dr. Dreidel may not be widely available until next Hanukkah. Hannah Rothstein, a conceptual artist, conceived of the dreidel in 2014 and has made fewer than a hundred of the wooden tops on a commission basis, charging $150. The dreidel features images of Dr. Dre, the rapper and record producer, and a   version will retail for about $40  \u2014   barring complications. \u201cI have not gotten any    letters from Dr. Dre\u2019s lawyers,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said. \u201cAnd if he wants to go in on the idea, we could make a million together. \u201d Next year she also hopes to produce a Hanukkah homage to Macklemore, another   artist: the  .'"}, "time": 1742562473.670431}
