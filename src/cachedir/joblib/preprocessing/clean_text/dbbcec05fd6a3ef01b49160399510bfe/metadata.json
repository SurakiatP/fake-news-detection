That tells you all you need to know,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. \u201cThey\u2019re against integration, immigration. This is standard white supremacist stuff. \u201d The group, which grew out of a social media meme, argues that white Americans are victims of a genocide caused by factors like the immigration of nonwhite people and marriage between white Christians and nonwhites or Jews, Ms. Beirich said. The law center\u2019s designation is meant to draw attention to and increase scrutiny of the group\u2019s activities. Last week, its members held a protest outside the Houston office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to demand that it denounce Black Lives Matter, according to video posted online by the group. The Houston Chronicle reported that some of the protesters carried assault rifles and Confederate flags. Researchers with the law center said White Lives Matter had been promoted by the Aryan Renaissance Society, a group in Texas that is a member of the United Aryan Front, a white nationalist coalition. Ms. Beirich said the center\u2019s designation focused on one chapter of the group based in Nashville that is led by Rebecca Barnette, a leader of the Aryan Strikeforce, a skinhead group, and the National Socialist Movement, America\u2019s largest   group. Ms. Barnette did not respond to an email seeking comment on Monday, but White Lives Matter posted several videos criticizing the Southern Poverty Law Center to its YouTube channel in the past two days. One video described White Lives Matter\u2019s members as \u201cjust the guy next door. \u201d Ms. Beirich said the number of white supremacist groups in the United States had grown in the past year and attributed that to the racially charged rhetoric of the presidential campaign. There are 892 active hate groups in the country, the law center said. \u201cCertainly we\u2019ve got people who are much more energized in a way that didn\u2019t exist before, and that\u2019s all because of the presidential campaign,\u201d Ms. Beirich said before specifying Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee \u201cTrump has given these people hope they didn\u2019t have before that they could influence politics or that they would at least be listened to. \u201d Ms. Barnette described herself as White Lives Matter\u2019s   in her profile on Vk. com, a Russian social networking site preferred by white nationalists for its lenient approach to posts that contain racist content. She said the group\u2019s name had \u201cbeen picked up by several other groups who are doing their own things with it. \u201d Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the   League, agreed that the phrase had spread beyond the group. \u201cWhite Lives Matter is a concept around which you can organize an event without necessarily being a formal organization,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is essentially the sum of the number of people who have done actions in the name of White Lives Matter. \u201d \u201cFor white supremacists, \u2018White Lives Matter\u2019 is an obvious meme, so they will use it,\u201d he said. On Vk. com, Ms. Barnette defended the group, writing that its members were unfairly labeled \u201ddomestic terrorists. \u201d In other posts she argued that white women represent \u201cthe elite of the human species. \u201d She also shared Nazi memes and frequently used racist,   and homophobic slurs. \u201cWe do not live by the code of the nonwhites,\u201d she wrote in one post calling for her followers to take action against the federal government, Jews and  . \u201cOur forefathers built the nation that is being allowed to be destroyed. \u201d Later she added, \u201cI wish Hitler were here alive and well today. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562409.2958093}
