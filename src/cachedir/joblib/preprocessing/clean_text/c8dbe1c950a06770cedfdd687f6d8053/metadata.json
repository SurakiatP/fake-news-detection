We\u2019ve got the Trump University fraud case, we probably have criminal charges coming out of his charitable donation. We\u2019ve got all of the Russian ties we don\u2019t know much about. He\u2019s got so many legal problems, I suspect he\u2019ll spend the next few years huddled with his lawyers.\u201d \\nSo, what does Gladwell think will happen when Hillary is elected? \\n\u201cRepublicans in Congress will start an investigation of her on day one, which will only end when she leaves office four years later. The forecast for the next four years is just stalemate. Their hatred will not be satiated by a Hillary Clinton victory, it will be enhanced. For twenty years they have been coming after this woman and they\u2019re gonna keep coming after her.\u201d Adding, \u201cIt will result in some kind of political paralysis for sure.\u201d \\nGladwell does not paint a very inspiring picture of a Clinton win, for sure, but it is better than the alternative. We all know Trump belongs in jail, but he can\u2019t be allowed to bring the entire nation down with him. In short, get your ass out and vote! \\nAlso, watch the full CBC interview where Gladwell discusses sexism, elitism, racism and the baffling media obsession with Hillary\u2019s emails: \\nFeatured image via video screengrab Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562210.2408173}
