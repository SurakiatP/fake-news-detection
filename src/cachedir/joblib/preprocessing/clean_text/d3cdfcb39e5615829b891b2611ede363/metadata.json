You dare to hopeThat someday soon you reach beyond your skyTo Something else. Not other worlds , this be your cry,Not other races who may think and hope and fear.What, then? Mere planets made of things you hold as dear,That may be broken down and labeled fast?Such fools you be!Dream on, the day has not yet come to passWhen you will face that which you cannot face.-Automatic writing channeled by Nell Heberling Page 1'"}, "time": 1742562338.932409}
