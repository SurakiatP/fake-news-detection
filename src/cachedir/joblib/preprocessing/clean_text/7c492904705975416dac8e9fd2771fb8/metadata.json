Earlier this week, a tweet from the account of Texas\u2019s agriculture commissioner , a Trump adviser, took the name-calling a step further, using a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to Clinton. \\nIn Prince William County, the offending electronic sign was one that had been placed in the commuter lot about a month ago by the county elections office. It was programmed to broadcast a message encouraging early voting for those who cannot make it to the polls on Tuesday. \\nThere are about 10 such signs posted in heavily trafficked areas across Prince William County, a relative Republican stronghold in the Washington area. The Board of County Supervisors is chaired by Corey Stewart (R), a high-profile cheerleader for Trump who co-chaired the GOP nominee\u2019s Virginia campaign until a dispute last month led to his ouster . \\nElection officials in the county, which also has a fast-growing Latino population, are taking special measures this year to speed voting and minimize potential disruptions at the polls. \\nOn Wednesday, officials said the tampered-with sign equipment had not been locked, giving whoever changed the message easy access to a keyboard panel inside. \u201cThere\u2019s a set of instructions next to the panel,\u201d said Winston Forrest, a spokesman for the county elections office. \u201cAnyone who could get access to it could make the change.\u201d \\nAfter the errant message was reported, it was turned off and the equipment was removed, according the county police. \\nCounty elections officials said they have placed locks on the remaining voting road signs in the county. \u201cThere are no more of these types of messages,\u201d Forrest said. \\nRead the rest of the story here . \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562177.6348298}
