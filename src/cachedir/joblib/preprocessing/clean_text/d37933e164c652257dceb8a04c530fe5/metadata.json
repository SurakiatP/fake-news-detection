It\u2019s a Darwinian,      world where greed is good, insults are the lingua franca, and winning is everything (or, in tangled Trumpian syntax, \u201cIt\u2019s not whether you win or lose, but whether you win! \u201d). To read a stack of new and reissued books about Mr. Trump, as well as a bunch of his own works, is to be plunged into a kind of Bizarro World version of Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno,\u201d where arrogance, acquisitiveness and the sowing of discord are not sins, but attributes of leadership a place where lies, contradictions and outrageous remarks spring up in such thickets that the sort of moral exhaustion associated with bad soap operas quickly threatens to ensue. That the subject of these books is not a fictional character but the Republican nominee for president can only remind the reader of Philip Roth\u2019s observation, made more than 50 years ago, that American reality is so stupefying, \u201cso weird and astonishing,\u201d that it poses an embarrassment to the novelist\u2019s \u201cmeager imagination. \u201d Books about Mr. Trump tend to fall into two categories. There are funny ones that focus on Trump the Celebrity of the 1980s and \u201990s  \u2014   a cartoony avatar of greed and wretched excess and what Garry Trudeau (\u201cYuge! 30 Years of Doonesbury on Trump\u201d) calls \u201cbig, honking hubris. \u201d And there are serious biographies that try to shed light on Mr. Trump\u2019s life and complex, highly opaque business dealings as a real estate magnate, which are vital to understanding the judgment,   abilities and financial entanglements he would bring to the Oval Office. Because of Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of transparency surrounding his business interests (he has even declined to disclose his tax returns) and because of his loose handling of facts and love of hyperbole, serious books are obligated to spend a lot of time sifting through business and court documents. (USA Today recently reported that there are \u201cabout 3, 500 legal actions involving Trump, including 1, 900 where he or his companies were a plaintiff and about 1, 300 in which he was the defendant. \u201d) And they must also   his assertions (PolitiFact rates 35 percent of his statements False, and 18 percent \u201cPants on Fire\u201d Lies). Perhaps because they were written rapidly as Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy gained traction, the latest of these books rarely step back to analyze in detail the larger implications and repercussions of the Trump phenomenon. Nor do they really map the landscape in which he has risen to popularity and is himself reshaping through his carelessness with facts, polarizing remarks and disregard for political rules. For that matter, these books shed little new light on controversial stands taken by Mr. Trump which, many legal scholars and historians note, threaten constitutional guarantees and American democratic traditions. Those include his call for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d and the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants his talk of revising libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations over critical coverage an   attack on a federal judge that raises questions about his commitment to an independent judiciary and his incendiary use of nativist and bigoted language that is fueling racial tensions and helping to mainstream   views on race. Some of these books touch fleetingly on Mr. Trump\u2019s use of inflammatory language and emotional appeal to feelings of fear and anger, but they do not delve deeply into the consequences of his nativist rhetoric or his contempt for the rules of civil discourse. They do, however, provide some sense of history, reminding us that while Mr. Trump\u2019s craving for attention and use of controversy as an instrument of publicity have remained the same over the years, the surreal switch of venues  \u2014   from the New York tabloid universe and the world of reality TV to the   arena of national and global politics  \u2014   has turned formerly \u201c  stakes,\u201d as one writer put it, into something profoundly more troubling. From   insults aimed at fellow celebrities, Mr. Trump now denigrates whole racial and religious groups and questions the legitimacy of the electoral system. A \u201c  buffoon\u201d in Manhattan in the waning decades of the 20th century  \u2014   as the editor of The New Yorker, David Remnick, terms the businessman in a foreword to Mark Singer\u2019s book \u201cTrump and Me\u201d  \u2014   has metamorphosed into a political candidate whom 50 senior Republican national security officials recently said \u201cwould be the most reckless president in American history,\u201d putting \u201cat risk our country\u2019s national security and well being. \u201d Two new books provide useful, vigorously reported overviews of Mr. Trump\u2019s life and career. \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher of The Washington Post, draws heavily on work by reporters of The Post and more than 20 hours of interviews with the candidate. Much of its material will be familiar to readers  \u2014   thanks to newspaper articles and Michael D\u2019Antonio\u2019s 2015 biography (\u201cNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\u201d)  \u2014   but \u201cTrump Revealed\u201d deftly charts his   building of his gaudy brand and his often masterful manipulation of the media. It provides a succinct account of Mr. Trump\u2019s childhood, when he says he punched a teacher, giving him a black eye. It also recounts his apprenticeship to a demanding father, who told him he needed to become a \u201ckiller\u201d in anything he did, and how he learned the art of the counterattack from Roy Cohn, Joseph McCarthy\u2019s former   man, whom Mr. Trump hired to countersue the federal government after the Justice Department brought a case against the Trump family firm in 1973 for violating the Fair Housing Act. \u201cThe Making of Donald Trump\u201d by David Cay Johnston  \u2014   a former reporter for The New York Times who has written extensively about Mr. Trump  \u2014   zeros in on Mr. Trump\u2019s business practices, arguing that while he presents himself as \u201ca modern Midas,\u201d much \u201cof what he touches\u201d has often turned \u201cto dross. \u201d Mr. Johnston, who has followed the real estate impresario for nearly three decades, offers a searing indictment of his business practices and creative accounting. He examines Mr. Trump\u2019s taste for debt, what associates have described as his startling capacity for recklessness, multiple corporate bankruptcies, dealings with reputed mobsters and accusations of fraud. The portrait of Mr. Trump that emerges from these books, old or new, serious or satirical, is remarkably consistent: a   narcissist, almost comically   a \u201chyperbole addict who prevaricates for fun and profit,\u201d as Mr. Singer wrote in The New Yorker in 1997. Mr. Singer also describes Mr. Trump as an \u201cinsatiable publicity hound who courts the press on a daily basis and, when he doesn\u2019t like what he reads, attacks the messengers as \u2018human garbage,\u2019\u201d \u201ca fellow both slippery and na\u00efve, artfully calculating and recklessly heedless of consequences. \u201d At the same time, Mr. Singer and other writers discern an emptiness underneath the   armor. In \u201cTrump and Me,\u201d Mr. Singer describes his subject as a man \u201cwho had aspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul. \u201d Mr. Kranish and Mr. Fisher likewise suggest that Mr. Trump \u201chad walled off\u201d any pain he experienced growing up and \u201chid it behind a   show about himself. \u201d When they ask him about friends, they write, he gives them  \u2014   off the record  \u2014   the names of three men \u201che had had business dealings with two or more decades before, men he had only rarely seen in recent years. \u201d Mr. Trump likes to boast about going it alone  \u2014   an impulse that helps explain the rapid turnover among advisers in his campaign, and that has raised serious concerns among national security experts and foreign policy observers, who note that his extreme   and certainty (\u201cI\u2019m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain\u201d) come coupled with a startling ignorance about global affairs and an impatience with policy and details. Passages in his books help illuminate Mr. Trump\u2019s admiration for the strongman style of autocratic leaders like Russia\u2019s Vladimir V. Putin, and his own astonishing \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d moment during his Republican convention speech. In his 2004 book, \u201cThink Like a Billionaire,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cYou must plan and execute your plan alone. \u201d He also advised: \u201cHave a short attention span,\u201d adding \u201cquite often, I\u2019ll be talking to someone and I\u2019ll know what they\u2019re going to say before they say it. After the first three words are out of their mouth, I can tell what the next 40 are going to be, so I try to pick up the pace and move it along. You can get more done faster that way. \u201d In many respects, Mr. Trump\u2019s own quotes and writings provide the most vivid and alarming picture of his values, modus operandi and relentlessly dark outlook focused on revenge. \u201cBe paranoid,\u201d he advises in one book. And in another: \u201cWhen somebody screws you, screw them back in spades. \u201d The grim, dystopian view of America, articulated in Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican convention speech, is previewed in his 2015 book, \u201cCrippled America\u201d (republished with the cheerier title of \u201cGreat Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America\u201d) in which he contends that \u201ceveryone is eating\u201d America\u2019s lunch. And a similarly nihilistic vision surfaces in other remarks he\u2019s made over the years: \u201cI always get even\u201d \u201cFor the most part, you can\u2019t respect people because most people aren\u2019t worthy of respect\u201d and: \u201cThe world is a horrible place. Lions kill for food, but people kill for sport. \u201d Once upon a time, such remarks made Mr. Trump perfect fodder for comedians. Though some writers noted that he was already a caricature of a caricature  \u2014   difficult to parody or satirize  \u2014   Mr. Trudeau recalled that he provided cartoonists with \u201can embarrassment of follies. \u201d And the businessman, who seems to live by the conviction that any publicity is good publicity, apparently embraced this celebrity, writing: \u201cMy cartoon is real. I am the creator of my own comic book. \u201d In a 1990 cartoon, Doonesbury characters argued over what they disliked more about Mr. Trump: \u201cthe boasting, the piggish consumption\u201d or \u201cthe hideous d\u00e9cor of his casinos. \u201d Sadly, the stakes today are infinitely so much huger.
