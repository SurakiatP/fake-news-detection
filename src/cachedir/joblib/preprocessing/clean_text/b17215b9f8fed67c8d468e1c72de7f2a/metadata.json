A federal law made it illegal to broadcast such recordings, but the radio station aired it anyway. The case reached the United States Supreme Court, which in 2001 ruled for the radio station. Legal experts say the decision, Bartnicki v. Vopper, powerfully undermines Donald J. Trump\u2019s claim that The New York Times can be held liable for publishing parts of his tax returns. Any effort to punish \u201cpublication of truthful information of public concern,\u201d Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority, \u201cimplicates the core purposes of the First Amendment. \u201d That is so even if someone broke the law in providing information to a news organization, he wrote. \u201cA stranger\u2019s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern. \u201d Not long before The Times posted its article on Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes, one of his lawyers, Marc E. Kasowitz, sent a letter to The Times threatening legal action. Mr. Kasowitz said that \u201can individual taxpayer\u2019s income tax returns are confidential and statutorily protected from public disclosure. \u201d That is true so far as it goes. In an email a few hours later, but before publication, Mr. Kasowitz wrote that \u201cany unauthorized disclosure, which publication by The New York Times would be, is illegal. \u201d He cited a federal law that makes it a crime \u201cwillfully to print or publish\u201d federal tax return information. It was the only law he cited. Here, though, things grow more complicated. The Times published parts of state tax returns only, from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The federal law Mr. Kasowitz cited does not appear to apply to state returns. In any event, the federal law is a criminal one that does not appear to authorize private civil suits. Mr. Kasowitz did not respond to a request for comment, and it may be that there is a statute or legal theory in one of the four jurisdictions in question that allows the lawsuit he described. Even if that is so, the First Amendment poses a very high barrier to any such litigation. That was the consistent opinion of 11 First Amendment experts consulted by Ronald K. L. Collins for the Concurring Opinions law blog. Here are two representative opinions: \u201cThere is no conceivable basis for an action against The New York Times for publishing the income tax returns of a candidate for president,\u201d said Burt Neuborne, a law professor at New York University. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have a First Amendment. \u201d \u201cThis is  \u201d said Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago. This view was not limited to people who might be expected to be friendly to The Times. Consider Gabriel Schoenfeld, who has called for the prosecution of The Times for publishing information about a program of warrantless wiretapping. \u201cI strongly hope,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cthat Donald Trump sues The New York Times for publishing his tax returns, just as I strongly hope that in the two debates to come, Donald Trump once again attacks Rosie O\u2019Donnell and utters more gibberish. Any such lawsuit  \u2014   which in all likelihood would be shot down by the courts on First Amendment grounds  \u2014   is likely to help further unravel the candidacy of a man who is, among other disqualifying flaws, an enemy of a free press. \u201d The decision that first springs to mind in discussions of what the First Amendment has to say about the publication of confidential or classified information is New York Times Co. v. United States, usually called the Pentagon Papers case. But it does not answer the central question in the current dispute. True, the decision refused to block publication by The Times and The Washington Post of the classified history of the Vietnam War, establishing an    prohibition against prior restraint on publication. But two of the justices in the    majority indicated that they did not rule out    prosecution of the newspapers under espionage laws. The Bartnicki decision, concerning the cellphone call, largely answered the question left open in the Pentagon Papers case. Lee Levine, who argued on the winning side in Bartnicki, said the decision would doom any lawsuit from Mr. Trump. \u201cThe Bartnicki case, both in its holding and reasoning, covers this case precisely,\u201d said Mr. Levine, who has on occasion represented The Times. \u201cIf anything, the claim of First Amendment protection is stronger here because of Mr. Trump\u2019s diminished reasonable expectation of privacy and because of the heightened newsworthiness of the information compared to what was before the court in Bartnicki. \u201d (As a lawyer in The New York Times Company\u2019s legal department, I helped Mr. Levine prepare for the Bartnicki argument and helped draft a     brief supporting his side in the case.) The tape at issue in that case concerned a labor negotiation. A union official said a school board\u2019s intransigence could require a violent response. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to go to their homes,\u201d the official said of board members, and \u201cblow off their front porches. \u201d The recording, like Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, arrived over the transom: It was delivered to an official of a local taxpayers\u2019 association that opposed the union\u2019s wage demands. As with the tax returns, the recording\u2019s source was unknown. The association official passed it along to the radio station. The people whose call was recorded sued under a federal law that banned such disclosures. That law\u2019s structure is very similar to the one invoked by Mr. Trump. Even though the source had obtained and disclosed the information unlawfully, Justice Stevens wrote, the radio station was free to broadcast it because it was \u201ca matter of public concern. \u201d \u201cIf the statements about the labor negotiations had been made in a public arena  \u2014   during a bargaining session, for example  \u2014   they would have been newsworthy. \u201d Some kinds of information  \u2014   \u201cdisclosures of trade secrets or domestic gossip or other information of purely private concern\u201d  \u2014   may not warrant First Amendment protection, he wrote. However, the tax returns of a presidential candidate whose campaign is based in large part on his business acumen would seem to be well on the other side of the line. Another part of the statute Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer cited makes it a crime to solicit federal tax return information, defining solicitation to mean \u201cwillfully to offer any item of material value in exchange for any return or return information. \u201d Some commentators have argued that a statement by the executive editor of The Times, Dean Baquet, may have amounted to such solicitation. In September, before the tax documents arrived at The Times, Mr. Baquet participated in a public discussion at Harvard with Bob Woodward of The Washington Post and Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker. Mr. Baquet said he would fight hard to publish Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes if The Times obtained them, were the paper\u2019s lawyers to object. (They did not.) Mr. Baquet added that he would, if need be, make the case in court that publishing the documents was valuable and lawful. He suggested but did not say that he would be willing to go to jail over the matter. This is not the sort of solicitation contemplated by the statute. Even a more direct request for information  \u2014   of the sort journalists make all day  \u2014   is not unlawful conduct, courts have said. In a concurring opinion in the Bartnicki case, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, not always a friend of the news media, said that it mattered that the union officials were public figures, if only to a limited extent. \u201cThey thereby subjected themselves to somewhat greater public scrutiny,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand had a lesser interest in privacy than an individual engaged in purely private affairs. \u201d A presidential candidate, it would follow, invites much more searching public scrutiny.'"}, "time": 1742564270.5732265}
