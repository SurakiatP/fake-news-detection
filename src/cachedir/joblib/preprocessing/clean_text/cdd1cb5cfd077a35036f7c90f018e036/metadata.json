The authorities were forced to raise the volume on the loudspeakers playing lamentation songs after some in the crowds took up cries of \u201cOh, Hussein, Mir Hussein,\u201d a reference to a former presidential candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, who has been under house arrest since 2011. Some of the chants were aimed at Russia, Iran\u2019s ally in the Syrian conflict. Video clips on social media showed mourners shouting \u201cDeath to Russia\u201d and \u201cthe Russian Embassy is the den of espionage,\u201d as they passed the embassy\u2019s complex in the heart of Tehran. People also called for the release of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons. State television, broadcasting the funeral live, airbrushed the protests, which were nevertheless allowed to proceed without police intervention. Mr. Rafsanjani, 82, who died on Sunday, was laid to rest after an elaborate ceremony that lasted several days. Right after his demise, his body was placed in a coffin that was put on public display in the modest house of the late founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. For two days, mourners had filed through the northern Tehran site, untouched since Mr. Khomeini died in 1989. A religious chanter brought the crowds to tears as he recalled how Mr. Rafsanjani helped to oust Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the 1979 revolution. \u201cOur sheikh was so wise, he made the shah leave, leave,\u201d the chanter sang. Men gathering on the ground floor bowed their heads in respect, while on the first floor  \u2014   the women\u2019s section  \u2014   mourners in black chadors peeked down. Qassem Soleimani, the general of the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards who runs Iran\u2019s operations in Iraq and Syria, paid his respects, some people said, showing clips of him on their cellphones as proof. Because of Mr. Rafsanjani\u2019s close relationship with Ayatollah Khomeini, he was accorded the honor of being buried in the late leader\u2019s mausoleum, in a golden cage. Before the interment, all Iranians were invited to gather around the campus of the University of Tehran, in the central part of the city, where Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led a prayer. People showed up early, some wearing scarves around their faces to protect them from the morning cold. Families passed by, pushing strollers carrying babies wearing woolen hats. Students took videos with their cellphones. Shiite clerics in traditional winter robes made of camel\u2019s hair held prayer beads. There were so many people  \u2014   2. 5 million by official estimates  \u2014   that many of the dignitaries and family members invited to the campus were marooned in their cars amid the crowds. Some hid behind curtains others waved at the collection of camera phones. One of Mr. Rafsanjani\u2019s daughters, Faezeh Hashemi, was photographed sticking her head out of the window of a bus and flashing a victory sign. She and her brother Mehdi have been harassed by   for their growing support of reformists and moderates seeking change in Iran. The daughter, an activist for women\u2019s rights and personal freedoms, was jailed in 2011 for making \u201c  propaganda,\u201d while her brother was given leave to attend the funeral from prison, where he was sent on embezzlement charges. In recent years their father, long a staunch conservative, became an unexpected hero to Iran\u2019s middle class. Mr. Rafsanjani sympathized with some demands made by protesters during the   Green Revolution, the antigovernment demonstrations following the disputed   victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. They saw him as a lone voice representing their beliefs in Iran\u2019s establishment. Such deviations from the official line were put aside by the authorities on Tuesday. In death it seemed that Mr. Rafsanjani was to be remembered for his revolutionary credentials, not for his criticisms. Potential troublemakers were not invited. The former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, who was supported by Mr. Rafsanjani, was told not to attend, local websites said. The same apparatus that normally churns out posters showing Uncle Sam with blood dripping from his teeth to burn during     demonstrations, now printed pictures of Mr. Rafsanjani, extolling him as \u201ca man of history, who is immortal. \u201d In the teeming streets, scenes clashed incongruously. At one point, Ayatollah Khamenei could be heard through loudspeakers saying prayers for Mr. Rafsanjani while protesters chanted opposition slogans. Some wore green wristbands, the color of the opposition, and flashed victory signs. Supporters of the establishment tried to drown out the slogans by shouting \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d meaning \u201cGod is great,\u201d but for the most part they were overmatched. On state television, sound engineers at one point forgot to lower the volume when people shouted, \u201cHail to Khatami. \u201d \u201cHashemi\u2019s death is a great worry to us,\u201d said Leili Farhang, a    university graduate, who emphasized that she was unemployed \u201clike many of my generation. \u201d She and her friends had showed up in front of the Tehran University campus \u201cto pay respect to a man who respected us. \u201d It was hard, she and her friends agreed, to come up with the name of anybody within Iran\u2019s establishment to replace Mr. Rafsanjani. Not one has his weight and stature, they concluded: \u201cHe will be missed. \u201d It took hours for the body to arrive at the South Tehran mausoleum, because of \u201cthe millions that have come out to honor the ayatollah,\u201d Khabarfori, an Iranian online news channel, said on the Telegram messaging app. Inside the mausoleum, state television showed, a marching band played the national anthem, after which Mr. Rafsanjani\u2019s coffin was placed next to Mr. Khomeini\u2019s, as planned.'"}, "time": 1742562058.76548}
