It is a rare day indeed that members of the party aren\u2019t acting in a nakedly political, self-interested manner, but the announcement last Friday that the FBI is reopening the probe into the Clinton email scandal has them in overdrive. \\nTake DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile \u2026 please! She has been tweeting out a steady stream of condemnations of FBI Director James Comey ever since his letter of intent to relaunch their investigation into potential wrongdoing arrived in the hands of Congress. \\nHere as an example is what she wrote yesterday: Justice officials warned FBI that Comey\u2019s decision to update Congress was not consistent with department policy https://t.co/N2yMIDnErR \\n\u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 29, 2016 \\nBut back in July, Brazile had only praise for Comey\u2019s wisdom and fairness. If she was lambasting anyone it was the GOP for its petulent refusal to accept the director\u2019s learned judgment: Pathetic. Simply pathetic to watch members of Congress grill Director Comey because he's not playing their game of gotcha. #Overreach \\n\u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) July 7, 2016 \\nBut when it comes to two-facedness, Brazile can\u2019t hold a candle to Team Clinton itself. In his statement on Friday, Clinton campaign honcho John Podesta wrote, \u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.\u201d \\nBut it was not that long ago that Clinton and her enablers were singing Comey\u2019s praises. Here\u2019s Clinton campaign mouthpiece Brian Fallon: So now @realDonaldTrump is calling the former head of the FBI cyber division a liar? Pathetic. https://t.co/sXp5CCS5oL ) \\n\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 15, 2016 Comey was not just Deputy AG under Bush 43. He was also deputy counsel on Senate Whitewater Committee that investigated the Clintons in 90s \\n\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) July 7, 2016 Grassley now resorting to trying to bully the FBI into serving his partisan interests. Shameless. http://t.co/993cFQyDYA \\n\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) September 22, 2015 \\nIt still remains to be seen what is in the emails that have prompted Comey\u2019s actions in the last 72 hours, but liberals aren\u2019t content to hold off on idle speculation . 7 shares\""}, "time": 1742628514.4299362}
