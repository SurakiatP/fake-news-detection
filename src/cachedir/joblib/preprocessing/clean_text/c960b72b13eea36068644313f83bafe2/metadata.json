But if you were Christian, it was almost impossible. \u201d \u201cAnd the reason that was so unfair, is that everybody was persecuted in all fairness, they were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians. I thought it was very, very unfair,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cSo we are going to help them. \u201d While the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama significantly increased the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the country, an overwhelming majority of these were Muslim, despite the Islamic State\u2019s systematic attempts to convert or kill both Syria and Iraq\u2019s Christian population. In June 2016, for example, the United States accepted a record number of 2, 300 refugees from Syria. Eight were Christian. As a presidential candidate, Trump made the case that the number of Christian refugees being accepted into the United States was too low, while the number of undervetted Syrian Muslim refugees could pose a danger to the safety of U. S. citizens.  '"}, "time": 1742561949.9937315}
