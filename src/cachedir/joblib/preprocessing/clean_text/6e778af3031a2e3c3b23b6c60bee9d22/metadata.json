[\u201cBank of America supports art programs worldwide, including an   partnership with The Public Theater and Shakespeare in the Park,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told the New York Daily News Sunday. \u201cThe Public Theater chose to present Julius Caesar in a way that was intended to provoke and offend. Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it. \u201d  Original story below: Delta Air Lines has cancelled its sponsorship of New York City\u2019s Public Theater following backlash surrounding a Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar, a \u201ccontemporary\u201d take on the classic play in which a Donald   twist on the titular character is graphically stabbed to death on stage. Breitbart News previously reported that this summer\u2019s Oskar   production of Julius Caesar  \u2014   which opened in previews last month in Central Park\u2019s Delacorte Theater  \u2014   had sparked controversy over its main character\u2019s striking resemblance to President Trump. The character sports blonde,   hair and a business suit and tie, and his wife Calpurnia speaks with a Slavic accent, similar to that of First Lady Melania Trump. Video captured at a recent performance shows the   Caesar character graphically stabbed to death during the climax of the play. One attendee recently told Mediaite that the character\u2019s resemblance to Trump made the assassination scene particularly \u201cshocking and distasteful. \u201d In the wake of the controversy, Delta Airlines has reportedly cancelled its sponsorship of the Public Theater, which stages the free productions of Shakespeare in the Park. \u201cNo matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer\u2019s Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines\u2019 values,\u201d the company said in a statement Sunday. \u201cTheir artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. We have notified them of our decision to end our sponsorship as the official airline of the Public Theater effective immediately,\u201d the statement added. Other sponsors of the New York City\u2019s Public Theater include American Express, the New York Times and Bank of America. The Delta sponsorship cancellation represents a blow to the Public Theater nearly two weeks after another controversy sparked by a graphic depiction of President Trump\u2019s death led to lost sponsorship and business opportunities. In May, comedian Kathy Griffin posed for a photograph with a fake, bloodied head of the president in her outstretched arm. The photograph generated a firestorm of criticism and Griffin was quickly fired from her role on CNN\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Eve Live broadcast. The comedian also lost out on a commercial deal with a restroom accessories company and had several scheduled performances on her   comedy tour cancelled.
