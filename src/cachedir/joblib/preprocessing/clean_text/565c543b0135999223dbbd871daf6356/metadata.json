[Nancy Holten, 42, is a   animal rights activist who has campaigned against the Swiss tradition of cow bells, calling them cruel.  Despite living in the country since the age of eight, and speaking fluent Swiss German, local residents vetoed her application of citizenship, saying they were \u201cfed up\u201d with her challenging their traditions. The Dutchwoman explained her views: \u201cThe sound that cow bells make is a hundred decibel. It is comparable with a pneumatic drill. We also would not want such a thing hanging close to our ears?\u201d \u201cThe bells, which the cows have to wear when they walk to and from the pasture, are especially heavy. \u201cThe animals carry around five kilograms around their neck. It causes friction and burns to their skin. \u201d Aargauer Zeitung says that as well as cow bells, she has also campaigned against other Swiss traditions including hunting, pig racing, and even loud church bells. Local politician Tanja Suter said Ms. Holten had a \u201cbig mouth\u201d and she does not deserve a Swiss passport \u201cif she irritates us and does not respect our traditions\u201d. Ms Holten herself admits: \u201cI think I spoke my mind too often, and I say it out too loud. \u201d Under Switzerland\u2019s highly decentralised constitution, local towns and regions grant citizenship rather than the central government, and some give citizens a vote on who gets a passport. Villagers in   in the canton of Aargau voted by 206 to 144 to reject Ms. Holten\u2019s application for citizenship in 2015, and have now rejected that application a second time. The case will now go to the regional government, which can overrule the vote and grant her citizenship anyway. Switzerland has some of the tightest citizenship laws in the world, and being born in the country often does not grant the children of immigrants an automatic right to a passport.'"}, "time": 1742628580.333119}
