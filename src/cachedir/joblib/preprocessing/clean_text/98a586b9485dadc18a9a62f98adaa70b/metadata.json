[Media attention primarily focused on hero Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were wounded as they fired back at the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.  But a third police officer, Henry Cabrera, who was also there at the time to protect House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) also helped take down the shooter, but was not wounded. Cabrera appears to be a U. S. Army veteran, according to his Facebook page. His page features a picture of himself in fatigues, and another of an Army platoon at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on Sept. 12, 1994. The unit is the 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment. Asked to confirm whether he is a veteran, Capitol Police Spokeswoman Eva Malecki responded, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment any further on an ongoing investigation. \u201d However, a relative of Cabrera confirmed to Breitbart News that he is a veteran. Cabrera\u2019s name became known to the public after Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa thanked him, Griner, and Bailey at a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cI want to commend Special Agents Crystal Griner, David Bailey, and Henry Cabrera for their heroic and appropriate response in protecting the Members and others today during their practice for the Congressional baseball game,\u201d he said. Cabrera posted on Facebook on Wednesday after the shooting: \u201cYesterday was   NUTS! !!! Many thanks to those who reached out to me yesterday. I\u2019m proud of my TEAMMATES David Bailey and Crystal Griner. They took care of business! !!!! Prayers for Mr Scalise and his family. \u201d Supportive comments poured into Cabrera\u2019s page and on Twitter. \u201cDont sell yourself short man. You are one of the heroes too!\u201d a friend posted. There was a third officer there who should also be recognized. He just wasn\u2019t wounded. Special Agent Henry Cabrera.  \u2014   BAJ (@BarbAnnJ) June 15, 2017,  Why did CBS @CBSThisMorning NOT mention HENRY CABRERA from the Capital Police for his heroic actions??  \u2014   teslaire (@teslaire) June 15, 2017,  Although details are scant, eyewitnesses say the officers took down Hodgkinson, 66, after he opened fire on Republican congressmen and their staff, critically wounding Scalise and lobbyist and former congressional staffer Matt Mika. Bailey, Griner, and an aide to Rep. Roger Williams ( ) Zach Barth, was also wounded. Those who were on the field that day credited the officers for saving their lives. Eyewitnesses said the officers stepped forward, towards the shooter, and saved everyone\u2019s lives. \u201cIt could have easily been 25 deaths or more,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe thin blue line held today. And Americans everywhere should be thankful that it\u2019s still the kind of country that produces these heroes. \u201d \u201cWithout the Capitol Police, who literally took a step forward   \u2026     they saved all of us out there. There is no question about it. We had no arms, all we had were bats. And the shooter,\u201d he added. Rep. Brad Wenstrup ( ) an Iraq veteran, said that after Hodgkinson fired at them with a rifle, he came out from behind a building with a pistol. \u201cThat\u2019s when security detail was able to take him down,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cYou never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did,\u201d Wenstrup tweeted later. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) who was also there at the scene, said it would have been a \u201cmassacre\u201d without the Capitol Police. \u201cI can tell you, that I think with absolute certainty, nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill Police. They saved everybody\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been a massacre without them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628563.866241}
