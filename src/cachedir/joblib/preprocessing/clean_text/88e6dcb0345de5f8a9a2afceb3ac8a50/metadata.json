In doing so, they were fulfilling their family\u2019s dreams. For years, her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City. But her parents died before that could happen. Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive. Still, he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move. \u201cAmerica is a great nation, a kind nation, a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities,\u201d Mr. Canunayon said. When the couple arrived, they stayed with Ms. Canunayon\u2019s family in New Jersey. Life was exciting, even relaxing, Mr. Canunayon said. But as they settled in a new country, he struggled to find work and grew despondent. \u201cOh, my God, I have cried a river because I was in a depression,\u201d said Mr. Canunayon, now 46. He found relaxation riding the subway, one station to the next, so long as it kept moving. \u201cWhen you come from a place where you are so familiar, your own country, you have friends, relatives, connections, a career. And then you\u2019re stripped of everything except your dignity it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. Eventually, the couple were able to move into an apartment of their own in Elmhurst, Queens. They also secured employment. He works at a   laundry, while his wife, 49, is a babysitter, a midwife and a nanny. In October 2015, they received their green cards. Beyond that, Mr. Canunayon, who left a career in nonprofit work in the Philippines, has recommitted himself to working to help people and neighborhoods change for the better. Only this time, he is not collecting a paycheck for it. \u201cGod gave knowledge for free, skills for free, talent for free, so I\u2019ll give it for free,\u201d Mr. Canunayon said. He volunteers at the couple\u2019s place of worship in Elmhurst, St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church. He also helps other Filipino immigrants. \u201cI cannot imagine myself not sharing the skills and   talent that I have,\u201d he said. But because this effort doesn\u2019t come with a salary, it doesn\u2019t help pay the bills. It took one episode, when the Canunayons received a $600 medical bill for lab tests in September, for them to plummet into financial instability. \u201cIt was a big problem, Mr. Canunayon said. \u201cWhat will happen to us if we can\u2019t pay the rent?\u201d He came across a possible solution on one of his volunteer outings for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Filipino Consulate, where he was helping people renew their passports. He mentioned his financial problems to Greg Hankins, a volunteer he had met that day. Mr. Hankins encouraged him to contact another group, Community Health Advocates. It is operated by the Community Service Society, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society did help, providing $641. 45 in Neediest Cases money to cover the couple\u2019s outstanding medical bills. They also got help obtaining health insurance. While grateful for the assistance, they continue to worry about everyday challenges: making ends meet, sending money back to their families and carefully monitoring their finances. \u201cIt\u2019s the same situation, financially struggling and trying to get myself back into the saddle,\u201d Mr. Canunayon said. He continues to search for jobs in the nonprofit sector. In the Philippines, he worked in research, advocacy and policy legislation, which led to the development of sustainable organic agriculture to feed the poor. The cause was personal: Many members of his family are farmers. He has not given up hope that he will find a job that lets him continue his passion for service while providing a decent income. \u201cI would be killing myself if I did something else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would deplete my energy. When you work on the things you most love doing, it\u2019s not work. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563637.432877}
