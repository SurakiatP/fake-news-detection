But then you might wonder, maybe this doesn\u2019t happen at all, and maybe it\u2019s possible for the internet to actually fragment and not to have this historical necessity to it. \u201d According to CNBC, Thiel added that \u201cNo one in their right mind would start an organization with the word \u2018global\u2019 in its title today,\u201d before claiming \u201cThat\u2019s so 2005, it feels so dated. \u201d \u201cA decade ago, this was a group of people who were running the world, and now, it\u2019s just a group of people who messed up the world,\u201d concluded Thiel. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is a good thing, but it is a fact that maybe politics is becoming more important, it\u2019s becoming more intense, the range of outcomes is becoming greater, and that we\u2019re in a world in which there\u2019s a bull market in politics that\u2019s getting started. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
