Trump spent Friday morning on the phone and agreed to not discuss wall payments in public. [In a prepared statement issued by Mexico\u2019s federal government, Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s team claimed that both heads of state understood their shared public differences and agreed to discuss the heated issue as part of an \u201cintegral discussion\u201d in relation to their bilateral partnership.   The telephone conversation dealt with the issues of trade deficit, international friendship, and both nations working together to stem the flow of drugs and weapons, the Mexican government revealed in their statement. Both presidents told their staff to continue discussing bilateral issues.  The two had a productive and constructive call regarding the bilateral relationship between the two countries, the current trade deficit the United States has with Mexico, the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales. With respect to payment for the border wall, both presidents recognize their clear and very public differences of positions on this issue but have agreed to work these differences out as part of a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationship. Both presidents have instructed their teams to continue the dialogue to strengthen this important strategic and economic relationship in a constructive way.
