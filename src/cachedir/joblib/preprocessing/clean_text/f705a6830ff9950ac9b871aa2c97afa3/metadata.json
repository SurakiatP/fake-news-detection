Trump and his allies on Thursday sought to tamp down his remarks, with Mr. Trump saying he was simply being \u201csarcastic. \u201d In public interviews and private conversations on Thursday, Mr. Trump his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and campaign staff members contended that Mr. Trump was being facetious when, during a news conference on Wednesday, he said he hoped Russia would be able to find Mrs. Clinton\u2019s missing emails. \u201cOf course I\u2019m being sarcastic,\u201d Mr. Trump told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Thursday morning as his aides accused the news media of misconstruing his remarks. And in an interview Thursday with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, Mr. Pence repeatedly said that Mr. Trump was merely joking. \u201cHe went on, using a statement laced with sarcasm, to point out that there are 33, 000 missing emails, according to the F. B. I. that Hillary Clinton deleted or did not make available in the course of that investigation,\u201d Mr. Pence told Ms. Ingraham. But the assertions that his remarks should not be taken at face value were at odds with statements put out by Mr. Trump and his aides right after his news conference on Wednesday. Those statements insisted that Mr. Trump was urging Russia to return any purloined property to the F. B. I. Aides to both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were clearly caught off guard by Mr. Trump\u2019s impromptu comments on Wednesday  \u2014   when he said, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing\u201d  \u2014   and were surprised by the swift and immediate reaction to them, especially in the news media. The extraordinary moment  \u2014   in which the Republican nominee basically urged Russia, an adversary, to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state  \u2014   again left Mr. Trump isolated from even some fellow Republicans, struggling to explain away another comment that had dominated yet another news cycle, and not necessarily in a positive way. Ed Brookover, a Trump campaign liaison to the Republican National Committee, said that the substance of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails was what was most important  \u2014   not Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cThe truth about the emails is that Hillary\u2019s record as secretary of state was abysmal, and her lack of security left our secrets vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Brookover said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that no foreign countries did get access to her private email account. \u201d On Thursday, even while trying to reframe his original comments, Mr. Trump reiterated his remarks from a day earlier that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is \u201ca better leader\u201d than President Obama. \u201cI said he\u2019s a better leader than Obama because Obama\u2019s not a leader, so he\u2019s certainly doing a better job than Obama is, and that\u2019s all,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the \u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview. \u201cBut you have 33, 000 emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said in those emails from the Democratic National Committee,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou take a look at what was said in those emails, it\u2019s disgraceful. It\u2019s disgraceful. \u201d For the second day in a row, Mr. Trump seemed to be conflating the roughly 30, 000 emails on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server during her time as secretary of state that her lawyers deleted as personal, and the roughly 20, 000 Democratic National Committee emails that were hacked. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to recalibrate his original remarks Wednesday began just hours after his news conference. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Wednesday that he was simply urging Russia, if it had indeed hacked Mrs. Clinton, to hand her emails over to the proper authorities. \u201cIf Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33, 000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the F. B. I!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. Republicans were largely muted Thursday in their defense of Mr. Trump, save for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who is a supporter. \u201cThat server of hers was less secure than the D. N. C. server that was hacked,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference in Philadelphia, adding that he was \u201csure\u201d Mr. Trump wanted the emails sent to the F. B. I. \u201cThose emails are being held by people. They should be released before the election. \u201d In her radio interview Thursday morning, Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Pence, \u201cShould Americans be concerned that the Republican nominee is inviting a foreign government to hack into government emails?\u201d Mr. Pence echoed the campaign\u2019s public posture, saying several times that Mr. Trump was just being \u201csarcastic\u201d  \u2014   and he sought to recast Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cWell, it\u2019s absolutely not what he said,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cWhat he said  \u2014   what I said  \u2014   was, clearly, if Russia or any foreign country was interfering or intervening or engaging in illegal activity in the United States, in our elections or otherwise, that there be serious consequences. \u201d At an afternoon rally Thursday in Davenport, Iowa, supporters of Mr. Trump offered almost uniform absolution for the comments, saying they believed he had been speaking facetiously. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was being serious,\u201d said Tom Taylor, 68, a retiree from Wilton, Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s just media spin. He\u2019s not a professional politician like the rest of them, so sometimes people misinterpret what he says. \u201d Still, some supporters allowed that Mr. Trump might have been imprudent in his remarks. \u201cMaybe he shouldn\u2019t have said that about Russia,\u201d said Joan Watson, 63, from Walnut, Ill. \u201cIt just gives the Democrats more material for ads. I think he was just trying to get a reaction. But even if he was kidding, he knows Russia could probably do it. \u201d In a common refrain among the people waiting for the rally to begin, Dan Brethaner said of the comments, \u201cThat\u2019s just Donald being Donald. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564061.6161664}
