Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. \\nHowever, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat\u2019s campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem. \\nRon Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were \u201clivid\u201d at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation. \\n\u201cHe lit her on fire and then walked away,\u201d Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges. \\nHosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision \u201cbased on what they have\u201d at the time. Hosko said he thinks agents were probing a separate matter and found emails that made them say, \u201cOh my God look at what we have.\u201d \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan called the FBI decision \u201clong overdue.\u201d BREAKING NEWS \u2192 The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton. \\nMy full statement \u21e9 pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk \\n\u2014 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) October 28, 2016 \\nBut former Obama administration spokesman Tommy Vietor chided the bureau on Twitter. How many emails did the FBI find? Get your butt in gear, read them, assess them, form a conclusion. Letting this hang is so irresponsible.'"}, "time": 1742628447.862137}
