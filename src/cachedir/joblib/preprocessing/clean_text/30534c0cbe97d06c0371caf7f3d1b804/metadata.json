S.  Border. [In a new plan by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) current legal immigration policy would be changed to fund President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall construction plans.  Rather than eliminating the diversity lottery altogether, as immigration hawks have requested, Rohrabacher\u2019s plan changes which foreign nationals are given the 55, 000 visas every year under the current system. Under Rohrabacher\u2019s proposal, the 55, 000 Green Cards awarded to   foreign nationals would be replaced by a system for those able to pay a $1 million fee. The only requirement for essentially buying the Green Card would be \u201cgood character,\u201d Rohrabacher told the Washington Examiner. Once the foreign national is in the U. S. for two years, the plan guarantees a pathway to citizenship. Center for Immigration Studies Director Mark Krikorian told Breitbart Texas the plan was \u201cabsurd,\u201d as it did not lower any legal immigration levels, thus not dealing with the concerns of Trump\u2019s base when it comes to the immigration issue. \u201cJust because you have money, does not mean you\u2019re going to become a better American,\u201d Krikorian said in an interview. \u201cYes, you\u2019re less likely to use welfare  \u2026     but that\u2019s not what this is all about though. That\u2019s part of the issue, but not all of it. \u201d \u201cThey figure this is a compromise,\u201d Krikorian continued. \u201cBut we don\u2019t get any reduction in [immigration] numbers with this. [Republicans] don\u2019t realize that reducing the numbers is the entire point. \u201d The plan by Rohrabacher is similar to a visa system that already exists and has been panned by immigration hawks, known as the   visa. With the   visa program, 10, 000 foreign nationals can come to the U. S.  \u2014   and bring their entire family with them  \u2014   so long as they claim to invest at least $500, 000 and create 10 American jobs. Eventually, those foreign nationals on   visas can apply for U. S. citizenship. Immigration expert John Miano, told Breitbart Texas that Rohrabacher\u2019s plan, like the   visa, creates a special pathway for wealthy foreigners without any requirement that they commit to the U. S. \u201cThere\u2019s something not right about grabbing the world\u2019s rich people and bringing them to America,\u201d Miano said. \u201cThey have no commitment to the country. \u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy people off, you have to have people who are going to pick up the guns and defend the nation, not people who are trying to find the most secure place to keep their money,\u201d Miano continued. Krikorian said he supports a border wall funding plan being pushed by Rep. Mike Rodgers ( ) where illegal immigrants\u2019 remittances are taxed. \u201cThere are any number of ways to fund the borders,\u201d Krikorian said. Rohrabacher\u2019s visa plan is not the only GOP immigration proposal opposed by immigration hawks. Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s ( ) proposal to potentially triple the number of foreign nationals who enter the U. S. under the   visa every year similarly received pushback, as Breitbart Texas reported. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that these guys just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Krikorian said.
