Drunk  \u2014   as she sang in 2013 of a gritty tryst with her husband  \u2014   in love. Oh well. On Saturday night, Beyonc\u00e9 walked the streets of a soundstage with a baseball bat, treating parked cars and police surveillance cameras like pi\u00f1atas, \u201cjealous and crazy,\u201d but in an elaborate   dress fit for Fat Tuesday. It didn\u2019t feel any more disjunctive than seeing Suzanne Lenglen rush the net in a   dress in say, 1916. Except the woman at this net also has a bone to pick with her spouse, Jay Z. This was \u201cLemonade,\u201d a \u201cvisual album\u201d and array of salvos, which tells the story of woman in a marriage she didn\u2019t know was bad, until, of course, she knew. Beyonc\u00e9, and HBO, were shrewd about keeping a lid on what this thing was going to be. Based on the only available image  \u2014   someone in cornrows, face disguised by a big fur coat  \u2014   I assumed drag queen prison drama. But it was bolder and deeper and more uncomfortable than anything I could have predicted. \u201cLemonade\u201d is less a dramatization than a daydream, infused with black magic, embracing  \u2014   if only notionally  \u2014   African tribalism, science fiction, menstruation and witchcraft. The music\u2019s emotional odyssey is conjugal. (The song chapters are presented as stages  \u2014   \u201cintuition,\u201d \u201cdenial,\u201d \u201cforgiveness,\u201d \u201chope,\u201d etc.) Most of the corresponding images commune with the psyche and with history. The Deep South  \u2014   New Orleans, mostly  \u2014   occupies the landscape. Throughout, black women are standing, sitting, phalanxed on the porches of what feel like plantations and antiquated houses, rich with pain. The cameras get in close on beautiful faces that lack pigment, that bear scars, burns and sorrow. The mothers of slain young men exude regal stoicism, holding photographs of their sons. Visually, \u201cLemonade\u201d invokes a lot  \u2014   Madonna\u2019s \u201cLa Isla Bonita,\u201d \u201cCarrie,\u201d \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild\u201d and the   at the end of Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White. \u201d But what its   spiritualism calls to mind is \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d Julie Dash\u2019s landmark tone poem from 1991, loosely  \u2014   very loosely  \u2014   about three generations, descended from slavery, and their migration north in 1902. The juicy immediacy of \u201cLemonade\u201d is what this one man did to this one woman. Not far in, Beyonc\u00e9 looks tearfully into the camera and, with her own song playing around her (\u201cI pray you catch me,\u201d she sings to a higher power) lets herself fall from a roof. The street below becomes a body of water. It complements the submerged churning all over the soundtrack. It has the effect of a leviathan astir. That interlude with a baseball bat begins with Beyonc\u00e9, in that yellow dress, throwing open the enormous doors of an old,   building and a deluge pouring out. \u201cAre you cheating on me?\u201d she asks in the running offscreen narration that\u2019s credited to the young   poet Warsan Shire. It\u2019s like something out of Toni Morrison. The water on her rage just broke. \u201cRing the alarm,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 once sang of being   before enumerating the stuff of hers this other woman would never touch. On a different occasion, she sang: \u201cTo the left, to the left. Everything you own in the box to the left. \u201d That all feels pedestrian now. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s prized possessions here are her trust, love and dignity. But she\u2019s daring to think beyond herself. The heavy hangover of the piece involves what lots of men have done to lots of women, black women in particular. Between songs, we hear Malcolm X intone that no one has had it rougher than they have. Think about what it takes to make lemonade. You have to split open a lot of citrus, remove the seeds, strain for pulp and add a lot of sugar. It\u2019s a process. Black women are good at lemonade. I watched this thing in a state of exhilarated shock. At first, I thought: How is this not a work of pretentious  ? How isn\u2019t this the mistake of the year? This is a woman who, in 2011, seemed incapable of gauging both the marketplace and what it wanted from her. She couldn\u2019t choose a good single from her uniformly superb album \u201c4. \u201d The surprise release of \u201cBeyonc\u00e9,\u201d at the end of 2013, was a major course correction. It cratered the Internet in a way that seemed to unify a   pop universe. Carnal, reflective, almost platitude free: It was the best and most creatively adventurous of her albums. The arrival of that record, the debut of a video for \u201cFormation\u201d last Super Bowl eve and the premiere of \u201cLemonade\u201d have put her atop the      complex in a way that rivals Madonna, Janet and Michael Jackson. \u201cLemonade\u201d has all of the formal coherence that kept \u201cFormation\u201d from being as good a video as it was a cultural bombshell. Its seven credited directors  \u2014   Jonas Akerlund, Kahlil Joseph, Melina Matsoukas, Dikayl Rimmasch, Mark Romanek, Todd Tourso and Beyonc\u00e9  \u2014   give this project texture, mystery and life. Restraint, too. The only memorable dancing is by the world\u2019s greatest living female athlete: Serena Williams, a tennis player. And all of that opacity  \u2014   the sense from her previous special that no matter how much Beyonc\u00e9 talks, she isn\u2019t telling you anything? That doesn\u2019t exist here. Feelings gush like water. The piece opens with Beyonc\u00e9 kneeling on a stage, a curtain behind her. She\u2019s getting out in front of the drama. Her so doing puts everybody in a compromising position. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z have made room for a different third party: us. Last week, HBO showed \u201cConfirmation,\u201d which   a different fight between a black woman and a black man. In one corner, Anita Hill in the other, Clarence Thomas. It was never a fair fight. He manages to wrest all the power from her side of the story. \u201cLemonade\u201d feels like a cultural rebuke on behalf of lots of aching women, whether they\u2019re standing on that plantation porch, watching from their living rooms, or running for president. The queasiest part of \u201cDrunk in Love\u201d comes when Jay Z raps, \u201cEat the cake, Anna Mae,\u201d invoking a diner scene from \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It\u201d when Ike (using Tina\u2019s birth name) shoves dessert in her face. Is \u201cLemonade\u201d a rebuke of that, too? Why not? Any wife who outs her husband on an album and in an hourlong video as a cheater, then makes him release that album on his streaming platform  \u2014   exclusively  \u2014   is having her cake and making him eat it, too. That feels only partially triumphant since we\u2019re left in a moral murk. He might be paying for his sins. But we\u2019re still paying him.'"}, "time": 1742562292.8660524}
