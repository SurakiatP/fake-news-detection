{"duration": 0.08225440979003906, "input_args": {"text": "'\u201cMorris From America,\u201d Chad Hartigan\u2019s charming new film, begins with a   discussion of   an argument about beats, flows and hooks. It\u2019s partly an affectionate intergenerational dispute    Morris (Markees Christmas) is skeptical of his father\u2019s   dogma, while his dad, Curtis (Craig Robinson) dismisses his son\u2019s taste as too pop. The conversation also provides a clue about the movie\u2019s own strategies. It\u2019s a pop confection with a rough, honest texture, real but not raw and suffused with an infectious sweetness that lingers after the final shot. As Curtis puts it, he and Morris are \u201cthe only brothers in Heidelberg,\u201d an   family in the perplexing and sometimes unfriendly environment of a picturesque German town. Curtis, a former soccer player in the United States, is on the coaching staff of the local team, and the rest of his back story is conveniently blurry. Like almost every other single dad you see in a movie, he is a widower, a shortcut to audience sympathy that Mr. Hartigan might have had the wit to avoid. But the novelty of the setting and the familiarity of the premise  \u2014   an adolescent boy navigating a bumpy stretch on the road from boyhood to maturity  \u2014   combine to give \u201cMorris From America\u201d buoyancy and heart. Mr. Christmas is an unusually subtle actor for someone his age. (He was 15 when the film was made.) He resists the temptation to make Morris precocious or cute, or to win over the viewer\u2019s sympathy, and instead takes us inside the young man\u2019s confusion. Like other teenagers, Morris is both smart and clueless, equally capable of sharp insights and colossal errors of judgment. Adding to his befuddlement is Katrin (Lina Keller) a slightly older girl (with a significantly older boyfriend) whom Morris meets at the youth center. He\u2019s been encouraged to go there by his German tutor, Inka (Carla Juri) who serves, somewhat awkwardly, as his   and surrogate big sister. Katrin, a cynical and capricious queen bee, is beautiful and more than a little cruel. She genuinely likes Morris, which means that she likes to humiliate and torment him. She encourages him to rap at the center\u2019s talent show, with disastrous results. \u201cMorris From America\u201d is blunt about German racism, which has a different texture from its American variety, partly because young,   Germans consider themselves entirely free of ancestral bigotry. A counselor at the youth center suspects that Morris is a drug dealer. The other kids blithely give voice to obnoxious assumptions about his basketball skills and his sexual prowess. He\u2019s either a mascot or a scapegoat. Without minimizing the pain and injustice of Morris\u2019s situation, Mr. Hartigan, whose previous features as a director are \u201cThis Is Martin Bonner\u201d and \u201cErin and Brie Are on a First Date,\u201d handles the film\u2019s racial dimensions with a gentle touch. The movie\u2019s most satisfying achievement is its sense of proportion. There is plenty of drama in a teenager\u2019s everyday life  \u2014   no need to sensationalize  \u2014   and \u201cMorris From America\u201d feels true to both the pleasures and the frustrations of its title character. And let\u2019s not forget about Curtis. Mr. Robinson, who has long been a stalwart supporting player in   and   comedies, has my vote for father of the year. If there is anything harder than being a    boy, it\u2019s living with one, and Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hartigan nail the particular challenges of that condition as well as anyone I can think of. Curtis, who has his own emotional and professional needs, must juggle an expanding number of conflicting duties. He\u2019s supposed to be a role model and a pal, to set limits and set his son free, to leave the boy alone and to be there when he\u2019s required. Morris and Curtis live in a state of mutual bewilderment, but the love between them is the beat that drives the movie\u2019s flow. The authenticity of some of the rapping means that \u201cMorris From America\u201d has an R rating, but if you know someone Morris\u2019s age and swearing is not a   for you, this is a perfect movie to see together as the new school year approaches. \u201cMorris From America\u201d is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explicit lyrics. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes.'"}, "time": 1742628416.6073086}
