After being held captive by Boko Haram for months, they made it to this government camp for thousands of civilians who have fled the militants\u2019 cruelty. But instead of a welcome, residents gathered around, badgering them with questions and glares. They beat her    brother, convinced that anyone who has spent time among the militants, even a young kidnapping victim, could have become a sympathizer, possibly even a suicide bomber. Zara, in fact, was hiding a dangerous secret strapped to her back: her baby. The child\u2019s father was a Boko Haram fighter who had raped her, but Zara knew the crowd would still doubt her loyalties. So she quickly spun a tale that the militants had killed her husband, leaving her a young, widowed mother. \u201cIf they knew my baby was from an insurgent, they wouldn\u2019t allow us to stay,\u201d said Zara, whose full name was not used, to protect her safety. \u201cThey\u2019ll never forget who her father is, just like a leopard never forgets its spots. \u201d In northeastern Nigeria, the years of suffering under Boko Haram have upended the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, stealing something  \u2014   or everything  \u2014   from countless families. Now, a deep suspicion is raging against anyone who has lived alongside the group  \u2014   even girls who were held hostage, repeatedly raped and left to raise infants fathered by their tormentors. Much of the anger stems from fear. Boko Haram has used dozens of women and girls  \u2014   many not even in their teens  \u2014   as suicide bombers in recent months, killing hundreds of people in attacks on places like markets and schools. Girls have even been sent to blow themselves up in a camp like this one. Nigeria\u2019s military has made major progress against the militants. Soldiers have been taking back areas that were under Boko Haram control, and the military\u2019s victories have lifted the spirits of Nigerians who are daring to talk about a   Haram life. Hopes were raised further this week when one of the more than 200 girls kidnapped from their boarding school in the town of Chibok two years ago was found alive, wandering the forest. But the discovery also reinforced the lingering trauma facing former hostages: She was carrying an infant, accompanied by a man who claimed to be her husband and an escaped captive himself. The military said the man was actually a suspected Boko Haram fighter. As thousands of freed captives pour into the camps, a rift has developed between two classes of victims: the people who managed to evade the group\u2019s clutches, and those who did not. \u201cI will never trust them,\u201d said Adamu Isa, a market vendor, referring to anyone who had been held by Boko Haram. \u201cThe government should detain them for the rest of their lives. \u201d Even the missing schoolgirls, whose abduction helped rally the country against Boko Haram and focus international attention on the plight of Nigeria\u2019s victims, are not immune to the suspicion. At a recent meeting with camp dwellers, aid workers said that one man even insisted that the parents of the missing schoolgirls  reject their own daughters if they turn up. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered some extreme views,\u201d said Mohammed Ngubdo Hassan, executive director of the Herwa Community Development Initiative in Maiduguri. Millions of people across West Africa have been uprooted by Boko Haram and the sometimes ruthless military campaign against the group through the years. But most of the displaced managed to flee their homes before militants swarmed and subjected them to Boko Haram\u2019s harsh interpretation of Islamic rule. Typically, when Boko Haram fighters overtake a village, they kill many of the young men and boys who refuse to join their ranks. Women are often forced to cook for the fighters or are even trained to become suicide bombers. Some women and girls, like Zara, are forced into what the group calls \u201cmarriages. \u201d As in many conflicts in which rape becomes a weapon of war, the hostages sometimes bear the children of the fighters. These victims now face intense stigma, and in some cases brutal beatings, when they return to their communities, according to humanitarian groups. A recent Unicef report documented the distrust, quoting a community leader who called the babies fathered by fighters \u201chyenas among dogs. \u201d \u201cSome people will not accept a child of their enemy,\u201d said Abba Aji Kalli, a state coordinator for the Civilian Joint Task Force, a volunteer group that fights Boko Haram. At one of the camps, Hazida Ali seethed at the mention of anyone who had become a Boko Haram \u201cwife,\u201d as the women forced into marriages are often called. \u201cAll those women who lived with Boko Haram are also Boko Haram soldiers,\u201d Ms. Ali said. \u201cThe military should not make the mistake of releasing them. If they can\u2019t execute them, they should figure out what to do with them. \u201d \u201cThey should not be allowed to live alongside those who suffered,\u201d Ms. Ali added. The targets of such loathing include Rukkaiya, 13, whose round belly bulged through her dress in a camp here. She had been kidnapped while visiting her sister in a neighboring village. A fighter took her for his wife. \u201cI was so scared, but there was nothing I could do,\u201d Rukkaiya said. \u201cI kept praying to God to rescue me. \u201d She said she had no idea why she had stopped menstruating until after the military freed the village and she was able to ask a friend what might be wrong. Rukkaiya was devastated when she learned that she was pregnant with a fighter\u2019s baby. Her first thought was abortion. But after some reflection, she decided to keep the child. \u201cGod gave me this baby right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re facing this war. What good would it do to take another life?\u201d Hafsat Ibrahim was happily married with a    daughter when Boko Haram invaded her village. Militants killed her husband, taking her and her daughter, Amira, into the forest. Ms. Ibrahim was forced to marry a fighter. He was strong, she said, and raped her often. Yet he was good to Amira, she said, playing with her toes until she giggled. \u201cI didn\u2019t like him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me to have his baby, then I\u2019ll forget about my other husband. \u201d After Ms. Ibrahim gave birth to the child, it became clear that the military was on its way. The fighter begged her to flee with him, but she wanted a chance at freedom and insisted on staying with the infant girl. Before Ms. Ibrahim could protest, he grabbed Amira and ran away. The lineage of Ms. Ibrahim\u2019s baby, a      girl with pierced ears, is an open secret in the camp. Some people whisper about Ms. Ibrahim and are uncomfortable when she is nearby. \u201cSometimes they look at me in that way, but it\u2019s not the baby\u2019s fault,\u201d she said, describing the girl as a blessing from God. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have her, I\u2019d have no children at all. \u201d When Boko Haram took over Zara\u2019s village, she was 17. A fighter demanded that her parents turn her over to be married. Zara\u2019s mother objected, but her father relented, fearing that they would all be killed. The fighter took Zara to a home he had claimed in the village, a small shed where she became pregnant. \u201cHis dream was for me to have a baby boy,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have an insurgent\u2019s baby. \u201d Before she gave birth, he died in a battle with the Nigerian military, she said. Another fighter decided to marry her, moving her to a home with two other girls he had taken. He rotated among them, raping one each night. Zara\u2019s new husband did not want children, she said he wanted martyrdom for himself and his wives. \u201cHe wanted us to become suicide bombers,\u201d Zara said. \u201cHe told us it wouldn\u2019t be painful  \u2014   just like if an ant bites you. It wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, because we\u2019d have a better life in heaven. \u201d Zara resisted. To buy herself time, she told him to wait until the baby was a couple of months older. Before long, the military arrived, freeing the hostages. Zara said she loved her daughter. Even so, the girl resembles her father. It\u2019s an image Zara can\u2019t shake.'"}, "time": 1742563422.947236}
