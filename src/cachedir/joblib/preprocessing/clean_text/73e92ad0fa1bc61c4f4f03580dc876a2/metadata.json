And it didn\u2019t take long for social media users to accuse Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s of failing to include women of other ethnicities in its campaign. \u201cYoung, white and thin is what\u2019s sexy according to VS. Where\u2019s the racial diversity? Where\u2019s the size diversity  \u2026    . \u201d one Twitter user wrote. Young, white and thin is what\u2019s sexy according to VS.

(@corimyles) April 14, 2017,  It\u2019s not the first time Victoria Secret has been dragged online over issues of race and diversity. Last year, the Huffington Post called the womenswear brand\u2019s What is Sexy\u201d list \u201can arbitrary roundup of the \u2018sexiest\u2019 lips, legs, hair and eyeballs among women in the fashion and entertainment industries. \u201d \u201cBut telling us what a \u2018sexy\u2019 pair of lips looks like? Or worse, \u201csexy hair,\u201d can only serve to make women without that lipstick or without a full head of long hair feel less adequate and less worthy of being called sexy in their own right,\u201d HuffPo\u2019s Suzy Strutner wrote. In December, the intimate apparel retailer was accused of cultural appropriation and of designing \u201cracist lingerie by Cosmopolitan editor Helin Jung. \u201c[D]on\u2019t let yourself be hoodwinked by Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s brazen attempt to relabel what is clearly cultural appropriation by turning it into a celebration of \u2018culture,\u2019\u201d Jung wrote in a   article about the brand\u2019s use of different cultural aesthetics during its runway shows. \u201cThe brand and its creative leads shamelessly   imagery, breaking apart aesthetic references from wherever they wanted and stitching them back together again. They\u2019re telling us it\u2019s worldliness. It\u2019s not it\u2019s a hack job. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742564197.5625813}
