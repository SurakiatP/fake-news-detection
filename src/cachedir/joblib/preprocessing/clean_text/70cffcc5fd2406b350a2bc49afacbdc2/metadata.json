They\u2019re not educated to realize that they have power. The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. We are the government .\u201d \u2014John Lennon\\nHow do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being tasered, tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons, detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the government\u2019s excesses, abuses and power-grabs?\\nPolitics won\u2019t fix a system that is broken beyond repair.\\nNo matter who sits in the White House, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes.\\nRelying on the courts to restore justice seems futile.\\nIndeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. This is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the U.S. Supreme Court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution.\\nEven so, justice matters.\\nIt matters whether you\u2019re a rancher protesting a federal land-grab by the Bureau of Land Management, a Native American protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies, or an African-American taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen.\\nUnfortunately, protests and populist movements haven\u2019t done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries, dumb to our troubles, blind to our needs, and accountable to no one.\\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who the activists are (environmentalists, peaceniks, Native Americans, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, or the Bundys and their followers) or what the source of the discontent is (endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs), the government\u2019s modus operandi has remained the same: shut down the protests using all means available, prosecute First Amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law, and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities, labeling dissidents as extremists or terrorists, and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root.\\nThus, if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship, it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws, tactics and policies that are illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional.\\nJust recently, in fact, an Oregon jury rejected the government\u2019s attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a six-week, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.\\nIn finding the defendants not guilty\u2014of conspiracy to impede federal officers, of possession of firearms in a federal facility, and of stealing a government-owned truck\u2014the jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case: justice matters.\\nThe Malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility (their lawyers argued the guns were \u201cas much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans\u201d). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles (although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks, thereby preventing workers from performing their duties (as the Washington Post points out, this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist left-wingers and Earth First protesters ).\\nMany other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the Malheur Refuge, so what made the difference here?\\nThe jury made all the difference.\\nThese seven Oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions, sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government, and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them: common sense, compassion and the power of the jury box.\\nJury nullification works.\\nAs law professor Ilya Somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the \u201claw in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive .\u201d According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is \u201cpremised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished.\u201d\\nImagine that: a world where the citizenry\u2014not the government or its corporate controllers\u2014actually calls the shots and determines what is just.\\nIn a world of \u201c rampant overcriminalization ,\u201d where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day, jury nullification acts as \u201c a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization and the increasing network of confusing laws that are passed with neither the approval nor oftentimes even the knowledge of the citizenry.\u201d\\nIndeed, Butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises :\\nIf you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case, I recommend that you vote \u201cnot guilty\u201d \u2014 even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot, or sold it to another consenting adult. As a juror, you have this power under the Bill of Rights ; if you exercise it, you become part of a proud tradition of American jurors who helped make our laws fairer.\\nIn other words, it\u2019s \u201cwe the people\u201d who can and should be determining what laws are just, what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes.\\nNot only should the punishment fit the crime, but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profit-driven priorities of Corporate America.\\nThis is where the power of jury nullification is so critical: to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profit-driven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime.\\nOf course, the powers-that-be don\u2019t want the citizenry to know that it has any power at all.\\nThey would prefer that we remain clueless about the government\u2019s many illicit activities, ignorant about our constitutional rights, and powerless to bring about any real change.\\nIn an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoing\u2014police officers, elected officials, etc.\u2014are treated with general leniency, while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, jury nullification is a powerful reminder that, as the Constitution tells us, \u201cwe the people\u201d are the government.\\nFor too long we\u2019ve allowed our so-called \u201crepresentatives\u201d to call the shots. Now it\u2019s time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic: as the masters, not the servants.\\nNullification is one way of doing so.\\nVarious cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to \u201c claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded .\u201d\\nWhere nullification can be particularly powerful, however, is in the hands of the juror.\\nThe reality with which we must contend is that justice in America is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail.\\nFor the rest of us who are dependent on the \u201cfairness\u201d of the system, there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day. Police misconduct. Prosecutorial misconduct. Judicial bias. Inadequate defense. Prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice. Judges who care more about what is legal than what is just. Jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about life-and-death decisions. And an overwhelming body of laws, statutes and ordinances that render the average American a criminal, no matter how law-abiding they might think themselves.\\nIf you\u2019re to have any hope of remaining free\u2014and I use that word loosely\u2014your best bet remains in your fellow citizens.\\nYour fellow citizens may not know what the Constitution says (studies have shown Americans to be abysmally ignorant about their rights), they may not know what the laws are (there are so many on the books that the average American breaks three laws a day without knowing it), and they may not even believe in your innocence, but if you\u2019re lucky, those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand.\\nThat\u2019s ultimately what jury nullification is all about: restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice. It\u2019s the best protection for \u201cwe the people\u201d against the oppression and tyranny of the government, and God knows, we can use all the protection we can get. It\u2019s a powerful way to remind the government\u2014all of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge, jury and jailer over all that we are, have and do\u2014that we\u2019re the ones who set the rules.\\nWe could transform this nation if only Americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent.\\nUnfortunately, the government\u2019s divide and conquer tactics are working like a charm.\\nDespite the laundry list of grievances that should unite \u201cwe the people\u201d in common cause against the government, the nation is more divided than ever by politics, by socio-economics, by race, by religion, and by every other distinction that serves to highlight our differences.\\nThe real and manufactured events of recent years\u2014the invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, the shootings, the bombings, the military exercises and active shooter drills, the color-coded alerts and threat assessments, the fusion centers, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces, the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakers\u2014have all conjoined to create an environment in which \u201cwe the people\u201d are more divided, more distrustful, and fearful of each other.\\nWhat we have failed to realize is that in the eyes of the government, we\u2019re all the same.\\nIn other words, when it\u2019s time for the government to crack down\u2014and that time is coming\u2014it won\u2019t matter whether we supported Hillary or Trump, whether we stood with the pipeline protesters or opposed BLM, or whether we spoke out against government misconduct and injustice or remained silent.\\nWhen the government cracks down, we\u2019ll all suffer.\\nHere\u2019s the thing: the government wants a civil war.\\nThe objective: compliance and control.\\nIts strategy: destabilize the economy through endless wars, escalate racial tensions, polarize the populace, heighten tensions through a show of force, intensify the use of violence, and then, when all hell breaks loose, clamp down on the nation for the good of the people and the security of the nation.\\nThe government has been anticipating and preparing for such a civil uprising for some time now.\\nThose protests in Ferguson , Baltimore and Baton Rouge to protest police brutality? The militarized police \u201c clad in Kevlar vests, helmets, and camouflage, armed with pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, and tear gas \u201d turning towns into war zones? The kenneling of pipeline protesters in North Dakota?\\nThose were just dress rehearsals for the government to work out the kinks in its operating manual on how to deal with civil unrest.\\nThey were also previews of what\u2019s in store if we continue to challenge the powers-that-be.\\nAfter all, it\u2019s hard to persuade anyone to stand against tyranny when all you can promise them as a reward is persecution, prosecution and a one-way trip to the morgue. And when the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusion\u2014the government always wins\u2014it can seem pointless, even foolhardy, to dare to challenge the system.\\nSo how do you not only push back against the police state\u2019s bureaucracy, corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means?\\nYou start by changing the rules and engaging in some (nonviolent) guerilla tactics.\\nEmploy militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , which Martin Luther King Jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins, boycotts and marches.\\nTake part in grassroots activism, which takes a trickle-up approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level (in other words, think nationally, but act locally).\\nAnd then, as I explain in more detail in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , nullify everything. Nullify the court cases. Nullify the laws. Nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional.
