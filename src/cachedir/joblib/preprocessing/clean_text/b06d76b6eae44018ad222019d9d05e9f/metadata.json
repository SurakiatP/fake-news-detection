[Flynn specifically referred to the Iranian regime\u2019s \u201cprovocative ballistic launch\u201d after the government conducted a test of a missile, as well as their support of Houthi militants who attacked a Saudi naval vessel.  \u201cAs of today we are officially putting Iran on notice,\u201d Flynn said at the White House press briefing on Wednesday. Flynn\u2019s statement was short, but a senior administration official answered followup questions about the statement to reporters at the White House later in the afternoon. The official said there was a \u201clarge number of options that were available\u201d to the administration and signaled that they would take \u201cappropriate actions\u201d in response to Iran\u2019s behavior. \u201cWe consider these actions to be inherently destabilizing and a threat to our friends and our allies, and it\u2019s   to the goals of the region,\u201d the official said. But the official would only confirm that a deliberative process had begun regarding how to respond, and he offered few additional details. The message, however, was clear  \u2014   the administration wanted to send a signal that there was a different president in the White House who would have a different relationship with Iran than former President Obama. \u201cWe are considering these things on a different perspective,\u201d the official noted. The official explained that Gen. Flynn delivered the message because the administration felt that it was important to send it directly from the White House, not through diplomacy at the State Department. \u201cIt reflects the level of importance that this administration believes this issue warrants,\u201d the official explained.
