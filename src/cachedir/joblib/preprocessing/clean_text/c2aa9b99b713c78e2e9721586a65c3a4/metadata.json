Rajpreet Heir was taking the L train to a friend\u2019s birthday party in Manhattan this month when a white man began shouting at her. \u201cDo you even know what a Marine looks like?\u201d the man asked Ms. Heir, who is pictured in the video above. \u201cDo you know what they have to see? What they do for this country? Because of people like you. \u201d He told Ms. Heir, who is Sikh and was born in Indiana, that he hoped she was sent \u201cback to Lebanon\u201d and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in this country. \u201d As New York City works to respond to a rise in reports of discrimination and harassment, subways have emerged as a source of special concern. Harassment has long been a problem on subways, in part because many strangers are packed together on narrow cars, sometimes for long periods. \u201cEven in a park, you\u2019re not going to be quite that close together,\u201d said Emily May, the executive director of the   group Hollaback. But since the election, the group has received nearly double the usual number of reports of harassment on the subway, and more than usual involve racist, Islamophobic or   comments. The New York City Commission on Human Rights was concerned enough about postelection incidents on subways that it organized an outreach day in December, with handouts on religious discrimination and reporting harassment distributed at eight subway stations. Overall, the commission saw a 480 percent increase in claims of discriminatory harassment between 2015 and 2016. For Sarah   the shock of being singled out for a racist attack was compounded by the fact that no one stepped in to help her. She was riding the train to work one morning in   when a man began elbowing her in the back. When Ms.   who is black, asked him to stop, he said, \u201cObama\u2019s term is over. \u201d Then the man, who was   delivered an angry rant that included a comment about \u201c  slaves. \u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected somebody to confront him, necessarily,\u201d she said. But even someone making eye contact with the man, she said, would have sent the message that his behavior was unacceptable. Harassment can be more traumatic when no one steps in to help, Ms. May said, and people who have experienced it are more likely to wish a bystander had spoken up than that police had gotten involved. Two fellow passengers stepped in to help Ms. Heir after the incident on the L train. One woman tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she was all right. \u201cThat meant something,\u201d Ms. Heir said, \u201cbecause when you\u2019re a minority, you\u2019re so used to just experiencing things on your own. \u201d Another woman reported the incident to a police officer at a subway station. Anyone who witnesses or experiences harassment on the subway can report it to the city\u2019s human rights commission by calling (718)  . Communities Against Hate, a partnership of 11 civil rights organizations, operates a hotline at     (  ) where people who have been harassed can get information about resources like legal services and counseling. Hollaback and other organizations offer bystander intervention training to help people learn what to do if they see someone being harassed. Ms.   reported what happened to her on the subway to the Documenting Hate project, a group of organizations  \u2014   including The New York Times opinion section  \u2014   tracking hate crimes and harassment since the election. She also posted about the incident on Facebook and talked to her children and their teachers about it. She wanted people to understand how to protect themselves and others, she said. \u201cWe actually all have a responsibility to create the society we want. \u201d If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project. The form is not a report to law enforcement or any government agency. These resources may be helpful for people who have experienced harassment.
