{"duration": 0.19842123985290527, "input_args": {"text": "'Consider this a primer on everything you need to know about one of the most important events of the fall season: the Metropolitan Opera premiere of Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin\u201d on Thursday, Dec. 1. (It runs through Dec. 29.) WHY IT\u2019S A BIG DEAL For a couple of reasons. Even as the Met has slowly modernized its offerings in recent years, it still does far less contemporary opera than major European companies. And \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin,\u201d which had its premiere at the Salzburg Festival in Austria in 2000, has since become one of the most acclaimed and widely performed works of the 21st century. The Met may be late to the party on this one, but it\u2019s still an arrival worth celebrating. Another important aspect relates to its composer\u2019s gender. The Met hasn\u2019t performed an opera written by a woman since Ethel Smyth\u2019s \u201cDer Wald\u201d in 1903. (Read that sentence one more time, and think about it hard.) So it\u2019s a major statement for the company to be adding Ms. Saariaho\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin\u201d to its history  \u2014   though this is a slightly delicate matter, since she has long resisted being categorized (read: ghettoized) as a \u201cfemale composer. \u201d WHO SHE IS Born in Helsinki in 1952, Ms. Saariaho has long experimented with incorporating electronics and technology into her work, without ever abandoning the resources and colors of traditional instruments. (For one piece, she developed a special microphone to individually amplify each of a cello\u2019s four strings.) There are fewer recognizable melodies in her music than there are shimmering, changeable textures, and sudden whirlpools of violence and activity. But even if they\u2019re not necessarily catchy, her vocal lines are lush and intense, well suited to the love and longing in \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin. \u201d WHAT IT\u2019S ABOUT Ms. Saariaho, working with the writer Amin Maalouf, created a stylized version of the life of a historical figure, the   troubadour Jaufr\u00e9 Rudel. A wealthy prince in Aquitaine, Jaufr\u00e9 is tired of his dissolute aristocratic life and, spurred by a pilgrim\u2019s tale, falls in love with someone he\u2019s never met: Cl\u00e9mence, the Countess of Tripoli. He avoids meeting her, though, fearing that that would ruin the purity of his \u201camour de loin\u201d (\u201clove from afar\u201d). The story couldn\u2019t be simpler, and the opera deepens not through the complexity of the plot, but from the emotional weight of living with these characters in a kind of contemplative stillness. (We aren\u2019t in \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d anymore, Toto. \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin\u201d feels more like it\u2019s suspended in space.) The work moves back and forth, like a kind of pendulum, from Jaufr\u00e9 (a baritone role) to Cl\u00e9mence (soprano) with the Pilgrim ( ) acting as   transmitting the  \u2019s songs to the countess. POLITICAL RESONANCES \u201cThough it was not intended as such,\u201d Anthony Tommasini wrote in his review of the 2000 premiere in The New York Times, \u201c\u2018L\u2019Amour de Loin\u2019 provides a jolt of sanity amid the political conflicts that of late have been rattling the world, Austria in particular, over issues of nationality, immigration, the sanctity of borders and the cultural gulf between the West and the East. \u201d And in an interview with The Times in 2002, Ms. Saariaho said: \u201cIn the midst of composing it, I understood that it was also my story. I was at once the troubadour and the lady, these two parts of me that I try to reconcile in my life. To write music, concentration is necessary, an interior hearing. To be a woman, to be a mother, one needs to be always available and busy. It\u2019s difficult to have, at the same time, your feet on the ground and your head in the sky. \u201d WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE There always seems to be a kind of metallic shimmer over the score, or perhaps a sheen of iridescent sea foam. Ms. Saariaho has always been adept at weaving together acoustic and electronic sounds, and here she adds tastes of medieval harmonies and North African rhythms. It\u2019s a     sinuous landscape, punctuated by dramatic orchestral explosions. While there are only three soloists, a chorus and powerful orchestra make this a very grand intimate opera. In Jaufr\u00e9\u2019s music, the oboe and low strings are prominent, with harp chords connected to what would have been his instrument, the lute. Cl\u00e9mence\u2019s world is brighter, its string textures higher. Ms. Saariaho conceived the two characters as having different harmonic languages that eventually merge. But, she said in a recent phone interview, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to know music theory to perceive it. My music is written for ears you don\u2019t need to intellectualize it. You just need to let yourself enter. \u201d Reviewing the 2000 premiere, Mr. Tommasini wrote: \u201cMs. Saariaho has provided a lushly beautiful score, structured in five continuous acts lasting two hours. \u201d (It should be noted that the Met will perform it with an intermission.) \u201cBest known for her explorations of sound, Ms. Saariaho continues in that vein here with music that combines vivid orchestration, the subtle use of electronic instruments and imaginative, sometimes unearthly writing for chorus, which sings from the side of the stage. The vocal writing is by turns elegiac and conversational. Her harmonic language is tonally grounded, with frequent use of sustained low pedal tones, but not tonal. Bits of dissonance, piercing overtones and gently jarring electronic sounds spike the undulant harmonies, but so subtly that the overall aural impression is of beguiling consonance. \u201d BUT Mr. Tommasini added: \u201cThe music sometimes lacks urgency. Stretches of the score pass by, beautiful, yes, but lacking in profile, just orchestral backdrops for the singer\u2019s reflections. \u201d DO I NEED TO PREPARE? The short answer is no: All you need to enjoy this opera is a couple of hours and an open mind. But of course it can only be rewarding to listen to some of Ms. Saariaho\u2019s music beforehand to get a sense of her sound world. The haunting vocal works she wrote in the years leading up to \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin\u201d are gorgeous, among them \u201cLonh\u201d (\u201cAfar\u201d) a setting of Jaufr\u00e9 Rudel\u2019s poetry for soprano and live electronics from 1996 \u201cCh\u00e2teau de l\u2019\u00c2me\u201d (1996) \u201cMiranda\u2019s Lament\u201d (1997) and \u201cOltra Mar\u201d (1999) for chorus. WHAT INFLUENCED IT \u201cBefore I had the story,\u201d Ms. Saariaho said by phone, \u201cI was already thinking about how to express these two very universal things and big mysteries of internal life which are love and death. \u201d An impossible love shot through with the death drive, presented through lush, contemplative music? Yes, Wagner\u2019s \u201cTristan und Isolde\u201d (already heard at the Met this season) makes its presence felt in \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin,\u201d as it does in much of modern opera. The stylized, dreamlike quality of Debussy\u2019s \u201cPell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande,\u201d its sense of shifting mists of sound that can suddenly coalesce in furious energy, is also a clear precursor. Messiaen\u2019s \u201cSt. Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assise,\u201d ruminative and largely interior, made an important impression on Ms. Saariaho, who had doubted that she had the traditional operatic gift for narrative thrust. WHO\u2019S IN THE CAST Cl\u00e9mence will be sung by the bright young soprano Susanna Phillips, who\u2019s mostly performed at the Met in Mozart operas. (The role was written for Dawn Upshaw, known for the purity of her tone.) The   Eric Owens, who had a breakthrough with the company as the malevolent dwarf Alberich in Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing\u201d cycle, may put that gift for moodiness (and his smoky voice) to good use as Jaufr\u00e9. Tamara Mumford, with her rich, plummy mezzo, will be the Pilgrim. And the Met\u2019s exceptionally versatile chorus takes a crucial role here as, Ms. Saariaho explained, \u201cthe sonic bridge between the soloists and the orchestra. \u201d WHO\u2019S CONDUCTING Almost as exciting as the Met premiere of \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin\u201d is the company debut of Susanna Malkki, a conductor of wide range who has nevertheless made contemporary music something of a specialty. Recently installed as music director of her hometown Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, she also led the New York Philharmonic for the first time last year. Since the Met has been barely better at attracting female conductors than female composers, to have the two finally together in a single production does feel, yes, like the breaking of a glass ceiling. WHO\u2019S DIRECTING Robert Lepage, the Canadian master of theatrical spectacle, declined the opportunity to direct the Salzburg premiere of \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin,\u201d but he\u2019s now getting a second chance. His work hasn\u2019t been seen at the Met since the last outing, in the spring of 2013, of his     production of Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing\u201d cycle. (Remember the massive set of mechanical seesaws that never seemed to work quite right?) If that \u201cRing\u201d was widely considered a failure  \u2014   \u201cPound for pound, ton for ton, it is the most witless and wasteful production in modern operatic history,\u201d Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker  \u2014   it didn\u2019t sway the loyalty of Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager. He has brought Mr. Lepage back for Ms. Saariaho\u2019s far more intimate, restrained and, well, short work, and the staging at least looks transfixing, with a Mediterranean created through LEDs. THE OPERA IS DEDICATED TO Gerard Mortier, one of the great impresarios of modern operatic history, who died in 2014. He shook up the stodgy Salzburg Festival when he took over its leadership in the early 1990s, and after the premiere of \u201cLonh,\u201d at Salzburg in 1996, he proposed to Ms. Saariaho the idea of writing the opera that became \u201cL\u2019Amour de Loin. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563984.957993}
