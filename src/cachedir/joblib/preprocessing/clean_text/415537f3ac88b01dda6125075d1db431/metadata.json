This strategy has spelled the company\u2019s tremendous success across the globe. \\nOccasionally, Apple immerses itself in politics and the current political atmosphere following the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president is one of those times. \\nBy now, the term Alt-Right (Alternative Right) has become a familiar phrase especially on social media. \\nThe Alternative Right, commonly known as the Alt-Right, is a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that \u201cwhite identity\u201d is under attack by multicultural forces using \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and \u201csocial justice\u201d to undermine white people and \u201ctheir\u201d civilization. Characterized by heavy use of social media and online memes, Alt-Righters eschew \u201cestablishment\u201d conservatism, skew young, and embrace white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value. \\nIn keeping up with this new political atmosphere, Apple has just announced that it will be replacing all keyboards on its desktops, laptops, iPhones and iPads with a new design that adds the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d key. The key will be located in the lowermost right corner of the keyboard. How appropriate \\nApple CEO Tim Cook said that the addition of this all-important key will enable those who subscribe to the Alternative Right ideologies (and idiosyncrasies) to identify themselves when sending emails, texts or posting on social media. Hitting the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d key will automatically add the hashtag #AlternativeRight to whatever a person is typing on the keyboard. \\nWelcome to the 22nd century!
