{"duration": 0.08117294311523438, "input_args": {"text": "'It seemed like an innocent enough announcement: Michael Strahan, the former football player turned television personality, was shifting assignments on ABC\u2019s morning lineup, the network said Tuesday. He would leave \u201cLive With Kelly and Michael\u201d in September to become a   on \u201cGood Morning America. \u201d But there was rancor behind the scenes. Mr. Strahan\u2019s   Kelly Ripa, was told of the move just minutes before the announcement, and felt blindsided, said a person who has spoken to her about ABC\u2019s decision. And she made little attempt to conceal her displeasure, skipping Wednesday\u2019s edition on \u201cLive. \u201d ABC said she would not appear on the show for the rest of the week and would be replaced by Erin Andrews. Ms. Ripa\u2019s absence Wednesday forced Mr. Strahan into the awkward position of addressing the news of his departure with a guest host, Ana Gasteyer, a former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member. After Mr. Strahan and Ms. Gasteyer danced their way to the hosts\u2019 desk on the \u201cLive\u201d set, Mr. Strahan said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in the news lately,\u201d before formally announcing that he was leaving. For ABC, what was supposed to be a boost to its morning lineup is instead developing into a giant headache with one of its most prominent stars. Ms. Ripa, who joined the show in 2001, replacing Kathy Lee Gifford, has developed a loyal following of her own. In addition to Ms. Ripa\u2019s apparent displeasure, \u201cGood Morning America\u201d is also presenting the network with cause for concern. Though it remains the   morning show, it\u2019s down 10 percent in total viewers and 18 percent in the      demographic important to advertisers. It is second in that age bracket to NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d a show that experienced its own ratings difficulties four years ago when it botched Ann Curry\u2019s departure. When Mr. Strahan does join \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in a   role in September, he will be accustomed to the surroundings. He began as an   correspondent for \u201cGood Morning America\u201d two years ago, a decision that Ms. Ripa expressed concerns about at the time, according to the person. Ms. Ripa was worried it would distract him from \u201cLive\u201d but was reassured it would only be a temporary position. Mr. Strahan continued to appear on the morning show, and ABC executives recently decided that bringing him into the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d lineup could help stem the ratings drop. After \u201cLive\u201d ended on Tuesday morning, Ms. Ripa was called to a meeting along with the show\u2019s longtime producer, Michael Gelman, and the WABC general manager, Dave Davis (the show is produced by WABC, and it is distributed by ABC and Disney\u2019s syndication group). She did not know the purpose of the meeting. After a   wait, Mr. Strahan entered the room and broke the news that he was leaving. It wasn\u2019t long before tensions flared. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you this was going to happen?\u201d Ms. Ripa said to Mr. Davis at the meeting, according to the person. \u201cI told you two years ago this was going to happen. \u201d A few minutes after the meeting ended, ABC publicly announced Mr. Strahan\u2019s departure. Ms. Ripa later let the network know she would not appear on Wednesday. Ms. Ripa was angry, this person said, because she perceived that \u201cGood Morning America\u201d was being given priority over \u201cLive. \u201d Ms. Ripa declined to comment. Ms. Ripa was similarly caught off guard in 2011 when Regis Philbin informed her 20 minutes before show time that he was going to announce his departure on that edition of \u201cLive. \u201d After Mr. Philbin left the show, \u201cLive\u201d began an open casting call to replace him, cycling in more than a dozen potential   to sit beside Ms. Ripa. After 10 months, ABC selected Mr. Strahan, who is also a commentator on Fox\u2019s N. F. L. pregame show. In a statement, an ABC spokeswoman said: \u201c\u2018Live\u2019 continues to be a vibrant and enduring franchise under our lead host, the extraordinarily talented Kelly Ripa. \u2018Live\u2019 has successfully transitioned   twice before and will do so again. Together with Kelly, ABC and the \u2018Live\u2019 team will begin a new search to find a replacement for Michael. \u201d It appears that Ms. Ripa\u2019s absence will be an extended one: \u201cLive\u201d is not scheduled to shoot on Friday and she had already arranged to take Monday off for a long weekend to celebrate her 20thwedding anniversary, the person said. Friday\u2019s show will be taped on Thursday, so Ms. Andrews will appear for the next two editions of \u201cLive. \u201d Ms. Ripa will be replaced by the \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d actress Shay Mitchell on Monday, an ABC spokeswoman said.'"}, "time": 1742564282.4576519}
