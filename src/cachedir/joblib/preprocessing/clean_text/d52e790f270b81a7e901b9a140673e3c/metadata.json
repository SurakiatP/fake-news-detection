The 12th falls on the 96th anniversary of Lenin\u2019s call to deploy Russian communists to start civil wars around the world. [In a \u201cworkers of the world unite \u201cfor corporate interests, Amazon\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos has mobilized big tech corporate support from Mozilla, Reddit, Kickstarter, Etsy and Vimeo to fill the streets with   allies from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Greenpeace.  The Day of Action seeks to upend the May 18 vote by FCC Republican Commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O\u2019Reilly, over the opposition by Democrat Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, to overturn the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 adoption of \u201cNet Neutrality. \u201d The Democrats\u2019 regulatory regime gave the U. S. government the effective right to take control of the Internet, create new taxation authority, and regulate the \u201cfairness\u201d of political thought under rules that once applied to the old ATT telephone monopoly. Under federal administrative law, the   FCC rule change allows a   initial public comment until July 17, and then another 30 days for replies to those comments by Aug. 16. Advocates of Net Neutrality called it a democratizing principle. But opponents complained that under Net Neutrality, corporate interests like Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s YouTube could make huge profits by clogging cable delivery pipes with enormous amounts of data at no cost. The   publication The Nation classified the February 2015   FCC majority\u2019s passage of \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d as \u201cpeople power.\u201c But it appeared to be more about the \u201ccorporate power\u201d that funded a record $139. 5 million in lobbying expenses by computer and Internet companies to influence the biggest regulatory expansion in decades. Naming July 12th the \u201cDay of Action\u201d will conjure 96th anniversary of the release of Vladimir Lenin\u2019s Report on the Tactics of the Revolutionary Communist Party. Soviets cadres had believed that once Russian workers overthrew capitalism, it would cause spontaneous uprisings by the workers of the world that would quickly sweep capitalism into the dustbin of history. But after four years and no more worldwide revolutions, Lenin used the July 12, 1921 conclusion of the \u201cThird Congress of The Communist International\u201d publish Tactics to encourage Russian communists to export \u201ccivil war\u201d and \u201copenly revolutionary uprisings. \u201d July 12, 1948 was also the day President Truman used the Democratic Party Platform to expand Marshall Plan to fight communism: \u201cOurs is the party under which were conceived the instruments for resisting Communist aggression and for rebuilding the economic strength of the democratic countries of Europe and Asia  \u2014   the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. \u201d   protests against Trump administration policies have been led by Antifa (antifascist) groups who wear black clothing and   as well as scarves, sunglasses, ski masks and motorcycle helmets. Antifa forces shut down Berkeley in April and May by using fists,   pepper spray and heavy bike locks to prevent presentations by conservative speakers. The Urban Dictionary describes Antifa as: \u201c  champagne    white boys who don\u2019t like nationalists or fascists. They consider themselves to be rebelling against the establishment, whilst upholding all of its   correct views. \u201d By uniting corporate and social justice forces for a July 12 \u201cDay of Action,\u201d just days before the end of the FCC comment period to oppose dumping Net Neutrality, Silicon Valley could fill the streets of America\u2019s biggest cities with large and potentially violent protests.'"}, "time": 1742562040.2453985}
