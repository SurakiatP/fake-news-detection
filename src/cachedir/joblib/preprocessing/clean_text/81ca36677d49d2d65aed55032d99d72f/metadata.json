[The NFL has recently endeavored to spice things up and enhance the entertainment value of the draft. Long gone are the days of a bunch of       football nerds sitting around a hotel ballroom calmly scribbling names on sheets of paper, to be carried by runner to the commissioner at the podium so he could announce the name of the player in which the franchise had entrusted its future hopes and dreams.  Oh no, say goodbye to suspender moustache guy, and say hello to skinny jean wearing,   having purveyor of social media guy. In short, the draft has become an entertainment event geared towards the   NFL fan. An entertainment event that, especially in light of the recent,   financial demise of ESPN, has to attract   viewers in order to draw ratings and raise revenues. One of the new entertainment innovations of the marketing and advertising department of the NFL Network was to have   draft pick announcements made  . The Texans had their draft picks read from the International Space Station, the Chiefs had picks read from Whiteman Air Force Base, and the Colts had their picks made by  \u2026    well  \u2026    an orangutan at the Indianapolis Zoo. The orangutan announcing the #Colts selection is the pick of the #NFLDraft pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jeffrey Kahn 247 (@jkahn247) April 29, 2017,  This latter innovation did not sit well with Mayock. Following prompts from a zookeeper, the orangutan then tapped a TV screen, which then displayed the name of the player the Colts had selected. Funny, right? I thought so. Mike Mayock did not. According to Pro Football Talk, Mayock said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going back to the zoo, I\u2019m walking off the desk. I\u2019ve about had the zoo, OK? Enough. Enough. I mean, is this good TV?\u201d NFL Network\u2019s Rich Eisen introduced the zoo segment with some sarcasm, saying, \u201cIf we don\u2019t go to the zoo, the world will stop spinning. \u201d When the orangutan revealed the Colts\u2019 selection of defensive tackle Grover Stewart, Mayock indicated he thought it was unfair to Stewart to turn one of the most significant moments of his life into a circus. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be a little respectful,\u201d Mayock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day for Grover Stewart, and rather than talking about that chimp, let\u2019s get back to some football here. It\u2019s a big day for him. \u201d While one can certainly see how having an orangutan announce the fulfillment of your life\u2019s dream to reach the NFL could be considered disrespectful, at some point Mayock also has to understand that he\u2019s in the entertainment business, and not just the sports business, which is something that\u2019s probably quite easy to forget when you\u2019ve been immersed in game tape and analysis of over 400 draft prospects for the last several months. The financial collapse of ESPN has heralded in the start of a new era for much of the sports world. Gone are the salad days when you could just name a price and the   monster would pay it, then eagerly ask for more. Sports leagues and their affiliated news networks can\u2019t be lazy anymore, relying on the financial largesse of the \u201cMagic Kingdom. \u201d Instead, they\u2019re going to have to make their products more entertaining, lucrative, and productive in order to pay the freight. Does that mean the NFL Network did the right thing in having an orangutan announce a draft pick? No. Personally, I found it funny and thought Mayock completely overreacted about a moment of levity in the midst of      bonanza about football players, the overwhelming majority of whom the country has never heard of before. Maybe I\u2019ve got that wrong, and that\u2019s fine. Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t have wrong: Gimmicky draft selection ideas aren\u2019t going away, and Mike Mayock will not be receiving a Christmas card from the Indianapolis Zoo anytime soon.
