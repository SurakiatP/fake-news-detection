WikiLeaks\u2019 editor-in-chief says that despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in U.S. elections, his organisation will keep on publishing until the elections are over. \\nVia YourNewsWire SPONSORED LINKS \\n\u201cEveryday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict,\u201d Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. Scroll Down For Video Below! \\nThe whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. Assange claimed the release \u201cwhipped up a crazed hornet\u2019s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign\u201d leading them to attack WikiLeaks. \\n\u201cThey attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,\u201d he added. \\nEcuador\u2019s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a \u201cstrategic position\u201d so that its \u201cpolicy of non-intervention can\u2019t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.\u201d He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month.

WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. \\nHe did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, \u201cthis is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process \u2013 for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.\u201d \\nHe also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being \u201ccontrolled by Clinton supporters.\u201c We were fastest on #Podestaemails6 , faster than @wikileaks , and the US conspiracy machine can\u2019t handle it https://t.co/njAae50qDd \\n\u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 13, 2016 \\nThe Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \\nAssange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing \u201cwhat in their mind is white trash.\u201d\""}, "time": 1742563562.2069967}
