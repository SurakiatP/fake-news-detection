Clinton is in serious trouble.\\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 1, 2016 \\n\\nThere is speculation that Dotcom is referring to the 33,000 missing Clinton emails\u2026and that someone has them (possibly WikiLeaks) and will be releasing them soon.\\nFrom The New Zealand Herald :\\nDotcom has previously hinted that Wikileaks is in possession of the missing emails, which Clinton acknowledged erasing rather than turning over to the State Department upon her retirement, claiming they were not work-related.\\nDotcom last week made a joking reference to the BleachBit software Clinton used to delete the emails, writing \u201cBleachbit(ch) can\u2019t bleach it.\u201d\\nShortly after, he then tweeted directly at Wikileaks writing \u201cOh no!\u201d with a video of him reacting to audio saying \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail.\u201d\\nAnd days before on October 27, he wrote that he knew where the deleted emails are and how to get them legally.\\n\u201cI know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump. 100% true. Retweet,\u201d he wrote.\\nDotcom pointed out something many have wondered about\u2026\\n\u201cThey are all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah. Congress or Senate can request the emails from the NSA.\u201d\\nWilliam Binney, architect of NSA mass surveillance system has confirmed that the NSA must have the deleted Clinton emails, by design. @FBI \\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 30, 2016 \\n\\nI think the FBI has found Clintons deleted emails in NSA spy cloud and now use Wiener laptop as a front to protect NSA secrets. Fine by me \\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 31, 2016 \\n\\nLast year, Dotcom \u2013 who has a long-standing relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange \u2013 said that Assange would be Clinton\u2019s worst nightmare in 2016 because he \u201chas access to information.\u201d\\nThe FBI is currently searching a laptop that belonged to Anthony Weiner, Clinton aide Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband, for any emails from Clinton\u2019s private server.\\nDotcom just might be the most fascinating person on Twitter. Take a look at some other things he\u2019s had to say lately\u2026\\nHillary, who signed my extradition request, will get busted by the same mass surveillance system the US Govt used to spy on me unlawfully.\\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 28, 2016 \\n\\nThe US Govt keeps underestimating the strength of oppressed people who'll fight for what's right even if it results in their crucifixion.\\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 28, 2016 \\n\\nWikileaks will deliver. #LockHerUp pic.twitter.com/jIUSOEWyEv \\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 30, 2016 \\nDelivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by Lily Dane of The Daily Sheeple . \\nLily Dane is a staff writer for The Daily Sheeple.
