[At 8:40 p. m. EDT, the U. S. launched 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles at the Shayrat Airfield located in the Homs Governorate in Western Syria, according to Pentagon officials. The strike lasted minutes.  \u201cThis was in response to the Syrian chemical weapons attack April 4th in Khan Sheikhoun  \u2026     That attack killed and injured hundreds of innocent Syrian people, including women and children,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis. \u201cThe strikes were intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again,\u201d he said. The missiles were launched from U. S. destroyers USS Porter and Ross, which were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea at the time, he said. The missiles hit aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems and radars, he said. Davis said the U. S. military took care to avoid any human casualties. It notified Russia  \u2014   and \u201cmany countries\u201d  \u2014   of the planned strikes ahead of time. There were Russian troops at the airbase, although it\u2019 is not clear if they were still there during the strikes. Davis said the U. S. struck an area where Russian and Syrian troops were not located. \u201cIn this case in particular, every precaution was taken to execute these strikes with minimal risk to personnel at the airfield,\u201d Davis said. The strike was aimed at deterring another chemical weapons attack by the regime. The airbase was the same one the regime used to carry out the chemical weapons attack, Davis said. The U. S. military said it tracked the two aircraft that the regime used to conduct the attacks. The airbase also housed one of Syria\u2019s main chemical weapons storage facility prior to 2013, he said. Trump had hinted on Wednesday during a Rose Garden briefing with the King of Jordan that he would take action against the regime. He said the attack had crossed \u201cmany, many lines, beyond a red line  \u2014   many, many lines. \u201d \u201cThat attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me. Big impact,\u201d Trump had said. \u201cThat was a horrible, horrible thing, and I\u2019ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn\u2019t get any worse than that. \u201d Trump reportedly spoke with lawmakers before the strike. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) called on the president to come to Congress to seek congressional authorization for military action in Syria. \u201cWhile we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the US was not attacked,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe President needs congressional authorization for military action and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate on our role. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different. \u201d Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) called Syrian President Bashar   a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cpuppet of Russia and Iran\u201d but said he looked forward to the president \u201cmaking the case to Congress and the American people\u201d in the days ahead. Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic defense hawks praised the airstrikes. \u201cUnlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,\u201d said Sens. John McCain ( ) and Lindsey Graham ( ). \u201cI think it was an important step,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said on CNN. \u201cThis was not some symbolic measure. \u201d \u201cI support the admin\u2019s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches Assad not to use chemical weapons again,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson ( ). In a statement, President Trump explained the urgency behind the strikes: My fellow Americans, on Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar   launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many, even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where a chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital, national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the U. N. Security Council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad\u2019s behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies. Tonight I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for God\u2019s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed and we hope that as long as America stands for justice, that peace and harmony will, in the end, prevail. Good night and God bless America and the entire world. Thank you.  '"}, "time": 1742561847.6065326}
