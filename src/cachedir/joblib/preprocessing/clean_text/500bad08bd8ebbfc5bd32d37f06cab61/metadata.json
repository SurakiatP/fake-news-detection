It is an annual tradition, as is Ms. Holton\u2019s practice of making the adults hand over all their grocery store receipts. She ensures that every household, factoring in the number of children, has paid not a dollar more or less than its fair share. \u201cShe is not the accountant, she\u2019s the judge,\u201d said her brother Dwight Holton, a former United States attorney in Oregon. \u201cNo one has ever questioned her Solomonic wisdom. \u201d The daughter of a governor who grew up to marry a man who became governor, senator and now   nominee, Ms. Holton has lived since childhood in a world of politics and power. But relatives and friends describe her as being uncommonly unimpressed by the trappings of privilege and instead driven by an almost religious sense of fairness, an aversion to idleness and a   commitment to service that has helped elevate her into   of Virginia\u2019s most famous power couple. As a child, Ms. Holton, 58, had a symbolic role in helping integrate Virginia\u2019s public schools before graduating from Princeton and meeting Mr. Kaine at Harvard Law School. As he rose up Virginia\u2019s political ladder, she achieved renown in her own right as a legal aid lawyer, family court judge and Virginia\u2019s secretary of education, a job she resigned once her husband was chosen as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. In some ways, Ms. Holton, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for her husband in the Senate, represents Mrs. Clinton\u2019s road not taken, continuing to pursue her career throughout her husband\u2019s ascent rather than waiting her turn. But now those roads have converged on the presidential campaign trail, with Ms. Holton sharing stages with the Clintons and amplifying her husband\u2019s high school teacher vibe with her Everywoman appeal. In a backstage holding room after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s acceptance speech last Thursday, Mr. Kaine broke out his harmonica, one of his hobbies, and goaded his wife into one of hers, clog dancing. On the trail, Ms. Holton is a staple at her husband\u2019s side, monitoring his speeches, giving him encouraging smiles and offering remarks in her lilting accent. \u201cShe has been around politics a looong time,\u201d said Tom Wolf, Mr. Kaine\u2019s former law partner and a friend of the family. \u201cAnd she knows what it\u2019s about and knows what needs to be done. \u201d Ms. Holton, who declined to be interviewed, first moved into the Virginia executive mansion in 1970 as the    daughter of Gov. A. Linwood Holton Jr. a Republican, and his wife, Virginia, known as Jinks. She enrolled at a prestigious grade school recommended to her parents by their   friends. Many children at school wanted to attach themselves to her because of who her father was. \u201cShe called them \u2018Buggy Friends,\u2019\u201d recalled her brother Woody, because they were constantly bugging her to visit the mansion. Status seeking, he said, was not a value instilled by their father. Instead, the children were roused from their comfortable beds every morning with refrains of \u201cIt\u2019s opportunity time! Let\u2019s go get \u2019em. \u201d A Presbyterian, he gave each of his four children Bibles with underlined passages about the good Samaritan. The lessons stuck. When a lightning strike in 1968 killed the daughter of the sitting governor, Ms. Holton started the Becky Godwin Club in the girl\u2019s honor. The club specialized in good Samaritan deeds, like playing with and raising money for a developmentally disabled girl down the block. When a federal judge ordered the desegregation of Virginia schools, Governor Holton sent his children to Mosby Middle, an   public school. He also made sure to alert the news media. \u201cDad is like Tim in this way,\u201d said Woody Holton, a historian at the University of South Carolina and the author of an acclaimed biography of the first lady Abigail Adams. \u201cThey both are really good social justice people, but they also understand that you better call reporters. \u201d A photograph of Anne\u2019s older sister, Tayloe, being escorted into the school by her father became an iconic image, though Woody Holton said she \u201cwas mad because Tayloe was becoming famous wearing Anne\u2019s dress. \u201d At Mosby, Ms. Holton, then 12, showed a middle child\u2019s talent for getting along with people, starting a cheerleading squad and making friends. She also gave a tour of the mansion to   Slaughter, another    who would go on to be a foreign policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, and whose best friend was the daughter of the Democrat that Linwood Holton beat in the governor\u2019s race. \u201cShe was very gracious,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said. The Holton children entertained themselves by roller skating in the basement, and while Donald J. Trump has criticized \u201cCorrupt Kaine,\u201d as he calls him, for accepting gifts as governor  \u2014   it was legal  \u2014   the Holton children were themselves awash in presents. \u201cWhen Dad was governor, the gifts just flowed,\u201d Woody Holton said. \u201cThis is all before Watergate. Nobody thought how it might be corrupting. So one of the gifts we got was a golf cart, and we drove it all around the Capitol grounds. \u201d Ms. Holton later enrolled in Open High School, which allowed students to create their own curriculum and did not give grades. When asked to pick an activity for physical education, she took up clogging. When assigned to research her family\u2019s ancestry, she presented not the names of distant gentry, but the names of slaves owned by her  . At Harvard Law, she met Mr. Kaine in a legal assistance program that focused on civil rights protections for inmates, and she worked for the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, interviewing the criminally insane about the conditions of their imprisonment. \u201cShe handled the case of a serial killer,\u201d Woody Holton said. As the couple decided where to live, Mr. Kaine\u2019s family, who lived in the Kansas City area, wooed her by taking her to barbecue meccas. But for ambitious young lawyers, Richmond had its advantages. \u201cHe told us that Anne\u2019s dad was the former governor of Virginia,\u201d said Pat Kaine, Tim\u2019s younger brother. Ms. Holton came home first, looking for a church to marry in. She was attending services at a Quaker meeting house at the time, but she knocked on the door of St. Elizabeth\u2019s, a predominantly black Roman Catholic church (her husband is Catholic). She gave her name to the priest. \u201cI tried to play it a little cool  \u2014   we all deal with hierarchy all the time,\u201d recalled the Rev. Michael Schmied, who said they had talked about wedding details for an hour. Then he looked up and remarked: \u201c\u2018Wow. You are the real Anne Holton. \u2019\u201d Ms. Holton began clerking for Robert R. Merhige Jr. the federal judge who had issued the desegregation order. As Mr. Kaine became a successful lawyer, a City Council member and mayor, Ms. Holton made a name for herself as a lawyer for   families and foster children, and then as chief judge on Richmond\u2019s juvenile court. Ms. Holton was sometimes so busy that she dropped her three children off at day care in their pajamas. In 2002, she conducted the   ceremony when her husband became lieutenant governor. But before he ran for the office, she had to assuage his concerns about whether they could give a normal life to their three children: Nat, now a Marine Woody, an artist and Annella, who is studying to be an actress. \u201cYou\u2019d see Anne tacking up posters to advertise the elementary school and middle school plays,\u201d said Pierce Homer, a former secretary of transportation under Mr. Kaine and a neighbor. The couple live in a modest house and drive sensible cars. Their friends talk about the autoharp Ms. Holton bought Mr. Kaine for his birthday (she plays the violin) and their unapologetic public displays of affection: kissing on stages, holding hands in the park. When Mr. Kaine was elected governor in 2005, Ms. Holton resigned from the bench and returned to her childhood home, where as first lady she concentrated on foster care programs that helped keep older children with permanent families and extend their education. Mr. Kaine won his Senate seat in 2012. When Terry McAuliffe was elected governor a year later, he surprised many people by appointing Ms. Holton as secretary of education, a position she at first declined because of her lack of education background, according to Mr. Wolf, the family friend. \u201cShe knew everybody and had a real opportunity to bring people together,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe explained. As for filling Mr. Kaine\u2019s seat in the Senate should he and Mrs. Clinton win, Mr. McAuliffe said, \u201cIt will be a little hard since he presides over the Senate. \u201d (The vice president serves as president of the Senate.) Ms. Holton is clearly at ease among the most exclusive club in Washington. At a retreat at his Virginia farm last month, Senator Mark Warner said, senators were singing along to Mr. Kaine\u2019s harmonica playing when Ms. Holton jumped into the middle of the room and started clog dancing. \u201cOur jaws dropped,\u201d Mr. Warner said. Mr. Kaine told Virginia delegates at a Democratic National Convention breakfast last week that his wife was \u201cmy political partner, my most astute critic, my most energetic enthusiast, my lover, my girlfriend, my wife of 32 years, the great mother of our great three children. \u201d He then kissed her on the lips and relayed to the crowd what the Clinton campaign told him about his wife: \u201cWe want every last minute that she can give us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564541.0233645}
