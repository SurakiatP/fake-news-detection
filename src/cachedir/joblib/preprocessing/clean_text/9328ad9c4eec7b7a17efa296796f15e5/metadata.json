During the visit, the girls, many of whom are members of minorities, were drawn to defender Kelsey Koelzer. Like them, Koelzer, who is   played much of her youth in secondhand equipment and was raised by a single parent who struggled to accommodate the costly expenses of hockey. The girls peppered Koelzer with questions. Koelzer was struck by the encounter, too her mother, Kristine, still remembers her daughter talking about the effect the visit had. Koelzer\u2019s influence is expanding in her senior season at Princeton. In June, she was selected first over all by the New York Riveters in the National Women\u2019s Hockey League draft. Koelzer is believed to be the first   player taken No. 1 by a   American professional hockey league. Shortly after the historic pick, Sarah Nurse of Canada, who is also black, was selected in the second round by the Boston Pride. Koelzer and Nurse, a forward at Wisconsin, are two of college hockey\u2019s top players and rising stars in their   programs. With increased visibility, they recognize their capacity to motivate a generation of young girls from similar backgrounds. \u201cI personally don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve played against many   people growing up,\u201d Koelzer said recently after a game at Princeton, where she is captain. \u201cI really do take pride in the fact that I could be a mentor and a model for other young girls, to see it really is possible if you put the work in no matter your situation or where you\u2019re from. \u201d Other   youth programs like Hockey in Newark have striven to introduce hockey to new audiences, highlighting a sport that has not always been viewed as accessible for financial and cultural reasons. Despite these barriers, women of color have long been instrumental in the emergence of women\u2019s hockey in North America. The Canadians Angela James, whose father is black, and Vicky Sunohara, who is of Japanese descent, were early pioneers. For years, Julie Chu, who is   was a star on the United States women\u2019s national team. Last season, Rachel Llanes, a   and Blake Bolden, an   were key contributors as the Pride won the first Isobel Cup, the trophy awarded to the N. W. H. L. champion. In 2015, they won the Clarkson Cup with the Boston Blades of the Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League. Koelzer and Nurse expressed a desire to continue that legacy, to help shape women\u2019s hockey as more inclusive as it continues to increase its audience. \u201cDiversity is an important element of the N. W. H. L.,\u201d Commissioner Dani Rylan said in an email. Earlier this year, Koelzer was recognized as one of the nation\u2019s best offensive defenders, earning first team   honors and a spot on the United States   team. According to U. S. A. Hockey, an   player has yet to make the women\u2019s senior national team. Nurse, also a senior, is a lethal scorer, and she led the   Badgers in points entering this weekend\u2019s games. She has already competed in the Four Nations Cup with the Canadian national team and was an alternate captain of the developmental team last summer, when she played against Koelzer. Both hope to eventually compete at the Olympics. John Sanful, the executive director of Ice Hockey in Harlem, said it was \u201cincredibly important\u201d that children from minority groups are able to \u201csee people on the ice who look like them,\u201d particularly at such high levels of competition. Over the summer, girls from his program were assigned to report on an influential figure in their lives, and one chose Koelzer, writing, \u201cI like that she\u2019s a black female that wanted to be a hockey player and she achieved her goal. \u201d For some players, hockey rinks can occasionally be uninviting. Tarasai Karega, who won a Division III national title at Amherst in 2009, started playing when she saw the film \u201cThe Mighty Ducks,\u201d influenced by the character Jesse, the only black player portrayed on the team. Karega said that even entering a rink now can feel unsettling. \u201cIt\u2019s tangible that people stare at you like a U. F. O. just landed on Earth,\u201d Karega said. \u201cThey\u2019ll speak to you in mannerisms or talk about proper English. \u201d Karega stressed the importance of the emergence of players like Koelzer and Nurse, to continue raising awareness that hockey is not an exclusive sport. \u201cI think it starts with having that conversation and defying stereotypes,\u201d Karega said. \u201cThen analyzing the nature of access to certain sports. \u201d In 2012, William Douglas founded a blog named the Color of Hockey after Joel Ward received racist threats when he scored a   goal for the Washington Capitals against the Boston Bruins. Douglas said it was important to not just identify minorities within the sport but to understand they can be resources for exposing \u201cproblems with diversity and issues where race can be involved. \u201d Koelzer, who grew up outside Philadelphia, and Nurse, who is from Hamilton, Ontario, have not been afraid to confront race throughout their careers. In high school, when Koelzer still played on a boys\u2019 team, an opponent directed a racial slur at her. Koelzer responded by hitting the aggressor across the head, showing that his ignorance would not be tolerated. \u201cUsually, the game of hockey has been very good to me,\u201d Koelzer said. \u201cWhen that does happen, I have an extreme sense of pride for who I am and where I came from. I do have that kind of attitude where I\u2019m not going to let anyone put me down and try to rise above me just based on something like that. \u201d Nurse comes from one of Canada\u2019s   sports families. Her father, Roger, was a lacrosse star. Her cousin Kia Nurse has won two national titles playing basketball at Connecticut. Kia\u2019s brother, Darnell Nurse, is a top defender for the Edmonton Oilers. Before a game in New York this month, Darnell Nurse said Jarome Iginla was a major influence during his youth. He sees a similar opportunity for Sarah Nurse as she continues her career. Despite her family\u2019s reputation, Sarah Nurse said opponents had sarcastically asked how she discovered hockey or if she was adopted. Recently, black athletes at Wisconsin have unified to address racial injustice on campus. Like many athletes there, Nurse posted a statement this month that condemned a student who wore a mask of President Obama with a noose around the neck to a Wisconsin football game. The statement also referred to episodes in which racial slurs had been used against black athletes and to discrimination in the classroom by students and professors. \u201cJust with the climate of the country right now, it\u2019s a national issue,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cAs   we want to make a difference on our campus and in our community if we can. \u201d Nurse and Koelzer are focused on their senior seasons and have not decided if they will turn pro. The N. W. H. L. is in financial straits, and much of 2017 will be focused on the 2018 Olympics. But wherever their careers lead, they appear comfortable using their influence to effect change, much in the way the United States women\u2019s national soccer team and W. N. B. A. players have addressed social issues. \u201cI definitely take pride in it,\u201d Koelzer said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have that on my shoulders, and I\u2019m happy to kind of carry that weight. It means that I\u2019ve made something. It means that I\u2019ve done something. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564432.9122846}
