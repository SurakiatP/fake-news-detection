Bernie Sanders and 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben, promise there will no honeymoon period for the centrist Democrat should she be elected. ( Daniel / (CC BY-ND 2.0) ) \\nWhile the whole country appears to be on edge ahead of next week\u2019s presidential election, the Left is \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that, should a Hillary Clinton presidency come to pass, the Democratic nominee won\u2019t be able to turn her back on progressive campaign promises\u2014as many argue President Barack Obama did\u2014because she will need that grassroots support if she hopes to stay in office beyond four years. \\n\u201cIf she wants to be more than a one-term president, she\u2019s going to have to work with the left. Period,\u201d Murshed Zaheed, political director of CREDO, told The Hill for a new report published Thursday. \\nSpeaking with progressive activists, The Hill reports that the Left is entering a post-election season \u201cemboldened and empowered,\u201d and ready to fight for implementation of the Democratic platform, said to be the most progressive in the party\u2019s history. \\nAnd unlike Obama, a hypothetical President Clinton won\u2019t be in a position to attempt a \u201c\u2018post-partisan\u2019 approach to seeking deals with Republicans.\u201d \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that she will be smart enough to know that if she were to go that route\u2026there\u2019s going to be a political price to pay for it, because it will demoralize her base heading into 2018 and, honestly, it may even jeopardize 2020,\u201d said Zaheed. \\nBen Wikler, Washington director at MoveOn.org, predicted that the Democratic party is potentially moving \u201cfrom an electoral storm into a governance storm.\u201d \\nClinton, Wikler told The Hill , \u201cwill find \u2018tremendous grassroots support if she goes to the mat\u2019 for her liberal campaign platform. And if she doesn\u2019t, those same grassroots liberals are \u2018emboldened and empowered\u2019 and \u2018ready to hold her to account.\u2019\u201d \\nAnd Clinton seems to be aware of this dynamic. \\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), points to the fact that the Clinton campaign has Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as well as her former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) aggressively campaigning on her behalf the last full week before the election, with stops in a number of pivotal battleground states. \\nAnd while both are doing all they can to ensure that her presidential rival, Republican nominee Donald Trump, is not elected, Green is hopeful that the two progressive firebrands will provide \u201c\u2018a pre-emptive chilling effect on bad behavior\u2019 if she does win the presidency,\u201d The Hill reports. \\nIndeed, Sanders has said that he intends to \u201cleverage\u201d the popularity he gained during the primary to ensure that Clinton enacts the party agenda and does not nominate the \u201csame old, same old Wall Street guys\u201d for regulatory positions. \\nAnd emails from Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta recently leaked by WikiLeaks illustrated how she sought Warren\u2019s approval and support. In one instance, her staff expressed concern that the by opposing a new Glass-Steagall Act, Clinton would appear too pro-Wall Street and thus \u201cantagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren.\u201d \\nProgressive leaders, including Sanders and 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben , have vowed that there will no honeymoon period for the centrist Democrat, should she be elected\u2014and campaigners say that Clinton would be wise to heed their advice and go for those \u201cbig, bold ideas,\u201d like tuition-free college, a higher minimum wage, a just transition to renewable energy, and Medicare for all. \\nAs Green told The Hill , Clinton\u2019s success will be largely determined by two factors: How aggressively she pushes the progressive party platform in the first 100 days of her presidency and how effectively she rallies public support for those policies. \u201cThe absolute best way to get something done is to push big, bold ideas, get the public on your side and force Republicans to the table,\u201d Green said. If she adopts that strategy, \u201cthe Republicans will cave,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d \\nLauren McCauley is a staff writer at Common Dreams.
