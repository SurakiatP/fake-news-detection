Establishment politicians \u201care just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d\\nDuring the Q&A session, the moderator inquired about \u201csocial blowback\u201d Thiel has received for supporting Trump and dwelled heavily on Thiel\u2019s funding of the Hulk Hogan case that brought down Gawker.\\nThiel justified funding the lawsuit against a Gawker that he described as a \u201csingular, sociopathic bully.\u201d Defending illegal revenge porn under the guise of the First Amendment \u201cis an insult to journalists,\u201d he noted.\\nThat comment aroused a scowl in the reporter sitting next to me, who walked out shortly after.\\nThe room was full of about 150 journalists, mostly from mainstream publications. There was a row of cameras filming the event, but only two reporters appeared to be streaming it live through Periscope and Facebook Live. National Press Club Executive Director William C. McCarren treated several members of the press brusquely as they tried to enter the event.\\nThe event highlighted the growing gulf between the establishment and the rest of the country, the mainstream press versus the independent press, and the truth of what\u2019s seen from direct sources and how mainstream reporters often spin it.\\nAt one point during the speech, Thiel directly pointed out the hoaxing and bias within the media. \u201cThe Advocate, a magazine which once praised me as a \u2018gay innovator,\u2019 published an article saying that as of now I am, and I quote, \u2018not a gay man,\u2019 because I don\u2019t agree with their politics.\u201d\\nWhen a high-profile, highly intelligent figure like Thiel supports Trump, who cares about the truth?\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628488.0682316}
