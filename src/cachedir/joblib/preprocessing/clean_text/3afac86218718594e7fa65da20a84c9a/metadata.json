The weary recipients know that once again, the boss has not yet gone to bed. The   interruptions from President Obama might be sharply worded questions about memos he has read. Sometimes they are taunts because the recipient\u2019s sports team just lost. Last month it was a 12:30 a. m. email to Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, and Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, telling them he had finished reworking a speechwriter\u2019s draft of presidential remarks for later that morning. Mr. Obama had spent three hours scrawling in longhand on a yellow legal pad an angry condemnation of Donald J. Trump\u2019s response to the attack in Orlando, Fla. and told his aides they could pick up his rewrite at the White House usher\u2019s office when they came in for work. Mr. Obama calls himself a \u201cnight guy,\u201d and as president, he has come to consider the long, solitary hours after dark as essential as his time in the Oval Office. Almost every night that he is in the White House, Mr. Obama has dinner at 6:30 with his wife and daughters and then withdraws to the Treaty Room, his private office down the hall from his bedroom on the second floor of the White House residence. There, his closest aides say, he spends four or five hours largely by himself. He works on speeches. He reads the stack of briefing papers delivered at 8 p. m. by the staff secretary. He reads 10 letters from Americans chosen each day by his staff. \u201cHow can we allow private citizens to buy automatic weapons? They are weapons of war,\u201d Liz O\u2019Connor, a Connecticut middle school teacher, wrote in a letter Mr. Obama read on the night of June 13. The president also watches ESPN, reads novels or plays Words With Friends on his iPad. Michelle Obama occasionally pops in, but she goes to bed before the president, who is up so late he barely gets five hours of sleep a night. For Mr. Obama, the time alone has become more important. \u201cEverybody carves out their time to get their thoughts together. There is no doubt that window is his window,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cYou can\u2019t block out a   and try to do it during the day. It\u2019s too much incoming. That\u2019s the place where it can all be put aside and you can focus. \u201d President George W. Bush, an early riser, was in bed by 10. President Bill Clinton was up late like Mr. Obama, but he spent the time in lengthy, freewheeling phone conversations with friends and political allies, forcing aides to scan the White House phone logs in the mornings to keep track of whom the president might have called the night before. \u201cA lot of times, for some of our presidential leaders, the energy they need comes from contact with other people,\u201d said the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who has had dinner with Mr. Obama several times in the past seven and a half years. \u201cHe seems to be somebody who is at home with himself. \u201d When Mr. Obama first arrived at the White House, his   routine started around 7:15 p. m. in the game room, on the third floor of the residence. There, on an old Brunswick pool table, Mr. Obama and Sam Kass, then the Obama family\u2019s personal chef, would spend 45 minutes playing  . Mr. Kass saw pool as a chance for Mr. Obama to decompress after intense days in the Oval Office, and the two kept a running score. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit ahead,\u201d said Mr. Kass, who left the White House at the end of 2014. In those days, the president followed the billiards game with bedtime routines with his daughters. These days, now that both are teenagers, Mr. Obama heads directly to the Treaty Room, named for the many historical documents that have been signed in it, including the peace protocol that ended the   War in 1898. \u201cThe sports channel is on,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said, recalling the ubiquitous images on the room\u2019s large   television. \u201cSports in the background, with the volume down. \u201d By 8 p. m. the usher\u2019s office delivers the president\u2019s   daily briefing book  \u2014   a large binder accompanied by a tall stack of folders with memos and documents from across the government, all demanding the president\u2019s attention. \u201cAn insane amount of paper,\u201d Mr. Kass said. Mr. Obama often reads through it in a leather swivel chair at his tablelike desk, under a portrait of President Ulysses S. Grant. Windows on each side of Grant look out on the brightly lit Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. Other nights, the president settles in on the sofa under the 1976 \u201cButterfly\u201d by Susan Rothenberg, a      canvas of burnt sienna and black slashes that evokes a galloping horse. \u201cHe is thoroughly predictable in having gone through every piece of paper that he gets,\u201d said Tom Donilon, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser from 2010 to 2013. \u201cYou\u2019ll come in in the morning, it will be there: questions, notes, decisions. \u201d To stay awake, the president does not turn to caffeine. He rarely drinks coffee or tea, and more often has a bottle of water next to him than a soda. His friends say his only snack at night is seven lightly salted almonds. \u201cMichelle and I would always joke: Not six. Not eight,\u201d Mr. Kass said. \u201cAlways seven almonds. \u201d The demands of the president\u2019s day job sometimes intrude. A photo taken in 2011 shows Mr. Obama in the Treaty Room with Mr. McDonough, at that time the deputy national security adviser, and John O. Brennan, then Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism chief and now the director of the C. I. A. after placing a call to Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan shortly after Japan was hit by a devastating magnitude 9. 0 earthquake. \u201cThe call was made near midnight,\u201d the photo caption says. But most often, Mr. Obama\u2019s time in the Treaty Room is his own. \u201cI\u2019ll probably read briefing papers or do paperwork or write stuff until about 11:30 p. m. and then I usually have about a   to read before I go to bed, about midnight, 12:30 a. m. sometimes a little later,\u201d Mr. Obama told Jon Meacham, the editor in chief of Newsweek, in 2009. In 2014, Mr. Obama told Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan of ABC\u2019s \u201cLive With Kelly and Michael\u201d that he stayed up even later  \u2014   \u201cuntil like 2 o\u2019clock at night, reading briefings and doing work\u201d  \u2014   and added that he woke up \u201cat a pretty reasonable hour, usually around 7. \u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s longest nights  \u2014   the ones that stretch well into the early morning  \u2014   usually involve speeches. One night last June, Cody Keenan, the president\u2019s chief speechwriter, had just returned home from work at 9 p. m. and ordered pizza when he heard from the president: \u201cCan you come back tonight?\u201d Mr. Keenan met the president in the usher\u2019s office on the first floor of the residence, where the two worked until nearly 11 p. m. on the president\u2019s eulogy for nine   fatally shot during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C. Three months earlier, Mr. Keenan had had to return to the White House when the president summoned him  \u2014   at midnight  \u2014   to go over changes to a speech Mr. Obama was to deliver in Selma, Ala. on the 50th anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d when protesters were brutally beaten by the police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the night,\u201d Mr. Keenan said, reflecting on his boss\u2019s use of the time. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller. It lets you think. \u201d In 2009, Jon Favreau, Mr. Keenan\u2019s predecessor, gave the president a draft of his Nobel Prize acceptance speech the night before they were scheduled to leave for the ceremony in Oslo. Mr. Obama stayed up until 4 a. m. revising the speech, and handed Mr. Favreau 11 handwritten pages later that morning. On the plane to Norway, Mr. Obama, Mr. Favreau and two other aides pulled another    as they continued to work on the speech. Once Mr. Obama had delivered it, he called the exhausted Mr. Favreau at his hotel. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, I think that turned out O. K.,\u2019\u201d Mr. Favreau recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Let\u2019s never do that again. \u2019\u201d Not everything that goes on in the Treaty Room is work. In addition to playing Words With Friends, a   online game, on his iPad, Mr. Obama turns up the sound on the television for big sports games. \u201cIf he\u2019s watching a game, he will send a message. \u2018Duke should have won that game,\u2019 or whatever,\u201d said Reggie Love, a former Duke basketball player who was Mr. Obama\u2019s personal aide for the first three years of his presidency. The president also uses the time to catch up on the news, skimming The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal on his iPad or watching cable. Mr. Love recalls getting an email after 1 a. m. after Mr. Obama saw a television report about students whose \u201cbucket list\u201d included meeting the president. Why had he not met them, the president asked Mr. Love. \u201c\u2018Someone decided it wasn\u2019t a good idea,\u2019 I said,\u201d Mr. Love recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m the president and I think it\u2019s a good idea. \u2019\u201d Mr. Obama and his wife are also fans of cable dramas like \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad. \u201d On Friday nights  \u2014   movie night at the White House  \u2014   Mr. Obama and his family are often in the Family Theater, a   screening room on the first floor of the East Wing, watching   films they have chosen and had delivered from the Motion Picture Association of America. There is time, too, for fantasy about what life would be like outside the White House. Mr. Emanuel, who is now the mayor of Chicago but remains close to the president, said he and Mr. Obama once imagined moving to Hawaii to open a   shack that sold only one size (medium) and one color (white). Their dream was that they would no longer have to make decisions. During difficult White House meetings when no good decision seemed possible, Mr. Emanuel would sometimes turn to Mr. Obama and say, \u201cWhite. \u201d Mr. Obama would in turn say, \u201cMedium. \u201d Now Mr. Obama, who has six months left of solitary late nights in the Treaty Room, seems to be looking toward the end. Once he is out of the White House, he said in March at an Easter prayer breakfast in the State Dining Room, \u201cI am going to take three, four months where I just sleep. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628365.4504273}
