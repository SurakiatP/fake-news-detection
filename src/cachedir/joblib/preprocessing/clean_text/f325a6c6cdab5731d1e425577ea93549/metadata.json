[Senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Elliott Abrams said on a conference call organized by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA),  We have come through a period of eight years of tension at various levels, but particularly the top level. It\u2019s clear that [former president Barack] Obama and Netanyahu didn\u2019t get along, didn\u2019t like each other. And that attitude was then communicated to the White House staff. You had a lot of backbiting, criticism of Netanyahu  \u2014   all of that is over. We\u2019ve returned now to the idea that there should be no daylight in public between the two governments. There will be plenty of disagreements, but those will be discussed in closed rooms and the relations at the top are obviously genuinely good. There is no artifice here about getting along. \u201cThat\u2019s a critically important thing,\u201d Abrams noted. \u201cThe whole US government takes its cue from the relationship at the top. \u201d Abrams, who also served as deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush, added, \u201cOther governments also pay attention. I\u2019ve always believed that most governments, particularly in Europe, base their relationship [with Israel] on ours. They don\u2019t want to be quite as close to Israel. So if we\u2019re distant, they\u2019re more distant. If we\u2019re close, then they get closer. \u201d Abrams lauded Trump\u2019s ambivalence regarding the   solution as being the key to solving the   conflict. The goal should never be a   solution, the goal is peace. And there are many ways of moving in that direction and there are several potential endpoints. And I think that it\u2019s useful to the Israelis and for us to remind everybody that the goal is peace. We should not let the means become more important than the end, and we should think about that goal, rather than saying there is no other possible arrangement ever than the   solution. Abrams said that Trump\u2019s request to Netanyahu to \u201chold back on settlements for a little bit\u201d was not necessarily an instruction to stop building entirely. I think that [Trump was] moving back to the George W. Bush approach. And what was the Bush approach? Basically it was, don\u2019t change the footprint [and] don\u2019t expand the settlements geographically. Population growth, that\u2019s different. Build up and in. In   areas, if you want to build a new house, a new apartment, that doesn\u2019t affect the Palestinians or the chances of peace really. So the Google Earth map, if you put it that way, of the settlements doesn\u2019t change. \u201cWe had a deal with [late Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon that was basically no new settlements, no physical  \u2014   territorial  \u2014   expansion of settlements and no financial inducements to move to a settlement. I think this administration is moving back to that view,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742561963.4907696}
