[\u201cApproximately half of adult Americans\u2019 photographs are stored in facial recognition databases that can be accessed by the FBI, without their knowledge or consent, in the hunt for suspected criminals,\u201d reported The Guardian on Monday. \u201cAbout 80% of photos in the FBI\u2019s network are   entries, including pictures from driver\u2019s licenses and passports. The algorithms used to identify matches are inaccurate about 15% of the time, and are more likely to misidentify black people than white people. \u201d  \u201cThese are just some of the damning facts presented at last week\u2019s House oversight committee hearing, where politicians and privacy campaigners criticized the FBI and called for stricter regulation of facial recognition technology at a time when it is creeping into law enforcement and business,\u201d they continued. During the committee hearing, chairman Jason Chaffetz praised the positives of using facial recognition technology before also raising concerns about some of the more negative potential uses. \u201cFacial recognition technology is a powerful tool law enforcement can use to protect people, their property, our borders, and our nation  \u2026     But it can also be used by bad actors to harass or stalk individuals,\u201d declared Chaffetz. \u201cIt can be used in a way that chills free speech and free association by targeting people attending certain political meetings, protests, churches, or other types of places in the public. \u201d \u201cFor those reasons and others, we must conduct proper oversight of this emerging technology,\u201d he continued, adding that body cameras with the potential to scan faces while walking down the street were the \u201cmost concerning. \u201d In their report, The Guardian added, \u201cUnlike with the collection of fingerprints and DNA, which is done following an arrest, photos of innocent civilians are being collected proactively. \u201d \u201cThe FBI made arrangements with 18 different states to gain access to their databases of driver\u2019s license photos,\u201d they explained, adding, \u201cLast year, the US government accountability office (GAO) analyzed the FBI\u2019s use of facial recognition technology and found it to be lacking in accountability, accuracy and oversight, and made recommendations of how to address the problem. \u201d Brian Brackeen, CEO of the movie and theme park facial recognition company Kairos, also criticized the lack of regulation for facial recognition software and databases, proclaiming the commercial side of the industry to be \u201cfive years ahead\u201d of FBI. According to The Guardian, Brackeen claimed \u201che was \u2018not comfortable\u2019 with the lack of regulation,\u201d before adding \u201cThere has got to be privacy protections for the individual. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
