[Gene Sykes, head of LA2024, spoke on Thursday at the Montgomery Conference in Santa Monica, during which he painted a picture of President Trump\u2019s involvement in the Olympic bidding process that greatly contrasts with the picture presented by the media and other sports elites.  \u201cThe Donald Trump effect, for us, is a   sword,\u201d Sykes said, according to KPCC. Sykes then went on to explain how, despite President Trump\u2019s strong stances on immigration and other issues which have bothered some international Olympic officials, Donald Trump has been most valuable in gaining support for the Los Angeles bid. Sykes then pointed out how Trump\u2019s efforts differ from those of his predecessor. After remarking about how Obama\u2019s interest in the Olympics waned after an attempt to win the games for Chicago in 2016 failed, Sykes said of Obama, \u201cHe never went to an Olympic games, never met with the IOC [International Olympic Committee] leadership, never talked to them by phone, and showed sort of a disregard and that was deeply frustrating to the leaders of the IOC. \u201d Sykes then spoke about a situation that involved some Iranian archers who found themselves turned back at the airport in Las Vegas during President Trump\u2019s first immigration ban. Specifically, Sykes mentioned how the President Trump intervened, \u201cAs soon as they learned they had created a problem for us they said \u2018We\u2019ll help you. We\u2019ll solve the problem.\u2019 \u201d They\u2019ve set up a team in the White House to help us. \u201d Though Sykes made no mistake about the obstacles ahead with some Olympic Committee members who have serious issues with Trump, Sykes said, \u201cThe President presents an image which is a challenging image for some of these voters. They don\u2019t like the   stance. They don\u2019t like the presumed   rhetoric. All that is alarming to them. We\u2019ve heard it. We continue to hear it. It\u2019s an issue. \u201d Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn'"}, "time": 1742561970.441651}
