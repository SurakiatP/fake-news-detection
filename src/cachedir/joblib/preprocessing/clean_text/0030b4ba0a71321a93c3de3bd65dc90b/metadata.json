Major League Baseball created an   and   Policy that covers the practice and the players\u2019 union agreed not to contest it as part of the new labor deal that was set to be ratified by both sides Tuesday. The policy, obtained by The Associated Press, prohibits \u201crequiring, coercing or encouraging\u201d players to dress up as women or wear costumes that \u201cmay be offensive to individuals based on their race, sex, nationality, age, sexual orientation, gender identify or other characteristic. \u201d Paul Mifsud, a vice president of M. L. B. said Monday the new rules resulted partly \u201cin light of social media, which in our view sort of unfortunately publicized a lot of the dressing up of the players. \u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s lots of pictures of baseball players dressed up as Disney princesses. \u201d All out starting next season: Bryce Harper as a member of the United States Olympic women\u2019s gymnastics team, Mike Trout as Lady Gaga, Manny Machado in a ballet tutu and Carlos Correa as Wonder Woman. \u201cAlthough it hasn\u2019t happened, you could sort of see how like someone might even dress up in black face and say, \u2018Oh, no, we were just dressing up,\u2019\u201d Mifsud said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also understood that a number of players have complained about it. \u201d Exactly when the annual   day began is not quite clear. Players often considered it a form of bonding, and it has become a bigger production in recent years. Chase Headley and other San Diego Padres newcomers wore the skimpy, shiny orange shorts and tight, white tops of Hooters servers for a flight from Denver to Washington in September 2008. \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d said Dave Prouty, the players union general counsel. \u201cThere is certain conduct that we have to be conscious of. \u201d Prouty said the union\u2019s focus was to preserve the players\u2019 rights to challenge the level and imposition of discipline. Not all outfits have been banned  \u2014   superheroes such as Batman and   are still permitted. Other past costumes that would be allowed include the giant ketchup bottle worn by the San Francisco ace Madison Bumgarner, the Olympic men\u2019s water polo uniform worn by the Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton, and the Gumby costume donned by the Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig. Last September, the Mets posted photos and video of players going to Starbucks in Philadelphia wearing uniforms from the   Girls Professional Baseball League, as portrayed in the 1992 movie \u201cA League of Their Own. \u201d Several other teams engaged in similar behavior. In 2012, Harper and other Nationals newcomers wore red leotards in the style of Gabby Douglas and the U. S. women\u2019s gymnastics team for a train ride to New York. The veteran pitcher Gio Gonzalez posted a photo in Twitter. In 2007, the Yankees\u2019 theme was \u201cThe Wizard of Oz. \u201d Ian Kennedy wore Dorothy\u2019s ruby red slippers for a flight from New York to Tampa, Florida. \u201cI\u2019d rather be here dressing up than anywhere else,\u201d Kennedy said at the time. \u201cIt makes you feel like one of the guys. \u201d The new policy states \u201ca player\u2019s actual or perceived willingness to participate in prohibited conduct does not excuse the activity from being considered a violation of the policy. \u201d Not everyone saw them as fun. After he was traded to the Mets in 1992, Jeff Kent threw a pimp costume to the floor in the visitors\u2019 clubhouse in Montreal and demanded that his regular clothes  \u2014   which contained the identification that he needed to go through customs  \u2014   be returned. \u201cI paid my rookie dues in Toronto,\u201d he said then. \u201cI feel I have endured my embarrassments, my punishment. I felt I was being taken advantage of. They wanted to go overboard. I stuck up for myself. I won\u2019t be pushed around. \u201d Some common rookie rituals will be permitted. Last year, the Cardinals and Dodgers made their newcomers walk across the street from Wrigley Field  \u2014   in their full uniforms  \u2014   to bring back coffee before a game against the Cubs. And rookie relievers still might find themselves lugging snacks across the diamond to the bullpen for the veterans. But requiring players \u201cto consume alcoholic beverages or any other kind of drug, or requiring the ingestion of an undesirable or unwanted substance (food, drink, concoction)\u201d is banned under the new collective bargaining agreement. The policy is in addition to the workplace code of conduct adopted by M. L. B. and the union in 2013 after the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked to meet with baseball officials and inquired what rules the sport had in place against bullying with respect to sexual orientation. \u201cThe purpose of this policy is not to prohibit all traditions regarding rookies or players,\u201d the new policy document said, \u201cbut rather to prohibit conduct that may cause players physical anguish or harm, may be offensive to some players, club staff or fans, or are distracting to the operation of the club or M. L. B. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628447.9096777}
