What he ended up with is a mess  \u2014   no matter the outcome of the welter of lawsuits swirling around Mr. Redstone, the ailing media mogul who turned 93 last Friday. A lawsuit brought by Manuela Herzer, one of Mr. Redstone\u2019s    romantic partners, stripped him of whatever dignity he might have hoped to retain by publicly revealing humiliating details about his physical and sexual appetites and his diminishing mental capacity. A medical expert said Mr. Redstone suffers from dementia that\u2019s \u201ctoward the severe end of moderate. \u201d That case was dismissed last month, but the testimony was just the curtain raiser for a far more important showdown now unfolding between Mr. Redstone\u2019s previously estranged daughter, Shari Redstone, and the man who had seemed to be his handpicked heir apparent, Philippe Dauman. The fate of the   CBS and Viacom hang in the balance. Mr. Dauman is the chief executive of Viacom, and was  \u2014   until recently  \u2014   Mr. Redstone\u2019s longtime confidant and a trustee of the trust that controls 80 percent of National Amusements (his daughter owns the remaining 20 percent). National Amusements in turn owns 80 percent of the voting stock in both CBS and Viacom. Mr. Dauman now finds himself in the seemingly contradictory position of arguing that Mr. Redstone, as his lawsuit asserts, \u201csuffers from profound physical and mental illness,\u201d only months after he said in court papers filed in Ms. Herzer\u2019s case that Mr. Redstone was \u201cengaged and attentive. \u201d (Mr. Dauman maintains in his lawsuit that Mr. Redstone has deteriorated since then.) Mr. Redstone \u201cnow faces a situation where it appears that people around him are competing for control and each has their own objectives,\u201d said Georgiana Slade, head of the trusts and estates group at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley  McCloy in New York. \u201cIt seems that many people with an interest are attempting to influence decisions related to his estate, the trust and Viacom. But the real question should be: What does Mr. Redstone himself want?\u201d While it may be an extreme example of the high stakes and chaos that can result, \u201cthe Redstone pattern is happening in epidemic proportions,\u201d said Kerry Peck, an estate planning specialist and managing partner at Peck Ritchey in Chicago and a   of the book \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s and the Law. \u201d \u201cCaregivers in particular, often younger women, are ingratiating themselves into the lives of older men,\u201d Mr. Peck said. \u201cThey meet them at places you\u2019d consider safe, like senior centers, churches and synagogues. They start as caregivers, and then they become romantic suitors. We\u2019re seeing these scenarios with stunning frequency. \u201d As Americans live longer and more families are forced to cope with common    issues like dementia, the problem is getting worse. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue nationally as the elderly population grows and their minds start to falter,\u201d Ms. Slade said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen charities coming after people for multiple gifts: Sometimes these donors don\u2019t remember that they already gave the previous week. Romantic partners, caregivers who take advantage of the elderly  \u2014   we\u2019re seeing it all. \u201d Elderly people may be especially susceptible to the influence of people who happen to be around them during their waning days. Ms. Slade and other Milbank lawyers were   to the public administrator overseeing the estate of Huguette Clark, the reclusive heiress who died in 2011 at the age of 104. Despite good health, she lived the last 20 years of her life in New York hospitals. She bestowed lavish gifts on various caregivers ($31 million to one nurse) and left the bulk of her $300 million fortune to her nurse and a charitable foundation controlled by her lawyers and accountant, to the exclusion of family members. The family challenged the will in court and Milbank, on behalf of the public administrator, sought to recoup the gifts for the estate. The cases were settled and family members said they hoped to call attention to a growing problem of elder abuse. \u201cThis is an issue for lots of people of even modest wealth,\u201d said David M. English, a professor of trusts and estates at the University of Missouri School of Law and former chairman of the American Bar Association\u2019s commission on law and aging. Professor English said the most common approach is the creation of a trust, either revocable (which means it can later be changed) or irrevocable, that anticipates such a problem and defines what the creator of the trust means by incapacity. This could be a much less rigorous standard than is typically applied by courts in the absence of such a definition. \u201cThe document should define the meaning of incapacity and, more importantly, indicate who determines incapacity,\u201d Professor English said. Mr. Redstone created such a trust, but it cedes little control to others as long as he remains alive, and it doesn\u2019t specifically define incapacity. According to his lawyers, his trust is irrevocable, but Mr. Redstone is the sole beneficiary as long as he\u2019s alive, and he has the power to remove or add trustees unless he\u2019s \u201cincapacitated. \u201d \u201cThis can occur only if Mr. Redstone is adjudged incompetent by a court, or upon the delivery of a document signed by three doctors stating that, based on medical evidence, he is unable to manage his affairs in a competent manner,\u201d according to a court filing by Mr. Redstone\u2019s lawyers. Who controls the   board of his trust is critical, since the National Amusements trust will control Mr. Redstone\u2019s assets, including his dominant stakes in CBS and Viacom, should Mr. Redstone die or be deemed incapacitated. Though long at odds with Ms. Redstone (who is a trustee, as is her son) Mr. Dauman and the other four nonfamily trustees seemed safely in charge as long as they retained Mr. Redstone\u2019s support. But last month, Mr. Redstone abruptly dismissed Mr. Dauman and another longstanding trustee in what Mr. Dauman called \u201ca shameful effort by Shari Redstone to seize control. \u201d Mr. Dauman and his   filed suit in Massachusetts (where Mr. Redstone\u2019s trust was created) to have their dismissal deemed invalid on grounds that Ms. Redstone had isolated her father and was exercising undue influence over him, all claims that Ms. Redstone denies. The trial is scheduled to begin next week. Mr. Redstone\u2019s lawyers filed suit in Los Angeles, seeking a ruling that the trustee changes were valid. Which court would prevail in the event of inconsistent rulings could be the subject of yet another round of litigation. Mr. Redstone\u2019s mental capacity is a central issue in both the California and Massachusetts lawsuits. \u201cIn drafting a trust like this, you need very clear standards and protocols for determining capacity,\u201d Ms. Slade said. An elderly client, she added, \u201cwill often require the assistance of a lawyer to protect him from himself in his old age. \u201d She emphasized that different decisions might require different standards for determining capacity. \u201cThe real question,\u201d Ms. Slade said, \u201cis does someone have the capacity for the decision at issue? It\u2019s one thing to be deciding what you want for dinner and something very different to decide who should be running a major corporation. \u201d   trusts can make such distinctions. Mr. Redstone \u201ccould have avoided many of these problems if he\u2019d created a trust that allowed a majority of trustees to conclude that he didn\u2019t have the capacity to remove trustees,\u201d Mr. Peck said. Trusts often contain such a provision that automatically goes into effect when the creator of the trust reaches a designated age, such as 75 or 80. But sometimes no amount of legal advice can save people from an unwillingness to face their own mortality and cede control while still in full control of their faculties. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any sympathetic characters here,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and author of a book on corporate succession, \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Farewell: What Happens When C. E. O.s Retire. \u201d \u201cSumner Redstone,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said, \u201cbrought this mess on himself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562358.6473782}
