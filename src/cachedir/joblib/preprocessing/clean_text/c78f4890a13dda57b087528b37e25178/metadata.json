Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nominations for the 59th annual Grammys, announced on Tuesday, with nine nods for her album \u201cLemonade. \u201d But in each of the three top categories she will square off against Adele, who was nominated five times. Both women had extraordinary years. \u201cLemonade,\u201d an ambitious album and film, tackled issues of race and infidelity, and its release became the kind of   cultural phenomenon that perhaps no artist but Beyonc\u00e9 could muster. Adele\u2019s album \u201c25\u201d sold more than 10 million copies in less than a year, a blockbuster that eclipsed all others. With enormous commercial success and the adoration of fellow musicians, those stars represent the very best of how the music industry sees itself, which should make their competition tight. \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201c25\u201d are both nominated for album of the year, and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s track \u201cFormation\u201d will go up against Adele\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d for both record and song of the year. This year\u2019s Grammys, on Feb. 12 in Los Angeles, will mostly hew to the biggest pop hits of the moment  \u2014   itself a notable development for a show that has often celebrated aging stars at the expense of vital young talent. The other leading nominees include Drake and Rihanna, each with eight nods, and Chance the Rapper, who climbed the charts as an independent and had seven nominations in five categories, including best new artist. Yet every list of Grammy nominations comes with surprises. For album of the year, \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201c25\u201d will compete against Drake\u2019s \u201cViews,\u201d a monster streaming hit \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s comeback vehicle and, in what might be the year\u2019s wild card, \u201cA Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth,\u201d by the country singer Sturgill Simpson, a critical favorite but modest seller. For record of the year, an award for the performer and producers of a single track, \u201cFormation\u201d and \u201cHello\u201d face off against \u201c7 Years,\u201d a mellow hit by the Danish group Lukas Graham \u201cStressed Out,\u201d by the   pop duo Twenty One Pilots and Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWork,\u201d which features Drake. (\u201cFormation,\u201d \u201cHello\u201d and \u201c7 Years\u201d are also up for song of the year, which recognizes songwriters.) When the nominations were announced early Tuesday, many artists took to social media to express thanks or surprise. The Chainsmokers, a D. J. duo, are up for three awards, including best new artist. When they got the news, they said on Twitter, they were in line at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, \u201cand   everyone in the store. \u201d Kanye West, whose album \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d and related tour also drew wide attention, received eight nominations in five categories like Drake and Chance, he is up for all four rap awards. But members of the Recording Academy, the organization that presents the Grammys, did not choose Mr. West  \u2014   a frequent Grammy critic  \u2014   in any of the top categories for his own work. He is, however, one of the 20 credited producers on Drake\u2019s \u201cViews. \u201d On the other hand, Beyonc\u00e9 was nominated for seemingly every award possible. Besides the top fields, she is up for awards in the pop category (\u201cHold Up,\u201d pop solo performance) rock (\u201cDon\u2019t Hurt Yourself,\u201d with Jack White, for rock performance) RB (\u201cLemonade,\u201d for urban contemporary album) and rap (\u201cFreedom,\u201d with Kendrick Lamar, for best   performance). \u201cLemonade\u201d was also nominated for best music film, and \u201cFormation\u201d for best music video. Beyonc\u00e9 has been nominated 62 times in her career, more than any other female artist. She has already won 20 awards, and if she wins eight this year, Beyonc\u00e9 would surpass Alison Krauss as the   woman in Grammy history. Members of Twenty One Pilots are up for a total of five awards David Bowie, who died in January after releasing his album \u201cBlackstar,\u201d is up for four. In his lifetime, Mr. Bowie won only one Grammy, along with a lifetime achievement award. In recent years, the Recording Academy has worked, with mixed success, to better reflect the diversity and pulse of current pop music. \u201cThere was a time when the membership of the academy may have skewed a little older,\u201d Neil Portnow, its president, said in an interview. \u201cBut as we have evolved and the community of membership has broadened, you probably see some reflection of that in how the nominations come out. \u201d Yet there were still some striking absences from this year\u2019s nominees, including Drake\u2019s song \u201cOne Dance. \u201d By far one of the biggest hits of the year  \u2014   it was No. 1 for 10 weeks  \u2014   the song received no nominations. (\u201cHotline Bling,\u201d Drake\u2019s other pop smash, had two nominations.) Another absence is the result of an apparent protest. The Grammys have fared far better than the Oscars and other awards in recognizing diversity, yet have also been criticized for favoring white artists in the top categories. Frank Ocean, the RB singer and songwriter whose album \u201cBlonde\u201d was another major pop event, declined to submit his material for consideration. In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Ocean called the Grammys\u2019 nomination system \u201cdated,\u201d and added: \u201cI\u2019d rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience. \u201d In response to that, Mr. Portnow said, \u201cIf you look at the   entries in our process, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that the vast majority of artists feel that we are important, that they do aspire to be honored by their peers, and that the process we\u2019ve created is democratic and transparent. \u201d Mr. Ocean\u2019s stance makes him an exception, with many artists and their business representatives spending months campaigning for the nominations. This year Chance the Rapper benefited from a rule change that allowed   albums like his \u201cColoring Book\u201d mixtape to be considered for awards. In a \u201cfor your consideration\u201d ad in Billboard, Chance asked simply, \u201cHey, why not me?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562278.7461116}
