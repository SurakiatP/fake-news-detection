Tulsi Gabbard ( ) said she was \u201cdoing her homework\u201d on the impeachment process of President Donald Trump but warned President Mike Pence would potentially push through a more conservative agenda.  Gabbard said, \u201cOn the issue of impeachment, I am doing my homework. I am studying more about the impeachment process. I will just say I understand the calls for impeachment, but what I am being cautious about and what I give you food for thought about is that if President Trump is impeached, the problems don\u2019t go away, because then you have a Vice President Pence who becomes President Pence. If you do your research on positions on many of the issues we\u2019ve talked, many of the issues that I get phone calls about from people all across the state, the issue of war and peace, he\u2019s about as hawkish as they come. \u201d \u201cIssues relating to the environment, education, healthcare  \u2014   I disagree with so many of the positions that he has. And in some ways given the fact that he\u2019s a former member of Congress and very well connected within the Republican establishment in Washington, he\u2019d be able to, I believe, be far more effective in furthering his agenda than we have seen so far in President Trump\u2019s first 100 days,\u201d she added.
