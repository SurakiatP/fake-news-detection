Image Credit: Flickr CC/ Lars Plougmann \\nAccording to PopSugar , the newborn girl appeared perfectly healthy at birth\u2014 with one exception. Her tiny hand included an extra thumb. \\nLove What Matters posted a photo of the baby girl on its Facebook page: Loading Facebook Post... \\nAs the newborn's parents explain, that third thumb earned their daughter some extra medical tests. And those extra tests led to an important discovery. They write : \\n\u201cQuincy has an extra thumb, which now we realize was a blessing in disguise. If she wouldn't have had this anomaly (along with her missing kidney), they never would have sent us to see a geneticist who referred us to a cardiologist. It was at her first cardiology appointment that we found out she has a congenital heart defect that will require surgery.\u201d \\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health , congenital heart defects affect approximately one out of 8,000 newborns, but can have few symptoms. It is even possible for doctors to miss the signs of a heart defect during a physical exam. Left untreated, a severe heart defect can lead to heart failure. However, with proper medical care, children with heart defects can go on to live healthy and active lives. \\nIronically, from the moment her mother first saw the extra thumb, she called it her daughter's \u201cheart thumb.\u201d Though she didn't realize it at the time, that nickname would be a perfect way to describe her \u201clucky\u201d extra digit: \\n\u201cWhen Liv saw her thumb for the first time, she told us it was her heart thumb. If we would have only known how right she was! Quincy is our little heart warrior!\u201d \\nAffectionately calling Quincy their \u201clittle heart warrior,\u201d her parents say they are fortunate that this \u201cstrong, beautiful baby\u201d belongs to them. \""}, "time": 1742564251.2571728}
