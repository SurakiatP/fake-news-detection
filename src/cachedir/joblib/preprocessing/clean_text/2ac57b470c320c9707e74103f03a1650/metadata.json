A homeless man sleeps on the steps of St. Bartholomew\u2019s Church, Tuesday, June 23, 2015 in New York. \\nThe San Antonio Police Department \u2014 known for its strict measures against homeless people \u2014 announced that it had fired a five-year veteran police officer after he attempted to feed a homeless man a \u201cfecal sandwich\u201d in May. \\nAccording to the department\u2019s statement, police officer Matthew Luckhurst bragged to a fellow officer about trying to feed the man human feces before his unnamed colleague reported the incident to the internal affairs in July. \\n\u201cThis was a vile and disgusting act that violates our guiding principles of \u2018treating all with integrity, compassion, fairness and respect,\u2019\u201d Chief William McManus said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe fact that his fellow officers were so disgusted with his actions that they reported him to Internal Affairs demonstrates that this type of behavior will never be tolerated.\u201d \\nIn 2014, however, McManus wanted to make giving money to homeless people a crime but the idea was shelved after public outcry. \\nThe decision to fire Luckhurst was based on recommendations by two separate review boards which were upheld by McManus. The Associated Press reported that at least two officers reported the incidents to internal affairs. \\nHowever, Luckhurst\u2019s lawyer told the San Antonio Express-News, which first reported the story, that his client would appeal the decision and denied that the incident had taken place ever and his comments were a \u201cjoke.\u201d \\nAccording to the local San Antonio Current, the police issued more than 12,000 citations in 22 months between 2013 and 2014 related to \u201cviolations of city laws aimed at discouraging the homeless and poor from hanging out downtown or asking for donations.\u201d \\nThe newspaper said homeless people were charged with aggressive solicitation \u2014 seeking donations in an intimidating manner \u2014 solicitation within forbidden zones, camping in a public place, littering, spitting, urinating or defecating in public, disorderly conduct and sitting or lying in manners obstructing the public\u2019s right of way. \\nAccording to Haven For Hope, there are almost 3,000 homeless people in the city, of whom 42 percent have no shelter and sleep in the streets.'"}, "time": 1742561760.141079}
