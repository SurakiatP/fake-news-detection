Feeling compelled to help, he posted on Facebook a suggestion to create a comic book that would benefit the victims. The result is \u201cLove Is Love,\u201d a   anthology filled with original work by contributors both familiar and unexpected. The book, which will be available Dec. 28, includes pages from the documentarian Morgan Spurlock, the actor Matt Bomer, the comedians Patton Oswalt and Taran Killam, and other entertainers. \u201cI went through my Rolodex  \u2014   to use a word for something that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore  \u2014   and looked for people who I\u2019m friends with and had name value,\u201d Mr. Andreyko said. \u201cI want this book to be in as many hands as possible. \u201d Proceeds from the book, which will cost $9. 99 and be available in comic stores and for download online (with additional pages) will benefit Equality Florida, which has set up a fund for the victims of the Pulse shooting and their families. Mr. Andreyko, 46, said the inspiration for the book could be traced to his childhood. He fondly recalled the musical acts that came together for benefit concerts such as Band Aid and Live Aid and the song \u201cWe Are the World. \u201d He noted that the format of the book  \u2014   no story is over two pages long  \u2014   had been chosen to help lure contributors who had tight schedules. But Mr. Andreyko found the biggest motivator was the act of expression. \u201cIt was therapeutic,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBy doing the art, it was purging for us. \u201d The offerings are diverse: There are stories that directly address the victims, some pinups, wistful ruminations and more. Brian Michael Bendis, one of Marvel\u2019s most prolific writers, teamed up with his oldest daughter, Olivia, to capture a glimmer of a moment from the shooting at Pulse. They came up with a   spread of revelrous dancers and a lone person in shadow looking upon them. \u201cThe idea that someone could stand in the middle of that club full of joy and fun and be drowning in madness was something we couldn\u2019t get past,\u201d Mr. Bendis said. Michael Avon Oeming drew the artwork, and Taki Soma colored it. Mr. Spurlock, who is working on a documentary about superheroes for the History Channel, wrote a   story, with art by Kieron Dwyer, in support of the nation\u2019s dedicated police officers. Mr. Spurlock said officers were sometimes tarnished as a group because of the actions of a few. \u201cThese guys still have to show up and do their jobs,\u201d he said. One of the most unusual contributions comes by way of J. K. Rowling, who allowed the use of a quote from \u201cHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. \u201d It serves as a caption to an image of Harry and his friends drawn by Jim Lee, a   of DC Comics. The pairing seemed only natural, Mr. Andreyko said. \u201cIf we get the   author on the planet, we need the biggest artist,\u201d Mr. Andreyko said. Mark Chiarello, a senior vice president of art and design at DC, added a watercolor rainbow flag to the drawing. The quote is by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Harry\u2019s school, who Ms. Rowling has said is gay, and drives home the point of the anthology: \u201cDifferences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562561.3191867}
