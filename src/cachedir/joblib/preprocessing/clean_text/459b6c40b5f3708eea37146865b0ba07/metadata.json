Sagar Thakkar, known as Shaggy, was apprehended by immigration officials in Mumbai after arriving on a flight from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where the police said he had been living since an October raid on his call centers. He was charged with extortion, cheating by impersonation and wire fraud, and is expected to remain in custody until April 15. Mr. Thakkar\u2019s lawyer could not be reached on Saturday. Officials accuse Mr. Thakkar of leveraging India\u2019s vast supply of     workers and modern communications technology to earn as much as $150, 000 a day at the height of the fraud. Many of Mr. Thakkar\u2019s nearly 700 young employees would call United States citizens, impersonate I. R. S. agents and demand immediate payment for unpaid taxes. The police estimated that he may have bilked Americans out of $100 million over the telephone. The police have been hunting for Mr. Thakkar since the call center raid last year. They believe an informer tipped him off to the raid, said Abhishek Trimukhe, the deputy commissioner of police in Thane. Mr. Thakkar\u2019s lavish fugitive lifestyle has intrigued Indian crime reporters, who chronicled his purchase of a $400, 000 German sports car from one of India\u2019s most famous cricket players as a gift for his girlfriend. Investigators said that Mr. Thakkar had recruited former schoolmates for the fraud by driving them in limousines and hosting them at opulent restaurants. \u201cHe appears like a regular guy he doesn\u2019t appear like a criminal if you talk to him,\u201d said Param Bir Singh, Thane\u2019s police commissioner. \u201cBut very, very   and very, very smart. \u201d Mr. Thakkar spent the past six months in Dubai. He told the police he lived there using a residential permit, which he claimed was linked to a   shell company. He returned to India of his own volition, perhaps because he had run out of money, Mr. Trimukhe said. And he returned with no luggage, carrying only travel documents and two cellphones, the police said. In conversations with the police, Mr. Thakkar described himself as the child of a    family from Gujarat who made his first foray into   work at 15, carrying out customer phone surveys about buying and selling cars, and then selling those leads to automotive retailers. He learned about   swindles a few years later from friends, and decided to replicate the model on a large scale, enlisting dozens of school friends, Mr. Trimukhe said. \u201cHis entire family was in Ahmedabad and they\u2019re lower middle class I don\u2019t think they really needed it,\u201d Mr. Trimukhe said. \u201cHe wanted fast money. There is no other intention for this. In Ahmedabad there is a culture of business they want to earn big money. \u201d The police said on Saturday that they believed their actions had \u201cheavily dented\u201d the illegal   industry. \u201cMr. Thakkar has shared that there were many call centers running in the country, which after our raid have shut down,\u201d Mr. Singh said. The police said they were scouring Mr. Thakkar\u2019s phones for information, but that he had disposed of the iPhone he had used to run the fraud. They said they had found only a handful of contacts and no trace of his past communications on his new phones.'"}, "time": 1742563685.2851171}
