Waters said, [relevant remarks begin around 4:00] \u201cI believe that this president has colluded with the Russians, with the Kremlin, with the oligarchs \u2014  perhaps \u2014  of Russia to undermine our election system, and thus undermine our democracy. I do realize that you can\u2019t just speculate about this. You\u2019ve got to connect the dots. You\u2019ve got to get the facts. \u201d She added that she would \u201ckeep working until he\u2019s impeached. \u201d Later on, [relevant exchange begins around 19:15] Waters repeated her charge, saying, \u201cI think that he absolutely colluded. \u201d Host Jonathan Capehart then asked Waters if she had seen anything to back any of the accusations she\u2019s made up. Waters pointed to intelligence agencies\u2019 documentation that Russia was behind the hacks of the DNC. Capehart followed up by asking Waters if she had seen evidence to back up the collusion charges. Waters answered, \u201cNo, we have not. And that\u2019s why investigations are so important, to drill down and to connect those dots and to get the facts. What we have is a lot of smoke, that causes us to want to know more about what has happened. Why is it there are so many people around him [who] are connected to oil? Why is it that Michael Flynn, who, evidently has a great relationship with Putin, who has received payments for   speeches, and who\u2019s spent a lot of time in Russia, and was accused of talking about sanctions, he lied about it and he got caught?\u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562650.6572626}
