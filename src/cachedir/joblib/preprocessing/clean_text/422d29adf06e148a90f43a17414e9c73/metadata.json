They're the real deal. \\nHere is a message from the founder of Newsbud, Sibel Edmond: \\nWe have launched our new Kickstarter campaign, and we need your help again. We have 35 days to raise $130,000, and we know we can do it with your support! \\nWe have taken an enormous step forward thanks to your funding of our Phase 1 campaign. Now we need your help to achieve this next step so we can continue building our 100% people-funded independent media outlet. \\nPlease help. Make a pledge and put the word out by telling everyone in your social-media networks. \\nWithout you, we cannot achieve our dream of a media outlet that is nonpartisan and accountable only to its viewers and to the truth. Make a donation, subscribe, and activate others. They have rendered we the people irrelevant; together, we will make them irrelevant! \\nThank you for all your support,Sibel Edmond\""}, "time": 1742564157.7454863}
