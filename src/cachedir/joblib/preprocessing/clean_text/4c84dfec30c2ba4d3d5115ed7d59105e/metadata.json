He doesn\u2019t remember what he has done , or what he has said , or what he believed or didn\u2019t believe in the recent past. \\nNow we have another example of Trump insisting that he said what he didn\u2019t say, that he didn\u2019t say what he said, and that he never believed what he said he believed. \\nConfused? \\nYup. We are, too. \\nMediate reports that Trump\u2019s memory about Obamacare is very murky, too. The candidate has been hitting the stump hard claiming that he will overturn the \u201cdisaster\u201d of Obamacare. \\nIn fact, Trump has been claiming to anyone who will listen that he has always been against Obama\u2019s health care plan. To listen to him, you would think that the man had taken to the airwaves as soon as the Affordable Care Act was passed, proclaiming that it would be the end of civilization as we know it. \\nExcept that he didn\u2019t. \\nAfter it was announced the other day that insurance premiums are going to be increasing this year, Trump pumped his fists and congratulated himself with his usual fervor. He crowed to Fox News: \u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster, and I\u2019ve been saying it from the time before they even voted for it. I said this is a plan can\u2019t work, it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d He told Rush Limbaugh that : \u201cObamacare is a disaster. And you remember, I called that from before it was approved. I said, \u2018This can\u2019t work, because it\u2019s just \u2026 the plan is no good. The concept is no good.\u2019\u201d \\nOnce again, though, the truth seems to have nothing in common with Trump\u2019s faulty memory. In reality, back when the law was passed, Trump had not yet declared for the Presidency. He went on the air with Joy Behar on the day in 2010 when the law was passed. She asked him what he thought about the Act, and he replied that he had mixed feelings. \\nTrump said that he hated to think about people being unable to get health care, but he worried about the cost to businesses. Then he commented on the President, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty tough thing, but yeah, right now, he\u2019s certainly looking like a hero.\u201d So. Um. Mr. Trump\u2019s memory is pretty damn shaky if you ask me. It seems that he is either trying to desperately to revise reality in order to put himself in a better light, or he is suffering from a very serious memory disorder.
