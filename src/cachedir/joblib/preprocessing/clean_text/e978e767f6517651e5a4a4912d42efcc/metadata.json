Trump lashed out at Democrats on Thursday over their efforts to preserve President Obama\u2019s health care coverage law, insulting their top legislative leader and denouncing the measure as a \u201clie\u201d as he called for a less expensive and more effective system. \u201cThe Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in the first of three   posts on Twitter. The posts arrived the day after Mr. Obama huddled with Democrats on Capitol Hill to strategize over protecting the Affordable Care Act and Vice   Mike Pence met with Republicans about how to gut it. \u201cInstead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and BLAME,\u201d Mr. Trump continued on Twitter. \u201cThe fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning. \u2018Keep you doctor, keep your plan! \u2019\u201d He said it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together on a \u201cplan that really works  \u2014   much less expensive  FAR BETTER!\u201d The messages could be seen as Mr. Trump\u2019s latest attempt to seize the narrative of the day and deflect attention from a story line less favorable to him. Senate Republicans convened a hearing on Thursday to examine intelligence that the Russians engaged in computer hacking to affect the outcome of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has disputed that the Russians were to blame, and he has criticized American intelligence agencies for their work. Mr. Trump also used the social media platform to push back against criticism he attracted on Wednesday for siding with Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, over United States intelligence officials in rejecting Russian responsibility for the hacking. Mr. Trump\u2019s latest Twitter salvo also appeared to be an attempt to mount a political defense of his bid to scrap the law that has provided health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans, as Democrats work to make that effort politically toxic. Mr. Schumer responded later Thursday, saying the   was in a \u201cdifficult spot\u201d on the issue. \u201cInstead of calling names,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump \u201cshould roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million Americans who gained coverage, that will cover students or   students, 21 to 26, who want to stay on their parents\u2019 plan, that will show how we cover people with   conditions. \u201d On Wednesday, the   appeared to acknowledge the challenges of doing so without being saddled by voters with a share of blame for the shortcomings of the measure. \u201cRepublicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, adding in a separate post: \u201cDon\u2019t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. \u201d His comments on Thursday came as Mr. Obama took a subtle swipe at the   in a farewell letter, without naming him, writing that Americans never voted for rolling back the health care measure. \u201cWhat won\u2019t help is taking health care away from 30 million Americans, most of them white and working class denying overtime pay to workers, most of whom have more than earned it or privatizing Medicare and Social Security and letting Wall Street regulate itself again  \u2014   none of which   Americans voted for,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the   letter. As the debate unfolded in Washington, Mr. Trump on Thursday spent more than an hour sitting for a deposition in New York as part of his legal feud with the renowned chef Jos\u00e9 Andres, whom Mr. Trump is suing for pulling out of a plan to open a new restaurant in his luxury hotel near the White House. Mr. Andres, who is   has said he canceled the project because of Mr. Trump\u2019s disparaging rhetoric about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign. Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, called the case \u201cfairly straightforward. \u201d \u201cIn short, the parties entered into a valid and enforceable lease, which the tenant clearly breached by walking out and failing to perform its obligations, thereby entitling the landlord to recover damages in the form of unpaid rent, cost of build out, lost profits and other expenses,\u201d Mr. Garten said in a statement.'"}, "time": 1742628556.928562}
