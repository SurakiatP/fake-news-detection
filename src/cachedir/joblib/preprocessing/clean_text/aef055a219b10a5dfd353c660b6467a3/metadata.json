[College Spokesperson Zach Powers told the Olympian on Tuesday that Bret Weinstein returned to his campus classroom \u201cjust over a week ago,\u201d despite Weinstein\u2019s Monday appearance on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News program, during which he claimed that he was forced to relocate his family and class sessions away from campus due to safety concerns.  \u201cThe college has never acknowledged the danger that they put us in, and therefore I have no way of knowing whether it\u2019s safe for me to return,\u201d Weinstein said on Carlson\u2019s program. \u201cTheir assurances that it is safe don\u2019t mean anything, not that they\u2019ve offered them. \u201d \u201cI understand faculty member Bret Weinstein returned to campus just over a week ago to teach in his normally assigned classroom,\u201d Evergreen Spokesperson Zach Powers claimed. \u201cHe has been notified by Evergreen Police Services of additional law enforcement present on campus. Weinstein quickly swatted down the Powers\u2019 claim that he had returned to campus. \u201cIf college administrators say I was on campus last week, they are lying,\u201d Weinstein told the Olympian. \u201cI left campus when it was evacuated on the morning of June 1. I held my afternoon class in a downtown park that day, and left the state with my family that evening. We have not been in Washington since, and some administrators know that. \u201d Weinstein\u2019s brother, Eric, who is the Managing Director at Thiel Capital, claimed that Evergreen State is \u201cnakedly lying to the press about\u201d Bret Weinstein. He called Evergreen the \u201c1st failed US College,\u201d before claiming that its president, George Bridges is \u201cnuts. \u201d The @EvergreenStCol now openly  nakedly lying to the press about @BretWeinstein. This is the 1st failed US college  its President is nuts. https:  .   \u2014   Eric Weinstein (@EricRWeinstein) June 14, 2017,  Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
