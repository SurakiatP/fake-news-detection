When Comey and the media have been politicizing it all along, by giving Hillary special treatment that no one else on earth would have gotten in the same circumstances?] \\nWhy did FBI Director James Comey shock Washington on Friday with an announcement that the FBI \u201chas learned of the existence of emails\u201d related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, and what does it mean? \\nThe truth is Comey didn\u2019t have a choice. Because the new information followed his sworn testimony about the case, Comey was obligated by Department of Justice rules to keep the relevant committees apprised. \\nUnder oath Comey had stated that the bureau had completed its review. Once he learned that there were new emails that required examination, Comey had to notify Congress that he had to amend his testimony because it was no longer true. \u2026 \\nHad Comey not told Congress and it emerged after the election that new materials had come into its possession, the director and his entire agency\u2019s credibility might have been questioned. \\nIn his letter, Comey did not use the phrase being touted by Republicans that the case had been reopened. Technically it was never closed.'"}, "time": 1742562716.5755877}
