[According to the Los Angeles Times, the    General Hospital and Melrose Place star will challenge Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley in California\u2019s 26th Congressional district, which encompasses a large portion of Ventura County and part of the central coast.  The actor  \u2014   who has competed on Dancing with the Stars and worked as a model  \u2014   spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of Trump in July. Sabato strategist and fundraiser Charles Moran told the Times that the actor\u2019s experience at the convention sparked his own desire to affect change in Washington. \u201cBeing a Republican and with proximity to the White House and Republican leadership, he\u2019s going to be able to get more done  \u2014   being in the majority, with his notoriety, for the residents of the 26th [Congressional] District,\u201d Moran told the paper. Sabato was a vocal supporter of Trump throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. At the Republican convention in July, the actor  \u2014   who immigrated from Italy to the United States in 1985  \u2014   said he had never considered himself to be a political person before, but expressed concern about the direction of the United States, and said those wishing to enter the country should follow the same procedures he did nearly thirty years ago. \u201cHaving secure borders, protecting our citizens, none of this is hateful,\u201d Sabato said at the time. \u201cThis is the responsibility of the government. And it\u2019s the right thing to do. \u201d The candidate will reportedly campaign with a focus on veterans and substance abuse issues. In August, Sabato said in an interview that he had been blacklisted from Hollywood due to his political beliefs. \u201ct\u2019s not just me. I know a lot of people in the industry who are in the same boat,\u201d he told Variety. \u201cThe reality is if you\u2019re associated with the Republican Party, the casting directors and producers already blacklist you based on that. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742564245.552352}
