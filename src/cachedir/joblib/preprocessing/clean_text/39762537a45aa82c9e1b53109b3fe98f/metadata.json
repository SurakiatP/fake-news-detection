[\u201cHe\u2019s gone out there and defied the odds over and over and over again, and he keeps getting told what he can\u2019t do by this narrative that\u2019s out there,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd he exceeds it every single time. \u201d  Spicer made his remarks during a question and answer session with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta during the White House Press briefing. During the briefing, Spicer listed all of the speculative predictions that the media made during Trump\u2019s campaign, the transition, and the inauguration that turned out to be wrong. \u201cI think over and over again there\u2019s this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and the movement that he represents,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s frustrating for not just him, but I think so many of us that are trying to work to get this message out. \u201d Throughout his time in Washington, Spicer said, the media had never been as negative as they were toward Trump, calling it \u201cdemoralizing. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it like this, Jim,\u201d he told Acosta, adding later that the \u201cdefault narrative is always negative and it\u2019s demoralizing. \u201d Despite accusations that Spicer misled the media, he said that he would never intentionally lie to them. \u201cThere are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our intention\u2019s never to lie to you. \u201d Big Government, Big Journalism'"}, "time": 1742562254.1012287}
