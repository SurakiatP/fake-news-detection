I beat the ban in Berkeley \u2013 still censored in Sacramento By Kevin Barrett on October 26, 2016 \\nby Kevin Barrett , Veterans Today Editor \\nThanks to members of the Social Justice Committee of the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian Universalists, a large and enthusiastic crowd turned out for my talk on \u201cRecent False Flags\u201d yesterday. It was a triumph of free speech in the city that gave the world the Free Speech Movement. \\nBut unlike last year\u2019s talk (watch it here ) this one wasn\u2019t held at BFUU. \\nWhy not? One member of the BFUU Social Justice Community, a certain Holly Harwood, demanded that my scheduled event be canceled because (she libelously claimed) I am a \u201cJew hater\u201d and \u201chomophobe.\u201d \\nNot one member of the Social Justice Committee supported her. \\nSo Holly Harwood started inundating the BFUU Board with lies and distortions about me and my books. The Board, which apparently includes some \u201cstealth Zionists\u201d who got themselves elected by concealing their pro-Israel loyalties, went along with her. \\nHarwood\u2019s vicious vilification campaign only succeeded in increasing the turnout for my talk, which was held at Redwood Gardens instead of BFUU. But Harwood didn\u2019t get the message. Now she has managed to censor another Berkeley free speech institution: Bonnie Faulkner\u2019s legendary Guns and Butter radio show. \\nToday\u2019s broadcast, which goes out on KPFA Berkeley and other Pacifica stations, features most of an interview Bonnie recorded with me last week. Unfortunately, after more mendacious complaints from Holly Harwood, Bonnie was apparently forced to cut the final six minutes of the interview, which features me explaining how and why I was banned at BFUU. Here is the censored \u201cGuns and Butter\u201d segment (please spread it far and wide so the censorship backfires): \\nThe last place on earth I would ever expect ANY censorship of ANYTHING is Berkeley, California. And the last two places in Berkeley I would EVER expect to be censored are the Unitarian Church and the Guns and Butter radio show! \\nDid I fall into a black hole and emerge into a Bizarro World counter-universe where Berkeley Unitarians are authoritarians and censors, and it\u2019s the Bible-thumping Baptists of Alabama who are at the cutting edge of free speech, free thought, and unfettered intellectual inquiry? Memo to the Association of Alabama Baptists: Please invite this \u201cradical Muslim conspiracy theorist\u201d to speak at your freedom-loving church! \\nAnd it gets worse. I will be speaking in Sacramento tonight, and guess who\u2019s blocking the news? The main local leader of the 9/11 truth movement! \\nDavid Kimball, who runs Sacramento 9/11 Truth, has sponsored and/or helped publicize all of my previous talks in the area. Yet this time he wouldn\u2019t return my repeated phone calls. Finally, weeks after I had started calling him, I got this email: \\nFrom: David Kimball <\u2026> Sent: Friday, October 21, 2016 11:42 PM Subject: Re: Sacramento event October 26th \\nHi Kevin. \\nI\u2019ve received your phone messages and email, and my apologies for this late response. \\nIn recent years I\u2019ve continued to research 9/11 more thoroughly, and although you and I are still in agreement that the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d of 9/11 cannot be true and that the media perpetuates the Big Lie, my views about 9/11 are no longer in agreement with yours. \\nTherefore, I cannot in good conscience promote your upcoming speaking event. \\nSincerely,'"}, "time": 1742564411.4046474}
