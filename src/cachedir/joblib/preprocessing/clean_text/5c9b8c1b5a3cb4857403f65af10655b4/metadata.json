This happened on his last day in office. \\nMarc Rich traded with America\u2019s enemies. He traded with Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s Iran when the Ayatollah held 53 Americans hostage in 1979. He made $2 billion selling oil to South Africa during the UN embargo of the country. He did deals with Khadafy\u2019s Libya,Milosevic\u2019s Yugoslavia, Kim Il Sung\u2019s North Korea, Communist dictatorships in Cuba and the Soviet Union itself. \\n*** He was on the FBI\u2019s ten most wanted list. \\nNow, we know that Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Ritch because his wife gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s senatorial campaign. \\nThere is literally evidence that Bill Clinton pardoned a known criminal because that criminal gave money to the Clinton Foundation. \\n*** HOW MUCH MORE CORRUPTION CAN WE STAND!?!? \\nShare this everywhere! We need to take down the Clinton\u2019s this week. This is the final stand. The second American revolution has started. It is peaceful and it relies on the people of the United States waking up to the crimes of the Clintons. \\nShare this 1 million times, patriots!\""}, "time": 1742564415.066944}
