From reports on her campus visits to FaceTime sessions with supporters, Chelsea Clinton\u2019s tweets were positive, inclusive and unfailingly on message. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be more proud of my mom and the campaign she\u2019s run,\u201d Ms. Clinton wrote on Election Day. \u201cLet\u2019s bring it home for her today. \u201d Things didn\u2019t work out as planned, of course. And after Donald J. Trump, and not her mother, was sworn in as the country\u2019s 45th president, another side of Chelsea Clinton seemed to emerge. In recent weeks, she has greeted the Trump era with a more sarcastic and feisty online personality, sharing with her 1. 6 million followers her fiercely held political beliefs and sparring with political adversaries in   bursts. Ms. Clinton has accused a Trump adviser of spreading misinformation, admonished a Republican congressman for racist comments and pushed the president to speak out in the face of an increase in religiously motivated attacks. She has also seemed to step up the number of messages she is sending: According to TweetStats, a tool that tracks posting frequency, Ms. Clinton posted 142 tweets last November. In February, she posted over 300, an average of more than 10 a day. All of this has raised questions  \u2014   and prompted criticism  \u2014   about Ms. Clinton\u2019s political ambitions. If it\u2019s coming from a Clinton, both supporters and critics have wondered, can a tweet ever be just a tweet? Several people close to Ms. Clinton and her family say that yes, this is just tweeting, and no, she is not using it as a strategy to eventually run for office. Melanne Verveer, who served as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff when she was first lady, has known Chelsea since she was a girl. Ms. Verveer didn\u2019t understand the newfound interest in the youngest Clinton\u2019s political motives, and thinks most observers are jumping to conclusions. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably natural in some ways for people to think, \u2018Well, she\u2019s the next in line\u2019 in a political family,\u201d Ms. Verveer said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s reading too much into tweets. \u201d (Since when has that ever satiated the internet\u2019s thirst for content?) Liz Robbins, a Washington lobbyist and a close friend of the Clintons, said she was surprised that people just now seemed to notice that Ms. Clinton was jumping into the Twitter fray. \u201cIt\u2019s like coming late to the movie,\u201d Ms. Robbins said. She does have a point: Ms. Clinton has maintained a Twitter account since 2012 and has tweeted more than 5, 900 times. Many of those were messages of support for her mother on the campaign trail. And here is Jen Lee Koss, a friend of Ms. Clinton\u2019s since the two were roommates at Oxford: \u201cShe\u2019s literally just tweeting like a normal person would tweet. \u201d Fine. There is probably some truth to this \u201cnormal person\u201d theory. People who use social media generally enjoy circulating information that aligns with their beliefs. People squabble. And people can certainly find themselves setting off heated discussions about things that don\u2019t really matter, as the bedlam that arose from Ms. Clinton\u2019s spinach pancake recipe may suggest. But Ms. Clinton is still a Clinton. She may be her own person  \u2014   a    mother of two, an activist  \u2014   but she remains the only child of President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, the first female presidential candidate of a major political party. Ms. Lee Koss, who said she spoke to Ms. Clinton daily, said that she may be living up to the expectations that come with this particular political family. Or maybe that is just what her supporters want to see. \u201cI think a lot of people maybe wonder where the Clinton voice is now,\u201d Ms. Lee Koss said. \u201cMaybe people want to hear from her and are clinging to that. \u201d Mattie Bekink, a friend from Ms. Clinton\u2019s days at Stanford, said Ms. Clinton\u2019s behavior hadn\u2019t changed much since the election, even if the political world thinks otherwise. These messages now come from a member of the party that lost lest Ms. Clinton forget, people like Kellyanne Conway are willing to remind her, in their own tweets. \u201cChelsea hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Ms. Bekink wrote in an email. \u201cThe norms of political and social discourse have. \u201d Referring to a message sent by Representative Steve King of Iowa, the Republican congressman whom Ms. Clinton criticized, Ms. Bekink added: \u201cEven a year ago, I doubt a sitting member of Congress would dare to tweet something blatantly racist and then stand by it. \u201d (Part of a tweet by Mr. King had read: \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies. \u201d) When asked to provide a   response to speculation over her tweets, Ms. Clinton relayed the following over email: \u201cTwitter helps us share what we think is important  helps us raise our voices against efforts to take us back years, decades   \u2026     or centuries. \u201d None of the five Clinton friends interviewed for this article thought that any of this necessarily adds up to another Clinton running for office. Ms. Clinton, several pointed out, has, for years, swatted down rumors over her political aspirations. But one Clinton ally did hint that Ms. Clinton could have a desire to be a voice for Democratic causes. The ally, Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat, said Ms. Clinton was perhaps simply keeping her family\u2019s name in the national conversation while her parents took time off from politics. \u201cIf that\u2019s your mother,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said, \u201cand you\u2019ve shared these interests and passions for these things, then there\u2019s no secret motivation that has to necessarily be behind your desire to get out in front and carry on. \u201d Mr. Jacobs added, \u201cThat\u2019s what Clintons do, by the way. \u201d Of course, others would prefer that the Clintons refrain from speaking out. The headlines can be blunt  \u2014   \u201cGod Help Us if Chelsea Clinton Runs for Office,\u201d The New York Post shouted in February. Meghan McCain, a daughter of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, (and herself no stranger to the political media glare) was just as unvarnished about the prospect. \u201cWhat fresh hell am I living in where I am going to have to sit through Chelsea Clinton running for office?\u201d Ms. McCain said recently on Fox News. \u201cThe media gives this grown woman with two children a pass. Every step of the way. \u201d Ms. Lee Koss, Ms. Clinton\u2019s friend from college, doesn\u2019t understand the intense criticism over a few hundred innocent tweets. \u201cTo the naysayers: It\u2019s Twitter,\u201d Ms. Lee Koss said. \u201cJust unfollow. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628557.3523607}
