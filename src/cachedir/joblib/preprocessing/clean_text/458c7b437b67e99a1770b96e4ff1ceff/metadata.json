She made her way through a maze of tall men in tailored sweatsuits rehearsing beneath a basket, to a spot that signified a turning point in her life. \u201cI was standing right here back in 2009 when I interviewed Estelle,\u201d she said, referring to the British singer and songwriter, shortly before the start of a New York Knicks basketball game last week. \u201cI was so nervous that day because she was such a big celebrity, and I was just a    kid in the program. \u201d Ms. Benjamin  \u2014   now a    senior at Brooklyn College majoring in film production who hopes, she said, \u201cto become the next influential film director\u201d  \u2014   was referring to her days as a student in the MSG Classroom program, which teaches children about jobs in television, including announcing, producing, directing and creating graphics. In 2009, Ms. Benjamin was living with her mother and two younger siblings in a homeless shelter. Things began to brighten when she was one of 10 children from   neighborhoods selected to participate in the Hope Leadership Academy. The academy is run by the Children\u2019s Aid Society, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Children\u2019s Aid Society also provided $300 to Ms. Benjamin to buy clothes to wear during interview assignments and college visits. The academy worked with the Garden of Dreams Foundation, a nonprofit that helps children facing obstacles, to form the MSG Classroom program, which allows students to use Madison Square Garden as a laboratory of sorts. Program members are free to interview MSG employees and officials players with the Knicks, the New York Rangers and the New York Liberty and celebrity guests booked by MSG Entertainment. \u201cThat experience is what motivated me to want to become the next Martin Scorsese, the next Quentin Tarantino, the next Spike Lee,\u201d Ms. Benjamin said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t nearly as many female directors out there, so I would love to break through and contribute my own artistic vision to the industry. And if that means directing a drama or a horror flick or a cheesy romantic comedy, it really doesn\u2019t matter. I just want the opportunity to put my own creative stamp on something. \u201d Having long recognized Ms. Benjamin\u2019s desire to become a director, program officials gave her the chance to meet Mr. Lee, an avid Knicks fan. His directorial skills, Ms. Benjamin said, \u201cchanged the film game in a lot of ways. \u201d The meeting took place during halftime at the Knicks game against the Oklahoma City Thunder last Monday, when Ms. Benjamin was escorted to a section of courtside seats where she found Mr. Lee chatting with the comedian Chris Rock. Mr. Lee immediately invited Ms. Benjamin over, and wasted no time offering her valuable advice. \u201cThe easiest way to break into this business is to be a   with a hyphen,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are your writing skills? Do you keep a journal? Do you write down your story ideas every single day? Just keep writing. \u201d Mr. Lee became animated when Ms. Benjamin said to him, \u201cWhen you came along, you did a lot of things that were new at the time, and now it sometimes feels as if everything has already been done. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole new world of cinema yet to be discovered, and we need more female directors like yourself out there trying to find it. So keep believing in yourself and do not let anyone discourage you from telling a story you want to tell. That\u2019s just noise that you don\u2019t want to hear. \u201d Mr. Lee offered one more directorial tip. \u201cAlways remember that a good director needs to be surrounded by very good actors, because the best actors might bring something extra or new to a role that you never expected,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that out one day when you\u2019re directing Denzel. \u201d When their conversation ended, Mr. Lee invited Ms. Benjamin to spend a day on the set of his coming Netflix show, \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d named for Mr. Lee\u2019s first movie, released in 1986. The series is being filmed in Brooklyn. \u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Ms. Benjamin said, her smile widening. \u201cThat would be amazing. \u201d Andrea Greenberg, president and chief executive of the television company MSG Networks, which runs the program, and a board member of the Garden of Dreams Foundation, said that Ms. Benjamin was \u201cjust one example of the   impact and effect the foundation has on our kids, which is something we pride ourselves on  \u2014   and we are very proud of Jazmyn. \u201d So is Ms. Benjamin\u2019s mother, Monica, who watched as Mr. Lee held court with her daughter. \u201cWhat an amazing night,\u201d said the elder Ms. Benjamin, who now lives with her three children in an apartment of their own in West Harlem. \u201cJazmyn is a very artistic person who has impressed me with a few film projects she has directed at school,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s always looking for that different camera angle, always trying new and creative things, and in that regard, she\u2019s a lot like Spike. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564520.3158991}
