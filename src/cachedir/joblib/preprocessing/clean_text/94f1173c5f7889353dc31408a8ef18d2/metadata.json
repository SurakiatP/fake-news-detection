[Up to 216 workers at the Kellogg plant in Vadnais Heights, Minnesota, were notified last week that their jobs were on the chopping block as part of the company\u2019s plan to reverse its financial freefall, according to CBS news.  Jeremy Hanson Willis, deputy commissioner of Minnesota\u2019s Department of Employment and Economic Development, told the media that he received the company\u2019s notification satisfying a federal mandate to alert state authorities when a mass layoff is occurring. Willis tried to put a brave face on it insisting the laid off workers will be fine. \u201cThere are a lot of businesses around the state looking for workers and having a hard time to employ them because we have so few unemployed folks in our state,\u201d Willis told the media. A Kellogg\u2019s spokesman admitted that the layoffs were part of the company\u2019s effort to retool. Joe Lierz, Kellogg\u2019s director of labor relations, told the StarTribune that the layoffs were \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the company\u2019s   plan. He added that the Minnesota job loss \u201cis one in a series\u201d of layoff announcements coming across the country. The layoffs in Minnesota came on the heels of layoffs at Kellogg\u2019s plants and distribution centers in New York, Michigan, and other states. The   plan was a result of the $53 million   loss reported by the cereal maker and is expected to include the closure of 39 distribution centers affecting roughly 1, 100 workers across the country. The cereal giant\u2019s financial troubles coincided with its decision to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart\u2019s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November, Kellogg\u2019s announced that Breitbart News\u2019s conservative readers are not \u201caligned with our values as a company. \u201d While the decision by Kellogg\u2019s to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com, it did represent an escalation in the war by companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.
