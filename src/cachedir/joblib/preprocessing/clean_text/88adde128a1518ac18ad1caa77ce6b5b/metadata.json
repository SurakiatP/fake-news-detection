We see a lot of the sneering that we\u2019re seeing from the Clinton News Network.\u201d \\nGorani interjected, \u201cThat\u2019s CNN, you\u2019re calling us the Clinton News Network,\u201d to which Hopkins immediately responded, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly correct.\u201d \\nWhen Gorani pressed as to why Hopkins would say such a thing about the network, Hopkins explained that she was referring to the manipulated polls that CNN routinely passes off on viewers showing Clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead over Trump.   \\nHopkins proceeded to say that she and many others had \u201cgrown bored\u201d with the collection of \u201cmeaningless\u201d polls that were clearly biased in favor of Clinton and downplayed support for Trump. \\n\u201cI will say having sat in the Republican convention and having watched your coverage, it is completely biased. And I think Trump is doing a great job,\u201d stated Hopkins. \\nThe two then attempted to speak over each other for a moment, with Gorani demanding proof that CNN was biased, until Hopkins finally broke through by decrying CNN\u2019s portrayal of woman as \u201cvictims\u201d who need to be shielded from someone like Trump, informing the host that women in general are plenty capable of deciding for themselves if they are threatened by Trump or not. \\nShe then proceeded to state that polls have shown how much Clinton is disliked by the general public, even saying, \u201cI find her abhorrent to look at. Her little smile there does nothing for me.\u201d  '"}, "time": 1742561777.596922}
