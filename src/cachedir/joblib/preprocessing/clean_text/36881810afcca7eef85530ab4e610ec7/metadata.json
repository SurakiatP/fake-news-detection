He said: \\n\u201cI\u2019m going to vote for Hillary because\u2026 I think she\u2019s great! It\u2019s not a lesser of two evils. I think she\u2019s great, she\u2019s really talented and I think she\u2019s super smart, I would take her over anybody else that would do it. To me it\u2019s really exciting to have the first mother in the White House, it\u2019s not just about the first woman, it\u2019s about the first mom. Because a mother she\u2019s got it! A mother just does IT. She feeds you, and teaches you, she protects you. She takes care of shit.\u201d \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 240 years of fathers. Father after father. Bald Father. Fat Father. Every kind of Father. Fathers are ok. I\u2019m a dad, you\u2019re a dad. A GREAT father can give his kids about 40% of their needs. Any mother, even a not even trying mother can give 200%!\u201d \\nWatch the rest here, because the ending is truly the best part:'"}, "time": 1742562227.6102808}
