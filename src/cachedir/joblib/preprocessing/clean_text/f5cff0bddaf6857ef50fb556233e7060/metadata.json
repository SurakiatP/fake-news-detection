Having clearly identified the bad guys, the US, its allies and mainstream media ask patiently for a hesitant international community to act on its \u201cResponsibility to Protect\u201d. By now it would seem mainstream media are tired of calling for humanitarian intervention in Eastern Aleppo to stop the Syrian Arab Army and Russian jets, tired of trotting out statistics and quotes from the terrorist/rebel-infested White Helmets (WHs) and the opposition-supporting Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, a one-man operation located in a London suburb, while completely ignoring civilian victims of a rebel force said to be composed of 50% al-Nusra (AKA al Qaeda terrorists. (1) Confident of their media cover, the WHs haven\u2019t been smart enough to hide their ties with the notorious al-Nusra and other terrorist factions and are now in danger of being fairly discredited. (2) At the same time, the SOHR, probably designed as a short-term propaganda asset at a time when rebel/terrorist funding was still obscure and the world didn\u2019t know it was actually Al-Nusra calling the shots in the \u00b4moderate\u00b4 opposition side, is also losing credibility. But before the media is no longer able to sustain the lie even among their most uninformed victims, the chant of \u201cthe international community must act\u2019 grows louder by the minute. But this time it\u2019s not just client states, lapdog allies and some weak third world \u2018regime\u2019, subject to easy de-stabilization, otherwise it would be business as usual: subvert, demonize, invade, set up a facade regime and get ready for the next target. This time there\u2019s Russia to reckon with. And Russia has her own independent reasons to be in Syria, ground zero for world terrorism. Gaddafi murdered by Washington-controlled jihadists. A mafia hit pure and simple, ordered by the biggest mafia outfit on earth. UK\u2019s Daily Mirror, a typical media shill for the imperialists, whitewashing the ugliness of what its masters did. In all these sanctimonious exercises favored by the Western media, in reality little but a Ministry of Disinformation for global capitalism, we should notice the rigid script followed by the press, the lack of options when demanding interventions, as well as a complete lack of any kind of explanation of how their proposed intervention is supposed to take place, as if \u2018humanitarian intervention\u2019 meant some sort of magical way to end conflicts and save civilians, all of which shows their complete disregard for the recent past. Many journalists\u2014who by dint of sheer ignorance (they too are subject to the brainwash afflicting most Americans, plus the pressures of careerism) are now lining up behind the \u2018no-fly zone\u2019 banner, some of them clearly not knowing exactly what it means, especially its sinister and extremely dangerous implications, but they know something better: Power (and their paychecks) demand it (again). As it did in 2003 when the official initial pretext to rally the country for war, Iraq\u00b4s Weapons of Mass Destruction narrative, was losing steam, the people of Iraq \u2014according to our brave media\u2014suddenly started to need \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018protection\u2019, to quote the usual doublespeak. Needles to say the very same same Powers which had ruthlessly imposed a brutal regime of sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of children and women between 1991 and 2003, were now eager to deliver humanitarian aid. (3) T hose children passed unnoticed by our deeply concerned journalists while the tragedy of their slow-motion death was taking place; their pictures not used to call for any kind of humanitarian relief or intervention, as the corporate media attention to the suffering of civilians tends to be very selective, as Ed Herman and David Peterson explain with typical lucidity in The Politics of Genocide: \u201cWhen we ourselves commit mass-atrocity crimes, the atrocities are Constructive , our victims are unworthy of our attention and indignation, and never suffer \u2018genocide\u2019 at our hands \u2013like the Iraqi untermenschen who have died in such grotesque numbers over the past two decades. But when the perpetrator of mass-atrocity crimes is our enemy or a state targeted by us for destabilization and attack, the converse is true. Then the atrocities are Nefarious and their victims worthy of our focus, sympathy, public displays of solidarity, and calls for inquiry and punishment\u201d. Eight years after Iraq\u2019s 2003 invasion, history repeated itself in Libya, where another putative tyrant was \u2018about to commit an atrocity against his own people\u2019, as was suggested by European leaders and a deafening mainstream media chorus. Eventually, the Great Hegemon, with headquarters in Washington, also heard the call for action, and joined the crusade. (Actually, the whole ruse had been plotted in close coordination in the true axis of evil of our time, the Washington-London-Paris triad of international gangsterism, with Obama\u2019s regime this time playing the coy, reluctant imperialist furnishing largely logistical and intel support). According to the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which was \u201cunable to visit Tripoli, Benghazi, Tobruk or anywhere else in Libya due to the collapse of internal security and the rule of law\u201d in 2016, \u201c\u2026out of a total Libyan population of 6.3 million people, 3 million people have been impacted by the armed conflict, and 2.4 million people require protection and some form of humanitarian assistance\u201d. (4) For its part, the Human Rights Watch stated, also in 2016, that \u201c\u2026Forces engaged in the conflict continued with impunity to arbitrarily detain, torture, unlawfully kill, indiscriminately attack, abduct and disappear, and forcefully displace people from their homes. The domestic criminal justice system collapsed in most parts of the country, exacerbating the human rights crisis\u201d. (5) This seems to be the paradoxical result of a recent \u2018humanitarian intervention\u2019 from which the mainstream media is not morally prepared to take any valuable lessons. Of course, the paradox is nothing of the sort when you understand the real reasons behind the intervention, regarding the French government, and particularly its ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, as stated by a US State Department intelligence advisor: \u201cA desire to gain a greater share of Libya oil production; Improve his internal political situation in France\u201d, among other supposedly deeply humanitarian causes. The US State Department, as expected, went along with the farce. B ut what is exactly a no-fly zone? According to US Army General Martin Dempsey in a letter to the US Congress in 2013: \u201cThis option uses lethal force to prevent the regime from using its military aircraft to bomb and resupply. It would extend air superiority over Syria by neutralizing the regime\u2019s advanced, defense integrated air defense system. It would also shoot down adversary aircraft and strike airfields, aircraft on the ground, and supporting infrastructure\u2026 Risks include the loss of U.S. aircraft, which would require us to insert personnel recovery forces. It may also fail to reduce the violence\u2026\u201d And going back to the House of Commons assessments of 2016, when \u201c\u2026France and UK argued that the international community should simply impose a no-fly zone\u2026 former US Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, pointed out: \u00b4Cameron was pushing for a no-fly zone, but in the US there was great skepticism. A no-fly zone wasn\u00b4t effective in Bosnia, it wasn\u2019t effective in Iraq, and probably wasn\u2019t going to be effective in Libya\u2026 Gaddafi was attacking people. A no-fly zone wasn\u2019t going to stop him. Instead, to stop him we would need to bomb his forces attacking people.\u2019\u201d Of course, Daalder was describing the ineffectiveness of a NFZ while pushing for stronger measures. The crime of \u201coptional imperialist war\u201d remained the same, regardless of the methods eventually used. Similarities with the Syrian \u2018civilian\u2019 uprising of 2011 abound, as UK Former Chief of Defense Staff Lord Richards of Herstmonceux later confirmed, intelligence on the composition of the rebel militias was not \u2018as good as one would wish\u2019, and when these rebels with affiliations to Al-Qaeda finally got their hands on the \u201ctyrant\u201d\u2014a man who had on numerous occasions been feted in Italy and France\u2019s capitals, and who had built one of the most advanced social safety nets for his people\u2014they simply do what jackals do, they tortured and murdered him, with the mainstream media, particularly in England and the US, reacting in a fashion that would make hyenas look like sheep: under headlines like \u201cMad Dog Put Down\u201d most front pages showed gruesome pictures of Gaddafi\u2019s last moments, the word \u2019murdered\u2019 nowhere to be found. Demonized \u201ctyrants\u201d aren\u00b4t murdered, they are executed or, as the New York Post stated: \u201cKilled by a Yankee Fan\u201d, in a humorous reference to a boy wearing a New York Yankees cap among the killers. (6) The New York Times\u2019 Kareem Fahim refers to the \u201ctrophies of war\u201d, in an article filled with pictures of Gaddafi\u2019s and one of his sons\u2019 dead bodies surrounded by cheering men, where any other \u201ctrophy\u201d, as his golden gun, is only mentioned briefly to give the idea he isn\u00b4t referring to the corpses. (7) Andrew Gilligan wrote in the Telegraph: \u201cthe one thing Gaddafi retained to the very end was his ability to put on a show\u2026\u201d (8). Ability shared by many journalists when cheering for interventions known for causing worse catastrophes than those that supposedly caused the intervention in the first place. Many rationales are given for the explicit, openly celebratory content. As Chris Elliot, The Guardian\u2019s reader\u2019s editor explains: \u201c On reflection \u2013 and having read the complaints \u2013 I feel less convinced about the way we used these photographs, although I still feel strongly that they are an important part of this story and should have been used. The scale of the photo on the newspaper front page of 21 October and prominent picture use on the website took us too close to appearing to revel in the killing rather than reporting it\u201d. (Emphasis added). This reveling over Gaddafi\u2019s corpse reflects the celebration of an establishment victory by its subservient propaganda media, but it also served to focus attention away from the unlawful killing of many others, and the exact details of how the killing took place. As Media Lens observed: \u201c\u2026but there was more than the lonely killing of a \u201ctyrant\u201d that went unreported. Human Rights Watch reported that between six and ten people appeared to have been executed at the scene of the Libyan leader\u2019s capture. Around 95 bodies were found in the immediate vicinity, many of them victims of NATO airstrikes. In fact, it is clear that NATO, with the assistance of Special Forces (although ground troops were strictly forbidden by UN resolution 1973), had maintained a no-drive zone around Sirte: a crucial factor facilitating the murder of Gaddafi. CBS reported 572 bodies \u2018and counting\u2019 in Sirte, including 300, \u2018many of them with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head\u2019, collected and buried in a mass grave\u201d. (9) (Emphasis added) There should be little doubt regarding the reasons behind the selective use of pictures of bloodied children by mainstream media (and many NGOs), especially when they endorse calls for \u2018humanitarian intervention\u2019 against governments previously targeted for regime change, as it has already been clearly established in the case of Syria long before the 2011 uprising, via many US secret documents revealed by WikiLeaks. Propaganda is particularly transparent in this case: create a sense of guilt and impotence, prepare public opinion to demand what has already been planned elsewhere, in the darker councils of unaccountable power. The scandalous double-standard that selectively shows the suffering of \u201cworthy\u201d children while hiding the pain and death of those victimized for sordid reasons by the \u201cExceptional Nation\u201d and its equally murderous accomplices dressed in civilized garb, is the great hypocrisy of our time, flowing smoothly from its deeply corrupt DNA. The obvious options such as putting an end to the funding of \u2018moderates\u2019 by the US, in reality the open funding of terrorists, is never considered, as important facts contradicting the official imperialist narrative are systematically omitted by the \u201cFree Press.\u201d Notes: Ruptly Tv.
