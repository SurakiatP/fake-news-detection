The SDR scenario is probably what is planned, and he always drives home the point of having 10% of your wealth in PMs and that percentage will keep you afloat on the other side of the collapse. I guess the \u201clisten to all and follow none\u201d idea applies here, and Jim Rickards is at least worth listening to.
