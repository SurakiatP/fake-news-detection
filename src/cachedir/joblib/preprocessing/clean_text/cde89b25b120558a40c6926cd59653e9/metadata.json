Believe me, this wall will be impervious to poorer people. It will be great. Okay?\u201d \\nTaoiseach Enda Kenny was the first to offer his support to the Cork man, who currently resides in Malta because it\u2019s nice and warm and no other reason, stating O\u2019Brien will be a perfect contender to represent Ireland\u2019s current climate. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely man, Denis, and he will make a great president if elected,\u201d Mr. Kenny said with his mouth, \u201cSure, he\u2019s basically representing the country already with his large stake in the Irish media. It would only make sense that such an influence would put themselves forward for such a position\u201d. \\nMr. O\u2019Brien then added that first things he will do in office is to abolish the current government.'"}, "time": 1742562206.8960972}
