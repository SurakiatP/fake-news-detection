But the developers of Trump Towers Pune, an elegant pair of     pillars, have an extraordinary new marketing tool they are moving quickly to exploit: the   of the United States. Since Donald J. Trump won the presidency, they have celebrated the growth that Mr. Trump\u2019s win could bring to their brand, even flying to New York last week to meet with the   and his family as he was assembling his cabinet. \u201cWe will see a tremendous jump in valuation in terms of the second tower,\u201d said Pranav R. Bhakta, a consultant who helped Mr. Trump\u2019s organization make inroads into the Indian market five years ago. \u201cTo say, \u2018I have a Trump flat or residence\u2019  \u2014   it\u2019s   branded. It\u2019s that recall value. If they didn\u2019t know Trump before, they definitely know him now. \u201d In just under nine weeks, Mr. Trump will take control of a portfolio of public business between the United States and India, the world\u2019s two largest democracies, supervising debates over issues including climate change, maritime shadowboxing with China and the nuclear standoff with Pakistan. The meeting shows that Mr. Trump has not fully disengaged from his business ventures even as he leads his presidential transition, and it highlights the potential conflicts he will face going forward if he does not separate himself from a brand that has been constructed around his persona. In a telephone interview, Atul Chordia, one of the developers who met last week with Mr. Trump, played down the appointment as a \u201c \u201d congratulatory conversation in which no business was transacted and no new projects were discussed. But newspapers in India reported it as a business meeting, illustrated with a photograph of the beaming real estate executives  \u2014   Atul Chordia, Sagar Chordia and Kalpesh Mehta  \u2014   flanking the future president, and indicated that the builders and Mr. Trump\u2019s organization are planning further collaborative real estate projects. Sagar Chordia confirmed to The New York Times on Sunday that this account of the meeting in New York  \u2014   which included discussions with the Trump family about possible additional real estate deals  \u2014   was accurate. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization did not dispute this account  \u2014   saying only that the encounter with Mr. Trump himself was brief. \u201cWe have identified a piece of land and spoken to them,\u201d Sagar Chordia told The Business Standard, a daily newspaper in India. Sagar Chordia, who posted photos of himself wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on social media during the presidential campaign, did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Times. Three prominent ethics lawyers said in interviews on Sunday that the interaction between Mr. Trump and his business partners from India does not appear to violate federal laws or ethics rules, nor would it even if he had already been sworn in. This is in part because the president, unlike members of Congress and most other federal employees, is exempt from such requirements. But each lawyer agreed the activities created the appearance that Mr. Trump and his business partners are using his status as a way to profit. \u201cIt is unprecedented in modern history,\u201d said Andrew D. Herman, a lawyer who has represented more than a dozen members of Congress in ethics cases. \u201cBut this is the new normal. \u201d Robert S. Stern, a lawyer who helped write California\u2019s ethics law and the former president of the nonprofit Center for Governmental Studies, said that anytime Mr. Trump has a meeting with a foreign government leader where one of his projects is based  \u2014   a list that includes Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Canada, Panama, Dubai, the Philippines, South Korea and Uruguay  \u2014   questions may arise as to whether he took any action that might benefit his investments. \u201cIt already looks like he is using his position as   to promote something in India that would benefit him financially,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cIt is not presidential  \u2014   or at least presidential before him. \u201d Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, declined on Sunday to comment. A spokeswoman from the Trump Organization declined to address questions about the appropriateness of Mr. Trump meeting with his business partners, and instead pointed to a statement the organization made last week about shifting control of Mr. Trump\u2019s business operations to his children. \u201cThis is a top priority at the organization, and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations,\u201d said Amanda Miller, the vice president of marketing at the Trump Organization. The Pune towers are the first   project to be completed in India, to be followed in the next few years by a   skyscraper in Mumbai. Mr. Trump\u2019s five current projects in India are worth around $1. 5 billion, making it Mr. Trump\u2019s most active development market outside North America, Mr. Mehta, the managing director at Tribeca Developers and the Trump Organization\u2019s representative in India, told The Indian Express last week. In most cases, Mr. Trump does not invest in the projects, but instead allows the developers to use his name in return for an undisclosed sum in royalties, according to industry analysts. Though each agreement is structured differently, in many cases the brand receives a percentage of sales, meaning Mr. Trump stands to benefit directly from increased revenues. Publicity materials focus heavily on Mr. Trump and his family. One pitch promises that \u201cthe experience of owning a   property and living the Trump lifestyle is unparalleled. \u201d Customers requesting information about the units receive an email illustrated with a large photograph of Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, seated thoughtfully before a window. The Trump name, Sagar Chordia told The Business Standard, is so valuable that apartments in the towers sell for 35 percent more than comparable apartments in other developments. Similar projects have been undertaken by Armani, the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton, said Ramesh Nair, chief operating officer and international director at Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants, a global real estate company. \u201cIt\u2019s a branding project,\u201d Mr. Nair said. \u201cThere is no skin in the game. You are lending your name. You give some specifications for the project. And you will generate some free publicity. \u201d But sharing your brand name with Indian developers could backfire. Over the past decade, many unscrupulous developers here allowed projects to stall midway for lack of ready capital and used home buyers\u2019 deposits to begin work on the next project, leaving families stripped of their savings to protest helplessly. Mr. Nair said Mr. Trump so far had partnered with   firms, but warned that a poor choice could damage not only Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation, but that of the United States, given the corruption typical of Indian land deals. \u201cIf that small university can get him into trouble, you can imagine what could happen with India\u2019s \u2018 \u2019 real estate sector,\u201d Mr. Nair said, referring to the fraud lawsuit against Trump University, which Mr. Trump settled last week for $25 million. \u201cTomorrow they could have 100 buyers standing outside the U. S. Consulate, saying, \u2018Give me back my money. \u2019\u201d Industry observers differed on whether Mr. Trump\u2019s brand image would help increase real estate sales. India\u2019s luxury housing market has been weak for years, and has been further damaged by a new government drive to stamp out untaxed cash transactions. So far, some boldface names have reportedly purchased units at the Trump Towers Pune, including the Bollywood actors Rishi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor. The Chordia family, which has close ties to Sharad Pawar, the chief of India\u2019s Nationalist Congress Party, is particularly enthusiastic in its embrace of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has made targeted appeals to   for financial support, holding a major   event in October in Edison, N. J. a city with a large number of Indian residents, where Mr. Trump called himself \u201ca big fan of Hindu. \u201d On the morning of the election, Sagar Chordia described giving a party for 800 people in honor of Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit there, in 2014. Vijayta Lalwani, a local journalist who interviewed Sagar Chordia as the final results came in, described him as \u201cecstatic. \u201d Mr. Bhakta, the former consultant to Trump\u2019s development group, said he was confident that more collaborations were forthcoming. He said Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. has typically taken the lead on advancing deals in India, but that the   also spends ample time with Indian partners. \u201cEvery time I have been there with clients from India, we always have a    with Senior,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is very much passionate about the India story. \u201d Many in Pune said they believed demand for the apartments would rise. Mohan Devasi, 21, a laborer, said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump when he \u201ccaught a glimpse of him\u201d in Pune in 2014. He had heard Mr. Trump was \u201ca close friend of Narendra Modi\u201d and that he had promised to take a hard line on Muslims. \u201cHe is right now the American president, which means he is the most powerful person in the world,\u201d said Partha Sikder, 25. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that liberty. People will obviously want the apartments more. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate partners are also taking steps to keep the focus on the  . Sagar Chordia told reporters from The Indian Express that he is planning to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.'"}, "time": 1742628564.096105}
