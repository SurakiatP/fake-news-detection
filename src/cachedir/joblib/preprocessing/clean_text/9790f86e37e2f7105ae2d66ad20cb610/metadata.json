[In a roundtable with four other \u201ctop TV broadcasters\u201d  \u2014   ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, NBC\u2019s  Savannah Guthrie, CBS\u2019s Gayle King, and Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier  \u2014   Tapper jokingly hoped that he could uncover real Truth from Putin with the help of barbiturates.  Final question: Who would you most like to interview?   \u2026     TAPPER Are these   or are they sodium pentothal [a trademarked name for the compound] interviews? (Laughter.) I mean, as long as we\u2019re doing a dream [interview] a Putin interview with sodium pentothal would be fantastic. Tapper\u2019s network CNN has doggedly pursued a conspiracy theory that President Trump and his associates are pawns in an international plot led by Putin. CNN was the first outlet to report on a dossier that claimed Russia had gathered blackmail material on Donald Trump before he ran for office, stating that intelligence officers briefed the    on these specific claims. Following CNN\u2019s lead, the advertorial   justice blog BuzzFeed published this unverified dossier in full  \u2014   quite obviously to air claims that Trump has a urine fetish. NBC later quashed CNN\u2019s reporting, writing that the dossier was appended to Trump\u2019s daily intel briefing as an example of \u201cunvetted disinformation. \u201d Tapper himself appears to be a true believer that Russia \u201cinfluenced\u201d the 2016 election and displays a very healthy interest in the topic, calling several detractors \u201cRussian trolls. \u201d Not quite. They indeed testified there was no hacking of voting machines no votes changed.
