When his brother rushed to see where what all the shrieking was about, he stumbled upon a gruesome scene with the groom holding something horrific in his hand. \\nMost ancient religions and cultures have a history of arranging marriages and often forcing unwilling participants into betrothals with people they\u2019ve never met and have no desire to wed. However, unlike many other ideologies, Islam rampantly continues to cling to not only arranged marriage but also polygamy, child marriage, and incest. Unlike other religions that have reformed and progressed, there is no hope for Islam, as its most revered prophet commanded and modeled these same barbaric behaviors. \\nIn a bizarre series of events, a young Muslim man in the United Arab Emirates found himself in an arranged marriage that he found completely insufferable. The 26-year-old refused to take a second wife, a refusal that is uncommon with men in Muslim-majority countries unless the bride is found to be undesirable for reasons including defilement, unsatisfactory appearance, poor financial status, or un-Islamic behavior. Instead, the young man, who has a wife and 2 daughters in another country, found a way to dissolve the betrothal in the most shocking way. \\nFeeling that there was no other way to get out of the engagement, the Khaleej Times reports that the unnamed man decided to render himself \u201cunfit\u201d to be married by taking a knife and slicing off his genitals. He surmised that if he is unable to perform his marital duties by consummating their wedding night, his fiance\u2019s family would be convinced to pull their daughter out of the arranged marriage. \\nThe Muslim groom\u2019s family was adamant that he marry a second wife, somehow forcing the 26-year-old man into a marriage of their own choosing. It was after a family argument that the groom\u2019s brother heard blood-curdling screams and burst into the room to find the man covered in blood and his genitals mutilated. \\nThe brother immediately rushed the young man to the Al-Kuwaiti Hospital, collecting the severed penis in a plastic bag. Thanks to the brother\u2019s quick thinking, doctors at the nearby Al-Qassimi Hospital accepted the victim as a transferred patient and informed him that they would be able to reattach the organ. \\n\u201cI have conducted a number of surgeries on male organs; but this case was very strange and rare as the organ was separated from the body and was brought to us in [a] plastic bag,\u201d Dr. Younis Al-Shamsi added. \\nIncredibly, the Muslim man refused the surgery, arguing that he would still be forced to marry the woman after his recovery. After much coaxing, his brother finally convinced him to have his penis surgically reattached. The process took just 3 hours, and the man is expected to make a full recovery. \\nThe Quran states that men are allowed to take up to 4 wives as long as they provide for them. The latter part of the scripture even encourages Muslim men to marry one of their sex slaves \u201cwho their right hand possesses\u201d if they have trouble finding a suitable Muslim woman. Of course, Allah considers women nothing more than property, as the Quran states twice that men should beat their wives if they fear even the slightest disobedience from them. In fact, Allah specifically told Job, a character stolen from Judaism and Christianity, that he must take a tree branch and beat his wife after she mocked him in her grief over the loss of their children. \\nLikewise, the Islamic prophet Muhammad proved that this was what Allah intended by beating his own child bride , Aisha, after she caught the pedophile sneaking out of their house in the middle of the night. His reasoning was that his property had left the house without his permission. \\nLuckily for the fiance, this man didn\u2019t see her as his next victim with whom he could unload his perverse sexual fantasies and physically torture her if she had any objection. Still, the Islamic oppression of women and children continues to see millions enslaved to abusive predators that are given divine authority to treat them as they wish.'"}, "time": 1742628539.532468}
