At the Pentagon, military missions in some of the world\u2019s most troubled places are being run by a defense secretary who has none of his top team in place. And at departments like Treasury, Commerce and Health and Human Services, many senior posts remain vacant even as the agencies have been handed enormous tasks like remaking the nation\u2019s health insurance system. From the moment he was sworn in, President Trump faced a personnel crisis, starting virtually from scratch in lining up senior leaders for his administration. Seven weeks into the job, he is still hobbled by the slow start, months behind where experts in both parties, even some inside his administration, say he should be. The lag has left critical power centers in his government devoid of leadership as he struggles to advance policy priorities on issues like health care, taxes, trade and environmental regulation. Many federal agencies and offices are in states of suspended animation, their career civil servants answering to temporary bosses whose influence and staying power are unclear, and who are sometimes awaiting policy direction from appointees whose arrival may be weeks or months away. \u201cThere\u2019s no question this is the slowest transition in decades,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official who served under presidents of both parties and has been involved in transitions since 1988. \u201cIt is a very, very big mistake. The world continues  \u2014   it doesn\u2019t respect transitions. \u201d Mr. Trump has insisted that the barren ranks of his government are not a shortcoming but the vanguard of a plan to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \u201cA lot of those jobs, I don\u2019t want to appoint, because they\u2019re unnecessary to have,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News last month. \u201cI say, \u2018What do all these people do?\u2019 You don\u2019t need all those jobs. \u201d But the president has not proposed any plan for trimming crucial senior positions, and a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay E. Walters, said he eventually planned to fill them. Mr. Trump\u2019s personnel problems are rooted in a dysfunctional transition effort that left him without a pool of    who had been screened for security and financial problems and were ready to be named on Day 1. In the weeks since, the problem has been compounded by roadblocks of his own making: a loyalty test that in some cases has eliminated qualified candidates, a   lobbying ban that has discouraged some of the most   potential appointees, and a general sense of upheaval at the White House that has repelled many others. Officials involved in and briefed on the situation described it on the condition of anonymity, unwilling to be quoted disparaging Mr. Trump or his administration. But the numbers paint an unmistakable picture. While Mr. Trump has won confirmation of 18 members of his cabinet, he has not nominated anyone for more than 500 other vital posts and has fallen behind his predecessors in filling the important   and   positions that carry out most of the government\u2019s crucial daily functions. As of Sunday, he had sent to the Senate 36 nominations for critical positions, just over half of the 70 sent by President Barack Obama, who was also criticized for early delays, at the same point in 2009, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service. In the vast majority of cases, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has not even begun the lengthy screening process  \u2014   which can take several weeks to as long as two months  \u2014   that nominees must complete before their confirmations can be considered by the Senate. According to data obtained by The New York Times, the Office of Government Ethics, the independent agency that conducts financial reviews of every presidential nominee, had received only 63 disclosure reports for prospective Trump administration nominees as of March 5, less than a third of the 228 that Mr. Obama\u2019s team had submitted by that date in 2009. At the State Department, both   jobs remain unfilled, along with the posts of six under secretaries and 22 assistant secretaries. At the Treasury Department, Mr. Trump has yet to name a deputy secretary, general counsel or chief financial officer, or any of the three under secretaries and nine assistant secretaries. At the Department of Homeland Security, one of three agencies for which the president has nominated a deputy, he has yet to name any of the four under secretaries, three assistant secretaries or other crucial players like a chief of Citizenship and Immigration Services or a commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Ms. Walters, the White House spokeswoman, denied any substantial delay in staffing the government, saying that \u201cthere is no holdup. \u201d But she added that the administration was now screening a large pool of prospective nominees  \u2014   a senior White House official put the number at about 130  \u2014   whom it would soon name for crucial positions. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to detail internal deliberations, said that since Inauguration Day, the White House had set a pace for filling positions that rivaled the rate of previous administrations, and was now moving as quickly as the meticulous personnel process would allow. Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was a compact operation, so he did not have the potentially thousands of political aides that other new presidents have rewarded with plum jobs, the official added. The staffing delays appear to reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of experience in government and his deep suspicion of anyone with such a background  \u2014   two significant factors in his flawed transition. Another challenge has been the president\u2019s attempt to apply to the sprawling federal bureaucracy the same mode of leadership he has used for decades in his business, where he placed exclusive trust in a small, insular team. \u201cThe approach that the president took as a businessman and a candidate is simply not scalable to the challenge of filling out the rest of the government leadership,\u201d said Max Stier, the president of the Center for Presidential Transition. If agencies lack leaders who understand their operations and policies and have the president\u2019s trust, said Carlos M. Gutierrez, who served as commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, \u201cit just makes the whole function of the executive branch less effective. \u201d \u201cIt is a big problem, because either the agency is not well represented or isn\u2019t represented at all,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. Outside the government, he added, foreign diplomats, businesspeople and others \u201cdon\u2019t know who to call or who to talk to. \u201d The lag could also undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s global influence. When trade ministers of Pacific Rim nations, including China, meet this week in Chile, the United States will be represented by its ambassador to Chile, Carol Z. Perez, a career diplomat, because no trade official has been confirmed. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is overseeing missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen without his own leadership team. Some nominees, including the billionaire Vincent Viola, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for Army secretary, had to withdraw because background checks  \u2014   which would normally have been completed weeks earlier  \u2014   revealed insurmountable problems, like financial entanglements. That has left Mr. Mattis to rely on holdovers like Robert O. Work, the deputy defense secretary under Mr. Obama, and senior civil servants. \u201cHe is really missing three to four levels of his leadership team,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy under Mr. Obama, who said she removed herself from consideration to be Mr. Mattis\u2019s deputy because she did not agree with the new administration\u2019s values and policy direction. \u201cThe White House personnel system has really put an emphasis on loyalty to Trump, and they have ruled out anyone who said anything bad about him. \u201d Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, identified potential nominees for senior posts early on, including Jim Donovan, a Goldman Sachs executive, whom he wants to be his deputy. But one official close to the process said the White House had hesitated over the political risk of bringing another alumnus of the investment bank into an administration that has styled itself a champion of   Americans. A nomination probably remains weeks away, according to another person familiar with the situation. As of Sunday, the list of Treasury officials on the department\u2019s website was empty, save for the words, \u201cThis page is temporarily unavailable. \u201d At the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, the administrator, was confirmed by the Senate last month, and he has hired a chief of staff and a few others. But the White House has yet to nominate anyone to fill another dozen key jobs requiring Senate confirmation, like the assistant administrators who oversee clean air and water regulation. Those offices sit empty even as Mr. Trump says he wants the E. P. A. to start rolling back several major   regulations, including a rule on water pollution. \u201cIt will be impossible for them to carry out that agenda unless they can get people in place,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, an assistant E. P. A. administrator under Mr. Bush. Adding to Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge is an approach to personnel that at times appears haphazard he abruptly asked 46 United States attorneys to submit their resignations on Friday and immediately clean out their desks, leaving himself the task of appointing replacements around the country. Analysts say Mr. Trump\u2019s approach also betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how the government works. \u201cThey can think of this lack of appointments as being a lean government, but this isn\u2019t like running a small business,\u201d said Terry Sullivan, the executive director of the White House Transition Project, a nonpartisan organization that tracks the pace of appointments. \u201cThe federal government is quantum times larger than the largest American corporation. It puts Exxon Mobil in the shade. It is a reflection of na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how big the U. S. government is. \u201d The personnel crisis has become something of a   prophecy, discouraging some experienced policy specialists from joining Mr. Trump\u2019s government. Rodney L. Whitlock, a health policy consultant and former longtime aide to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said the   lobbying ban was a deterrent from pursuing a position with the administration. \u201cIf I stayed in for three years, and then I stepped out, when could I lobby?\u201d Mr. Whitlock said. \u201cI would be 60. I\u2019ve got to put kids through college, and I\u2019m not the only one. \u201d Beyond that, he said, \u201ca perception of chaos, right or wrong, makes people uncomfortable. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562169.704506}
