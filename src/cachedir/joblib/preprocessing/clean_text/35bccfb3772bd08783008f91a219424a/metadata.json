The report does not compare America\u2019s human rights record to that of China, a Communist country which forces women to have abortions as late as eight months into a pregnancy, conducts widespread espionage against its Muslim ethnic minorities (and has banned wearing burqas publicly in Western China) and regularly shuts down media outlets it does not directly control. Instead, the report  \u2014   prepared by China\u2019s Information Office of the State Council  \u2014   condemns the United States for standing up for human rights internationally. \u201cWielding \u2018the baton of human rights,\u2019 it pointed fingers and cast blame on the human rights situation in many countries while paying no attention to its own terrible human rights problems,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWith the gunshots lingering in people\u2019s ears behind the Statue of Liberty, worsening racial discrimination and the election farce dominated by money politics, the   human rights defender has exposed its human rights \u2018myth\u2019 with its own deeds,\u201d the report declares. The report blames \u201ccolonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality\u201d for the supposedly deteriorating relationship between black and white people in America, while claiming that American \u201cwomen frequently fell victims to sexual harassment and assault. \u201d \u201cMuslims suffer increasingly serious discrimination,\u201d the report continues. In accusing America of discriminating against its Muslim population, the Chinese expose themselves post to accusations of hypocrisy. The Uighur population of western China are majority Muslim and greatly inhibited in practicing their religion due to fears on the other side of the country that they are insufficiently loyal to Beijing. Most recently, China mandated that all cars in Xinjiang, its westernmost and most   province, install GPS tracking devices to allow the government full knowledge of where every car in the region is at any given time. China has previously forced Muslim shops to sell alcohol and cigarettes in the region as a way of diluting Islam in Xinjiang and forced Muslim Communist Party officials in the region to forego the Ramadan fast. Uighur Chinese nationals abroad have reported incidents of spying and coercion to prevent them from taking advantage of their freedom of expression in other countries to expose abuses against Muslim Uighurs in China. Nonetheless, the Chinese human rights report concluded America\u2019s population was suffering oppression worth addressing more than their own nationals. The United States \u201cexercised no effective control over guns, law enforcement departments abused their power, and crimes were not effectively contained,\u201d Chinese officials claim, without mentioning that the right to bear arms is ensconced in the nation\u2019s chief governing charter. The Chinese report also condemns the United States\u2019 recent presidential election cycle, without noting that China is a Communist autocracy that does not allow for popular election of its leaders. \u201cIn 2016, money politics and    deals had controlled the presidential election, which was full of lies and farces,\u201d the report reads. It goes on to claim the fact that voters were \u201cangry\u201d as a human rights abuse and condemn American media, who \u201cpublished a lot of biased reports and commentaries during the 2016 election, fully demonstrating their failure in staying objective or impartial. \u201d The Information Office of the State Council concludes that America is \u201cundergoing a \u2018human rights crisis. \u2019\u201d Beijing periodically releases human rights reports of this nature, weaponizing its critiques of the United States in an attempt to diminish Washington\u2019s influence on international human rights norms. In 2014, the Chinese government went so far as to condemn the United States for broadcasting Jimmy Kimmel Live! a program the Chinese accused of \u201cpromoting racial hatred. \u201d Following the publication of the 2014 report, Chinese media released a report claiming \u201cevery aspect of society\u201d in America was racially divided, citing riots in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.'"}, "time": 1742564467.848765}
