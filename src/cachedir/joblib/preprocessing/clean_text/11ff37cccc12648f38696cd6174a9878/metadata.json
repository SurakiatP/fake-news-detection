Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/how-wifi-other-emfs-cause-biological.html Professor Martin Pall, PhD \u2013 professor of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Science at Washington State University, Pullman, says that WiFi & other EMFs can cause biological harm. In 2014 he said \u201cI think this is going to be one of the major issues in the next few years. Most people are not aware of this, and the people who are mostly know the old data and there\u2019s a lot of new stuff on this that\u2019s extremely, extremely important\u201d. According to some governments, it is not possible for microwaves from mobile phones, WiFi, \u2018smart\u2019 meters , etc. to cause harm, that research in the field is inconsistent and that there is no proof that such radiation can cause health issues. But Prof Pall who is an eminent physicist, geneticist and cell biologist, says they are wrong on all counts.In this video (below), Pall argues that research results showing harm are not \u201cinconsistent\u201d as is sometimes claimed, and that the health of the public now urgently needs to be protected. Pall\u2019s extensive research over recent decades (some of his peer-reviewed studies on this subject are listed in the final two minutes of this presentation) shows that: Microwaves damage humans at levels far below present radiation limits, through mechanisms at the cellular level These biological mechanisms can \u2013 completely or partially \u2013 be behind growing \u201cunexplained illnesses\u201d like sudden cardiac death, ME, weakened immune system, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress, and increased DNA breakage, etc. The effects can in principle affect all multicellular animals, and is proven, for example, in mussels You need neither New Age, tendentious science or conspiracy theories to justify this. The conclusion to be drawn from Pall\u2019s findings is that we face a new and increasingly present environmental pollutant. Some have called it the \u201c21st century environmental bomb\u201d, with implications for the environment, human health, construction of mobile towers, computers in schools, and handling of individuals presenting with symptoms of EHS. Martin Pall, prof. Em. at Washington State University, has an impressive body of work. His first article on EMFs and their role in VGCC activation earned a place in the \u201cGlobal Medical Discovery\u201d list of the most important articles in medicine in 2013.
