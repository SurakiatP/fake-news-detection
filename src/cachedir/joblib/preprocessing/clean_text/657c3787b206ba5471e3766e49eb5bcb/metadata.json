Pulling no punches, the   savages the U. S. President, calling him a \u201cfanatic\u201d who is intent on constructing a \u201cmonument to intimidation and silence, hatred and xenophobia. \u201d As harsh as its denunciation of Trump may be, however, the article is directed at Mexicans who are willing to work on the wall. What is regrettable, the piece states, is that \u201con this side of the border, Mexicans are ready to collaborate with a fanatical project that annihilates the good relationship and harmony of two nations that share a common border. \u201d The article states that in recent days, more than 500 Mexican companies have expressed interest in contracts to participate in \u201cthe construction of the wall of ignominy,\u201d by providing cement, materials, lighting and paint. \u201cWith the fine justification of being companies that generate jobs, these companies seek to make a profit, regardless of the consequences, and consolidate their presence in the industry they exploit. \u201d For these companies, \u201cthe end justifies the means,\u201d it reads. The result, the piece adds, is that the \u201cinvestment of Mexican companies in the wall will end up nurturing all those forms of discrimination that throughout history have subjected millions of human beings. \u201d The   also takes issue with the Mexican government for its \u201clukewarmness\u201d in dealing with Mexican businesses. In their   the piece continues, government officials fail to see that the wall is an \u201copen threat\u201d that violates social relations and peace and therefore has not taken legal action against these companies. In an interesting twist, the   states that \u201cany deportation, when there is no proven crime and administrative failure justified according to law, is a sign of terror. \u201d It is entirely possible that the Archdiocese is unaware of Mexico\u2019s own immigration policy and practices, which in most respects are stricter than those of the United States. Under Mexican law, illegal immigration is a felony. In Article 118, the General Law on Population states that foreigners entering the country without the required documentation will be fined the equivalent of \u201c20 to 100 days of established minimum salary. \u201d Article 125 adds that along with the stated fine, foreigners without legal documentation will be deported from the country. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2015, the Mexican government \u201ccarried out about 150, 000 deportations of unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \u201d The Mexican Archdiocese states that the border wall is a monument \u201cto silence the voices of poorly paid and   workers, unprotected families and abused persons. It is a retreat from the noblest longings of mankind, for which much blood has been shed. It is a prelude to the destruction of the values \\u200b\\u200bof democracy and social rights. \u201d Moreover, the wall \u201crepresents the predominance of a country that considers itself good with the manifest destiny to crush a nationality that it has considered perverted and corrupt: the Mexican. \u201d The article concludes: \u201cAny company that intends to invest in the wall of the fanatic Trump would be immoral, but above all, its shareholders and owners should be considered as traitors to their country. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
