Ten years later, however, the people of Alabama overwhelmingly voted their heroic defender of liberty back to his position in 2013. This example proves that many American citizens are looking for elected officials who uphold   hold moral conviction! \\nSadly, the Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice has again been unlawfully removed from the bench at the hands of liberal activists on Alabama\u2019s Court of the Judiciary (COJ), due to an administrative order issued by Moore that stated, \u201cUntil further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect.\" \\nChief Justice Moore remarked, \u201cI have been targeted for my belief in marriage, a belief shared by the majority of Americans. No one can point to any illegal, unlawful or unethical aspect of my four-page Administrative Order. That order was a status report on the case. A justice should not be removed from office because of a political agenda.\u201d \\nYou see God created marriage - not man, not governments. \\nConsider the following analogy. You lease a home in a residential neighborhood for your personal residence. You sign a contract \u2013your vow\u2014and move in to enjoy that new home. Later, you decide you want to open a retail business in that home against the owner\u2019s wishes and against your contract. No matter what kind of attorney arsenal you have, you cannot change the zoning of that residence into a business; it is not permissible in the contract, and you don\u2019t own the home. \\nIn the same way, marriage belongs to God, and He has given us the benefit of it. For this reason, when you make marriage vows, you are asked to repeat them twice. The first time is a vow to God, who creates the marriage, and the second time is your vow to the other person. \\nOur founders have long since passed into the annals of history. Their monuments are lifeless stone and can no longer rectify or redeem the champions of their spiritual cause of liberty. That is our job as Americans. To defend and pray for Chief Justice Roy Moore is our duty. Why? Because as Americans, we believe in the \u201cLaws of Nature and Nature\u2019s God\u201d that were set in motion by our Creator to protect the Rights He has given us. \\nLearn more about your Constitution with Jake MacAulay and the Institute on   receive your free gift. shares'"}, "time": 1742628489.4538014}
