The makeshift village  \u2014   with about 20 tepees, wooden racks holding strips of drying meat and buffalo hides spread on the ground  \u2014   was the backdrop for a grueling scene from AMC\u2019s adaptation of Mr. Meyer\u2019s 2013 novel, \u201cThe Son,\u201d an epic Western about a Texas ranching family. The series stars Pierce Brosnan as Eli McCullough, the family\u2019s steely patriarch, who was captured by Comanches as a teenager in 1849 and later becomes a cattle rancher with a violent, vengeful streak. Mr. Meyer watched as makeup artists applied fake blood and ash to the prosthetic limbs of a white buffalo hunter who had been captured and tortured by the Comanches. \u201cThis is great!\u201d he said. He studied the scene more closely, and then suggested making the charred ground around the actor\u2019s limbs bigger. After all, he noted, the fires would have been burning for hours. It\u2019s rare for novelists to wield this much influence over screen adaptations of their work. They may get an executive producer credit and an occasional ceremonial visit to the set, yet typically they just cash their checks and move on to their next novels. But Mr. Meyer is far from typical. Bald and muscular, with a square jaw and thick beard, he\u2019s handy with pistols, rifles and hunting bows, and looks more at home on a working cattle ranch than most M. F. A. graduates. He wrote three of the episodes in the first season, and rewrote the rest. And he was a near constant presence on the set throughout the five months of filming, weighing in on casting, props, costumes and the choreography of battle scenes. \u201cHe was heavily involved in everything,\u201d Mr. Brosnan, who spoke admiringly of Mr. Meyer\u2019s \u201cswagger,\u201d said. \u201cHe\u2019s a   weapons nut, with his own arsenal, and he was very specific in the choice of weapons I would use. \u201d Mr. Meyer admits his obsession with historical details was \u201cprobably annoying\u201d to the other writers and producers. But his scrupulous oversight of even minute aspects of the production was always part of the bargain. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely put his fingerprints on the show,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, the president of original programming and development for AMC and SundanceTV. \u201cIt was clear that he was not comfortable just walking away, and he felt like he had something to contribute. \u201d [ Texas TV: From the Sublime to the Ridiculous ] \u201cThe Son\u201d is the first big project from El Jefe, a production company that Mr. Meyer founded with the writers Brian McGreevy and Lee Shipman. The three men, who met at the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s M. F. A. program, created the company in 2014, with the aim of giving authors, who are often sidelined in Hollywood\u2019s creative hierarchy, greater control over the adaptations of their work. The company is developing TV shows based on Mr. Meyer\u2019s debut novel, \u201cAmerican Rust,\u201d Wil S. Hylton\u2019s World War II book, \u201cVanished,\u201d and \u201cFourth of July Creek,\u201d a novel by Smith Henderson. (Mr. Meyer also plans to write and   the adaptation of \u201cAmerican Rust. \u201d) \u201cNovelists, who are the most qualified people when it comes to the world of the books they\u2019ve written, are the first people to be benched in this process,\u201d said Mr. McGreevy, who was a writer and executive producer on the Netflix adaptation of his horror novel, \u201cHemlock Grove. \u201d Television has become an increasingly attractive medium for novelists (like Richard Price, Tom Perrotta and Nic Pizzolatto) who see it as an ideal form for teasing out long story arcs and subtle character development. But it\u2019s rare for them to have as much of a creative stake as Mr. Meyer does in \u201cThe Son,\u201d and he\u2019s feeling the pressure. Whether \u201cThe Son\u201d succeeds, critically and commercially, could determine whether El Jefe becomes a big player in the already heated competition for literary properties, which have become a staple of prestige television. \u201cThere\u2019s this sinking feeling of, \u2018Oh, this is years of my life,\u2019\u201d he said, using an expletive. \u201cIt almost feels like writing a first novel. \u201d Mr. Meyer had been in development purgatory before, and was determined not to go through it again. His 2009 debut novel, \u201cAmerican Rust,\u201d was optioned for a feature film, but the production never went anywhere. So when \u201cThe Son,\u201d which became a critically acclaimed best seller that sold 300, 000 copies and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, caught the interest of several production companies, he agreed to Mr. McGreevy\u2019s pitch. \u201cI said, you can go with these heavy hitters who will back up dump trucks of money to your house but will likely marginalize you in the process, if the thing gets made at all,\u201d Mr. McGreevy said, \u201cor you can take the risk of us doing this together. \u201d Mr. Meyer chose the riskier option. In the spring of 2013, he and Mr. McGreevy and Mr. Shipman wrote a   script for \u201cThe Son\u201d and started shopping it to TV networks. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Entertainment Studios made on offer on the series but never followed through, and the fledgling studio later shut down. Even after AMC picked up \u201cThe Son\u201d as a series in early 2016, with a role for Mr. Meyer as a series writer and executive producer, there were other hiccups. Last summer, the actor Sam Neill, who was playing Eli, dropped out for personal reasons, soon before shooting was scheduled to begin. Mr. Brosnan took his place, and had to prepare for the role on the fly. He read passages of the novel out loud to capture Eli\u2019s cadences, and listened to speeches by famous Texans including Lyndon B. Johnson, Rick Perry and the Texas congressman Ted Poe. (In the first few episodes, Mr. Brosnan\u2019s labored accent is never quite convincing. ). To make the multigenerational epic work dramatically, the source material underwent some major changes. In the show, one of the book\u2019s major characters, Jeanne Anne, is Eli\u2019s granddaughter, rather than his   which compressed Mr. Meyer\u2019s sprawling novel into two parallel narratives, in 1849 and 1915. (The original story spans more than 160 years.) \u201cPhilipp understood that anything we did to his book didn\u2019t unwrite the book,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, the showrunner and executive producer for \u201cThe Son. \u201d Still, Mr. Meyer wasn\u2019t content to cede control. \u201cPhilipp has zero   experience, zero television experience, but his ideas are taken, they are valuable,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Meyer takes a   approach to writing. While researching the book, he went to extreme lengths to learn about Comanche customs and life in   Texas. At a ranch in Southwest Texas, he shot a buffalo and drank a mug full of its blood, so that he could accurately describe the taste when young Eli eats a raw buffalo liver. He studied animal tracking, fire building and plant identification at a   school, and learned enough Comanche to write dialogue. Mr. Meyer brought the same obsessive attention to detail to the show. He set up an archery program to teach the actors how to shoot a traditional Comanche bow, which is shorter than most other bows and designed to be used on horseback. And he brought in Juanita Pahdopony, a Comanche educator and artist, to advise the set designers on the tepees and costumes, and to help translate the dialogue and coach the actors on their pronunciation. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me weeks to memorize,\u201d said Zahn McClarnon, who plays Toshaway, a Comanche warrior who takes Eli under his wing. \u201cWe, as native actors, don\u2019t get any credit for that. It\u2019s like Tom Cruise learning Japanese. \u201d Occasionally, Mr. Meyer\u2019s commitment to historical accuracy created uncomfortable moments. Some of the Native American actors expressed concern that the Comanches were portrayed as savages who relished rape and torture. Mr. Meyer and the other writers made some changes to the script, like cutting the depiction of a rape. \u201cAs native people, we have been portrayed in a certain way throughout the history of television, with stereotypes,\u201d said Mr. McClarnon, who is of Lakota descent. \u201cThe producers were very open about changing things and listening to the cast and to the native advisers, and that\u2019s the way it should be. \u201d Standing near the mangled body of the buffalo hunter on the set, Mr. Meyer said he was aiming to capture a bloody chapter in American history, from which no one emerged innocent. That day, they were filming some brutal scenes from an episode that takes place in the Comanche camp. The episode features Jacob Lofland as young Eli, who\u2019s been living with the tribe and feels torn over the fate of another captive, a white buffalo hunter who is being tortured to death. \u201cThey were pretty inventive with torture stuff,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cThe best political stance to take is honesty. White people did horrible things, Native Americans did horrible things. \u201d Working on a TV show has taken a bit of a toll on his fiction writing. Mr. Meyer said he\u2019s been struggling to finish his next novel, which is overdue to his publisher. \u201cThe crazy thing is, now I have to make sure I have time to write novels,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561990.4247077}
