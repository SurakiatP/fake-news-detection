President Trump pledged to work closely with Japan on security and economic issues during a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House. The president reaffirmed his support for a defense treaty with Japan that he had questioned during the campaign. The two plan to play golf together in Florida on Saturday. Their closeness is in stark contrast to the president\u2019s relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, who had been angered by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to review the status of Taiwan. Mr. Trump backed down from that position in a phone call with Mr. Xi on Thursday night, handing China a diplomatic victory. \u201cTrump lost his first fight with Xi,\u201d one analyst said. _____  2. Among the issues Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump might discuss on the golf course: immigration. Japan has achieved what Mr. Trump promised to: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking   work. But its tough stance on immigration  \u2014   both legal and illegal  \u2014   is contributing to a severe labor shortage that\u2019s hurting economic growth in the country. Some businesses get around the rules by hiring workers from China and elsewhere as \u201ctrainees. \u201d Critics say the system is rife with exploitation and even abuse.

Shortly after Thursday\u2019s appeals court decision blocking his travel ban, Mr. Trump vowed to fight on. \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Many legal experts say Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of success at the Supreme Court, which for a year now has had just eight members, are slim. A    tie would leave the appeals court ruling in place. The White House is insisting that Judge Neil Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme Court, was not referring to Mr. Trump when he said privately that he was disheartened by attacks on the courts. _____ 4. Those trying to divine the roots of the presidential adviser Stephen Bannon\u2019s worldview have combed over a speech that he made in 2014 to a Vatican conference. Little noticed, until now, was a reference to Julius Evola, a deeply taboo,   thinker who was a darling of Italian Fascists. Mr. Evola was a leading proponent of Traditionalism, a set of beliefs embraced by today\u2019s   that argues progress and equality are poisonous illusions. _____ 5. Months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq could regain one of the Islamic State\u2019s strongholds, the victory now seems at risk. There is no sign yet that the   national government can secure and rebuild the Sunni city, and Iraqi and American security officials fear that neglected residents may once again embrace the Islamic State. The scene is more encouraging in parts of Mosul that have been retaken by Iraqi forces, our reporter observed this week. _____ 6. A French farmer who became something of a folk hero for helping migrants was given a fine, but no jail time. C\u00e9dric Herrou\u2019s case made headlines around the world. He\u2019ll be off the hook if he \u201cstays out of trouble\u201d for five years, but he vowed to continue offering migrants shelter. \u201cThere\u2019s a deficiency of the state in France and in Italy, so I take action,\u201d he said. _____  7. Two celestial events will take place on Friday night: a lunar eclipse and the passing of a comet. The moon will appear slightly darker than usual at about 7:45 p. m. Eastern Standard Time. The comet will be tough to see without binoculars or a telescope. It should appear as a green dot because of its chemical components. If you want to try, the best time would be around 3 a. m. Eastern Time. _____ 8. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the best new children\u2019s books on   history. Here are five illustrated biographies of iconic figures, including \u201cFrederick Douglass: The Lion Who Wrote History. \u201d The book conveys the centrality of reading and \u201ccareful decisions\u201d to Douglass\u2019s struggle for freedom and his later public work, offering an anchor for children trying to comprehend the cruelties of American slavery. _____ 9. The Grammys are Sunday, and the big matchup is Adele versus Beyonc\u00e9. The two megaselling queens of pop will face off in each of the top three categories  \u2014   album, record and song of the year. A sweep by Adele could feed into   complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Above, setting up for the event. _____ 10. Finally, this weekend is also when many people will celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day. If you express your affection in food, we have recipes at the ready, including mocha chocolate chip cake, above, and less romantic but still delicious dishes like goulash. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
