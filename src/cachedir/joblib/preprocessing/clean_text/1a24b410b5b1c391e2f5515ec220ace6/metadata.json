[The 18 Army officers in the Special Forces Qualification Course, or \u201c\u201d were visiting the National Security Council in early February, as a normal part of the course.  But this time, Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka, who was scheduled to speak to the students, had suggested that they meet the president. The plan was to take them into the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, but Trump decided to invite them into the Oval Office, to take pictures with them for their families. \u201cHalfway through the discussion, [Trump] said, \u2018Hey  \u2014   we\u2019re not supposed to do this, but follow me,\u2019 and he brought them all into the Oval Office, took a group photograph around the Resolute desk, and then  \u2014   throwing the schedules into a bit of a tizzy, said, \u2018OK that\u2019s not good enough,\u2019\u201d Gorka told Breitbart News in an interview. \u201cHe said, \u2018Everybody stand in the corner.\u2019 They all stood in the corner, and    we took photographs they can take home to their family with each future Green Beret next to the president at the Oval Office desk,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cThat\u2019s how much he loves our soldiers  \u2014   our warriors,\u201d he said. Gorka had earlier brought up the meeting during remarks on a panel at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. Under Obama, he said, they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have even gotten into the West Wing. \u201d The Feb. 7 meeting, which was announced a day in advance, was not covered at the time by any news outlet. It also prompted criticism from Democrats that Trump was trying to use the military for political gain. A source familiar with the preparations for the event told Breitbart News shortly after the event occurred that the president\u2019s decision to meet with the officers set off an \u201cintense\u201d scramble. The source said NSC officials scrambled to notify Pentagon officials so they would not be surprised, and no preparation materials had been drafted  \u2014   such as background information on the course, expected topics of discussion, biographies of the students, talking points for the president, or other materials normally produced for a presidential meeting. The source characterized the meeting as a \u201cphoto op\u201d for the president to \u201conce again, wrap himself in the flag of the military. \u201d A White House official, responding to a query by Breitbart News, said the meeting was private and \u201ccouldn\u2019t be publicized. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy to take the time to do an event that couldn\u2019t be publicized,\u201d the official said. Photos from the event were never publicly distributed. Several Pentagon and Army officials denied there was any \u201cscramble\u201d and said that they were notified earlier in the week about the meeting and characterized it as a \u201c . \u201d \u201cArmy officials were notified of the photo opportunity with the President beforehand,\u201d Army Col. Patrick Seibert told Breitbart News. Gorka also dismissed the report there was a scramble and said the plan was conceived a week and a half in advance. \u201cThe opposition media will of course want to spin it, which is just ridiculous\u201d he said. During his first month in office, Trump has engaged with members of the military at least four times. He was sworn in on Jan. 20, and a week later on Jan. 27, he made his first trip to the Pentagon. There, he met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and attended the ceremonial swearing in of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A few days later, on Feb. 1, he made a private visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, to receive the remains of Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, a Navy SEAL who died of wounds during a mission in Yemen. Five days later, on Feb. 6, he visited MacDill Air Force Base to meet with Central Command commander Army Gen. Joe Votel and Special Operations Command commander Army Gen. Tony Thomas. He also ate lunch with enlisted service members, and spoke with representatives of the multinational   coalition. The next day, back in Washington, he would meet with the Special Forces Qualification Course students. Trump has also had several strategy sessions with Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, the White House official said. One top Democrat criticized Trump\u2019s meeting at Centcom, specifically his comment: \u201cWe had a wonderful election, didn\u2019t we? And I saw those numbers, and you like me and I like you, that\u2019s the way it works. \u201d The visits have prompted Democratic criticism that the president was inappropriately politicizing the military. \u201cThe president\u2019s efforts to politicize the military, starting with his remarks at the CIA memorial, are becoming a troubling rhetorical pattern,\u201d Rep. Adam Smith ( ) ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, said after Trump\u2019s visit to Centcom. Specifically, Smith cited Trump\u2019s remarks at Centcom, where he said, \u201cWe had a wonderful election, didn\u2019t we? And I saw those numbers, and you like me and I like you, that\u2019s the way it works. \u201d Multiple exit polls showed that military veterans voted for Trump   according to the Washington Post. A brief search of news articles showed that former President Obama had almost as many engagements with the military during his first month in office. During the    inaugural ball, Obama   in Illinois National Guard members who were serving in Afghanistan. He first visited the Pentagon on day nine of his administration, two days later than Trump in his administration. About three weeks in, he visited with family members of those killed in the 2000 USS Cole bombing. He visited Fort Myers in Florida about a week later.'"}, "time": 1742564355.2295237}
