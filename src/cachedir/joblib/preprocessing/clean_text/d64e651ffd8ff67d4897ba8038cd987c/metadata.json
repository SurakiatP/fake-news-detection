[Xinjiang is home to most of the nation\u2019s Muslim Uighur minority and borders both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Authorities in Beijing have expressed concern that Muslim separatist groups in the region are feeding the population of Islamic State jihadists in the group\u2019s Middle Eastern strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State recently released a video featuring Uighur terrorists who vowed to return home to conduct terrorist attacks there.  China\u2019s     media ran the full report from the State Council Information Office on Thursday, which applauds the Chinese government for taking \u201ceffective measures to develop the economy, improve people\u2019s living standards, enhance the   of the public, promote ethnic unity and progress, and safeguard the basic rights of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. \u201d \u201cNormal religious needs of local people have been satisfied,\u201d China\u2019s Global Times asserts, citing the report. The text of the report asserts that \u201cthe people of all Xinjiang\u2019s ethnic groups enjoy the same status and the same rights, and must fulfill the same obligations in accordance with the law. Their political rights as citizens are fully protected. \u201d The   report spends much of its energy on \u201cenvironmental\u201d rights, health care, and economic equality. On health care, for example, the report condemns the free government preceding the communist People\u2019s Republic of China, claiming Xinjiang\u2019s population suffered \u201ca shortage of doctors and medicines, and epidemics of diseases, such as the plague, smallpox, and cholera. \u201d It then goes on to claim that the Chinese government has successfully curbed radical Islamic terror in Xinjiang: Since the 1990s, violent terrorists, nationalist separatists, and religious extremists have plotted and committed a series of violent terrorist crimes, causing loss of life to and damaging the property of people of all ethnic groups  \u2026     The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has taken a series of measures designed to strike against violent terrorist crimes, strengthen social protection and control, modernize the governance system and capacity, and safeguard the lives and property of all the people of Xinjiang, whatever their ethnic group. These measures include the promulgation and implementation of the Measures of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Enforcement of the   Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The report then asserts that China has protected freedom of religion in Xinjiang by expanding the government\u2019s power to control religious practices by implementing \u201cRegulations on   of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\u201d and working to \u201cstrengthen management of religious affairs in accordance with the law. \u201d The claims in the report echo those of a similar publication released almost exactly one year ago, titled \u201cFreedom of Religious Belief in Xinjiang,\u201d which asserted that \u201cNormal religious activities in Xinjiang are protected by law, and religious organizations are responsible for coordinating internal religious affairs and the government should not interfere. \u201d This year, the Chinese government white paper did not claim that the government had minimized its interference in religion, instead claiming its interference aided the \u201cnormal\u201d practice of religion. The new report also emphasizes the government\u2019s push to replace the Uighur language with \u201cPutonghua,\u201d or \u201ccommon tongue\u201d (Mandarin). \u201cThe Constitution stipulates that the state promotes the nationwide use of Putonghua in accordance with the law,\u201d the report notes but asserts that the common use of Uighur in public is a sign the government protects the Uighur language. In reality, the Chinese government announced a nationwide campaign to eradicate   languages in January, which corresponded with the development of a plan to promote intermarriage between Uighurs and the Han minority and the imposition of a variety of ordinances that prohibit overly Islamic activity in public. Among the activities prohibited in public in Xinjiang is the wearing of burqas in the capital city of Urumqi, the use of public transportation while wearing any Islamic garb, and the observance of the Ramadan fast by Communist Party officials. \u201cIf we think that someone may be fasting, we will invite them to the village office to \u2018drink tea\u2019 with us to see if they are fasting or not,\u201d Alim Abdurahman, a Xinjiang official, told Radio Free Asia last year. The Chinese government also forces Muslim shops to carry a variety of alcohol and cigarette brands to encourage the violation of Quranic laws against the consumption of these products. Beijing has also banned Muslim parents in Xinjiang from giving their children overly religious names like \u201cIslam,\u201d \u201cJihad,\u201d or \u201cMuhammad. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562028.3212082}
