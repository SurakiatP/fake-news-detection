Dr. Niv noticed that none of the 21 scientists scheduled to speak were women. This was not the first time Dr. Niv had lamented a skewed lineup. For years, she had tried to persuade other conference organizers, sometimes successfully, to invite more women to speak. But something about this particular conference, perhaps that the organizers were women, pushed her and about 20 other female scientists to take action. Over a series of furious emails that night, they decided that the best approach they could take was scientific: They would collect data  \u2014   irrefutable evidence  \u2014   on the numbers of male and female speakers. The very next day, they started a website called BiasWatchNeuro, with an inaugural post on the conference. Since then, they have posted gender ratios among speakers at more than 60 conferences in various areas of neuroscience, and compared them with the base rates  \u2014   the proportion of female scientists in that particular field. The base rates are estimated from the number of women in grants databases. If anything, Dr. Niv said, the site errs on the side of underestimating the base rates. At about half of the conferences listed on the site so far, the number of female speakers matches or surpasses the base rate in that field in general. But what fuels the project, Dr. Niv said, is how many conferences continue to fall not just a little, but far short, of the proportion of women in that field. For the gender ratio of panelists to mirror the base rate in that particular field, assuming the site\u2019s estimates are accurate, the dark blue dots, above, would have to turn pink and the dark red dots would have to turn blue. There were a total of just 11 women (compared with 213 male speakers) at 13 conferences that fell in the egregious offender category  \u2014   those that were more than two standard deviations below the base rate. You can also see that six conferences on the left had no female speakers at all, and that few conferences reached the 50 percent gender mark. Dr. Niv said that she and her colleagues believed that the gap between the ratio of the women in the field and on panels was primarily the result of implicit bias, which some of them have studied. \u201cImplicit bias is just that  \u2014   implicit: We are not aware of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not saying that conference organizers are bigots and purposefully discriminating they just can\u2019t help it. \u201d Some conference organizers have been receptive to the criticism, adding more women to their lineups. But others in the world of neuroscience have taken issue with the mission. Panels should be organized based strictly on the speakers\u2019 merit, they say, and not on any notion of fairness. Veerle   one of the organizers of the deep brain stimulation conference, said she was \u201cpuzzled by the gender issue\u201d and had never experienced any bias. In selecting speakers for the conference, \u201cit was not our goal to have an equal distribution between, for example, European and American lecturers, or black and white, or male and female,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir scientific excellence was the criterion. \u201d Among the defenders of the project, however, is Anne Churchland, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory who studies how people make decisions. In 2001, she started Anne\u2019s List, a directory of 170 women in computational neuroscience, intended to silence claims that no good female scientists existed in that field. Her research suggests that someone you recently had lunch with or someone from your hometown might spring to mind when selecting a speaker, even though neither has anything to do with science. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like irrelevant information influences our judgment, but it does,\u201d Dr. Churchland said. Being invited to speak on panels is more than a matter of prestige it\u2019s how your peers come to know who you are, Dr. Niv said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not known in science, you\u2019re basically doomed, because when your papers are reviewed, they\u2019re less likely to be accepted,\u201d she said. \u201cYour grants are less likely to be funded. \u201d When less than 50 percent of a field is made up of women, and then they are barely represented on panels, their ideas may never be heard by their colleagues, Dr. Niv said. \u201cScience should not be biased,\u201d she said. Addressing that, she added, \u201cshould be everybody\u2019s priority. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564601.6935081}
