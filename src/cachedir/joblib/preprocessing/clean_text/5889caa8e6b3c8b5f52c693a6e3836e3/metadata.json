W. Murnau and packaged rarities for the consumer market, died on Jan. 31 in Medford, Ore. He was 76. The cause was cancer, said his brother, Donald. The era of Valentino and Fairbanks had been over for decades when Mr. Shepard, barely in his teens, began buying old films, reel by reel, with money earned from his paper route. He had been bitten by the bug when his uncle Myron, a photographer in the Signal Corps, brought home a projector and a boxful of films from France after World War II  \u2014   abridged versions of Fritz Lang\u2019s \u201cMetropolis\u201d and Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019s experimental \u201cA Trip to the Moon,\u201d among others. They kindled an enthusiasm that only grew with time. Working for the American Film Institute and later for Blackhawk Films, which reproduced old films for the collectors\u2019 market, Mr. Shepard began searching out movies that had been languishing in studio vaults or private collections and bringing them in for restoration. By trial and error, he developed techniques now used widely in commercial preservation laboratories. In 1989, after acquiring Blackhawk\u2019s library, he created his own company, Film Preservation Associates. Over the years, he restored or made available many of the silent films now found in DVD and video libraries, including the 12 shorts that Charlie Chaplin made for the Mutual Film Corporation in 1916 and 1917, Murnau\u2019s 1927 masterpiece \u201cSunrise,\u201d all of Buster Keaton\u2019s independent films of the 1920s, and Soviet silent films from the same decade. For many films, he commissioned new musical scores. One of his most stunning efforts was the restoration of the French filmmaker Abel Gance\u2019s \u201cLa Roue\u201d (\u201cThe Wheel\u201d). Originally shown in 1923 over three days, it was cut down to two and half hours for commercial distribution, and the original was subsequently lost. Mr. Shepard, with the archivist Eric Lange, reassembled a      version from five different prints, released in 2008 by Flicker Alley. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen a superior print of a film by Chaplin or Keaton, Griffith or Murnau, chances are David had a hand in restoring it,\u201d the film critic Leonard Maltin recently wrote on his blog. Just as important, Mr. Shepard brought films out of the archives and to the general public, building on the work of the pioneer revivalist Kevin Brownlow. \u201cHe was able to build an audience for silent film and keep it going,\u201d Jeffrey Vance, a film historian who has written books on Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd, said in an interview. \u201cHe made silent films available to everyone. \u201d David Haspel Shepard was born on Oct. 22, 1940, in Manhattan and grew up, from the age of 11, in Tenafly, N. J. His father, Bertram, was an executive with the Grand Union grocery chain his mother, the former Marjorie Markley, was a homemaker.\u2019 \u201dHe was film crazy from his earliest years, with a connoisseur\u2019s bent that his father indulged by taking him to the film programs at the Museum of Modern Art. After buying a   projector at 12, he discovered that film rental companies, hard hit by television, were selling off their stocks, and he began acquiring films for $1 a reel.\u201d \u2019In junior high and high school, he filmed football games for the coaches to study. In the   he used the camera to make his own films with student actors. Mr. Shepard earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and religion from Hamilton College in Clinton, N. Y. in 1962 and a master\u2019s in American studies from the University of Pennsylvania a year later. He was teaching theater and film at Pennsylvania State University in 1968 when the fledgling American Film Institute hired him to seek out historically significant films from studios and collectors, with the aim of having them donated to the institute for preservation and archiving. In an early coup, he persuaded Paramount Pictures to turn over the 200 silent features it had in storage in Fort Lee, N. J. After five years, he went to work for Blackhawk, in Davenport, Iowa, as head of product development. It was there that he led the project to acquire and restore Chaplin\u2019s Mutual shorts, in which Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp character evolved from a purely slapstick figure to a rich, comedic personality. Mr. Shepard was hired by the Directors Guild of America in 1976 to oversee special projects, notably a series of oral histories with directors like King Vidor and Henry King. In the 1980s, he began teaching film history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California. In 1977, he married Kimberly Fetter, who had worked with him at Blackhawk. The marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his brother, he is survived by a son, Ben Baker. Pinched by competition from the video market, Blackhawk Films closed in 1987 and offered Mr. Shepard its equipment for scrap value. He bought an industrial building to house it, and to pay off the building he began doing commercial preservation and restoration work. Soon after, he acquired Blackhawk\u2019s film library, which became the basis for Film Preservation Associates. The company worked with distributors like Kino International and Flicker Alley. Many of the titles were released in box sets, including \u201cMasterworks of D. W. Griffith,\u201d \u201cThe Art of Buster Keaton,\u201d \u201cThe Golden Age of German Cinema,\u201d \u201cCecil B. De Mille: The Visionary Years,\u201d \u201cDouglas Fairbanks: King of Hollywood\u201d and \u201cGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s: First Wizard of the Cinema. \u201d In 2006, the National Society of Film Critics gave its Film Heritage Award to Mr. Shepard and his collaborators  \u2014   Anthology Film Archives and the film restorer Bruce Posner  \u2014   for the   collection \u201cUnseen Cinema: American   Films. \u201d Mr. Shepard, who lived in Hat Creek, Calif. had his fair share of serendipity along the way. Raoul Walsh\u2019s first film, \u201cRegeneration\u201d (1915) sometimes credited as the first gangster feature, simply fell into his lap when a meter reader from Missoula, Mont. contacted him about some films he had stumbled across in a building scheduled for demolition. \u201cWhen he went to read the meters for the last time, the tenants were gone but the films were still there, so he took them,\u201d Mr. Shepard told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. \u201cHe called me looking for someone to preserve them. \u201d Better yet, he told the newspaper in 1999, while he was visiting a colleague in France in the early 1970s, a boy rode up on a bicycle balancing a box of films on the handlebars. He had recently retrieved them from the family farm in Normandy. Among the films was an original print of \u201cThe Tramp,\u201d which Chaplin had made at Essanay Studios in 1915. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stage this in a bad play,\u201d Mr. Shepard said.'"}, "time": 1742561784.75025}
