[The lawsuit concerns an O\u2019Keefe sting that exposed Creamer\u2019s efforts to incite violence at Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign rallies to create a sense of \u201canarchy\u201d around the candidate.  O\u2019Keefe\u2019s work revealed that Creamer and his associates, who worked with the Democratic National Committee, were involved in a tactic called \u201c\u201d which involved provoking Trump supporters to lash out at them, and to film those reactions, with footage to be distributed to media outlets. The Project Veritas team also showed a Creamer associate describing a complex communications system he referred to as the \u201cPony Express,\u201d which Democrats used to circumvent rules against coordination between political campaigns and super PACs. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s work resulted in Creamer being forced to step aside from his campaign activities  \u2014   and also exposed his close connections to the Obama White House. Arguably, his reporting shifted the momentum in the campaign. Creamer\u2019s   complaint alleges that O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas \u201cselectively edit   \u2026     videotapes so as to distort and misrepresent what was said,\u201d and complains that their efforts unfairly interfered with Democrats\u2019 efforts to wreak havoc on the Trump campaign. The complaint also alleges: \u201cThe [Project Veritas] video was heavily edited and contained commentary by O\u2019Keefe that drew false conclusions from the selectively edited videos, to charge that Plaintiffs were involved in a conspiracy to incite violence at rallies for   Donald Trump  \u2026    \u201d. As a result of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s expos\u00e9s, Creamer\u2019s complaint alleges, Democracy Partners lost valuable business contracts from   political clients. Creamer and his company are seeking damages for alleged unlawful interception of oral communications, for civil conspiracy, and for fraudulent misrepresentation, among other torts. O\u2019Keefe responded with a statement: Robert Creamer believes that by suing us, he can intimidate us. I will not be silenced  \u2014   only over my dead body! We are on the right side of the law and will not stop exposing the truth.   \u2026     This lawsuit further justifies the need to drain the swamp. Our army of guerrilla journalists, which grows daily, will continue to expose the malfeasance and corruption committed by these organizations. In fact, we will be deploying a new batch of freshly trained journalists next week to shine additional light on the cockroaches of the corrupt DC establishment. We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced. We will find out who is funding this lawsuit. We will never stop exposing the truth. We will not back down. Project Veritas attorney Benjamin Barr added: \u201cThe First Amendment protects the rights of undercover journalists to expose exactly the sort of corruption captured in these videos. Veritas will assert its full First Amendment rights to defend itself in these proceedings. \u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
