Pope Francis creates anticipation for intercommunion between Catholics and Lutherans. \\nAfter 500 years of clear differences between them, intercommunion between Catholics and Lutherans seems to be closer to becoming a reality. Lutheran and Catholic bishops are expressing their expectation of the ability to receive Communion in the Catholic Church, a practice that is not lawful. Pope Francis, who will travel to Lund, Sweden, to participate in the ceremonies, has himself elicited the excitement by suggesting that intercommunion is a possibility. \\nThe Lutheran Church of Sweden to which Pope Francis is going for the celebration accepts contraception, abortion, homosexuality, and female clergy, all of which are strictly forbidden in the Catholic Church. Regarding the Eucharist, Lutherans have a fundamentally different faith from Catholics. Nevertheless, Eucharistic intercommunion seems to be the main desire for Lutheran and Catholic leaders. There doesn't seem to be much talk about whether married homosexual couples will be taking communion together at the Catholic Church. It is after all a legitimate concern for many considering the position of both Catholics and Lutherans on the issue. Donate Today!
