They didn\u2019t vote for Trump. They voted against the corrupt DC/Wall Street Establishment and against the Democratic National Committee criminal enterprise. The Dems could have put just about anyone else up against Trump and won. \\nWe knew what we were getting with Hillary Clinton: the reincarnation of Al Capone. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll get with Trump. But can it be any worse than what we\u2019ve had for the last 16 years? A Clinton victory would have sealed that fate. At least with Trump there\u2019s some small chance that the forces at work destroying the U.S. middle class will be halted. \\nUnfortunately the mainstream media was successful at smearing Trump and building a false narrative about Hillary Clinton. But Americans vote with their wallet and the fact that Trump won Wisconsin \u2013 the first time in 32 years that State voted for the Republican candidate \u2013 and the fact that Trump took most of the Rust Belt States reflects a middle class that is far worse off now than it was 8 years ago. And Hillary was correctly perceived as the candidate who was going to perpetuate the policies that are destroying this country. \\nThe truth is that not much will change under Trump. The U.S. is enveloped in a systemic collapse \u2013 financial, economic, social and political \u2013 that is an inevitability regardless of who or which party occupies the Oval Office. \\nThe United States has operated like a giant Ponzi scheme for several decades \u2013 a Ponzi scheme fueled by debt, fraud and overt corruption. When a Ponzi scheme fails nothing can stop its collapse. The U.S. has crossed that Rubicon \u2013 but long before the Loch Ness Monster defeated the Devil. Share this:'"}, "time": 1742563006.3817778}
