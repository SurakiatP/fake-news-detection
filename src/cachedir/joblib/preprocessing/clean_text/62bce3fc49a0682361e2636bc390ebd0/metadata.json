[And last October, Obama\u2019s former attorney general, Eric Holder, signed his name to a letter circulated by Clinton\u2019s campaign strongly criticizing Comey\u2019s decision to publicize aspects of the FBI investigation, alleging Comey\u2019s moves were inconsistent with FBI protocol.  In late October, less than two weeks before the presidential election, Comey informed key members of Congress that the FBI was reviewing additional emails that may have been relevant to the Clinton probe. This after emails were reportedly discovered on the personal devices of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of   top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. At the time, Clinton\u2019s campaign circulated the   letter, signed by Holder as well as nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and   Department of Justice officials. The letter stated: \u201cMany of us have worked with Director Comey all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. \u201d ABC News reported on the letter: The authors of the letter said they were \u201cmoved\u201d to speak out publicly because Comey\u2019s action violated \u201csettled\u201d DOJ tenets. Justice Department officials are instructed to refrain from commenting publicly on pending investigations except in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d as well as to \u201cexercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election,\u201d said the letter. \u201cWe cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official \u2014   Republican or Democrat \u2014  has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election\u2019s outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new,\u201d they wrote. The nearly 100 former DOJ officials who signed on to the letter wrote that Comey\u2019s letter to Congress was inconsistent with prevailing department policy and that it broke with longstanding practices followed during past elections. \u201cPerhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department\u2019s     traditions,\u201d they wrote. After Comey renewed the email probe in late October, Clinton herself called the FBI chief\u2019s actions \u201cdeeply troubling. \u201d \u201cIt is pretty strange,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information, right before an election. In fact, it\u2019s not just strange it\u2019s unprecedented and it\u2019s deeply troubling. \u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said Comey had \u201cnot been forthcoming with the facts. \u201d However, now that Trump has fired Comey, with administration officials citing Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation, former Obama aides and Clinton officials claim to be dismayed. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein clarified the firing in a letter, writing, \u201cI cannot defend the director\u2019s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201d Yet Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton\u2019s running mate, claimed the firing was about the Russia investigation. \u201cTrump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,\u201d Kaine tweeted in response to the news. \u201cComey firing part of a growing pattern by White House to   the truth. \u201d Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,  \u2014   Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) May 9, 2017,  Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, released the following statement: I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey\u2019s handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a \u201ccharade\u201d only 24 hours ago. It\u2019s equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey\u2019s firing. Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Brian Fallon, tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m not shedding any tears for Comey personally  \u2014   he hurt the FBI\u2019s reputation  \u2014   but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now. \u201d Former aides to Obama also claimed Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation. \u201cThis should not be sugarcoated. Firing Comey is up there in terms of the scariest things Trump has done,\u201d former Obama White House Communications Director Jen Psaki wrote on Twitter. Former Obama National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes expressed concern: \u201cThis is not normal. This is not healthy for a democracy. The fixed 10 year term for an FBI Director exists to prevent   \u2026     this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis justification several months into this Administration is just completely and insultingly unbelievable. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
