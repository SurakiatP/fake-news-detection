In a recent interview, Savage took a break from giving relationship advice and revealed a theory he has about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \\nSpeaking with host Mike Pesca on Slate \u2018s The Gist podcast, Savage tried his hand at figuring out the root of Trump\u2019s misogynistic comments and alleged sexual assault : \u201cI\u2019ve never really said this out loud before, so forgive me if I say this in an inarticulate way, but I\u2019ve encountered over my life straight guys who hated women so much that you could almost sense that if gay was a choice, they would make it.\u201d \\nTrump has an almost pathological need to be seen as powerful and in control, and Savage thinks that need, as well as fear of the power of female sexuality, is the root of his misogynistic behavior: \u201cThey\u2019re condemned to sit with both their hatred and disgust with women and their fear of women\u2019s bodies and their insecurity and their need for them, their desire for them, because they are who they are sexually attracted to, and the cognitive dissonance that can produce \u2014 you see those guys who are much more comfortable in the company of men, but they need this thing\u2026 They need this woman, and they need her as an object. They can\u2019t see her as a human being, or see them as human beings.\u201d \\nSavage states that he does not think Trump is actually gay, but that he would probably be happier if he was, since he would never have to interact with women in that case. \\nSavage\u2019s biggest concern with the Trump campaign is not the actual candidate, however. He is more concerned with the hatred and vitriol that the Republican party has adopted because of him: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned that, like climate change, assault is now a partisan issue, and that\u2019s going to play out for 30 years\u2026 You\u2019ve got the Giulianis and the Gingriches from their moral high grounds defending this. You\u2019ve got rank-and-file Republican knuckle-draggers \u2014 including Republican women \u2014 defending this.\u201d \\nIt should be noted that both former New York City mayor Rudy Guiliani and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich adamantly defend Trump in the face of sexual assault allegations. It should also be noted that both have been married multiple times and engaged in very public affairs. \\nIt will be up to those \u201crank-and-file\u201d Republicans to put the ugly, misogynist rhetoric of Donald Trump behind them after election day. Hopefully Savage is wrong when he says that he expects this to be a partisan issue for 30 years. \\nCheck out another interview from Savage here , where he refers to Trump as the \u201cenemy of the LGBT community.\u201d \\nFeatured Image via YouTube Video About Jordan Baranowski \\nJordan is a writer and teacher based out of Kansas City.
