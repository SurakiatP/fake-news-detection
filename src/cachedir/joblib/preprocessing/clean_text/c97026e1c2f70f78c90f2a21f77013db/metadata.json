Whether you\u2019re in a minuscule studio or a Classic 6 with too few closets, there is rarely enough of it. Most of us try to make the best of what we\u2019ve got, embracing our tiny kitchens and eking out storage where we can. But what do designers who specialize in small spaces  \u2014   and those who have made an art form of living in them  \u2014   know that the rest of us don\u2019t? Below, some tips and tricks. GET ORGANIZED \u201cHaving a place for everything is key,\u201d said Lauren DeCaro, who moved from the large   she shared with three roommates into a    studio in Brooklyn Heights that she bought for about $500, 000 last winter. Working with a contractor she found through Sweeten, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted professionals, Ms. DeCaro, 28, who works in development for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, overhauled the apartment with special attention to where all her things would go. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t want a dresser taking up valuable floor space in my apartment, so I made sure to install drawers and shelving in the closet,\u201d she said, noting that the $1, 500 system from California Closets was custom made, taking into consideration everything from her height to the number of shoes she owns. In the kitchen, $40 rolling cabinet inserts from the Container Store help corral her Tupperware and pots and pans. She installed her microwave in an   cabinet (along with its own electrical outlet) to avoid taking up valuable counter space and added a linen closet in an awkwardly shaped wall niche in the bathroom. \u201cHaving a designated place for everything has allowed me to have a streamlined, uncluttered studio apartment,\u201d she said. IF YOU DON\u2019T USE IT, LOSE IT \u201cIt\u2019s all about the edit,\u201d said David Bazner, 26, who lives in a      in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, and works as an interior designer at the Studio at One Kings Lane. \u201cI spent a lot of time getting rid of things that held no emotional value. If something means nothing to you, then it can be categorized as clutter  \u2014   and clutter is a small space\u2019s worst enemy. \u201d Getting rid of things he didn\u2019t love, he said, \u201callowed the pieces I really care about to take center stage\u201d  \u2014   an Afghan rug from his parents, an LC4 cowhide chaise, his favorite books. Mr. Bazner even did away with the headboard on his bed, stretching a tapestry he picked up for $20 from the ceiling to the floor along the full width of the bed, then pairing it with some   throw pillows to make the whole thing seem more expensive. GO VERTICAL \u201cOpt for the tallest bookcase possible,\u201d Mr. Bazner said. \u201cThe height will cue the eye to the top of the room, making your ceiling appear taller than it really is. \u201d James Tabb, 32, an interior designer for the online design service Laurel  Wolf, likes to add a floating shelf near the ceiling, along the perimeter of a room. The wraparound shelf not only frees up space below, but when filled with books or collectibles, he said, \u201ccreates an effect similar to crown molding,\u201d drawing the eye upward and adding definition to a room. The kitchen in his      in Los Angeles has about 80 square feet and only one drawer, so he installed a magnetic wall strip to hold knives and utensils. He suggests using   sconces instead of floor or table lamps whenever possible, because it \u201cnot only adds an interesting design feature to your space, but also serves a necessary, functional purpose. \u201d To hide unsightly cords, he said, pick up some cord covers (about $14 for a   length at Home Depot) and paint them the same color as the wall: \u201cYou won\u2019t even know they\u2019re there. \u201d LEAVE ROOM TO BREATHE \u201cWhen you have a small apartment, it can be tempting to place furniture in corners to save space,\u201d Mr. Tabb said. \u201cHowever, this actually ends up making your space look and feel much smaller. \u201d Leave \u201ca little breathing room between your furniture pieces and walls, as this visually opens up your space. \u201d MAINTAIN VISUAL FLOW \u201cOpt for sofas and credenzas with visible legs,\u201d said Kimberly Winthrop, 35, a senior designer at Laurel  Wolf. \u201cThe little bit of negative space will help to keep your small apartment from feeling like it\u2019s filled from wall to wall with furniture. \u201d Mr. Bazner of One Kings Lane recommends   club chairs with a seat height of about 20 inches to complement a sofa or settee. \u201cTheir skeletal nature maintains the visual flow of the room, while their height makes them appropriate to be used at a dining table in a pinch,\u201d he said. And if you\u2019re struggling to find a coffee table that\u2019s the right size, he added, try an arrangement of three smaller side tables: \u201cIt\u2019s an idea perfect for today\u2019s nomad, as the lack of bulk makes moving a breeze when the lease is up. \u201d BE FLEXIBLE Consider collapsible furniture, like a gateleg or   table, as well as pieces that can do double duty, like an ottoman with hidden storage, Ms. Winthrop suggested. That also goes for things like kitchen gadgets that can quickly crowd drawers or countertops. \u201cIf a tool or utensil doesn\u2019t have at least two to three functions, I simply don\u2019t buy it,\u201d said Mr. Tabb, who does without a microwave to save space in his    kitchen. \u201cIt may sound weird, but you really don\u2019t need one,\u201d he said. \u201cPopcorn is a bit more challenging to make on the stovetop, but the results are well worth the effort, and food reheated by stove or oven always tastes better. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628449.2563825}
