But running was her release. Ms. Vetrano, 30, had undergone surgery on her legs and defied doctors\u2019 conjecture that she might never run again, a friend, Jackie Hartstein, said. \u201cIt just hurts me that this evil person took the one thing that was hers,\u201d said Ms. Hartstein, 28, who lives in Bayside, Queens. \u201cWhen she was the happiest, that\u2019s where he took her. \u201d Ms. Hartstein, speaking outside a vigil on Wednesday night for Ms. Vetrano, was referring to an attacker, still at large, who the police say sexually assaulted and strangled Ms. Vetrano as she took one of her daily runs on Tuesday afternoon in the tall weeds of a nature preserve near her home in Howard Beach, Queens. The attack shocked residents of the neighborhood, which is one of New York City\u2019s safest. The police said they had few leads but believed her killing was random. \u201cYou feel safe here, because this is a community where nothing ever happens,\u201d said Annette Nocero, who was working at Beach Bum Tanning on Cross Bay Boulevard when she met Ms. Vetrano, a customer. She called Ms. Vetrano a sweetheart. \u201cNot like a runaround girl, nothing like that,\u201d Ms. Nocero said. \u201cA good girl. \u201d Ms. Vetrano\u2019s many followers on social media were treated to glamorous shots of her partying lifestyle. Many were shocked by the attack in broad daylight in a public park, an episode that seemed to hark back to a more lawless time in the city. And in a safer New York where crime has been declining for decades, even elected and police officials seemed shaken. At a news conference on Thursday at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, officials announced updates on what Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives, described as \u201can extraordinary case of murder. \u201d The conference was held to announce more reassuring news  \u2014   declines in citywide statistics on murder and shootings  \u2014   but details of the killing made for a gloomy departure, as Chief Boyce spoke of a lack of suspects or substantial leads in the attack. The chief noted Ms. Vetrano was attacked \u201cat a recreational center, in daylight hours, and that\u2019s extraordinarily unusual,\u201d especially because rape by strangers has decreased in the city over all. Police officials announced a $10, 000 reward. \u201cWe really need the public\u2019s help with this one,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the news conference. Chief Boyce said that detectives were still examining video from security cameras nearby, and that Ms. Vetrano\u2019s phone would be tested for DNA matches. \u201cWe plan to chop down just about every weed in that area, until we are satisfied that we got all the evidence,\u201d he said. On Thursday, investigators continued to hack through the tall reeds in the Gateway National Recreation Area on the edge of Jamaica Bay. The expanse lies south of the Belt Parkway, just to the west of Kennedy International Airport. Nearby, Councilman Eric A. Ulrich, who represents the area, described Ms. Vetrano as \u201cthe kind of daughter any parent would want. \u201d She was a graduate of St. John\u2019s University and recently earned a master\u2019s degree in speech pathology. She worked for years at Central, a lounge in Astoria, Queens, and also at Vetro Restaurant  Wine Bar on Cross Bay Boulevard, where her friends gathered on Wednesday night. Ms. Vetrano had several thousand followers on Instagram and enjoyed posting shots of herself clubbing and traveling, whether poolside on Long Island or in France or Monaco. But her alluring lifestyle had a flip side. As a writer, Ms. Vetrano also chronicled the pain and poignancy of her life. She published on her website, Karinavee. com, a variety of introspective and   writing she called \u201ca collection of conversations, contradictions and poetic conflicts. \u201d \u201cThis is my life, through my eyes, and I invite you to take a peek into my world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic, and unpredictable, but I do believe, that on some days, it\u2019s quite beautiful, in all its poetic little tragedies. \u201d Ms. Vetrano often ran with her father, Philip Vetrano, 60, a retired firefighter, through the preserve, an expanse of undeveloped wetlands known locally as the Weeds or the Baja. As a shortcut to a path popular with joggers and cyclists, they would cut through the   fire roads. But Mr. Vetrano had recently injured his back. He urged his daughter to avoid the grassy lanes kept for firefighting access, which are remote and frequented by transients, local residents said. \u201cHe got very worried, but she said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Dad, I\u2019ll be right back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ulrich said. Ms. Vetrano left her house near the edge of the preserve and jogged past the    homes, exchanging chatty text messages with a friend. Near 79th Street, she ran into the refuge via one of the shortcuts. Some 40 yards in, she was attacked. After several calls to her phone went unanswered, Mr. Vetrano contacted a neighbor who is an assistant chief in the Police Department. Within several hours, officers found Ms. Vetrano\u2019s body face down near a trail, with her clothing askew and her fists still clutching the reeds she was dragged into, Mr. Ulrich said. On Thursday, even hardened homeless people nearby expressed surprise that Ms. Vetrano would jog in the area. They described it as a remote place where screams could be drowned out by planes overhead. Mohamed Yasseen, who lives under the Cross Bay Bridge, spoke about an encampment where perhaps a dozen homeless men lived and often drank. He said he would not dare venture there, for fear of being attacked. \u201cI don\u2019t go back there,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who is back there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564045.4829276}
