He vows that his bank will drop its sales incentive program  \u2014   blamed for prompting bankers to set up illegal and unauthorized bank and credit card accounts to meet their sales goals  \u2014   by the end of the week, not in January, as he had previously promised. But at a hearing Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, nobody was impressed. If anything, the House lawmakers who interrogated John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, were even angrier and more hostile than their Senate counterparts who questioned him last week, before either of those steps had been taken. One by one, Democrats and Republicans alike took turns ripping apart Mr. Stumpf and what took place at the bank he leads. They denounced the actions as \u201ctheft,\u201d \u201ca criminal enterprise,\u201d identity fraud, an outrage and a devastating blow to the entire banking industry. But that was not all of Wells Fargo\u2019s bad news for the day. Also on Thursday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Wells Fargo $20 million for violating rules on lending to members of the military, including a rate cap on how much interest can be charged to service members on active duty. In a separate action, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $4 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into improper seizures of vehicles owned by soldiers who fell behind on their loans. \u201cIn those instances where some service members did not receive the appropriate benefits and protections, we did not live up to our commitment and we apologize,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe have been notifying and fully compensating customers and will complete this work in 60 days. \u201d The news did not play well with members of the House committee, who spent more than four hours on Thursday questioning and castigating Mr. Stumpf about the misdeeds under his leadership. \u201cIt appears that the company just can\u2019t make it through even this congressional hearing without us learning more and more information about what is going on at Wells Fargo,\u201d Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat of California, said as word began to spread of the coming sanctions over military lending. But Mr. Stumpf  \u2014   whom the members of the House committee personally blamed for the persistent and widespread misdeeds  \u2014   stuck to the same script he has used throughout the crisis. The problem, he explained, was an ethical lapse among the 5, 300 employees, most of them   bankers and tellers, who had been fired for their actions since 2011. At the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Stumpf apologized repeatedly for his bank\u2019s failings and repeated his earlier pledge  \u2014   given last week to the disgruntled Senate Finance Committee  \u2014   to accept \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for them. But he again rejected lawmakers\u2019 attempts to cast the scandal as a consequence of broader failings in Wells Fargo\u2019s leadership and corporate culture. \u201cI led the company with courage,\u201d Mr. Stumpf said, while admitting that the company \u201cshould have done more sooner\u201d to address the problem of unauthorized accounts being created by employees in the names of real customers. After the Senate hearing and before the House hearing, the board of directors of Wells Fargo agreed to claw back $41 million of Mr. Stumpf\u2019s unvested stock awards, deny him his annual bonus and strip away a portion of his $2. 8 million base salary. Mr. Stumpf said he approved of the decision. Carrie L. Tolstedt, who until recently ran the Wells Fargo retail banking operation, will lose $19 million in compensation. Confronted by the lawmakers with evidence that the practice of setting up phony accounts to meet sales goals might have gone back much further than the bank has admitted, perhaps to 2007, Mr. Stumpf said that Wells Fargo was continuing to investigate the extent of the problem, how far back it stretched and who knew. But those steps did not appease the lawmakers. Several called for Mr. Stumpf\u2019s resignation, and others asked why he shouldn\u2019t be jailed, like a bank robber. \u201cSomething is going wrong at this bank, and you are the head of it,\u201d said Gregory Meeks, Democrat of New York, adding, \u201cYou should be fired. \u201d Mr. Stumpf replied, \u201cI serve at the pleasure of the board. \u201d Mr. Stumpf is the board chairman. Mr. Meeks, at times pounding the table for emphasis, asked if Mr. Stumpf would have set free someone who had robbed a Wells Fargo Bank, then simply apologized and taken responsibility. Criticizing Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d Mr. Meeks said: \u201cYour bank, Wells Fargo, has given the entire financial services industry a black eye. \u201d \u201cTo the American people, this kind of feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the committee. \u201cSome institution is found engaging in terrible activities. There is a headline, fine, and yet no one seems to be held accountable. \u201d As Mr. Stumpf testified, a video screen on the hearing room\u2019s wall displayed a scroll of more than a dozen fines Wells Fargo has paid in recent years, totaling more than $10 billion. The list included penalties for subprime loan abuses, discriminating against   and Hispanic mortgage borrowers, and foreclosure violations, among others. Mr. Hensarling asked whether such fines are simply the \u201ccost of doing business. \u201d Mr. Stumpf answered no, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want our culture to be defined by these mistakes. \u201d Wells Fargo has been in crisis mode since it acknowledged this month that its employees had, over the course of several years, opened as many as 1. 5 million bank accounts and 565, 000 credit card accounts that may not have been approved by customers. The company agreed to pay $185 million in penalties and fines to settle cases brought by federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney. Wells Fargo has said it is contacting all of the customers who may have been affected. So far, the bank has contacted 20, 000 customers with questionable credit cards. About a quarter of them have said that they did not apply for the card or could not remember if they had, Mr. Stumpf said at the hearing. He also said that Wells Fargo would eliminate its product sales goals for retail bankers by the end of the week, accelerating the bank\u2019s previously announced plan to drop them by the start of next year.   say those sales goals led to intense pressure on workers to cheat to fulfill unrealistically high quotas. Mr. Stumpf carried with him a binder filled with material to help him form his answers, and he consulted it repeatedly as lawmakers questioned him about how many customers with potentially unauthorized accounts had been affected in their own home states. He reeled off the answers: Texas, 149, 857 Missouri, 1, 191 Delaware, 4, 255. The plight of Wells Fargo workers who lost their jobs for not meeting sales goals came up several times during the hearing, with lawmakers citing personal experiences from their constituents. Representative Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, Democrat of New York, asked how many workers Wells Fargo had fired for falling short. \u201cMy understanding is that people should not be fired, terminated for missing sales goals,\u201d Mr. Stumpf answered. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re doing a review of whatever, whoever might have been terminated for that. \u201d As for those who did take the fall for the illegal account openings, Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat of California, was particularly acerbic. \u201cYou fired 5, 300 people,\u201d he said at the hearing. \u201cYou took 5, 300 good Americans and turned them into felons. \u201d It is time, he concluded, to break up the big banks.'"}, "time": 1742562129.2634048}
