But of all things that \u201cdiversity\u201d covers  \u2014   gender, race, religion, or even what bathrooms should be made available  \u2014   diversity of thought isn\u2019t one of them. [If you dare question the (il) liberal orthodoxy, you\u2019re a pariah. And an adjunct professor at UCLA is in danger of becoming another victim.  Keith Fink has taught classes on free speech, contemporary issues, and entertainment law at UCLA for a decade. A lawyer by trade, Fink went on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d show earlier in May to discuss the school\u2019s attempt to fire him in a \u201cstar chamber\u201d review meeting that excluded him and his representatives.  \u201cThe administration doesn\u2019t like what I have to say,\u201d Fink told the Los Angeles Daily News. \u201cI also support students\u2019 basic rights to due process and the school doesn\u2019t like that.   \u2026     I show the students how their rights are violated.   \u2026     I don\u2019t believe in trigger warnings. I don\u2019t walk on eggshells. I don\u2019t believe in safe spaces. I run against that current. \u201d The \u201ccurrent\u201d at UCLA, as well as at most American colleges, is to stifle free speech  \u2014   or anything that runs contrary to the politically correct dogma now practiced on many campuses. Last June an appearance by former Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos at the school was canceled after protesters blocked the entrance at the beginning, followed by a bomb threat. Another Milo event at UCLA earlier this year was also scuttled after the school claimed that it could not provide adequate security. Fink is now undergoing a review process that he said probably will lead to his dismissal, since he\u2019s not a tenured professor at UCLA. His plight has drawn the attention of his students, who held a rally on campus Friday with signs saying \u201cfree speech is under attack\u201d and \u201ckeep your agenda out of our classroom\u201d to support him. UCLA officials issued a statement Friday with regard to Fink\u2019s employment, claiming that \u201c(t) he content of his courses has never been curtailed.   \u2026     UCLA\u2019s process for reviewing instructors is comprehensive and fair,   \u2026     and he has been afforded the full due process considerations mandated by the collective bargaining agreement. \u201d Fink teaches in the Communications Studies Department, which happens to be the same one that your humble correspondent taught nearly 20 years ago as a teaching assistant while a graduate student at UCLA. I taught several communications classes on journalism, and one time was asked to give a lecture for an adjunct professor who needed the day off. Before delivering my presentation in front of about 300 students, I carefully reviewed the course material and couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the boilerplate liberal talking points about the state of journalism. The most galling item was the claim that the media establishment had an overwhelmingly conservative bias  \u2014   keep in mind that this was at a time when Fox News was in its infancy and the Internet was still being invented by Al Gore. I ripped apart that lecture and instead gave a talk on the media\u2019s liberal bias, backed by my own experience as an actual practicing journalist (as opposed to most professors who teach in communications, including the one I was subbing for). Near the end, I held a    QA session and gladly answered each and every question. My presentation was received very well, with a number of students commending me for a \u201crefreshing\u201d and \u201c \u201d discourse afterward. Needless to say, I was not asked back for more. That might be the fate awaiting Fink at UCLA as well since he clearly holds a view on free speech that\u2019s no longer acceptable in academia. That would be a shame, said Mick Mathis, a senior at UCLA who attended Friday\u2019s rally. \u201cThis is supposed to be a marketplace of ideas,\u201d Mathis told the Daily News. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a marketplace of ideas if they\u2019re trying to get rid of somebody with a contradictory viewpoint. \u201d Follow Samuel Chi on Twitter @ThePlayoffGuru.'"}, "time": 1742628565.2389736}
