Food shortages have driven the now 83% of Venezuelans that live in cities to grow their own produce as a means of survival. Socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s calls for \u201cfood sovereignty,\u201d meaning that he wants urban people to start small farms and raise chickens in their homes in order to feed themselves, but his policies have only caused economic depravity, resulting in starvation and homelessness throughout the country. To add insult to injury, many believe these urban \u201c victory gardens \u201d will fail due to the lack of gardening skills urban dwellers possess.\\nLearn about the 7 Laws of Gardening Too Little Too Late? Venezuelans think Maduro\u2019s strategy is a sorry excuse for a solution to solve the country\u2019s dire food shortages and crippling inflation. Critics of Venezuelan economic policies have taken to social media to accuse government officials of downplaying the impoverished situation across the country.\\n#ThisIsVenezuela Urban farming in #Venezuela .

Thanks to @Nicolas Maduro.\u201d Many people think that Maduro is not fixing the problem but ignoring it altogether.\\nAnother tweet shows a picture of a woman shopping inside a Venezuelan grocery store with the caption \u201c#ThisIsVenezuela\u201d, and the shelves are nearly empty.\\n \\n#ThisIsVenezuela #TalkingDoesntWork #MoreAction #Venezuela #NadieSeRindeCarajo #Democracia #SacaLaBasura #MaduroPaFuera pic.twitter.com/vb9FP1oRz6 \\n\u2014 Mariana Gordon (@MarianaGordon_) November 2, 2016 \\n\\nOthers are enthusiastic about the plan. \u201cIf all communities began to cultivate, it would help to combat the high cost of living and food shortages,\u201d said Luisana Galvis, 69, in a Reuters report . \u201cIf we sell and cultivate in our own home, nobody can take that away from us, and nobody is going to sell it to us. And so, we reduce the cost of living.\u201d\\nIn 3 months time, only 273 tons of food have been grown, and this falls far short of the 3,500 ton annual goal of Venezuelans to feed their country. Some seeds that the Venezuelans are most likely growing are those that are easy to cultivate .\\n\u2018An Impending Humanitarian Crisis\u2019 This past week, lawmakers in Venezuela declared a \u201cfood emergency\u201d after reports of widespread shortages in milk, meat, bread and produce.\\nMaduro blames an \u201ceconomic war\u201d, but many Venezuelans are condemning Maduro\u2019s socialist economic policies for causing the inflation and subsequent market instability.\\nPhil Gunson , a member of the International Crisis Group based in Caracas, warns of an impending humanitarian crisis.\\n\u201cAt least one in 10 people is eating two meals a day or less. There isn\u2019t starvation. We are not talking about famine,\u201d says Gunson. \u201cBut we are talking about malnutrition, particularly in the case of children.\u201d\\nWith crime on the streets of Caracas at an all-time high, some are happy to be starting an indoor garden for the sake of staying away from thieves and violent crime. For Iraima Pacheco de Leandro, 54, a government opponent who was once kidnapped and held for ransom, farming is a great way to circumvent the chaos, but it may not be a long-term solution for Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis. Her terrace is filled with vegetables as a measure of self-suffiiciency, but she still thinks that \u201cagriculture should not be a solution,\u201d and the real problem lies in government policy and the inflated markets they created. \\nThis information has been made available by Ready Nutrition \\nOriginally published November 4th, 2016 How Would You Survive Hyperinflation in Venezuela?
