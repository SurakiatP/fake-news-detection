Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn\u2019t get the memo\u2026Trump\u2019s tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, \u201cThere will never be a President Trump\u201d. \\nPerhaps Amal should\u2019ve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns\u2026 \\nAmal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump\u2019s proposals would be \u2018violations of international law.\u2019 \\nSpeaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America\u2019s reputation under the real estate mogul\u2019s plans. \\nShe noted that Trump\u2019s comments during his campaign, \u2018that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed \u2014 all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.\u2019 \\nThe 38-year-old wife said America\u2019s reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. \\n\u2018I think there\u2019s some concern from abroad as to, \u201cAre these things actually going to happen?\u201d, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,\u2019 according to the Hollywood Reporter. \\nPerhaps its time to put our nation\u2019s security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us\u2026 \\nBoth Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. \\nEarlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. \\nWatch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: \\n\u2018When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, \u2018They only want jihad. They don\u2019t believe in our way of life. They don\u2019t respect our system,\u201d Clooney said. Via: Daily Mail  '"}, "time": 1742562819.8338492}
