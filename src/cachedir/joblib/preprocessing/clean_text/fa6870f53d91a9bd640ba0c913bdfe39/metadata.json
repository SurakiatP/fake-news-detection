What? \\nShe then went on to rail against Clinton and Obama, accusing both of making race relations worse over the past eight years. \\n\u201cHillary Clinton is running around saying [that], when she and the president have worked so hard over the last eight years to divide the country.\u201d \\nWithout citing any concrete evidence, the attorney claimed that both Clinton and Obama worked to pit \u201cwhites against blacks, blacks against Hispanics,\u201d and \u201cHispanics against Asians.\u201d \\nShe further argued that unlike Obama and Clinton, Trump would bring Americans together. \\nDonald-Kyei concluded her rant with a prediction as bulletproof as her logic. \\n\u201cBelieve me, believe me, they are convening a grand jury,\u201d Donald-Kyei exclaimed . \u201cTrust me!\u201d \\nDonald Trump must have the greatest collection of mentally unbalanced, intellectually dishonest, and morally dubious surrogates of any presidential candidate in U.S. history. \\nFeatured image via YouTube .'"}, "time": 1742564602.1641326}
