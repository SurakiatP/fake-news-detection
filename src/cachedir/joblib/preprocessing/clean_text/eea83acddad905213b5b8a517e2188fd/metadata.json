The soaring minarets that draw Istanbul\u2019s singular skyline, peeking out behind a gray haze of flurries. The street carts selling roasted chestnuts, the old tram making its way slowly, the street cats huddling around heaters in cafes  \u2014   all gave the city the feel of an old    photograph. Snow in Istanbul always feels magical, but for a few days this week and last, a blizzard  \u2014   at more than a foot, it was the heaviest snowfall since 2009  \u2014   was just what the city needed. It acted as a balm for the chronic fear and anxiety that had taken over amid terrorist attacks, political instability and the deep purges of civil society that began after a failed coup last summer. \u201cThis all blends into a feeling of suspension of normal daily life,\u201d said Orhan Pamuk, a Nobel laureate who coincidentally wrote an acclaimed novel called \u201cSnow. \u201d \u201cAnd perhaps this time, because of horrors of politics  \u2014   tens of thousands of professors and people are being fired from their jobs, and journalist and writer friends are being pushed into prisons  \u2014   at least for five minutes this is a consolation. \u201d In his many books, Mr. Pamuk, 64, has created a language of Istanbul, its intricacies, its mysteries, its landscapes. For him, a lifelong Istanbul resident, winter is bound up with youth, and as the snow fell this week, he was on the streets, taking photographs and remembering what it was like to be a child in such a big city. \u201cSnow is highly intertwined with memories of childhood,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon, sitting in his apartment as the snow fell across the Bosporus outside his window. In \u201cIstanbul: Memories and the City,\u201d he wrote: \u201cIt is impossible for me to remember my childhood without this blanket of snow. Some children can\u2019t wait for the summer holiday to begin, but I couldn\u2019t wait for it to snow  \u2014   not because I would be going outside to play in it but because it made the city look new, not only by covering up the mud, the filth, the ruins, and the neglect, but by producing in every street and every view an element of surprise, a delicious air of impending disaster. \u201d The snow brought the expected inconveniences to a city that, as Mr. Pamuk wrote in the book, is \u201calways caught unawares, greeting each snowfall as if it were the first. \u201d Hundreds of flights were canceled, ferry services that connect two continents, Europe and Asia, were halted, and streets were impassable. But there were many more pleasures. The incessant construction and traffic fell silent. Normally gruff policemen engaged in snowball fights with  . Children, off from school, sledded down the narrow streets. All of this lent itself to a feeling of being stranded, of time standing still. And that is why it all felt so delicious to the city\u2019s residents, who had become accustomed to a disorienting pace of bad news  \u2014   one attack after another, one political crisis after another. For a time, even, people seemed to forget that there was a killer on the loose, that the Turkish police had not yet apprehended the gunman in a New Year\u2019s morning attack on a nightclub that left dozens dead. \u201cThe snow landed in Istanbul like a rescuer from the recent traumatizing events,\u201d Aylin Sokmen, a Turkish fiction writer, wrote this week in an email. \u201cNowadays, watching the snowflakes  \u2014   for those who are lucky enough to be in a cozy home  \u2014   gives a sense of security from the troubling events, while it\u2019s still a struggle for survival for some others. Getting a break from our lives evokes deep feelings, such as remembrance of the past, innocence, nostalgia for childhood. \u201d She added, though, \u201cIt will not take long to face the uncontrollable narrative of the city, of the country and of our lives. \u201d And yes, even amid the bliss of the snowfall, there were intrusions this week: the continuing fall in value of the Turkish lira, a debate in Parliament about expanding the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many already regard as an authoritarian leader. But all that was a sideshow as people enjoyed the snow. \u201cWe come to this park every year when it snows, it\u2019s always so beautiful,\u201d said Sophie, 52, a teacher playing with her children who gave just her first name because, as a civil servant, she was not allowed to speak to a reporter. \u201cIt makes me so happy when schools are canceled on snow days, because the work is very demanding, especially at public schools, and children finally get to rest. \u201d In a city upended by divisions and unrest, the snow showed a gentler side, as city officials and business owners mobilized to care for the thousands of street dogs and cats that are as much a part of urban life here as tea shops and antiques sellers. One photograph that went viral on social media showed dogs bundled up under blankets inside a shopping mall. And probably for the first time in their lives, Syrian children, among the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled civil war to take up uncertain lives in Istanbul, played in the snow. \u201cWhat I will remember from this year\u2019s snow is the Syrian children I saw, who had perhaps encountered the first snow of their lives and were laughing in excitement,\u201d said Fatih Demir, 32, a photographer. \u201cThey were probably among those lucky enough to be off the streets, and outside shelters, having set up homes in the city with their families. \u201d Yet even while the snow provided a respite, it was still obvious to some how much the city\u2019s mood had changed in recent times, and how many fewer tourists there are. \u201cSnow is cleansing,\u201d said Ahmet Koc, 44, who owns a housewares store in Cihangir, a trendy neighborhood where many expatriates live. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful outside, but when I look at people\u2019s faces, I see sadness. \u201d While the snowfall interrupted lives for many, others kept to their routines. Murat Pak, 35, was out there on Monday where he usually is, despite the heavy snowfall: fishing from the Galata Bridge, which connects two of the city\u2019s European quarters across the Golden Horn waterway. There were only a few other fishermen with him. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel the cold if we\u2019re catching fish,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it\u2019s empty not because of the snow but because this past week there were no fish. They must have gone to warmer, deeper waters. \u201d As the city began returning to its regular rhythms after the storm, it was left with a feeling of being refreshed, even as the weather report called for more snow in the coming days. \u201cThis, quote, holiday, or sense of freedom, a sense of not doing your regular thing, is heavily intertwined with landscape, beauties of the town, and silence,\u201d Mr. Pamuk said. \u201cI think that is what makes it magical. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628513.6683805}
