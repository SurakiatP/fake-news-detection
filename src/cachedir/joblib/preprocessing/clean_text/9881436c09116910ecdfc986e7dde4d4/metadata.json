The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change.\u201d She continued: \u201cEight years ago, I was so inspired to know that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president. And now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless. \u201cWe have to think about the future of our daughters, our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,\u201d she continued, concluding: \u201cAnd that is why I\u2019m with her.\u201d After Beyonce\u2019s performance, she and her husband, Jay Z, bowed, hugged, and kissed, ending their night with their official endorsement of Hillary Clinton. then Jay Z made his endorsement. \u201cI want to grow up in a world where our daughter has no limitations. She can feel like she can be whatever she wants to be in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis other guy [Donald Trump], I don\u2019t have any ill will towards him, but his conversation is divisive, and that\u2019s not an evolved soul to me. He cannot be my president. He cannot be our president. Once you divide us, you weaken us. We\u2019re stronger together,\u201d Jay Z added. Jay Z then welcomed Hillary Clinton on stage and, along with Beyonc\u00e9, gave the 69-year-old politician a big hug. Then, the former Secretary of State grabbed the mic. \u201cWe have a woman who is an inspiration to so many others. I thank Beyonc\u00e9 for standing up and showing the world we are strongest when we look out for each other,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I thank Jay for addressing in his music some of our biggest challenges in the country: poverty, racism, the urgent end for criminal justice reform.\u201d \\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.
