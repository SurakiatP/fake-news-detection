The attack came during a peaceful demonstration against the widely publicized police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota earlier in the week. \u2022 Shots were fired around 9. p. m. on Thursday as hundreds of demonstrators were peacefully marching west on Main Street in downtown Dallas. Scores could be seen fleeing and screaming as police officers, who were on the scene to maintain order, took cover and returned fire. \u2022 Five police officers were killed, seven other officers were shot and two civilians were wounded. A lawyer for five of the wounded officers said they were expected to recover. \u2022 A senior law enforcement official identified the gunman as Micah Johnson, 25, an Army veteran who lived in the Dallas area. The police killed him using a   bomb during a standoff early on Friday. \u2022 The city\u2019s police chief, David O. Brown, originally described the shooting as a coordinated attack by two snipers. On Friday, the secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh C. Johnson, said that there had been only one gunman and that he had no known links to international terrorist organizations. \u2022 Three other people are in custody, but their identities and connections to the attack are unknown. \u2022 Before Mr. Johnson was identified, Chief Brown said the suspect was upset about the recent police shootings and \u201cwanted to kill white people, especially white officers. \u201d \u2022 Some downtown locations that were part of the crime scene will remain closed to the public until Wednesday. \u2022 President Obama, speaking in Warsaw, called the shootings a \u201cvicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. \u201d He will visit Dallas early next week at the invitation of Mayor Mike Rawlings, the White House said. \u2022 The shootings occurred just a few blocks from where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and they appear to be the deadliest attack for American law enforcement officers since Sept. 11, 2001. \u2022 Streets downtown were mostly quiet as the authorities began their second day of investigation on Saturday. A night earlier, demonstrators gathered in cities around the country for   protests. \u2022 On Wednesday evening, a police officer fatally shot a black man, Philando Castile, 32, during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. a suburb of St. Paul, the state capital. The aftermath was streamed on Facebook Live by Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, along with her young daughter. \u2022 St. Paul has been convulsed by protests. Demonstrators gathered around the home of Gov. Mark Dayton, who said he was shaken by the video. \u201cWould this have happened if the driver were white, if the passengers were white?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Obama, after arriving in Warsaw for a NATO summit meeting, told reporters, \u201cThere\u2019s a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us. \u201d That was before the demonstration  \u2014   and the killings of police officers  \u2014   in Dallas. \u2022 Mr. Castile had notified the police officer that he had a gun on him, and was a licensed gun owner. Whether this information played a role in the shooting is not clear. Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend said he was trying to retrieve his license and registration when the officer opened fire. \u2022 On Tuesday morning, two police officers fatally shot a black man, Alton B. Sterling, 37, in Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, while trying to arrest him. The shooting was captured on video that drew widespread attention after it was released online on Wednesday. \u2022 The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting, the latest in a series of killings of civilians that have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. \u2022 There have been protests and a vigil, but the city has otherwise remained calm. \u2022 Mr. Sterling had a long criminal history, but it is not clear whether the officers knew that when they tried to arrest him.'"}, "time": 1742564058.9788947}
