But legislators have been experiencing such a high volume of calls from constituents recently that their voice mail inboxes have been filled to capacity. High on the agendas of callers: President Trump\u2019s cabinet nominations and the flurry of actions taken in his first week in office. J. P. Freire, a spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Friday that the office had doubled its voice mail capacity in the past few months when it became clear that, with the new administration, \u201cwe were going to play an even larger role. \u201d \u201cCertainly we have a high call volume,\u201d Mr. Freire said. While he declined to comment on the topics discussed with constituents, he attributed some of the high volumes to Senator Hatch\u2019s position on several congressional committees. With votes scheduled to take place on Jan. 31 on his nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and his pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, online campaigns promoting telephone activism are also picking up steam. Constituents and political activists are organizing to try and influence lawmakers\u2019 votes on the nominations, and are tagging them on Twitter or Facebook if they are unable to reach staff members by telephone. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, took note of the feedback in her home state, California, with notes tacked onto her Twitter timeline by people trying to reach her and blaming telephone backlogs. At 10:17 Eastern on Friday morning, for example, no one picked up the telephone at the main number for the senator\u2019s office in Washington. Two minutes later, when a call was placed to Ms. Feinstein\u2019s San Francisco office, a recording said the voice mail box was full. The mailbox was still full at 1:17 p. m. But someone did pick up the phone at her office in San Diego, referring a reporter to a spokesman, said they were aware of the heavy call volume and were working on it. \u201cAll office lines in California and Washington are being answered, and voicemails are being taken down as quickly as possible,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, said in an email on Friday. \u201cWhen phone lines are overwhelmed, we also encourage constituents to use the senator\u2019s website to contact her online. \u201d This week, Concerned Student 1950, a student group  named in honor of the year the first black students were admitted to the University of Missouri, promoted a telephone campaign to oppose Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination. It published on Twitter a register of phone numbers for key legislators whose votes could be pivotal, along with advice on who was picking up the phone and who was not. People urged others on Twitter to use the   fax machine, to send emails or to reach out to their local legislators\u2019 offices if phone lines on Capitol Hill were not being answered or if voice mail messages were no longer being accepted. Sometimes, residents expressed their displeasure about the jammed lines. Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, was the subject of protests in his home state this week by some constituents over what they said was their inability to contact their elected official by phone, The Durango Herald reported. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why Cory Gardner is not responding to the people he\u2019s supposed to represent,\u201d said Gail Harriss, a Durango resident who was one of about 50 protesters who converged on the senator\u2019s office. \u201cEspecially when time is of the essence with Trump\u2019s nominees,\u201d the newspaper quoted her as saying. Alex Siciliano, a spokesman for Senator Gardner, said in a telephone interview on Friday that in the past week or two, the senator\u2019s office had switched over to a system that has a \u201cvirtually unlimited\u201d capacity that sends voice mail messages digitally to an email inbox that make it easier for staff members to work through the calls. Mr. Siciliano said later in an email: \u201cNothing is more important to Senator Gardner than providing the best constituent service possible to all Coloradans. Since January 1st, our office has received a large volume of emails and phone calls, and we have responded to more than 25, 000 letters and fielded thousands of phone calls. \u201d The Twitter timeline of Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, was littered with messages on Friday saying her phone lines were jammed. Ms Murray replied with an announcement telling people to send emails, instead. Taylor Haulsee, a spokesman for Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Friday that the office was busy fielding a high volume of calls from constituents with opinions about the nominees. Bryan Watt, a spokesman for Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, said in a telephone interview that the office has received about 6, 000 calls this week and 5, 000 more voice mail messages, between the Washington, D. C. offices and the Seattle office. \u201cMost of them are coming in about the nominees,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seven phone lines. If they are currently busy, then that person will be kicked to voice mail. \u201d He added, \u201cFor the most part, we are able to keep up and listen to as many people as possible. \u201d Perhaps the calls had some effect. Senator Cantwell announced on Thursday that she would not back Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination for education secretary.'"}, "time": 1742563502.3462882}
