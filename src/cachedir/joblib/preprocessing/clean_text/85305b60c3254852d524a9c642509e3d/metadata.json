He was surprised by the diagnosis, but even more by the prognosis \u2014 that he was to live only six to nine months, according to medical \u2018experts.\u2019 \\nMoraitis hails from the Greek island of Ikaria, known as a place where people \u2018forget to die,\u2019 as they have such high longevity rates. He opted to forgo chemotherapy and other medications, not because this was the Greek way, necessarily, but because he considered funeral costs to be too exorbitant in the U.S. where he had moved in 1943 to seek treatment for a combat injury. Upon learning he had little time, he opted to return to his native Ikaria. \\nMoraitis simply continued to work, and drank two to three glasses of wine every day, waiting for his certain death. At about age 50, he started to question the doctor\u2019s prognosis, and at 98 years of age he says, \u201c I\u2019m no doctor, but I think the wine helped. I\u2019ve done nothing else except eat pure food, [drink] pure wine, [take] pure herbs. \u201d \\nHis actions to cure his cancer are decidedly simple, but that\u2019s what makes them so surprising. Americans have been taught to believe they need to spend thousands of dollars on chemotherapy drugs, and practically go into bankruptcy while also killing their healthy cells with chemo and radiation, instead of simply changing their lifestyle habits. \\nMoraitis is living proof that eating right, working in fresh air , and giving the body the proper nutrients \u2014 that scavenge free radicals and create an environment in which cancer cannot thrive \u2014 might be all it truly takes to live well and prosper. \\nMoraitis may not be a doctor, he quipped, but there are over 2,200 peer-reviewed scientific studies suggesting that his lifestyle was very conducive to his recovery. \\nInstead of spending more than $120,000 on pharmaceutical \u2018cures\u2019 which don\u2019t necessarily work, he likely spent a few bucks every week on wine, fruit, and vegetables. He also happened to avoid the cost of an American funeral . \\nSo, in essence, he spent less to live, than to die at the hands of modern, Western medicine. \\n\u201c I found my friends in the village where I was born, and we started drinking. I thought, at least I\u2019ll die happy, \u201d he said when first given his death-sentence.'"}, "time": 1742562483.8676996}
