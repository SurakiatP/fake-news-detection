Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, decided to lecture Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Senate Republicans, Mr. Grassley said, were not to blame for the partisan deadlock over President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. The real culprits? The chief justice and his colleagues. Mr. Grassley\u2019s   delivered on the Senate floor, was in response to an analysis in this column last month of the chief justice\u2019s stance as Senate Republicans refuse to consider the nomination. Chief Justice Roberts has said, for instance, that partisan confirmation hearings feed a false public perception that justices cast their votes \u201cas Democrats and Republicans,\u201d rather than as neutral arbiters of the law. Mr. Grassley offered a different take. \u201cThe chief justice has it exactly backwards,\u201d he said. \u201cThe confirmation process doesn\u2019t make the justices appear political. The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the court has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. \u201d \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d Mr. Grassley told the chief justice. Mr. Grassley did not list the decisions that troubled him. But he did say that only two members of the court, presumably Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u201cstick to the constitutional text and vote in a consistently conservative way. \u201d Mr. Grassley\u2019s logic, if that is the right word, was that conservative decisions are apolitical but that liberal ones are partisan. As for Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. Grassley said, \u201ca number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. \u201d Again, the senator did not say which votes he was talking about, but they probably included ones rejecting challenges to the Affordable Care Act. Chief Justice Roberts has said that the president\u2019s two previous nominees, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were \u201cextremely well qualified for the court. \u201d Yet they were confirmed almost strictly along party lines, he said in remarks in Boston 10 days before Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cThat suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees. \u201d There is truth on both sides, said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cI think Grassley may be right,\u201d she said, \u201cto blame the court for the increasing role of ideology, as opposed to qualifications and other factors, in Senate confirmation proceedings. \u201d She added that politics had played a significant role in Supreme Court decisions since at least the 1950s. \u201cBut Chief Justice Roberts is also right,\u201d Professor Epstein said. \u201cPolitical science research shows that Americans are less likely to support the court when it is portrayed as a political body  \u2014   as it is during confirmation proceedings  \u2014   and not a legal body. \u201d Chief Justice Roberts has said nothing in public about the confirmation process since Justice Scalia died. He has been silent on the nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Mr. Grassley\u2019s remarks, made on April 5, seemed calculated to make sure that Chief Justice Roberts stays quiet notwithstanding exhortations from constitutional scholars that he speak up. \u201cThat\u2019s a political temptation that the chief justice should resist,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. But there is precedent for measured intervention by a chief justice in a clash over the nature and future of the Supreme Court. Consider another chief justice\u2019s response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s   plan. In 1937, unhappy with Supreme Court decisions striking down New Deal programs, Roosevelt announced a plan to add justices, saying the current ones were overworked. The plan was defeated after a letter from Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes to the Senate rebutted Roosevelt\u2019s charges in mild language backed by detailed figures. \u201cThe present number of justices,\u201d Chief Justice Hughes wrote, \u201cis thought to be large enough so far as the prompt, adequate and efficient conduct of the work of the court is concerned. \u201d Chief Justice Roberts may also have views about whether the present number of justices on his court  \u2014   eight  \u2014   is adequate. He certainly admires Chief Justice Hughes, as he made plain in remarks in November at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cOne of the greatest crises facing the Supreme Court since Marbury v. Madison was F. D. R. \u2019s   plan,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said, \u201cand it fell to Hughes to guide a very unpopular Supreme Court through that   showdown against America\u2019s most popular president since George Washington. \u201d \u201cThere are things to learn from it,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said. James F. Simon, the author of \u201cF. D. R. and Chief Justice Hughes,\u201d said he saw parallels between the two historical moments. \u201cI think Hughes would have been frustrated and annoyed by the present Senate Republicans\u2019 vow to ignore their constitutional obligation to consider Garland\u2019s nomination,\u201d Mr. Simon said. \u201cI suspect that Roberts shares those feelings. Both Hughes and Roberts put great value in protecting the court\u2019s integrity. \u201d The key difference, Mr. Simon said, is that senators had asked for Chief Justice Hughes\u2019s views. \u201cShould the Senate Judiciary Committee make a similar request to Roberts, I think he would probably respond, giving a carefully worded nudge to the committee to consider Garland,\u201d Mr. Simon said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see Grassley reaching out to the chief justice. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562043.3145154}
