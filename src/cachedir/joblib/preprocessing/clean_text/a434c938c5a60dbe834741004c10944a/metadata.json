Dershowitz continued, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the law is supposed to operate. And finally, the Trump Justice Department is getting smart. They are appealing this not to the Ninth Circuit where they are likely to get an adverse ruling. They are appealing it to the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit is a much more conservative court. And much more likely to uphold the travel ban, and then if the case goes to the Supreme Court and ties four to four, Trump wins. \u201d He added, \u201cI actually said that this wasn\u2019t constitutional analysis. It was psychoanalysis. There is precedent in extreme cases where legislators in enacting a statute say things that you can sometimes look to the legislative intent. But I have never heard of a case where the rhetoric of a candidate, ambiguous rhetoric to be sure  \u2014   because I do not believe this is a Muslim ban  \u2014  focusing on a country like Iran, the greatest exporter of terrorism, not only no vetting, it sends terrorists out in order to kill Americans. Iran has so much blood on its hands of Americans and American allies, to exclude a country like Iran from the list would be absurd. And the list  \u2014  although for a different purpose  \u2014   was originally designed by President Obama. So how can you say that the exclusion of six countries on the list was motivated by what Mr. Trump said when he was candidate Trump? That is not good legal analysis. I\u2019m putting my reputation on the line \u2014  I predict the case gets to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will uphold the major provisions of this ban. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562104.0543408}
