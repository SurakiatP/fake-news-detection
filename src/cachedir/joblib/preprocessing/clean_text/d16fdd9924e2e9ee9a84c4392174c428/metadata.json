It is a matter of generosity more than accuracy. \u201cWe need to \u201d Coach Vic Schaefer said amusedly, \u201cbecause I\u2019m pretty sure she ain\u2019t the 5 on the second part of that. \u201d No matter. William, the shortest player on the court, made the biggest play of the national semifinals late Friday. Her   jump shot at the buzzer in overtime defeated Connecticut,   in an epic upset that halted the Huskies\u2019   winning streak and ended their chance of a fifth consecutive N. C. A. A. championship. \u201cI was in shock I\u2019m still in shock,\u201d William, who had 13 points and 6 assists, said half an hour after the game. \u201cI\u2019m over here like, dang, I just won the game. \u201d It was a startling moment of release for William in a career forged by the doubts of others, bereavement, injury, newfound assurance and a remarkably close bond with her coach. And it was a rousing moment of liberation for the N. C. A. A. in the 36th year that it has sponsored a women\u2019s basketball tournament. UConn and Tennessee  \u2014   with 19 national titles between them  \u2014   have provided reliable and appreciated greatness. Their success has given women\u2019s basketball groundbreaking visibility and legitimacy. And now the sport has another luminous moment that many observers felt it needed: not certainty but mystery. A surprise ending, a   revelation, a champion dethroned. A stunning instant that will be replayed for as long as games are won in a final astonishment. A woman hitting a late shot and her face blooming in jubilant disbelief and her teammates engulfing her in an ecstatic pile. \u201cI think the fun of the men\u2019s game is the parity, and the fun of the N. C. A. A. tournament is the upsets,\u201d said Muffet McGraw, the longtime women\u2019s coach at Notre Dame, which won the 2001 N. C. A. A. title and reached the final in four of the previous six seasons. \u201cYou hear about a lot of different teams on the men\u2019s side you know about a lot of different players,\u201d McGraw said. Referring to UConn, she added, \u201cI think it gets boring for some people to watch and say, \u2018Eh, they\u2019re going to win.\u2019 You want to see a great game. When the Yankees dominated, when the Celtics dominated, they still lost games. \u201d But with the Huskies, she said, \u201cNobody comes close. \u201d Well, hardly ever. UConn had not lost a game since Nov. 17, 2014. No team had seriously threatened this season since the Huskies escaped the opener in November by 2 points at Florida State. But there was something personal about Mississippi State\u2019s determination on Friday after it had lost to the Huskies by 60 points  \u2014   60 points  \u2014   in the 2016 tournament. \u201cI feel like we earned respect,\u201d William said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t believe in us, but it didn\u2019t faze us. \u201d On Sunday, in the national title game, Mississippi State ( ) will face a familiar opponent: South Carolina ( ) a fellow member of the Southeastern Conference. One university will win its first national title, bringing hope to other aspirants and confirmation that women\u2019s basketball has been steadily and broadly improving in UConn\u2019s shadow, even if it was not always apparent to a general audience. \u201cIt breathes a little life into women\u2019s basketball, knowing that it\u2019s not the same old, same old, same old UConn,\u201d said Dawn Staley, the South Carolina coach. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beautiful thing to watch, but it\u2019s great to know somebody else is going to win the national championship, and it\u2019s not like you just tear the Velcro off and stick UConn back up. \u201d By early Saturday afternoon, the shock of Friday for William had been replaced by preparation for Sunday\u2019s championship game. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay levelheaded,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have business to take care of. I can\u2019t get the big head just yet. We beat UConn, but we haven\u2019t got the ring or cut down the nets, nothing like that. \u201d For William, 20, a junior from Birmingham, Ala. her awakening during this tournament has been a validation of her skill and a rebuke to the countless people who told her she was too short to play major college basketball. After averaging 9. 6 points for her career, William scored 41 in a regional final a week ago against Baylor. And then she dribbled three times to the right of the lane just before overtime expired on Friday and hit a   jumper, sending Mississippi State\u2019s players and fans into delirium. In that moment, William did what every child who ever played basketball in the driveway or shot at a hoop nailed to a barn has dreamed of and rehearsed  \u2014   counting the time down, hitting the winning shot and hearing the crowd erupt with the sound of something decisive and astounding. \u201cSometimes all it takes is one kid to go into a completely different zone, and they can carry a team through an entire tournament,\u201d UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cIt happens. That kid averaged 9 points a game during the season. This isn\u2019t the regular season. She doesn\u2019t have to do it for the next five months. \u201d Just for one more night. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole different dynamic,\u201d he said. Auriemma met William at a Final Four banquet on Wednesday night and said he told her: \u201cThat\u2019s what the N. C. A. A. tournament\u2019s all about, for kids to throw themselves into the national spotlight. It\u2019s the chance of a lifetime, and you\u2019re taking advantage of it. \u201d But her career has not followed the same smooth arc as her winning shot on Friday. When William was a senior in high school in Birmingham in 2014, her stepfather, Donnie Rory, died of a heart attack. He had played football at Samford University in Alabama and had encouraged his stepdaughter to play basketball. She could play in the S. E. C. he told her, and could be the best point guard in the conference. \u201cEvery time I play basketball, I think about him,\u201d William said. \u201cHe put the ball in my hand when I was 3, and I ran from there. \u201d At Mississippi State, she found the understanding of Schaefer, who had lost both his parents. William rooms with Schaefer\u2019s daughter, Blair, a reserve guard on the team, and often eats dinner at the Schaefer household. \u201cBecause of what she\u2019s been through, I try to provide that stability whenever necessary, because she\u2019s away from home,\u201d Vic Schaefer said. \u201cI love all my kids. But there\u2019s always a special place in my heart for any young person who has had to go through dealing with losing a parent. \u201d Last season, as a sophomore, William played with what she called a stress fracture in her right tibia. Schaefer called it a \u201ccrack. \u201d William wore a protective covering over her leg, but she admitted to playing timidly in the   loss to UConn. \u201cI didn\u2019t cry because we played so bad,\u201d she said. After the season, the injury did not heal. So William underwent surgery, and a rod was inserted into her leg. \u201cI\u2019m back to myself,\u201d she said. This season, she has played more aggressively and confidently. On Friday, when Mississippi State called a timeout to set up its final play with the score tied at 64, Schaefer told William, \u201cMo, you\u2019re about to win the game. \u201d She did, and on the UConn bench, Auriemma flashed a droll smile. \u201cIt was almost like, \u2018Of course, of course it\u2019s going to go in,\u2019\u201d Auriemma said. \u201cShe\u2019s had an amazing run so far. \u201d Afterward, William said that Auriemma told her, \u201cYou deserve everything that\u2019s coming your way. \u201d She took it to mean one thing: \u201cGo win it all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561815.0699143}
