They have commenced a struggle between the cross and crescent. There is no other explanation than this. I am saying this clearly: Europe is heading toward the days just before World War II,\u201d said Erdogan, as rendered by Hurriyet Daily News.  Euractiv transcribes Erdogan\u2019s quote as, \u201cThe European Union\u2019s court, the European Court of Justice, my esteemed brothers, have started a crusade struggle against the crescent,\u201d which would be even more incendiary. Jihad and Islamist groups perpetually accuse Western powers of conducting another \u201ccrusade\u201d against Muslims. \u201cShame on the EU. Down with your European principles, values, and justice,\u201d Erdogan told his supporters. In a tirade on Wednesday, Erdogan said the \u201cspirit of fascism is roaming the streets of Europe,\u201d comparing the treatment of Muslims to how the Nazis treated Jews. \u201cThe fear of the Turks is beginning to appear. The fear of Islam is beginning to appear. They are even afraid of the migrants looking for asylum. They fear everything which originates elsewhere they are hostile to everything that is not from there,\u201d he thundered. Also speaking on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu predicted that \u201choly wars\u201d would soon begin in Europe. As translated by Hurriyet Daily News, Cavusoglu said: Now the election is over in the Netherlands.   \u2026     When you look at the many parties you see there is no difference between the social democrats and fascist [Geert] Wilders. All have the same mentality. Where will you go? Where are you taking Europe? You have begun to collapse Europe. You are dragging Europe into the abyss. Holy wars will soon begin in Europe. \u201cThey killed each other 100 years ago because they were of different faiths, but they learned a lesson from this and set up the European Union and the Council of Europe,\u201d Cavusoglu continued, prompting a bit of   from Hurriyet about exactly what he was driving at. Like Cavusoglu, Erdogan took some time on Thursday to thumb his nose at the Netherlands, taunting   Prime Minister Mark Rutte: \u201cO Rutte! You may have been first in the elections, but you have lost a friend like Turkey. \u201d He went on to needle Rutte about refusing to have dinner with him because \u201cthere is no such prime minister here  \u2014   give it up, you have lost. \u201d Presumably, this was Erdogan\u2019s way of treating Rutte as beneath his notice. Erdogan wrapped up his remarks by threatening to scuttle Turkey\u2019s migrant readmission agreement with the European Union. \u201cThey have promised to remove visas. Now they are talking about a readmission plan. What readmission? Get over it! You did not let my minister enter the Netherlands, you did not give permission to my foreign minister to fly to the country and did not let the minister get into the consulate building, which is my territory. Then you are expecting readmission? There is no such thing,\u201d Erdogan said.'"}, "time": 1742562069.1306453}
