After first refusing to disavow Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations, made in a series of Twitter posts, and instead calling for Congress to investigate them, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters, \u201cThere is no reason that we have to think the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever. \u201d Mr. Spicer\u2019s statement, which he read from a sheet of paper that was handed to him at the end of his briefing, reinforced the conundrum Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets have created for the White House: Either the president\u2019s assertions are baseless, or he may have implicated himself in a government investigation of contacts between his presidential campaign and Russia. Until Wednesday, Mr. Spicer had steadfastly declined to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that former President Barack Obama ordered wiretap surveillance of Trump Tower  \u2014   an act that Mr. Trump condemned as a scandal comparable in scale to McCarthyism or Watergate. Early into Wednesday\u2019s briefing, Mr. Spicer stuck to the policy he has followed since the storm broke over Mr. Trump\u2019s posts. Asked whether the president was the target of a counterintelligence inquiry, he replied: \u201cI think that\u2019s what we need to find out. There\u2019s obviously a lot of concern. \u201d But after an aide slipped Mr. Spicer a note, he circled back to clarify that \u201cthere is no reason to believe there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice. \u201d The press secretary insisted he was not disavowing the president, who posted his tweets early on Saturday morning from    his resort in Palm Beach, Fla. \u201cThe tweet dealt with wiretaps,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThe other is an investigation. They are two separate issues. \u201d While the F. B. I. is conducting a   counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, there is no public evidence that Mr. Trump is a target. The Justice Department defines \u201ctarget\u201d as someone whom investigators have substantial evidence against and who is likely to be indicted. Current and former officials have said repeatedly that although they were concerned about intelligence suggesting meetings between associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s and Russian officials, they have developed no evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia\u2019s hacking efforts. Mr. Spicer cited the former director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. who last Sunday made that point on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d But Mr. Clapper also said he had no knowledge the government had sought a warrant from a foreign intelligence court to install a wiretap in Trump Tower. On Saturday, the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that his agency had wiretapped his phones. The department has refused to do so. Mr. Spicer complained bitterly about news media coverage of ties between Mr. Trump and Russia, saying it was fueled by leaks from anonymous sources, none of which had been substantiated. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how many times this fake narrative gets repeated over and over and over again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet no evidence has ever been suggested that shows the president has anything to do with any of the things that are being said. It\u2019s a recycled story, over and over and over again. \u201d The problem for the White House is that Mr. Trump fueled this week\u2019s cycle of stories himself. On Wednesday, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate\u2019s Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism asked the F. B. I. and the Justice Department for evidence that the government had sought legal permission to tap Mr. Trump\u2019s phones. The request came in a letter from Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, to Mr. Comey and the acting deputy attorney general, Dana Boente. Mr. Boente is overseeing the Russia inquiry because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any cases involving the Trump campaign and Russia, after acknowledging he met with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. \u201cWe request that the Department of Justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders  \u2014   redacted as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods that may be compromised by disclosure, and to protect any ongoing investigations  \u2014   related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump campaign or Trump Tower,\u201d the senators wrote. With no evidence of wiretaps emerging, the White House has been forced into a defensive communications strategy. It has curtailed Mr. Trump\u2019s appearances before cameras, where reporters could ask him about his claims. Mr. Spicer held his briefing on Monday without TV cameras, though on Tuesday and Wednesday, he answered questions at length and before the cameras. On Tuesday, the administration sent the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, on CNN, where he, too, provided no evidence of any wiretapping. However, Mr. Kelly said, \u201cif the president of the United States said that, he\u2019s got his reasons to say it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628424.7937257}
