So if I vote, will Immigration know where I live, will they come for my family and deport us?\u201d \\nObama: \u201cNot true, and the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself, and there is not a situation when the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential.\u201d \\nWords no longer have meaning: \u201cUndocumented citizens\u201d is a new Orwellian oxymoron. \\nRecall that Obama had studied Constitutional law at Harvard Law School. His course of study must have been How to Subvert the U.S. Constitution. \\nWhy isn\u2019t Congress impeaching this outlaw and disgrace to the presidency? \\nH/t \u201cBarry Soetoro\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562734.8945956}
