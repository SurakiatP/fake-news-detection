I think we now have a definitive answer: \u201cThese blast points on Hillary\u2019s campaign\u2026 too accurate for the Mainstream Media. Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise.\u201d \\nThe Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a \u201close-lose\u201d situation for embattled FBI Director Comey. If Comey remained quiet until after the election, he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice (sic). \\nBut in going public, he stands accused by Democrats of \u201cintervening in an election,\u201d i.e. raising doubts about Hillary\u2019s judgment and veracity days before Americans go to the polls. \\nAnother narrative has Comey\u2019s hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election. \\nI submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play: the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability. The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not, i.e. take one for the good of the nation/Deep State/Imperial Project. \\nAs a refresher: the Deep State is the unelected government (also called the invisible or shadow government) that is not as monolithic as generally assumed.'"}, "time": 1742563809.0278344}
