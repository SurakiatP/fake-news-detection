He brought up the example of the polls, which can never really be random and are manipulated by selective sampling. These polling results then impact the selection of voters who don\u2019t want to waste their vote on someone they feel has no chance of winning. \\nHe talked about his debate tonight, which will be live on C-SPAN. You can find the livestreaming information here. Dr. Slattery joined the show and spoke of the fact that even if Donald Trump becomes president, European Americans will not have a single voice representing their interests in Washington unless David Duke wins his race for the Senate. \\n\\nOur show is aired live at 11 am replayed at ET 4pm Eastern and 4am Eastern. \\n '"}, "time": 1742628513.7399302}
