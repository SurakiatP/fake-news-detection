Only one of the four putative weapons ships was validated by the United Nations as being an actual smuggling attempt. \\nDonegan went on to claim that he believes Iran is \u201cconnected in some way\u201d to recent incidents of missiles fired at a US ship off the Yemeni coast, though the Pentagon conceded one of those incidents likely never happened, and he offered no evidence of Iranian involvement in anything else. \\nThe allegations were likely made by way of justifying US attacks on the Yemeni coast, as well as justifying Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing naval blockade of Yemen, which Saudi Arabia recently denied is happening.
