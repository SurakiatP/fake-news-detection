If they\u2019re not giving out about bodily autonomy, they\u2019re complaining about wage equality or something like that. \\nDon\u2019t they have enough? When will they quit whining and giving out? It\u2019s like they got the vote in 1918 and then just kept nagging and nagging, wanting more and more. It\u2019s no longer legal for husbands to rape their wives, we sorted that out in 1993. The last of the Magdalene Laundries was shut in 1996\u2026 and now they\u2019re still going on about the 8th amendment. Lads, what will we do with them at all? POLL: What Are We Going To Do With These Women, At All, At All? Ignore them, they'll get bored soon Tell them they look lovely, that'll distract them for a while Just Repeal the 8th, Jesus, enough already Take the vote off them again\""}, "time": 1742628315.8757138}
