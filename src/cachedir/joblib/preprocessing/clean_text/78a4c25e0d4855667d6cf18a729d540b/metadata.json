{"duration": 0.13003849983215332, "input_args": {"text": "'After President Donald Trump described former President Barack Obama as a \u201csick guy,\u201d the former president\u2019s loyal team rose in unison to defend him. [Obama\u2019s office quickly asserted that the president had a \u201ccardinal rule\u201d not to interfere with investigations led by the Department of Justice.  \u201cEnough said,\u201d wrote former White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, sharing the statement on Twitter. Trump\u2019s accusations clearly triggered a nerve among former Obama staffers, as many of them spent their weekend battling back the suggestion that their boss engaged in shady tactics to take down Trump. Obama\u2019s former foreign policy spokesman Ben Rhodes sprang into action on Twitter, directing a series of challenges to Trump\u2019s statements. \u201cNo President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, challenging Trump. He also denounced Trump\u2019s assertion that a lawyer could make a case that Obama was wiretapping his phones. \u201cNo. They couldn\u2019t. Only a liar could do that,\u201d he replied. Rhodes appeared disturbed that the pundits had lauded Trump\u2019s speech to Congress earlier in the week, suggesting that they were part of the problem and shaming them for their assessment. \u201cDear Pundits who lauded his speech. Is it still \u2018presidential\u2019 to call your dignified predecessor \u2018Bad (or sick) guy! \u2019\u201d he asked. Rhodes, who famously bragged about creating an \u201cecho chamber\u201d to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public, was deep in the process of creating a new one as Trump\u2019s claims rocketed through the news. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a campaign anymore. WH needs to explain what\u2019s going on with these repeated blatant lies about a matter of justice and natsec,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s lying no matter what \u20183 people with direct knowledge\u2019 say. This isn\u2019t he said   he said. Obama did not order a wiretap. That is a fact. \u201d \u201cThis seems \u2018nutts,\u2019\u201d Obama\u2019s former campaign chief David Axelrod chimed in on Twitter. \u201cFrantic way in which Donald Trump is kicking up dust only adds to suspicions and the need for full public reckoning. If there were the wiretap Donald Trump loudly alleges, such an extraordinary warrant would only have been OKed by a court for a reason. \u201d Former Obama speechwriters Jon Lovett and Jon Favreau, who recently launched a \u201cCrooked Media\u201d left wing media outlet, immediately launched a series of snarky messages on Twitter. \u201cThey said Trump was presidential on Tuesday,\u201d Lovett wrote on Twitter. \u201cNixon got weird at night. Trump wakes up angry. \u201d He directed his angry followers on Twitter to question members of Congress. \u201cImportant also to direct your anger at the Republicans in Congress who have enabled and apologized for this awful devious moron,\u201d he wrote. Obama former senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer also questioned Republicans for their failure to denounce Trump\u2019s accusations. \u201cHave any elected Republicans had the courage to speak out against Trump\u2019s deeply, deranged tweets this morning?\u201d he asked. Other Obama staffers were still reacting to initial accusations. \u201cJesus, I can\u2019t sleep until 8am on Saturday anymore?\u201d complained Favreau\\u200f on Twitter on Saturday. After Obama\u2019s statement was released, Favreau asserted that the former president never denied any wiretapping of Trump Tower, suggesting that Trump was guilty. \u201cI\u2019d be careful about reporting that Obama said there was no wiretapping. Statement just said that neither he nor the WH ordered it,\u201d he wrote. Other staffers reacted with incredulity. \u201cWhy would Obama decide close out his presidency by illegally wiretapping a buffoon that everyone thought was going to lose in a landslide?\u201d questioned Tommy Vietor, Obama\u2019s former National Security Council spokesman. Citing a report from CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asserting that Trump\u2019s claim came from a Breitbart News story, Vietor added,\u201dJake confirms what we all assumed. Trump shares conspiracies with all the forethought of your crazy uncle on Facebook. \u201d Favreau quickly slipped into gallows humor as the afternoon wore on. \u201cBy tomorrow morning, the party line will be that Obama personally bugged Trump Tower while disguised as the cable guy,\u201d he wrote, and added, \u201cI just learned that Trump robbed a bank. And I have exactly as much evidence for that claim as Trump does that Obama tapped his phone. \u201d \u201cWiretap birtherism is not a governing strategy,\u201d Rhodes replied, citing Favreau\u2019s tweet. On Sunday, former White House press secretary Josh Earnest went on ABC\u2019s This Week to deny the allegations and raise more questions about Trump\u2019s involvement in Russia. \u201cThe bigger the scandal, the more outrageous the tweet,\u201d he said as he joined the show with Martha Raddatz. Earnest stoked the fires of speculation surrounding Trump\u2019s campaign communications with the Russians. \u201cIt is almost like a Russian novel to try to keep up with all these conversations,\u201d Earnest said, citing multiple incidents of Trump campaign officials coming into contact with representatives of the Russian government. When pressed for details about the investigation, Earnest feigned ignorance, pointing out that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any details but repeated that Obama did not meddle with the investigation. \u201cHere\u2019s the simple answer to that question, is, Martha, I don\u2019t know and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m no longer in government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, even when I was in government, I was not in a position of being regularly briefed on an FBI criminal or counterintelligence investigation. \u201d But as the day wore on, the team appeared increasingly frustrated that Trump\u2019s narrative was taking hold. \u201cNeeds to be repeated: this is not he     it\u2019s   Obama didn\u2019t do what Trump said. Trump lied about it and offered no proof,\u201d Rhodes urged on Twitter. \u201c[F]or the MILLIONTH TIME, the White House doesn\u2019t interfere in independent investigations,\u201d Favreau complained in response to the former United States director of National Intelligence\u2019s denial of the existence of a wiretap on Trump Tower in an interview on Meet the Press. The group, who maintained discipline during the Obama administration, appeared to enjoy their new found freedom to defend their boss and detract from his successor. The squad began cynically floating their own conspiracy theories with a thread of gallows humor. \u201cWhat did you know and when did you know it about Trump lying about where Obama was born, when he founded ISIL, ordering wiretaps?\u201d Rhodes joked to Favreau, who promoted his upcoming podcast about the fiasco. Citing a claim from Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Cory Lewandowski, Rhodes mockingly added that \u201cthe Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy\u201d joined Obama by listening into a meeting between the Russian ambassador and Sen. Jeff Sessions. \u201cRemember that time Valerie and I took the space shuttle to the moon to get the forged birth certificate?\u201d he wrote to Favreau and Feiffer. \u201cDo you even know how many Mass voters I drove to NH on Election Day?\u201d replied Favreau, citing another one of Trump\u2019s claims of voter fraud. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but I worked with Ted Cruz\u2019s dad to kill JFK,\u201d joked Feiffer. \u201cMy last act on the job was using massive amounts of Iranian invisible ink to make Trump inauguration crowds disappear,\u201d Rhodes continued.'"}, "time": 1742564247.2820783}
