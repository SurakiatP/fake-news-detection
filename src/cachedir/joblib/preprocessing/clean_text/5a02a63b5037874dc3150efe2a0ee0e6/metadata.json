But before Mr. Harvey was off the premises, he unexpectedly revived a recent controversy over his comments about Asian men. After the meeting, Mr. Trump and Mr. Harvey briefly appeared together in the lobby. When Mr. Trump left, Mr. Harvey said they had discussed ways he could work with Ben Carson, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Harvey has spoken openly in the past of being homeless as an adult while struggling to start his comedy career, though he gave no reason on Friday for why he was consulted on housing affairs. Mr. Harvey said he was invited a week ago by \u201cboth transition teams,\u201d referring to representatives of President Obama and Mr. Trump, and emphasized that the visit was informal. \u201cWell, you know it\u2019s not my jump into politics,\u201d Mr. Harvey said. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna pass a background check. It\u2019s just me following orders from my friend President Obama who said, \u2018Steve, you gotta,\u2019 as he told everybody, \u2018get out from behind your computer, stop tweeting and texting and get out there and sit down and talk. \u2019\u201d The Trump team confirmed the invitation. The White House did not comment. Mr. Harvey announced his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton, last March in the presidential primaries. In September, during an interview with her on \u201cThe Steve Harvey Morning Show\u201d on iHeartRadio, he said: \u201cShe\u2019s a mother, she\u2019s a grandmother, and we\u2019re going to put her back in the White House, just flat out. Simply put. \u201d This was just the latest     crossover for Mr. Trump during his transition. Last month the   surprised reporters at Trump Tower by posing for photographs in the lobby with Kanye West. For Mr. Harvey\u2019s part, he said that the incoming president was \u201ca great guy\u201d and \u201cgenuine. \u201d He deflected questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s history of questionable comments regarding race from the campaign trail, and was diplomatic about his doubts about Mr. Trump. \u201cYou don\u2019t kill it with one conversation, but you can start it with the conversation,\u201d Mr. Harvey said. \u201cSo, you know, a lot about what people say, \u2018Now, well, it\u2019s time to see what you do.\u2019 And he said he wanted to do something. \u201d Mr. Harvey also mentioned a controversy in which, during his television show last week, he mocked the dating skills of Asian men. At Trump Tower, Mr. Harvey said, unprompted, that he hadn\u2019t laughed recently as a result of the controversy. \u201cI ain\u2019t been laughing that much over the past few days,\u201d Mr. Harvey said. \u201cThey\u2019re kinda beating me up on the internet right now for no reason. But, you know, that\u2019s life, ain\u2019t it?\u201d After the meeting, Mr. Harvey put out a message on Twitter, saying that he found Mr. Trump \u201ccongenial and sincere\u201d and that he would \u201csit with him anytime. \u201d Here are some edited excerpts from Mr. Harvey\u2019s conversation with reporters in Trump Tower: REPORTER: There have been a lot of doubts about this administration about race. Jeff Sessions, his record in Alabama, some of the things the   said during the campaign about the inner cities. Are your doubts fully gone or are you going to still try and work them out? STEVE HARVEY: Well, I mean, you know, look, you don\u2019t kill it with one conversation, but you can start it with the conversation. So, you know, a lot about what people say, now, well, it\u2019s time to see what you do. And he said he wanted to do something. You can\u2019t beat better than that. You know, and so, we\u2019re gonna see. I\u2019ve been put in contact with Ben Carson, which was great, I spoke with him. And so, we\u2019re gonna get some things started, and they have a plan for the inner cities but they need help. And so, that\u2019s why they called me. So we\u2019ll see what I can do. REPORTER: Do you have any lingering things you still want to talk further about, that you\u2019re still concerned about, you haven\u2019t heard quite what you wanted to hear yet? HARVEY: Well, I mean for this, we got off to a great start. I think it could be the beginning of something. For them to invite me here to talk about a specific problem and thought that I might be able to help  \u2014   I know I got a big radio show, I got a lot of people listening every morning. So I\u2019ve always been concerned about inner city problems because they\u2019re huge. My mentoring problem, excuse me, my mentoring program has been a part of this type of  \u2014   and that\u2019s what I want to see happen. And they were spot on with it. And Ben Carson got on the phone. I met with him over the phone today, but I sat with   Trump and we laughed a little bit. I ain\u2019t been laughing that much over the past few days. They\u2019re kinda beating me up on the internet right now for no reason. But, you know, that\u2019s life, ain\u2019t it? REPORTER: What did you laugh over? HARVEY: Well we talked about golf. We laughed about my score in golf, his score in golf, we talked about some of the friends that we have in common. Mark Burnett. Talked about TV shows. Things like that. He\u2019s a fan. So he\u2019s seen it. I met his daughter, she was very sweet. So I think we\u2019re off to a good start.'"}, "time": 1742561642.7507212}
