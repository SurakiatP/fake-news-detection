I bet Huma Abedin is kicking herself for not dumping him earlier. The FBI Announcement \\nOn October 28, 2016, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the Bureau had learned of new emails that might be relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of an unauthorized primate email server. \\nThe FBI planned to review the emails to determine whether they were relevant to the Clinton case and, if so, how. Comey stated that the agency learned of the emails in an unrelated criminal case, which he did not identify. \\nNaturally, the news media jumped the gun and concluded that the Clinton investigation was back on. And just as naturally, the truth was not so simple. JUST IN: FBI Director informs Congress Hillary Clinton email investigation is back on. pic.twitter.com/2p4iAAYH97 \\n\u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 28, 2016 Weiner and Clinton Emails? \\nAs it turns out, the emails that concerned the FBI were found on a device owned by Anthony Weiner. Yes, that Anthony Weiner, the one who couldn\u2019t keep from sexting on his cell phone. \\nHe is the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s Chief of Staff when she was Secretary of State. Abedin remains one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides. Abedin announced that the couple were separating after his latest sexting scandal. \\nAccording to the New York Times , the FBI was investigating text messages that Weiner allegedly sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. In that investigation, the FBI examined the devices and computers that Weiner used. One of the devices also contained emails that the FBI determined might be related to the investigation into Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails. Not A Reopening \\n  candidate Donald Trump claims that Comey\u2019s letter indicates that the entire investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server is back on. They\u2019re salivating over the possibility that Clinton\u2019s campaign could go down in flames. However, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. \\nBack in July, Comey testified before Congress that the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server was complete and the agency did not recommend that anyone be charged criminally. He also said that Clinton had been very careless with classified information. \\nHis October 28 letter informs Congress that the FBI will examine the emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer to determine whether they contain classified information. Comey doesn\u2019t know how long it will take or what he will find. What Remains The Same \\nStill, it\u2019s highly unlikely that any new information would change the ultimate outcome of the investigation. After all, Comey said back in July that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against Clinton without evidence that she either intentionally or recklessly shared classified information. \\nDoes anyone really think that the evidence will appear on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer? \\nWatch this news clip for more information : \\nFeatured Image Via U.S. Dept.
