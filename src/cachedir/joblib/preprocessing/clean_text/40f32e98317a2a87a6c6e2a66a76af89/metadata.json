[\u201cThe church really doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Duterte said during a speech at an event commemorating the anniversary of a local medical center in northern Nueva Ecija province. \u201cThey know [the drug problem] they know that it is worst, and yet they say \u2018extrajudicial killing,\u2019\u201d he told the audience, with a wag of the finger meant to symbolize the church\u2019s disapproval.  \u201cWhen a person is high, they really put up a fight. So some priests should take shabu so they understand,\u201d Duterte recommended. \u201cI recommend one or two of the bishops [do it] too. \u201d \u201cWhat is really raging in my heart is that you [drug traffickers] are making so many slaves, millions of them, in my country. I could not accept that,\u201d Duterte told the audience. \u201cHonestly, I could not allow that. They are slaves to a chemical and making the people very rich. \u201d \u201cThe killing? It will not stop,\u201d he promised. Duterte also challenged priests on their piety. \u201cWe\u2019re the same, with two, three wives. Don\u2019t get me started  \u2014   all the hypocrisy,\u201d Duterte lamented, alluding to his own multiple marriages. The challenge to priests to use methamphetamine, a highly dangerous drug, comes at an unusually friendly moment in relations between the Philippine head of state and the Catholic church. While Duterte himself is Catholic, as is more than 80 percent of his country, he has long been at odds with the Vatican. As a candidate, he prompted criticism for calling Pope Francis the \u201cson of a whore\u201d in a rant about Manila\u2019s traffic woes during the pontiff\u2019s 2015 visit. Duterte subsequently promised to visit the Vatican and personally apologize for the remarks. This week, however, Pope Francis blessed Duterte from afar, receiving envoy Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza and blessing the nation of the Philippines before the Vatican moderates peace talks with radical leftist groups in the country. Dureza handed Pope Francis a letter from Duterte, whose contents were private, except for the first page, which conveyed a message of \u201cprofound respect. \u201d Duterte\u2019s call for clergy to use illegal drugs closely followed the exchange with Pope Francis. Priests in the Philippines have begun to loudly protest Duterte\u2019s policies against drug traffickers. \u201cMoral norms are being violated and so now is the time for the Church to speak up,\u201d Jerome Secillano, public affairs chief for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, said this week. Another bishop, Teodoro Bacani, referred to the drug war as a \u201cbringer of death. \u201d Duterte won the presidency on a campaign promise to eradicate drug abuse from the Philippines, particularly targeting the use of \u201cshabu. \u201d In 2015, government estimates put the availability of shabu at 90 percent of neighborhoods in Manila, according to a Vice report from that year. Manila estimates that up to four million people are addicted to drugs or involved in the drug trade nationwide. According to the U. S. National Institute of Drug Abuse, use of methamphetamine can trigger \u201ca number of psychotic features, including paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, and delusions\u201d that can last for \u201cmonths\u201d after quitting the drug. The drug also causes \u201csevere structural and functional changes in areas of the brain associated with emotion and memory,\u201d and withdrawal from \u201cshabu\u201d can also trigger violent, erratic behavior. As of January, the Philippine government estimates that more than 6, 000 people have been killed in relation to   operations since Duterte took office, and more than 60 percent of these died as a result of an extrajudicial killing. An excess of one million people have surrendered to police to avoid being killed, and nearly 900 kilograms of \u201cshabu\u201d have been seized in police raids.'"}, "time": 1742562304.9088185}
