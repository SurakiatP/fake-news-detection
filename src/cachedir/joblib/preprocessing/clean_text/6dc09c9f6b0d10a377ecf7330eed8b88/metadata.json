Soon the ropes  \u2014   and her orange knee socks  \u2014   were a blur as she jumped faster and faster in a cavernous gymnasium echoing with her teammates\u2019 encouragement. \u201cKnees up!\u201d \u201cPush!\u201d Armani, 13, and her teammates were practicing competitive double dutch, the schoolyard game that was adopted and perfected by black girls in urban American communities after World War II. In recent decades, double dutch has evolved into a competitive sport, complete with rules, score sheets and tournaments. But it has also fallen out of favor in the neighborhoods where it was born and once flourished. \u201cI\u2019m one of the only kids who does double dutch in my school,\u201d said Armani, a member of Stan\u2019s Pepper Steppers, a   club, who lives in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. But even as double dutch has declined in popularity in New York City and across the United States, its appeal has surged beyond the country\u2019s borders, with the number of teams from abroad soaring and many of them beating American teams at a sport that was invented here. Perhaps nothing illustrates double dutch\u2019s international spread as much as the Double Dutch Holiday Classic, an annual tournament at the Apollo Theater in Harlem that bills itself as the Super Bowl of double dutch and will have its 25th anniversary on Sunday. In addition to teams from Queens, Brooklyn, Connecticut and South Carolina, there will be competitors from France and Japan. \u201cThe Double Dutch Classic is a perfect example of what\u2019s happened,\u201d said Kyra Gaunt, a professor of sociology and anthropology at Baruch College and author of \u201cThe Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes From   to  . \u201d \u201cFor the last 15 years, almost every freestyle competition has been won by groups that are outside the United States. \u201d As Stan\u2019s Pepper Steppers were practicing Wednesday night in a community center in Queens, five teams from Japan were aboard a   flight to New York. On Thursday, a Japanese team called Big Up, still   rehearsed in Central Park for this weekend\u2019s tournament, the Midtown skyline looming behind them. While the Queens team is known for its swiftness  \u2014   members hold various speed records  \u2014   Japan\u2019s competitors are renowned for their choreographed,   style. Two of the five members of the coed team Big Up, including Koichiro Sugawa, were trained as dancers. Mr. Sugawa, 21, first tried double dutch when he began college. \u201cI simply thought it was cool,\u201d he said. The organizer of the Japanese trip, Jun Haratake, was a competitor in high school and then at his   university in Tokyo, where the double dutch club had 100 members. Now 36, Mr. Haratake is the director and   of the Japan Double Dutch Association, a nonprofit organization. From 2004 to 2008, Mr. Haratake studied English in New York and worked as a physical education teacher in a Japanese school. He recalls taking the subway to the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and joining teenage girls in   jam sessions  \u2014   akin to a golfer traveling to St. Andrews in Scotland. Double dutch, he said, is still ascendant in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s continuing to grow in popularity,\u201d he said. In New York City, its transformation into a competitive sport started in the 1970s, when a former police sergeant in Harlem, David A. Walker, decided that girls needed a way to channel their athletic skill. He founded the National Double Dutch League, a nonprofit group that sponsors the annual tournament at the Apollo. He also developed rules and worked with the city\u2019s schools to incorporate double dutch into gym classes and intramural programs. \u201cIn the 1970s, there were not a lot of programs for girls,\u201d said Lauren Walker, Mr. Walker\u2019s daughter, who assumed leadership of the league after his death in 2008. \u201cBoys had baseball, basketball and football. My father saw some girls jumping double dutch in a schoolyard one day and said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s turn an urban activity into an actual sport. \u2019\u201d In 2009, the city\u2019s Department of Education made double dutch a varsity sport in nearly a dozen high schools, mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods like   and Harlem. The idea was to increase the number of students, girls in particular, who participate in competitive sports. Yet despite the imprimatur of school officials, and clubs like Stan\u2019s Pepper Steppers, double dutch veterans and observers of black youth say the activity has slowly lost its appeal as a spontaneous form of play. They blame the lure of social media and video games. \u201cBack in the day, there were no computers,\u201d Ms. Walker said. \u201cKids are just not as physically active anymore. \u201d Dr. Gaunt, who is an ethnomusicologist and social media researcher, agreed. \u201cMost girls spend most of their time on Instagram or Tumblr, or with games online, rather than outside,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s true across all demographic groups. But double dutch is a street sport. It\u2019s so common now to meet    girls who have never  . That wasn\u2019t the case 20 years ago. \u201d But in countries from Latin America to Asia, the sport has been embraced as part of a love affair with   culture. (The impresario Malcolm McLaren put it on the map as far back as 1983 with his hit song \u201cDouble Dutch. \u201d) Since the 1980s, double dutch organizations and competitions have emerged across the globe. In the last decade in Europe, championship tournaments have been held in Denmark, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. In Japan, it has spread though clubs in high schools and colleges. Mr. Haratake said that at least half of the members of his university\u2019s double dutch club were studying physical education, adding that they would most likely spread the sport as future teachers. But double dutch still casts a spell on some teenagers in New York  \u2014   mostly girls, but the occasional boy, too. Young competitors say it combines art and athleticism and also improves their performance in other sports. Armani Graves, for example, plays flag football and runs track. \u201cI\u2019m one of the fastest runners in my school because of double dutch,\u201d she said. During practice, Javon Langston, 14, a member of the Pepper Steppers, had just pulled off a series of tricks inside the swirling ropes, including an aerial, a   and a flip, and he did not get tangled. \u201cI like the freestyle the most because it shows your creativity,\u201d he said modestly. His mother, Rene\u00e9 Langston, nodded her approval. \u201cIt keeps him positive and active and off the streets,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has definitely made him a better young adult. \u201d Dr. Gaunt lamented that there weren\u2019t more funds available to allow the city\u2019s double dutch champions to travel to international competitions. \u201cThe girls here who jump don\u2019t get to go to Morocco and France and Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the teams in Far Rockaway and Brooklyn don\u2019t have that kind of money. So the descendants of the culture from which double dutch emerged do not have the same resources to compete. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563193.5057771}
