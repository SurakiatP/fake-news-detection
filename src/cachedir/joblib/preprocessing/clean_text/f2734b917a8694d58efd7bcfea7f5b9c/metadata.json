This co-worker has lots of thoughts . For example, they wrote this block, which is supposed to replace certain characters with some other characters. sbyte sbCount = 0; // set value of new field content to old value sNewFieldContent = sFieldContent; while (rFieldIdentifierRegex.Match(sNewFieldContent).Success) { // for security reasons if (++sbCount > 10) break; // get identifier and name string sActFieldSymbol = rFieldIdentifierRegex.Match(sNewFieldContent).Groups[1].Value; string sActFieldName = rFieldIdentifierRegex.Match(sNewFieldContent).Groups[2].Value; string sActFieldIdentifier = sActFieldSymbol + sActFieldName; // default value for unknown fields is an empty string string sValue = \"\"; [... calculate actual replacement value ...] // replace value for placeholder in new field content sNewFieldContent = sNewFieldContent.Replace(sActFieldIdentifier, sValue); } \\nAs Florian puts it: \\nHaving more matches than 10 inside one line is obviously a security risk (it isn\u2019t) and must be prohibited (it mustn\u2019t) because that would cause erroneous behavior in the application (it doesn\u2019t).
