S. \u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201cit will hurt for the endurance of a year, two years, whatever, while the administration is there. \u201d  Kerry said, \u201cTake Iran for instance. If the United States were to decide suddenly, and say \u2018hey we are not going to pursue this,\u2019 and so forth, I bet you  \u2014  I haven\u2019t talked to all of them  \u2014   but I\u2019ll bet you that our friends and allies who negotiated this will get together, and that Russia, China, Germany, France, and Britain will say, \u2018you know what, this is a good deal. We\u2019re going to keep it.\u2019 And Iran will keep it. And we\u2019ll have made ourselves the odd person out. We\u2019ll have injured our own credibility in, conceivably, an irreparable way.

And it will hurt for the endurance of a year, two years, whatever, while the administration is there.

I didn\u2019t say how active. \u201d (  Business Insider) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561928.5993042}
