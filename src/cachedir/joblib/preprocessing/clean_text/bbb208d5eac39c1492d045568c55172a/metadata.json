A man walks in off the street, opens a portfolio of drawings, and there, mixed in with the jumble of routine   items, is a   work by Leonardo da Vinci. And that, more or less, is what happened to Thadd\u00e9e Prate, director of old master pictures at the Tajan auction house here, which is to announce on Monday the discovery of a drawing that a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art says is by Leonardo, the Renaissance genius and master draftsman. Tajan values the work at 15 million euros, or about $15. 8 million. On Thursday, this reporter was ushered into Tajan\u2019s private viewing room, where the drawing, of the martyred St. Sebastian, about 7\u00bd inches by 5 inches, stood resplendent in an Italian Renaissance gold frame on an old wooden easel. In March, Mr. Prate recalled being \u201cin a bit of a rush\u201d when a retired doctor visited Tajan with 14 unframed drawings that had been collected by his bibliophile father. (The owner\u2019s name and residence somewhere in \u201ccentral France\u201d remain a closely guarded secret, at his request.) Mr. Prate spotted a vigorous    study of St. Sebastian tied to a tree, inscribed on the mount \u201cMichelange\u201d (Michelangelo). \u201cI had a sense that it was an interesting   drawing that required more work,\u201d said the elegantly suited Mr. Prate, speaking in the boardroom of Tajan\u2019s Art Deco premises, near the Paris Opera. Mr. Prate, 55, asked for a second opinion from Patrick de Bayser, an independent dealer and adviser in old master drawings, who examined the St. Sebastian in Paris. Mr. de Bayser asked, \u201cHave you seen the drawing is by a   artist?\u201d (Leonardo was  .) He also discovered two smaller scientific drawings on the back of the sheet. These diagrammatic studies of candlelight were accompanied by notes written in a minute, Italian Renaissance    hand. The two men looked at each other. \u201cI said, \u2018You can\u2019t believe this is by Leonardo? \u2019\u201d Mr. Prate recalls. \u201cBut that would have been so incredible. \u201d Tajan reached out to New York for a third, definitive view from Carmen C. Bambach, a curator of Italian and Spanish drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dr. Bambach was an organizer of the Met\u2019s 2003 exhibition \u201cLeonardo da Vinci, Master Draftsman,\u201d the first in America to take a comprehensive chronological overview of the artist\u2019s works on paper. That show included two studies, from museums in Hamburg, Germany, and Bayonne, France, that related to the \u201ceight St. Sebastians\u201d listed by Leonardo in his \u201cCodex Atlanticus\u201d sketch and notebooks, preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan. \u201cMy eyes jumped out of their sockets,\u201d Dr. Bambach said in a telephone interview, remembering her first sight of the drawing in Paris with Mr. de Bayser on the last day of March. \u201cIt exactly complemented the Hamburg St. Sebastian,\u201d she added, referring to how that    study of the saint tied to a tree also included inscribed optical studies on the reverse side, and to how the handwriting of the inscription was consistent in both   drawings. \u201cThe attribution is quite incontestable,\u201d Dr. Bambach said, even though the drawing has no    ownership history. \u201cWhat we have here is an    case. It\u2019s an exciting discovery. \u201d In Dr. Bambach\u2019s view, the newly discovered drawing is the most highly developed and attractive of the three known studies associated with what may have been a lost painting of St. Sebastian. Unlike its monochromatic Hamburg companion, the Paris St. Sebastian is drawn in two shades of ink, features several alterations to the pose and has a mountainous landscape in the background. \u201cMy heart will always pound when I think about that drawing,\u201d Dr. Bambach said. \u201cIt has so many changes of ideas, so much energy in the way he explores the figure. It has a furious spontaneity. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like glancing over his shoulder,\u201d she said of Leonardo. Dr. Bambach estimates the drawing\u2019s date at 1482 to 1485, during the early phase of Leonardo\u2019s period in Milan, when he painted his first version of \u201cThe Virgin of the Rocks,\u201d now in the Louvre. (The Met said it had no agreement with the auction house to buy or to show the artwork.) According to Dr. Bambach, the drawing  \u2014   which she hopes will be bought by a French museum  \u2014   represents the first \u201cLeonardo, full stop\u201d discovery (as she put it) in this medium since 2000, when Sotheby\u2019s in London offered a slighter sheet from around 1506 to 1508 that had black chalk and pen studies of Hercules and whirlpools. It failed to sell against a low estimate of 400, 000 pounds, or what was then about $600, 000, but sold later for about $550, 000. The drawing (also attributed by Dr. Bambach) is now jointly owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York collector Leon Black and his wife, Debra Ressler. As for a     profile portrait of a young woman, known as \u201cLa Bella Principessa,\u201d which eight years ago was valued by the London dealer Simon Dickinson at as much as $150 million, Dr. Bambach commented, \u201cIt does not look like a Leonardo. \u201d A painter, sculptor, architect, scientist and inventor of seemingly limitless ambition (if not finished execution) Leonardo ( ) most formidably embodies the notion of universal genius. This reputation has been translated into formidable financial value for the few of his works that have come up for sale. In 1994, Bill Gates paid $30. 8 million at Christie\u2019s for the \u201cCodex Hammer\u201d notebook, containing 300 drawings and scientific writings. More controversially, in 2013 the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev bought Leonardo\u2019s painting \u201cChrist as Salvator Mundi,\u201d circa 1499, for $127. 5 million from the Swiss businessman and dealer Yves Bouvier, who had recently bought it for $80 million from a consortium of dealers. The current high for a Leonardo drawing sold at auction is $11. 5 million, at Christie\u2019s in 2001, for a silverpoint study of a horse and rider. In September, Mr. Prate and Nicolas de Moustier, director general of the auction house, drove to an undisclosed part of France to deliver the good news to their client. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not shocked?\u201d Mr. Prate recalls asking. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased,\u201d the owner calmly replied. \u201cBut I have other interests in life other than money. \u201d Curators from the Louvre inspected the Tajan drawing in October, without, as usual, being drawn into any official pronouncement. France has the option of declaring the work a \u201cnational treasure\u201d to stop its export. The government would then have 30 months to offer a \u201cfair international market value\u201d for the drawing, according to rules protecting French heritage. Alternatively, it can issue the work a passport, allowing its sale globally, which Rodica Seward, Tajan\u2019s owner, hopes will happen. \u201cThis reinforces Tajan\u2019s reputation as a   boutique auction house,\u201d Ms. Seward, a   United States citizen, said in her boardroom here, seated behind a desk that she designed. Trained as an architect before becoming a banker for 20 years, she bought Tajan in 2003. \u201cMy friends thought I was mad,\u201d Ms. Seward said. But they might not have thought her so mad if they had had the chance to walk with her and Mr. Prate through Tajan\u2019s   private viewing room, where the   St. Sebastian stood in its Renaissance gold frame. \u201cIf only it could speak,\u201d said an awed Mr. Prate.'"}, "time": 1742563226.0820127}
