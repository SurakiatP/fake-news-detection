aggressive form monetary stimulus government power print money try spur growth get inflation higher buzz bank japan could move direction elect take small action bank say would comprehensive review policy month come could presage coordination bank japanese government idea base metaphor use renowned economist milton friedman nearly five decade ago give new life century ben bernanke also policy echo great catastrophe economic history regardless anything japanese central bank fall global economys deflationary doldrum continue expect discussion around metaphorical helicopter get loud say desperate time demand desperate measure helicopter money monetary policy desperation look like helicopter money normally say central bank like federal reserve european central bank create money thin air buy bond asset bank use money electronic accounting entry bank spread money economy mechanism not effective reason banking system not work well example central bank want get money circulate economy anyway thought experiment mr friedman deal paper title optimum quantity money offer intentionally absurd hypothetical let we suppose one day helicopter fly community drop additional bill sky course hastily collect member community money float around use chase amount good service would inevitably cause price rise word would bring high inflation wait would anybody want high inflation deflation fall price deeply damaging economy mr friedmans influential analysis great depression happen focus primarily monetary phenomenon argue central bank fail supply enough money thus allow devastating deflation take hold price fall make consumer business reluctant spend anything want buy cheap tomorrow make debt onerous pay back money valuable next day condition fuel vicious spiral economic weakness create fall price create economic weakness arguably much advanced world especially japan eurozone experience mild version right bank japan european central bank deploy series increasingly aggressive tool try reverse bank japan example pledge whatever take get inflation percent target buy trillion yen asset try make happen instead key price measure fall percent year end may

thin air give government government cut taxis mail check every citizen would substantive ground amount thing mr friedmans mythical helicopter drop mr bernanke ignore fed press officer recommendation use helicopter reference speech accord memoir fear would seem flippant sure enough earn nickname helicopter ben critic prime example central banker rarely use colorful language different central bank year quantitative easing policy crucial difference q e policy indeed consist central bank use money create thin air buy government bond effect print money fund government deficit q e central bank buy asset government pay back fed example trillion treasury security balance sheet mature government repay money course fed could plow money back new bond depend assessment whether time withdraw money economy contrast version helicopter money analyst discuss japan country deal deflation trap involve different type transaction key possibility government issue perpetual bond percent interest rate central bank buy promise hold onto forever may sound technical think way quantitative easing akin rich uncle make loan favorable term make clear make interest payment pay money back one day helicopter money happen rich uncle make loan say not pay interest never pay back practical purpose gift loan whatever bookkeeping technically say likely spend money uncle give abandon second situation first government likely spread money around indeed want liberal definition could argue united states experience form helicopter money fed quantitative easing congress enact fiscal stimulus package among thing temporarily reduce payroll taxis not fit classic definition q e program probably reduce interest rate boost stock price still acquire bond government would need repay one way another keep talk government think talk central bank modern democracy division power central bank wall political concern grant authority money supply buy sell asset try maintain stable inflation growth democratic institution like congress parliament power spend money outright common misunderstanding era bank bailout q e fed not spend money conventional sense rather buy asset would earn return sell allow mature fed judge appropriate form helicopter money work would need form spend public work mass distribution fund citizen tax cut would amount government continue normal government spending without either raise taxis pay increase public debt propose central bank grant authority distribute money directly citizen likely illegal country change law would grant power unelected body already extremely powerful nothing stop elect representative coordinate central banker process central bank create money democratic institution spend not anyone do yet potentially risky technical complication carry print money thin air fund government spending not sterling history happen weimar germany early hyperinflation run rampant happen zimbabwe first part century happen venezuela right example show easily thing spiral control government finance use ability create money boost inflation tend also increase interest rate hence borrow cost government may need yet newly print money fund next year consequence thing spiral control stark money lose role store value commerce grind halt international monetary fund project venezuela inflation percent year percent next year one point trillion zimbabwe dollar bill reportedly not enough buy bus ticket countrys capital advanced economy spend decade write law building tradition keep thing like happen one core principle central bank remain independent politic fund government discussion helicopter money boil whether deflationary cycle advanced economy like japan sufficiently problematic abandon tradition try jolt economy level even official decide justify technical reason way central bank work influence money supply set target interest rate could reduce eliminate effectiveness q e program mr bernanke explain concern recent blog post go happen never say never decade ago one could imagine major central bank would deploy quantitative easing negative interest rate world live japan analyst think likely combination new fiscal stimulus government pair yet q e central bank perhaps explicitly coordinate way amount soft form policy even open question much really differ policy already place like bond buying central bank combine fiscal stimulus combine
