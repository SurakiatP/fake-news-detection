Black Agenda Radio for Week of Nov 14, 2016 Submitted by Nellie Bailey a... on Mon, 11/14/2016 - 21:23 2016 elections Cornel West: Class Becoming \u201cMuch More Central\u201d \\n\u201cWe are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era,\u201d said Dr. Cornel West , the nation\u2019s most prominent Black public intellectual, assessing the import of last week\u2019s election. West backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, then endorsed the Green Party\u2019s presidential ticket. The election \u201cdid not go left-populist, following Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,\u201d he said. Instead, \u201cit went rightwing-fascist. But the neoliberal era is coming to a close and the neoliberal establishment is being exposed. The issues of class now are becoming much more central.\u201d Trump Supporters Mounted an \u201cInsurrection\u201d \\nDuboisian scholar Dr. Anthony Monteiro was among the few observers on the Left that thought Donald Trump would win at the polls. But, even he was startled at the scope of Trump\u2019s sweep. \u201cI felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but I never thought that it would become an insurrection,\u201d said Monteiro. \u201cIn a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the Clintons down that Black people had in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected with a huge Black turnout,\u201d he said. Monteiro is one of the organizers of a Conference on Political Science for Radical Times, set for December 9-10, in Philadelphia. TPP \u201cOn Its Death Bed\u201d \\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s victory, President Obama\u2019s Trans Pacific Partnership corporate rights trade deal is \u201clooking like it\u2019s on its death bed,\u201d said Kevin Zeese , of Popular Resistance. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked for five years to make TPP stand for Toxic Political Poison, and that seems to have happened,\u201d said Zeese. Trump won in \u201cthe rust belt that was destroyed by NAFTA\u201d -- Bill Clinton\u2019s jobs-exporting bill of a generation ago -- \u201cand was going to be threatened again by TPP.\u201d Zeese said Obama may make a last bid to pass TPP in the lame duck session of Congress that begins this week. Finally, a Practical Guide to Black Self-Determination \\nThe Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations adopted a 19-point Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, at a conference in Washington. The document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from Black Community Control of the Police, to Mass Black Incarceration, to Nationalization of the Banks. \u201cEverybody wants self-determination,\u201d said Coalition chairman Omali Yeshitela , \u201cbut what does it mean, practically?\u201d The 19 points give direction to the struggle. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you work on every four years,\u201d said Yeshitela. \u201cThis is something you work on every day. This is our program.\u201d \\nMargaret Kimberley , an editor and senior columnist for Black Agenda Report, told the conference: \u201cWhen we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like.\u201d Voting for \u201cyour enemies\u201d is not self-determination, and \u201cthinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination,\u201d said Kimberley. Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey. A new edition of the program airs every Monday at 11:00am ET on PRN.
