[Said Sekulow on Comey, \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly a credible witness,\u201d while pointing out several previous issues with testimony he\u2019s given that has to be corrected later.  As for what to expect now, said Sekulow, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be left alone with the President of the United States? Well, that\u2019s why you\u2019re not the FBI director. Grow up and act like an adult. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be whining testimony,\u201d added Sekulow, saying he\u2019s not sure what the intelligence community is even going to gain from the testimony. Comey is already leaking parts of his testimony and is said to not believe Trump tried to obstruct justice. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
