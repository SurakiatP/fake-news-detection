She is hated by too many progressives, because she is successful and her people are free,\u201d he said. \\nPence also said Israel\u2019s military defends the Jewish state with \u201cdecency, humanity and restraint.\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s adviser on Israel affairs, David Friedman, came to Israel for the event. He promised the crowd that if Trump were elected he would treat Israel very differently than the Obama administration. \\nHe added that Trump would make good on his promise to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \\n\u201cUnder a Trump administration there is going to be no daylight between the U.S. and the State of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are disagreements they will be handled in private as is done between close friends.\u201d \\nAccording to Friedman, some 80 percent of registered U.S. voters in Israel are expected to vote for Trump. \\nMany of the Trump supporters at the rally were sporting red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and said they believed he was the most pro-Israel candidate to lead America. \\n\u201cI\u2019m here today to show support for Donald Trump as he is standing with us, supporting us here in Israel,\u201d the Times of Israel quoted Reuven Ashenberg saying. Ashenberg, originally from Teaneck, New Jersey, now runs the Republican party\u2019s campaign in Beit Shemesh. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only candidate that\u2019s pro-Israel and we need to show him our support as we\u2019re rallying around the right choice, to help \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 and thereby helping Israel become great again as well,\u201d Ashenberg said. \\nAbe Marks, who hails from New York and now lives in Jerusalem, said his biggest concern about Hillary Clinton would be who she appoints to the Supreme Court. Her choices \u201cwill be destructive to American freedoms and the American way of life.\u201d \\nMarks admitted that while he was not completely \u201cenamored\u201d by Trump, he likes that \u201che\u2019s not part of the big boys\u2019 club.\u201d Clinton, Marks said, was \u201cunder the thumb of the New World Order\u201d and as such he\u2019s \u201cvery, very scared of her.\u201d \\nMarks added that, most crucially, Trump will fulfill his campaign pledge to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem. \\n\u201cThey all promise it, but he will actually do it. He has nothing holding him back,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563397.7935283}
