[Gianforte beat Quist by seven points in a race Democrats had hoped to turn into a referendum on Trump\u2019s first few months in office, and particularly, the unpopular Republican health care bill.   As Gianforte welcomed the president\u2019s support in the days leading up to the election, opponents hoped that Trump\u2019s alleged unpopularity would motivate the Democratic base and turn away moderates  \u2014   something they would then hope to replicate in the 2018 midterms. Democrats had also hoped that the last minute twist in which Gianforte allegedly assaulted a UK Guardian reporter  \u2014   for which Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault  \u2014   would be the nail in the coffin. But it was not to be, and an analysis by Politico\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti found that the \u201cTrump effect\u201d was the opposite of Democrats would have hoped. Noting that Gianforte had lost the governor\u2019s race in November, Debenedetti concluded that the Trump robocalls and using his campaign slogans paid off. Under a heading of \u201cTrump was an asset, not a drag,\u201d he said: For Gianforte, the biggest applause lines of his Thursday night speech came when he mentioned Trump and used his \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d slogan. Local Republicans dismissed the idea that the president could drag Gianforte to defeat as preposterous, The state\u2019s Democratic politicians had also noted Gianforte\u2019s belief in Trump. Everything I see is that Greg Gianforte is trying to make [Trump] completely   . He might have muttered his name once or twice when he was running against me and now he wants to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and says, \u2018I want to be with Trump every step of the way,\u2019\u201d said the state\u2019s Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock on Wednesday  \u2014   nearly seven months after he himself defeated Gianforte. Debenedetti noted that Quist barely talked about Trump during the campaign, possibly realizing it wasn\u2019t the best strategy to take in the solidly red Treasure State. Trump won the state in November by over 20 points. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY'"}, "time": 1742628587.827767}
