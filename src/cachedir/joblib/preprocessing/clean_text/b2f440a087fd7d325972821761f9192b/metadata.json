Phil Roe ( ) talked about his vote in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily. [Kassam observed that the Breitbart News Daily audience appeared to be leaning \u201cabout 60 percent against\u201d the AHCA because they do not see it as a full repeal of Obamacare or a bold enough step toward getting government out of the health insurance industry.  \u201cA yes vote was an obvious vote for me because the ACA is failing,\u201d said Roe, referring to Obamacare by its legislative name, the Affordable Care Act. \u201cA third of my district this coming year  \u2014   maybe more  \u2014   have no options whatsoever. We\u2019re going to be an Obamacare desert in Tennessee within a year. There\u2019s not going to be anywhere to buy insurance on the ACA. So it\u2019s failed, just like it has in Iowa, just like it is in many places across the country. \u201d  \u201cThe premiums have skyrocketed. The    have gone up. I\u2019ll give you an example locally, the hospital where I practiced for over 30 years,\u201d Rep. Roe, who is a retired medical doctor who also served in the U. S. Army Medical Corps, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large system, a   system: 9, 000 employees 60 to 70 percent of the uncollectable debt are people with insurance  \u2014   not without insurance, with insurance. Their   and    are skyrocketed, and they can\u2019t pay the bills. \u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of not doing anything,\u201d said Roe. \u201cThe Republican Study Committee asked me two terms ago to write an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, which I did, and I did it again in the last Congress. We put our ideas out there. \u201d He said the implementation of those ideas was limited by congressional rules and the large number of votes required to pass a bill. \u201cI agree with people: if I\u2019d have had my way and a magic wand, this bill would have looked differently,\u201d he conceded. \u201cThere would have been more free market principles in it. But we got as far as we could get and get the votes. \u201d  \u201cAnd by the way, that vote would have been stronger  \u2014   we were five representatives short on our side yesterday,\u201d he added. \u201cWe had five people, one out for personal reasons, and then four out in the Trump administration. People have forgotten that in the 2010 vote, the Democrats had 257, not 237, and they passed it by five votes, I believe. So it was a similar vote. Big things like this are hard to do. I understand people\u2019s frustration that it didn\u2019t go far enough. Believe me, this was a giant step, in my opinion  \u2014   positive, not negative. \u201d Kassam asked about the AHCA\u2019s potential to defund Planned Parenthood and whether such a provision has a chance of surviving in the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what the Senate does,\u201d replied Roe. \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to them. This is hard work. Look, we spent hours and hours and hours getting to where we were, getting to 216 votes with hiccups and starts. \u201d \u201cI am a   obstetrician,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019ve delivered almost 5, 000 babies in my career before I retired and ran for Congress. Money from the federal government ought to go into health care. What we decided, we have 141 federally qualified health centers that provide health care in the state of Tennessee and three Planned Parenthood clinics. So we want to put that money where health care is going on, not abortions. \u201d  \u201cThis was a   step. We\u2019ll see what the Senate does. I think most of us are very happy about that, Raheem,\u201d he said. Roe noted that Planned Parenthood provides services other than abortion. \u201cThey do sexually transmitted disease screening. They do breast exams, pap smears,\u201d he said. However, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of their clinics actually do mammograms. I think they refer those out. \u201d \u201cI know this was a big part for some people but a relatively small part of that whole package,\u201d he said of the Planned Parenthood funding issue. \u201cIn the state of Tennessee  \u2014   I got this off of the Planned Parenthood website it\u2019s not a number I\u2019m making up  \u2014    they did 918 breast exams in 2016 in the three clinics in the state of Tennessee. I saw myself, just one doctor, between three and four thousand patients a year, every year. \u201d Roe disagreed with the criticism that the AHCA merely does some \u201ctweaking\u201d of Obamacare, as Kassam put it, rather than substantially repealing the ACA. \u201cRemember, this is only the first part of this, Raheem,\u201d Roe reiterated. \u201cThis is all we could get in reconciliation, meaning it just takes 51 votes in the Senate. Again, I go back to the Senate rules. We were hamstrung because of what we could do. We passed already across state lines and association health plans. That\u2019s already been passed over to the Senate. Now, the Senate will filibuster that. \u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not saying there are not ways you can get around it and do it. Remember, we have a Secretary of HHS, Tom Price, who can also do a lot of things just executively with the stroke of a pen,\u201d he added.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do  \u2014   and I did a terrible job of this when we first debated the healthcare bill  \u2014   this part of the market we\u2019re talking about, this individual and   market, is seven percent of the entire insurance market,\u201d said Roe, adding that \u201c160 million of us get our insurance through our employer. There are already ERISA protections in there for   conditions. There is no   exclusion if you have Medicaid, which 74 million people do. \u201d  \u201cAnd by the way, this is the first major reform of Medicaid in decades, maybe since it was established,\u201d he continued. \u201cAbout 57 million people get insurance through Medicare, where there is no   condition exclusion. What we tried to do was create a market in that seven percent to reconstruct the small market. It\u2019s been destroyed by Obamacare. I mean, we have well over a third of the counties in this country, of the 3, 000 or so counties in America, that only have one choice, and that\u2019s going up every day. That market has been destroyed. This will help recreate it. \u201d Roe said there were other free   features of the Obamacare replacement bill worth praising, such as the expansion of health savings accounts.  \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he promised. \u201cLook, if I could have taken the bill I had written and passed it with 216 votes, as written, it would look different. We want to recreate a situation where doctors and patients are making choices, not bureaucrats. \u201d  \u201cIf we fail at this, if we fail with making it where it\u2019s cheaper, where more people can buy insurance, and the quality goes up, then we will have failed. I admit that fully. I think we can hit those targets, and I believe you can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my third iteration of healthcare reform. I was involved in the Tenncare reform in the nineties in Tennessee, which was a failure,\u201d Roe recalled. \u201cI wrote an editorial in 2010, Raheem, about what I thought would happen to the ACA because of what I had seen almost 20 years before, and it exactly came true. \u201d  Roe argued that Obamacare has failed, according to its own standards and goals. \u201cIt\u2019s intention was to increase access and decrease costs. Well, the costs have just gone through the roof. If we don\u2019t do something with the cost of health care in this country, nobody is going to be able to afford it,\u201d he warned.
