His comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because Mr. H\u00f6cke, a rising star in the AfD, has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism. Shouting to be heard over cheering supporters, many of whom stood, Mr. H\u00f6cke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained German politics for three generations. At times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat. Germans were \u201cthe only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,\u201d he said, referring to a memorial to murdered Jews in Berlin. He added that Germans had the \u201cmentality of a totally vanquished people. \u201d Mr. H\u00f6cke, who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head, represents the rightward flank of Alternative for Germany, an already   party. But his speech and the crowd\u2019s energetic reception of his words offer a glimpse of the relatively new party\u2019s threat to German politics. He is on the fringe, but that fringe is growing in numbers and in willingness to defy the usual restraints, to the rising alarm of Germany\u2019s establishment leaders, who on Wednesday denounced his comments. Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats and the country\u2019s vice chancellor, shot back in a Facebook post showing a banner splashed across an image of Mr. H\u00f6cke standing at a lectern, reading: \u201cTo remember the millions of victims of the Nazis is no weakness. Baiting the helpless to promote yourself is weakness. \u201d The chairman of the Green Party for the state of Saxony, J\u00fcrgen Kasek, on Twitter called for the speech to be checked for possible violations of   laws. He accused Mr. H\u00f6cke of saying things that violated the spirit of the Constitution \u201cin the style of national socialism. \u201d The Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, called the comments \u201cdeeply deplorable and fully unacceptable. \u201d Charlotte Knobloch, a former president of the council, told the newspaper Stimme Heilbronner that Mr. H\u00f6cke\u2019s speech was \u201cunbearable agitation,\u201d and she warned that \u201cthe AfD is poisoning the political culture and social debate in Germany. \u201d Mr. H\u00f6cke\u2019s comments even drew a rebuke from the chairwoman of Alternative for Germany, Frauke Petry, who said they were out of line and \u201cstraining\u201d the party. Ms. Petry and Mr. H\u00f6cke have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party, which was originally founded on an   platform. The party is polling at nearly 15 percent, ahead of some mainstream parties, for this fall\u2019s national election. Its rapid rise demonstrates that German nationalist politics can find a foothold in unexpected places, for example among educated young people like those at Tuesday\u2019s rally. Those   many in coat and tie, looked   and primly trendy. Most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top, separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of Hitler\u2019s. Mainstream parties in Germany have long eschewed   politics  \u2014   in the style of   movements  \u2014   and have avoided shows of overt nationalism. But that leaves an opening: A populist party like Alternative for Germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters. The Alternative for Germany supporters who were gathered in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in Germany. Most Germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or, just as sensitive an issue, about their national identity. The atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression, as if the act of cheering   ideas was as important, or perhaps more so, than the ideas themselves. Julian M. W\u00e4lder, a    law student, said he had initially joined the youth league of the Christian Democratic Union, the   party to which Chancellor Angela Merkel belongs. But the party did not feel like \u201creal politics,\u201d he said. Alternative for Germany, Mr. W\u00e4lder said, finally felt genuine. This is a core part of the party\u2019s message: While other parties are all the same, only Alternative for Germany really expresses the popular will. Mr. W\u00e4lder and other young attendees seemed tense  \u2014   the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the   protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies  \u2014   but they were jovial. The rally on Tuesday felt, if not like a watershed, then a glimpse of a wider, more gradual change. Calls for asserting a strong national identity are not pernicious on their own  \u2014   all nations have identities, after all  \u2014   but they remain somewhat taboo in Germany. And that taboo is precisely the point. Only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity. But that risks letting those fringes define its contours. Mr. H\u00f6cke, for instance, disavowed a famous 1985 speech by Richard von Weizsacker, then the president of Germany, that called for the Allied victory to be seen as the liberation of the German people, not as their defeat. Mr. H\u00f6cke called Mr. Weizsacker\u2019s address \u201ca speech against his own people, and not for his own people. \u201d Since 2015, when Germany received nearly a million asylum seekers, Alternative for Germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism. Establishment parties and other enemies, Mr. H\u00f6cke told the crowd, \u201care liquidating our beloved German fatherland, like a piece of soap under warm running water. But we, we beloved friends, we patriots, we will close this open tap, and we will win back our Germany, piece by piece. \u201d Yascha Mounk, a lecturer at Harvard and a fellow at the Transatlantic Academy of the German Marshall Fund, said Germany had a style of government that could leave an especially wide opening for fringe parties. Because the German parties tend to govern in a grand,   coalition, voters often see little change when parties shift in and out. Politics in Germany usually play out in quiet, polite negotiations among members of the coalition, rather than in dramatic, public clashes between competing parties. The coalition blocks fringe parties like Alternative for Germany, which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate. The crowd, at one point, chanted a line Mr. W\u00e4lder has also used: \u201cWe are the outsiders. \u201d It was a jarring moment, as many of the \u201coutsiders\u201d were young, white and wore suits and ties  \u2014   seemingly the definition of an insider in Germany. Because these young Germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity, they feel as if they are being oppressed, even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of Europe\u2019s   economies. But young and old supporters of Alternative for Germany seemed to find something at Tuesday\u2019s rally that is not common among   politics: a sense of impending victory. Not in the sense that they would oust Ms. Merkel\u2019s government this fall  \u2014   she is likely to retain power  \u2014   but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their German pride. Mr. Mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable, given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national   and for charismatic politics. That left an opening for Mr. H\u00f6cke to deliver a message \u201cbeyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of being German,\u201d Mr. Mounk added, \u201cimplying, though never quite stating outright, that defeat in 1945 was a bad thing. \u201d Mr. H\u00f6cke concluded his speech on Tuesday with a rallying call. \u201cBeloved friends, we must do little less than make history, so that there will be for us Germans, us Europeans, a future,\u201d he said, as the audience stood, cheered and chanted his name. He added, \u201cWe can make history, and we are doing it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562442.168896}
