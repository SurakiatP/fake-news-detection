Mr. Eustis, the exuberant    artistic director of the Public Theater and arguably the most admired theater executive in the country, was in his element: It was late September, opening night of a production of \u201cHamlet\u201d from the branch of the Public that takes dramas to prisons and homeless shelters. The play began. Mr. Eustis\u2019s eyes welled up. There were tears when the ghost of the dead king cries out to his son, Hamlet tears when Hamlet laments that he has \u201clost all my mirth\u201d tears through \u201cTo be or not to be,\u201d the speech in which Hamlet considers ending his life. \u201cWatch \u2018Hamlet\u2019 tonight with this in mind,\u201d Mr. Eustis had urged over dinner just before the show, seated at his regular table at the Public\u2019s restaurant, photos of his family arrayed on the shelves overhead. \u201cThree years before he wrote \u2018Hamlet,\u2019 Shakespeare\u2019s only son died. \u201d Mr. Eustis, whose theater oversees Shakespeare in the Park, had long known about the possible connection between the playwright\u2019s grief and his play, but it had new and unwanted resonance. His    son, Jack, took his own life nearly two years ago. Now, Mr. Eustis, with his family, faces the kind of   for which there can be no preparation. How to hold on and move forward at the same time. What it means to be a public figure with a private grief. How he thinks about the work he does and the shows he sees. The tragedy coincided with a time of extraordinary success in Mr. Eustis\u2019s professional life: The Public was the Off Broadway birthplace of two groundbreaking new musicals, \u201cFun Home\u201d and the     hit \u201cHamilton. \u201d Those very shows are propelled by tragic losses. But his is a life of theater, and immersing himself in theatermaking is the only path he knows to take. \u201cIt is the way I move in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like the place for me to work it out. \u201d SIX WEEKS AFTER HIS SON DIED, Mr. Eustis returned to work. He invited the Public\u2019s employees to meet him in the Library, the theater\u2019s new restaurant space, and began to talk. \u201cYou guys all know what happened, and what I\u2019m going to do now is tell you my story,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cAnd for 45 minutes, I told them the story. I said: \u2018Now this means that you know what I think. It\u2019s not a taboo subject  \u2014   we can talk about it when we need to  \u2014   but you never have to talk about it, because now we have. \u2019\u201d Mr. Eustis is burly and bearded, with a generous hug and an easy cry. Cheerleader and counselor, impresario and guru  \u2014   he will push and prod in a rehearsal room for greater clarity, deeper character, more truth. And then, come opening night, he will climb atop a bar or a table and dole out praise in poetically turned phrases that are somehow both sincere and superlative. \u201cHe cares about theater as deeply as anyone I\u2019ve ever met  \u2014   this idea that you sit in the dark with a group of strangers and something galvanizing happens,\u201d said Thomas Kail, the director of \u201cHamilton,\u201d who this season will direct his third show at the Public. \u201cThat ritual of going to the theater is just part of his ethos and his soul, and you feel like you are a part of that when you sit in the theater with him. \u201d As deft with Shakespeare as it is with contemporary drama, the nonprofit Public is a magnet for star performers (Anne Hathaway and Daniel Radcliffe, to name two) and laureled writers (coming soon: Stephen Sondheim). Its Astor Place headquarters, renovated under Mr. Eustis\u2019s watch, is alive and aglitter, night after night. Mr. Eustis\u2019s sharp sense of what works onstage and his obvious affection for artists and artistry are why the playwrights affiliated with the Public  \u2014   one of the nation\u2019s most storied theaters  \u2014   have embraced him so ardently since his arrival in 2005. Richard Nelson, whom Mr. Eustis has encouraged to pursue a stunningly intimate series of plays chronicling dinner table conversations at two family homes, describes Mr. Eustis as \u201ca life force\u201d and credits him with \u201can extraordinary sense of trust and collaboration with a playwright,   in my experience. \u201d   Parks, the Pulitzer   author of \u201c\u201d lauds Mr. Eustis for \u201ca kind of generosity that is otherworldly, that is enormous, that is spiritual. \u201d The theater world is an emotional community pain is expressed and discussed and honored. But still, figuring out how to talk about his loss has been difficult for Mr. Eustis, who ultimately agreed to answer questions about his experience, and how it affects his thinking about theater and the challenges facing the Public, in a series of interviews over the last six months. An early test came at Jack\u2019s school, Saint Ann\u2019s in Brooklyn Heights, where Mr. Eustis had been teaching a class about the Public Theater itself. Two weeks after Jack died, he decided to return to the classroom. \u201cI knew it was going to be one thing or the other  \u2014   it was either within five minutes I was going to have to get out of there, or I would find out what I did find out, which is that I loved being there, and I still feel that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids  \u2014   you could feel they wanted to be there for me, which was so moving. \u201d He has leaned heavily for support on his wife, Laurie, and daughter, Kyle. As he has turned to the theater, Laurie has taken up writing poetry, and Kyle, 25, has begun directing. \u201cLaurie and Kyle and I are struggling with this together, and the main thing we have is our support for each other,\u201d he said. The family is often at the theater together all three of them attended that \u201cHamlet\u201d opening. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how they navigated their way,\u201d said Jeanine Tesori, the \u201cFun Home\u201d composer. \u201cThey really are there to bear witness at openings and closings, often with very painful material to sit through, and yet, here they are, part of the circle. \u201d AN MP3 ARRIVED by email, hours after Jack\u2019s death. It came from   Miranda, a new arrival to the Public fold. It was a demo recording of \u201cIt\u2019s Quiet Uptown,\u201d the song from \u201cHamilton\u201d describing Alexander Hamilton, and his wife, Eliza, as they grieve the death of their    son, Philip: \u201cThere is nothing you can say,\u201d Mr. Miranda recalled thinking. \u201cAnd yet, I had a song about this. So I wrote to him saying, \u2018If this is useful, then lean on it, and, if not, delete this email. \u2019\u201d Mr. Eustis and his wife found it useful. \u201cEvery line of \u2018Quiet Uptown\u2019 feels like it\u2019s exactly correct to my experience,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cIt was the only music we listened to for a long time, and we listened to it every day, and it became a key thing for the two of us. \u201d There is a part of \u201cHamilton\u201d that Mr. Eustis still finds unbearable, in the opening number, when a rapid description of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s childhood includes the lyric \u201cMoved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide,\u201d which is choreographed with a brief pantomime of the death. \u201cFrom the moment it happened in rehearsal, I\u2019ve turned away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked at it. \u201d But Mr. Eustis and Mr. Miranda both recall something else, too: The grieving father\u2019s reaction to a line of comic relief that, in the show\u2019s libretto, is uttered by Thomas Jefferson immediately after \u201cIt\u2019s Quiet Uptown\u201d: \u201cCan we get back to politics?\u201d \u201cFor me, the beautiful thing about \u2018Quiet Uptown\u2019 is, it serves a ritualistic function  \u2014   it takes us into the grief, and then it takes us out of it,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s no other ritual that I know of, that can do that for me. \u201d Mr. Miranda still remembers hearing Mr. Eustis\u2019s instinctive response. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure that laugh forever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a big belly laugh of getting to stop crying. \u201d MR. EUSTIS NOW FACES BIG DECISIONS, about his career and his institution, a $41    operation with 170   staff members. He is wise enough to know that making those decisions while in the middle of a   tragedy is not a good idea. But still, they loom. He is midway through a contract with the Public that expires in 2018, so he must decide in the    future whether to ask the board to extend his tenure, or to do something else (he especially loves teaching, which he does regularly at the Bread Loaf School of English in Vermont and at New York University). He has enormous support. \u201cI hope he sticks around forever,\u201d said Arielle Tepper Madover, the chairwoman of the Public\u2019s board. He also has ever more ambitious dreams and is excited about seeing them through. Presenting consistently excellent work and cultivating new voices, yes, but also expanding the Public\u2019s audience. His biggest, craziest idea  \u2014   more a longstanding hope than a plan  \u2014   is to make much of the theater\u2019s programming free, knowing that free shows attract audiences younger and more diverse than those that charge for tickets. \u201cPeople who tell you that there\u2019s not economic barriers to people participating in the theater are just not telling you the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are huge economic barriers. \u201d The notion of free tickets is not as wild as it sounds the Public, of course, already makes most tickets to its summertime Shakespeare in the Park series available free. And the Public is largely financed by philanthropy, not ticket sales. The Public has begun offering free tickets to the first preview of all of its shows, and it now has plans to expand the experimentation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take another big step next season,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, if we start being able to give away our tickets for free in an indoor space, and balance our budgets, and run financially successful seasons, it will be a big earthquake in American theater. \u201d He is also pushing to extend the reach of the Public\u2019s programming, and its ethos, beyond Astor Place. He has become an evangelist for Public Works, the Labor Day weekend musicalizations of classic plays that combine a handful of professional actors with hundreds of amateur performers from across the five boroughs. Theaters in Dallas, Detroit and Seattle are adopting the program, often using productions created by the Public, but with their own casts, and Mr. Eustis, enamored of the democratic ideals implicit in the casting, and the diversity of the audiences that result, is eager to see it spread further. Joe\u2019s Pub, the Public\u2019s   nightspot, has begun producing a performance series in Houston and is about to do the same in Seattle. The Public has announced a partnership with the Donmar Warehouse, a highly regarded nonprofit in London, and is talking about what Mr. Eustis calls a possible \u201cmultilevel collaboration\u201d with the National Theater in London, which is a pioneer in presenting stage productions on cinema screens. And the Public is taking to festivals in Hong Kong and Australia Mr. Nelson\u2019s latest plays, about an upstate New York family called the Gabriels, dramatic works that Mr. Eustis believes can give global audiences insight into contemporary American life. Next: The theater, which has had considerable financial ups and downs over the years, must decide whether to initiate a major fund drive for new rehearsal facilities and more. \u201cHamilton\u201d is a help  \u2014   the theater gets 5 percent of the profits and 1 percent of the adjusted gross from the production  \u2014   but not as much as \u201cA Chorus Line\u201d was years ago, and Mr. Eustis is determined that the Public not become dependent on a single show. \u201cWhat I want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis make sure that this theater is set up so that not just its existence, but its mission, is permanent. \u201d  IMPERMANENCE, AS IT HAPPENS, turns out to be an inescapable theme in the work Mr. Eustis oversees. It\u2019s not just in \u201cHamilton,\u201d but also in \u201cFun Home,\u201d which closes with the suicide of Alison Bechdel\u2019s father, and Mr. Nelson\u2019s play this fall, \u201cWhat Did You Expect,\u201d which opens with a story about men debating whether to tell a family that its little girl has drowned. Mr. Eustis is not without a sense of humor about his theatrical appetites. Earlier this year  \u2014   arriving at the   party for \u201cHead of Passes,\u201d a play that ends with a scorching cri de coeur from a mother railing against God after the tragic death of her children  \u2014   Mr. Eustis blurted out, \u201cGet used to seeing plays like this. \u201d He finds himself marveling at the frequency of heartbreaking loss in the plays he has chosen to present. \u201cIs it just suddenly I\u2019m noticing that all of these plays that I\u2019m trying to do have this quality,\u201d he said, \u201cor have they been there and I\u2019ve just not seen it?\u201d At the same time, Mr. Eustis, who attends theater five or six nights a week, finds himself newly angered by shows that he believes present an overly rosy picture of life  \u2014   particularly on Broadway, where the triumph over tragedy is a staple. He is infuriated, he says, by \u201cnarratives that imply that children are always reunited with their parents, that dead people aren\u2019t really dead. \u201d \u201cWhat I see over and over is narratives that are absolutely lying to the audience about how life works out, and they are lying to the audience for the sole purpose of making the audience feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what art is for. \u201d \u201cThe mission that I feel like I have is to figure out how you can tell the truth about how tragic and unfair life actually is without destroying hope,\u201d he added. As the   anniversary of his son\u2019s death approaches, and a new season at the Public gets underway, Mr. Eustis is seeking hope himself. He is thrilled with the success of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d this year\u2019s Public Works endeavor pleased with the audience appetite for Mr. Nelson\u2019s Gabriels plays and looking forward to a revival of \u201cPlenty,\u201d which opens Oct. 20. One sign of change: This past spring, when \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d a   musical imagining the aftermath of a high school student\u2019s suicide, was playing Off Broadway at Second Stage, the show\u2019s director, Michael Greif, persuaded the Eustises not to come, thinking elements of the show would just be too painful. Now the show is heading to Broadway, and, at the moment, the Eustises are planning to be there opening night. Mr. Eustis said that he has also recently noticed a change in his own behavior: He has found himself straightening up and organizing his office and home. \u201cIt feels like the start of a new phase, where we\u2019re actually thinking about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cNot happy. But a step. Almost two years in. \u201d And then, trying to sum up how he is doing, he turned, as he always does, to theater for words. He quoted \u201cAngels in America,\u201d the Pulitzer   epic by one of his closest friends, Tony Kushner, in which Prior Walter, a character with AIDS, converses with an angel, declaring, toward the play\u2019s end, \u201cI want more life. \u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be quite so grandiose, but that\u2019s actually kind of what it\u2019s feeling like,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling like I want to be alive. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562749.008861}
