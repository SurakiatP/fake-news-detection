My case is pretty simple \u2014 it\u2019s Trump or it\u2019s the end of America. \\nI was raised as a middle-class kid in the greatest country in world history. A country built around mobility, opportunity and economic freedom. A country that allowed this son of a butcher to become a successful business owner, media personality, best-selling author and TV star and producer. Only in America. \\nI was taught by my wonderful, patriotic, true red, white and blue, salt-of-the-earth, American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are: \\nFaith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, the Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. \\nWell don\u2019t look now. But everything from that list above \u2026 everything we believe in \u2026 everything that made America great \u2026 has been under full-scale assault for eight long years \u2014 from multiple directions. And Hillary is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama\u2019s third term. \\nThe truth is we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love is gone. Forever. \\nBecause if Trump doesn\u2019t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great. \\nForeigners come here not out of a love for America, but for a love of the cradle-to-grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote Democrat forever more to keep the welfare checks coming. That\u2019s Hillary\u2019s plan. \\nDon\u2019t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks and then train them to vote Democrat to keep the handouts coming. \\nIt worked! \\nThat was the experiment. Now Democrats are onto Plan B \u2014 to turn the rest of America into California. \\nHillary will open the borders and tie the hands of border agents in order to flood the country with millions of new illegals. Hillary will legalize the 12 million to 15 million or so already here \u2014 and give them the right to vote. \\nHillary will also enthusiastically import millions of Muslim refugees who have no love for America, capitalism, the Constitution, or certainly Judeo-Christian values. Some will become terrorists, almost all will require cradle-to-grave welfare. \\nThen it\u2019s over for America. \\nSo vote. Drag your friends to the polls. Make phone calls to your entire address book. Leave no stone unturned. \\nThink of the U.S. Supreme Court. \\nThink of open borders. \\nThink of your children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s future. \\nThen vote for Trump like it\u2019s \u2026 Trump, or the end of America. \\nBecause it is. \\nWayne Allyn Root is a best-selling author and host of \u201cWAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show\u201d 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily at 790 Talk Now.
