Putin. The protest in the capital took the form of a synchronized walk along a major shopping street to avoid a ban on unsanctioned stationary gatherings. It was one of 99 similar rallies in cities and towns across the country  \u2014   from Vladivostok in the far east to Kaliningrad in the west  \u2014   according to the organizer, Mr. Navalny\u2019s   foundation. All but 17 of these, the foundation said, had been declared illegal by the authorities. In Moscow, some protesters tried to block security vans with cars, and the authorities deployed the riot police and surveillance helicopters. But they mostly avoided the brutal measures used in neighboring Belarus on Saturday against protesters in the capital, Minsk, and other cities. The police in Belarus beat and arrested hundreds of people who tried to gather for the latest in demonstrations against President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994. But while less   than in Belarus, whose   president is often referred to as \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator,\u201d the police crackdown in Moscow could still complicate efforts by President Trump to deliver on pledges to \u201cget along\u201d with Mr. Putin. In a statement on Sunday that reflected widespread wariness of the Russian leader in Washington, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said: \u201cPutin\u2019s thugocracy is on full display. The United States government cannot be silent about Russia\u2019s crackdown on peaceful protesters. Free speech is what we\u2019re all about and Americans expect our leaders to call out thugs who trample the basic human rights of speech, press, assembly and protest. \u201d Shortly after the senator\u2019s statement, Mark Toner, the acting spokesman for the State Department in Washington, said the United States \u201cstrongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters throughout Russia on Sunday\u201d and called for their immediate release. \u201cDetaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values,\u201d he added. The protests in Russia on Sunday  \u2014   nominally against corruption but also a rare show of public defiance against Mr. Putin, who has found a fierce and enduring critic in Mr. Navalny  \u2014   were the largest coordinated display of public dissatisfaction since   demonstrations in 2011 and 2012, after an election that was tainted by fraud. Protesters tried to prevent a police van from taking Mr. Navalny away and chanted: \u201cThis is our city. This is our city. \u201d Others shouted, \u201cRussia without Putin,\u201d and held up pieces of paper denouncing the Russian president and his allies as thieves. In a Twitter post, Mr. Navalny urged his followers to continue with the demonstration after he was grabbed by police officers as he tried to join the crowds along Tverskaya Street in the center of Moscow. \u201cGuys, I\u2019m O. K.,\u201d he wrote in a message in Russian. \u201cNo need to fight to get me out. Walk along Tverskaya. Our topic of the day is the fight against corruption. \u201d The Moscow Police Department said on its website that \u201caround 500\u201d people had been arrested in the city for taking part in an \u201cunapproved public event. \u201d   a group that monitors arrests, said the number of arrests in Moscow was at least 1, 000. Instead of waving big banners with antigovernment slogans as in previous protests, most of those who joined Sunday\u2019s walk on Tverskaya Street displayed their feelings discreetly. Some waved Russian flags, cloaking their opposition in the same patriotism that Mr. Putin has used so successfully to boost his popularity. Others carried easily hidden signs featuring pictures of ducks, a reference to a claim by Mr. Navalny that corrupt officials even build houses for their ducks. Among those arrested in Moscow were Russian and foreign journalists, the leader of a small opposition party, Nikolai Lyaskin  \u2014   who said he was hit around the head by police officers and taken to a hospital  \u2014   and a British student, Gregory Hill, 17. Demoralized and divided since the   election protests, which fizzled amid a wave of arrests, Russia\u2019s opposition has struggled to make its voice heard over a din of   sentiment on   television, which invariably presents opponents of Mr. Putin as traitors in cahoots with the West. But Mr. Navalny, a charismatic   campaigner who helped lead the   protests, has shown a knack for turning repressive action against him and his followers to his own advantage. When an assailant doused him in a green liquid in Siberia last week, he exulted that his face made him look like a superhero. Instead of directly attacking Mr. Putin, who is hugely popular outside more   cities like Moscow, Mr. Navalny has focused on rallying support by exposing corruption, an issue that alarms even many of Mr. Putin\u2019s supporters. Mr. Putin, who is widely expected to seek another term as president in elections next year, has ruled Russia as president or prime minister since the former president, Boris N. Yeltsin, resigned on Dec. 31, 1999. He faces no credible opposition other than that mobilized by Mr. Navalny, the founder and leader of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption. The opposition leader has declared his intention to run in the 2018 presidential race, despite a criminal conviction in February on fraud charges that made him ineligible to compete but was widely viewed as a political ploy to keep him out of the race. Even if Mr. Navalny manages to compete for the presidency, he has little chance of winning. But his presence on the ballot would end what since 2000 have been a series of tightly choreographed presidential contests that resembled coronations. Dmitri Charishnikov, a    web designer who answered Mr. Navalny\u2019s call to walk up and down Tverskaya Street, said protests would change nothing as most Russians \u201cbelieve what they see on television\u201d and strongly support Mr. Putin. But he added that he still wanted to show that \u201canother Russia still exists. \u201d Nearby, a police officer shouted through a bullhorn that all those walking in the area were \u201cparticipants in an unsanctioned gathering\u201d and must immediately disperse or risk prosecution. State television, the main source of news for most Russians, responded to the protests by ignoring them. In a report published this month, Mr. Navalny detailed how Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, a close ally of Mr. Putin\u2019s, had built a lavish empire of mansions, country estates, luxury yachts, an Italian vineyard and an   palace near St. Petersburg. Mr. Navalny called for the protests after Russia\u2019s Parliament, which is dominated by United Russia  \u2014   a political party loyal to Mr. Putin  \u2014   ignored demands for an investigation into accusations of corruption by senior government officials. By dusk on Sunday, the protests in Moscow had wound down after sporadic scuffles between the police and protesters. Russian news media reported at least one police officer was taken to a hospital in Moscow with head injuries. A spokesman for the interior ministry in St. Petersburg denied reports one of its officers had died after being beaten by protesters.'"}, "time": 1742561816.410723}
