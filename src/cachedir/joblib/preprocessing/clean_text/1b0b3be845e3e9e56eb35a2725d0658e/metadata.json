Ms. Arjun took her two young grandchildren with her and rode off with a man in a white car. Ms. Arjun\u2019s    stepdaughter, though, stayed behind. Ms. Arjun told the woman that the girl was washing her hair, according to a criminal complaint. But the light in the bathroom had been on for hours, and the door was locked, the woman, whose name was not disclosed, told investigators. She knocked on the door, and there was no answer. She called the girl\u2019s father, and he told her to break down the door. Inside, she saw the girl, Ashdeep Kaur, lying in a bathtub with no water in it. She was lifeless and bruised. Emergency workers and the police were called around 6 p. m. to the apartment in Richmond Hill, on 112th Street near 101st Avenue, where Ashdeep was pronounced dead, officials said. On Sunday, Ms. Arjun, 55, was charged with   murder in her death, prosecutors said. Ashdeep died of strangulation, and her death has been ruled a homicide, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner said. \u201cHer actions, if true, are beyond comprehension and must be severely punished,\u201d Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement. Ms. Arjun appeared in Queens Criminal Court on Sunday, where a judge ordered that she be held without bail. Michael Curtis, an assistant district attorney, said that Ms. Arjun had \u201cthe motive, the means and the exclusive opportunity to commit this awful and brutal crime. \u201d \u201cThis defendant repeatedly and on numerous occasions threatened to kill the victim,\u201d he added, \u201cmost recently doing so this past Tuesday. On Friday, she made good on that threat. \u201d Ms. Arjun\u2019s lawyer, Judah Maltz, said his client maintained that she was innocent. \u201cShe denied ever hurting the child,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no confession. No one saw her commit this crime. All they have is circumstantial evidence. \u201d Ms. Arjun was arrested late Saturday in the South Ozone Park neighborhood at the home of her former husband, Raymond Narayan. He was the one who drove her and their grandchildren, who are 3 and 5, away from her home in Richmond Hill, the authorities said. When investigators arrived at Mr. Narayan\u2019s home, he and Ms. Arjun refused to leave for over an hour, prosecutors said. He finally relented, opening the door, and they were both arrested. Mr. Narayan, 65, has been charged with obstructing governmental administration. Ashdeep had been in the United States for only a few months, neighbors said, leaving her mother and other relatives in India to live with her father and his wife, who is from Guyana. She came to a neighborhood that is filled with immigrants from India, Pakistan and Guyana. She moved into the   apartment, which her family shared with another family, in a crowded complex formed by brick houses that have been stitched together. Neighbors said that the building\u2019s tenants turned over quickly and that many of them, like Ashdeep and her father, were from India. It is in an area of southwest Queens that has been shaken by killings this month, with an imam and his assistant gunned down in Ozone Park and a jogger, Karina Vetrano, found dead in an area of marshland in Howard Beach. And in Richmond Hill, Ashdeep\u2019s neighbors struggled with the young girl\u2019s death. \u201cI see my daughter\u2019s face in hers,\u201d Kiran Kaur said, trembling and crying as she left a nearby gurdwara, or Sikh temple. (She is not related to Ashdeep.) \u201cEvery mother can see her kids\u2019 faces in another,\u201d she continued, her    daughter\u2019s arms wrapped around her waist. \u201cI don\u2019t know how her mother feels to know that her daughter is no longer in this world. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564136.450541}
