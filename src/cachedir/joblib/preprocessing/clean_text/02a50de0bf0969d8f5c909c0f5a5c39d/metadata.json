Then, after much wine, vodka and awkward conversation, comes a fabulous eruption of runaway hedonism. Maybe, you think, coming to this shindig wasn\u2019t such a bad idea, after all. You\u2019ve known such moments, surely, when the spectacle of people going stark raving wild carries its own irresistible, anarchic logic. A feeling of vital connection saturates the room like the fizz from an exploded bottle of Champagne. Alas, the thrill is   a lonely cascade of fireworks in a night of damp squibs. And the briefly, beautifully animated revelers go back to being their soggy, miserable selves. That\u2019s what happens  \u2014   in terms of both plot and performance  \u2014   toward the end of the first half of \u201cThe Present,\u201d the Sydney Theater Company\u2019s sprawling and confused adaptation of a sprawling and confused play written by a young Anton Chekhov. This fitful Australian import, which opened on Sunday night at the Barrymore Theater, chronicles the bad behavior at one   birthday celebration. The mistress of these revels, I am happy to report, is the extraordinary screen star Cate Blanchett, making a   Broadway debut. Ms. Blanchett is portraying the hostess and birthday girl, Anna, a ravishing widow who is unhappily turning 40. Ms. Blanchett knows how to hold a stage and, if necessary, hijack it. Her   performances in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d (at New York City Center) both for the Sydney Theater Company, were as brilliant as they were brave. Such commanding,   charisma is useful if you\u2019re attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or, for that matter, play. But here Ms. Blanchett\u2019s   inventiveness is as sorely taxed as that of her character. Anna\u2019s party turns into the kind of disaster that ends not only in tears but also bloodshed. This production, on the other hand, feels moribund from the beginning. Frantic attempts at resuscitation by Ms. Blanchett and her valiant leading man (and unforgettable   in \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d) a tireless Richard Roxburgh as a hapless homme fatale, only occasionally succeed in eliciting a pulse. \u201cThe Present,\u201d which has been adapted by Andrew Upton (Ms. Blanchett\u2019s husband) and directed by John Crowley, is the Chekhov play that almost got away. Though the scholarship on its origins is uncertain, it appears that Chekhov began writing it as an    student, and it exudes a youthful, passionate untidiness. Its manuscript, a whopper in length, wasn\u2019t published until nearly two decades after his death. An uncut version would take at least five hours this one is three. The eminent playwrights Michael Frayn and David Hare, among others, have done their best to domesticate this shaggy behemoth. Mr. Frayn reconceived it as an elegant sex farce, under the title \u201cWild Honey\u201d (seen briefly on Broadway in the  ) while Mr. Hare\u2019s adaptation hewed closer to the more brooding, tragicomic template usually associated with Chekhov. That version is called \u201cPlatonov,\u201d and I saw a fine production of it at London\u2019s National Theater last summer. Directed by Jonathan Kent, it was set in the period in which it was written. And the vestiges of   decorum served as an appropriately chafing corset for the flabby plot. Mr. Upton drags the story out of the twilight of the czars and into the   morning after of the  . As in the original script, it\u2019s a period of profound uneasiness, when a nation\u2019s future is murky and its citizens unsure of their roles. But despite the inclusion of several   soliloquies on recent Russian history, it\u2019s hard to comprehend what they\u2019re reacting against here. Exit the robber barons (and the real aristocrats) enter the   oligarchs and their murderous henchmen. Farewell, balalaikas hello, the Clash. As for those without a fixed part in the new scheme of things, they\u2019re the same old kvetchers of yore, doomed to circular philosophizing and   drinking. Chief among these is Mikhail Platonov (Mr. Roxburgh) a provincial schoolteacher of vaulting wit and unfulfilled aspirations. He knew Anna when she was the young trophy wife of a powerful general, now dead. It\u2019s at the general\u2019s summer dacha  \u2014   rendered with all the personality of an Ikea showroom by the show\u2019s designer, Alice Babidge  \u2014   that Anna has chosen to celebrate her birthday. Her guests include her stepson, Sergei (Chris Ryan) who as a youth was best friends with Nikolai (Toby Schmitz) and Mikhail, who is married to Nikolai\u2019s sister, Sasha (Susan Prior). Though Mikhail is a bloviator, a womanizer and a mean drunk, Sasha loves her   husband. So, more problematically, do all the other women in the play, who, in addition to the patrician Anna, include Sergei\u2019s wife, Sophia (Jacqueline McKenzie) a humanitarian physician, and Nikolai\u2019s girlfriend, Maria (Anna Bamford). It\u2019s hard to fathom the attraction, but apparently once you\u2019ve had your first whiff of him, Mikhail is as addictive and dangerous as crack cocaine. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s livelier and more subversive than the other guys, who include Anna\u2019s rich older suitors, Alexei (Martin Jacobs) and Yegor (David Downer). But like most of his contemporaries, Mikhail can\u2019t stop talking about how directionless his life is. Such flailing is common in Chekhov. But usually you understand the specific, idiosyncratic places his characters are coming from. In this version, everyone seems to be flailing interchangeably, in the same stale vacuum, for all eternity. (Setting the play\u2019s third section in what looks like a   dreamscape only compounds the impression.) Ms. Blanchett does bring colorful shades of excitement to being bored. Her Anna plays a great game of dramatically uninterested chess, and her response to a rambling speech by Mikhail at the lunch table is priceless. (Hint: it involves the removal of an undergarment.) That comes just before that     bacchanal I wrote about earlier. It\u2019s one of the most memorable party sequences I\u2019ve ever seen, a volcanic channeling of a displaced class\u2019s fear, anger and disgust. These people want to blow up their world, and in a way they do, most entertainingly. That leaves us with another full hour of tediously sorting through the ashes.'"}, "time": 1742563204.2568295}
