Trump on Sunday renewed his call for the United States to consider profiling as a preventive tactic against terrorism in the aftermath of the mass shooting last week in Orlando, Fla. \u201cI hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,\u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d Mr. Trump issued a similar call in December after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. which left 14 people dead and more than 20 injured. On Sunday, he also sought to downplay any differences between his positions on gun control and those of the National Rifle Association. Last week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that people on the government\u2019s terrorist watch list should be barred from buying firearms, a stance that contradicts that of the N. R. A. But Mr. Trump seems to be backtracking, saying on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he \u201cunderstands exactly\u201d the N. R. A. \u2019s objections to restricting access to people on the watch list. \u201cA lot of people are on the list that really maybe shouldn\u2019t be on the list, and their rights are being taken away,\u201d he said. The N. R. A. used the Sunday morning political shows to criticize, and even to mock, Democratic efforts to pass new gun control laws after the Orlando shooting. Wayne LaPierre, the group\u2019s executive vice president, said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that legislation was effectively useless at preventing terrorist attacks. \u201cThese bad guys we\u2019re facing, they don\u2019t say: \u2018Oh gosh, they passed a law. Oh gosh, I don\u2019t think I could do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. LaPierre said. Democrats made their own push for expanded gun control  \u2014   which the Senate is to take up Monday  \u2014   and more broadly, for a   effort to take on opponents of stricter gun control. Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who led a   marathon of speeches on the Senate floor that ended early Thursday, said on ABC that \u201cthe only way that you win this issue is by building a political infrastructure around the country that rivals that of the gun lobby. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s presumptive Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, expressed her support for the effort, writing \u201cStand strong @ChrisMurphyCT\u201d on Twitter. Profiling has been an occasional theme of the Trump campaign. In addition to his most recent comments, Mr. Trump has discussed increased surveillance of Muslims and mosques, and has said that he would consider registering Muslims in a special database or requiring that they carry cards that identify them as Muslim.'"}, "time": 1742563314.1263955}
