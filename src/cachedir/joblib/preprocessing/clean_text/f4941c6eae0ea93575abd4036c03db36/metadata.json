[\u201cThe \u2018Speak Easy\u2019 study  \u2014   based on the responses of over 1, 000 UK smartphone owners aged 18+ and 100 Amazon Echo owners  \u2014   was published on Wednesday by advertising agencies JWT and Mindshare,\u201d reported Business Insider on the survey. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what percentage of respondents were men and what percentage were women. \u201d  \u201cThe study also found that 37% of voice technology users \u2018love their voice assistant so much that they wish it were a real person. \u2019\u201d they continued, adding that \u201cClearly some humans are finding themselves very attached to their voice assistants. \u201d The survey also discovered that 88% of UK smartphone users surveyed had used voice technology services, or would consider doing so in the future. \u201cWe are on the cusp of a new era in technology where voice is set to become mainstream,\u201d said Elizabeth Cherian, a director at JWT. \u201cOur research shows that 88% of UK smartphone users have used voice technology or would consider doing so in the future. \u201d \u201cTo successfully integrate voice into their offerings, brands need to understand how the technology can simplify everyday tasks by adding value and removing friction from their experience,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is not about tech for tech\u2019s sake. Thoughtful and helpful interactions which genuinely enhance the experience will drive engagement and deeper relationships between consumers and brands. \u201d Last year, it was also reported that sexual conversations with A. I. were on the rise, with one company CEO claiming that his virtual assistant \u201cRobin\u201d is used by \u201cteenagers and truckers without girlfriends\u201d for up to 300 conversations a day. \u201cThis happens because people are lonely and bored,\u201d said Robin Labs chief executive Ilya Eckstein. \u201cIt is a symptom of our society. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
