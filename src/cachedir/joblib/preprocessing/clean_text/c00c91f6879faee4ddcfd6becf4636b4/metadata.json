[In a new interview, the Hunger Games star revealed that his pot smoking days are over. Harrelson, 55, told Vulture that he stopped smoking pot a year ago.  \u201cI am a party animal,\u201d the Oscar nominee said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I haven\u2019t  \u2026     I\u2019m now extremely moderate, and  \u2026     I actually stopped smoking pot almost a year ago. \u201d The interviewer noted that he, too, had \u201ca problem\u201d with pot saying that it \u201cmessed with his head\u201d and made him \u201cless productive. \u201d Harrelson agreed to a degree with that characterization, saying, \u201cYeah, that was a little bit of my issue. Just 30 solid years of just partying too f***ing hard. \u201d This might shock some of the actor\u2019s   fans. After all, Harrelson has been a longtime fan of pot.

I think it\u2019s a great drug, in terms of  \u2026     Even cops say that the side effect is euphoria. Or the   \u2026     what do you call it?  \u2026     The effect of it is euphoria,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re doing it all the time, it just becomes   \u2026     Well, you know. I feel like it was keeping me from being emotionally available. I really don\u2019t want this interview to turn into a whole thing about that. \u201d   Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742562049.1308768}
