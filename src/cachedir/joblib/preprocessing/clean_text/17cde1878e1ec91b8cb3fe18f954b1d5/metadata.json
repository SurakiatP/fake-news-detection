Trump\u2019s personal and political history with race, arguing in her most forceful terms yet that a nationalist conservative fringe had engulfed the Republican Party. In a   address, building to a controlled simmer, Mrs. Clinton did everything but call Mr. Trump a racist outright  \u2014   saying he had promoted \u201cracist lie\u201d after \u201cracist lie,\u201d pushed conspiracy theories with \u201cracist undertones\u201d and heartened racists across the country by submitting to an \u201cemerging racist ideology known as the  . \u201d \u201cHe is taking hate groups mainstream,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told supporters at a community college here, \u201cand helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. \u201d Mrs. Clinton said that while a racially charged and \u201cparanoid fringe\u201d had always existed in politics, \u201cit\u2019s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone, until now. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks coincide with a conspicuous shift in strategy from Mr. Trump, who has spoken with more compassion about people in the country illegally and expressed a desire to win   support. He has even suggested he might revisit his call to deport 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally, a pivot seen as an attempt to draw in moderate voters turned off by his views. With Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, Mrs. Clinton has often struck a       theme in her critiques  \u2014   warning sternly and repeatedly that the arc of his candidacy transcended standard political attack. But her effort on Thursday was remarkable for its exhaustive accounting of Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial racial history in business and in his presidential campaign. Mrs. Clinton detailed the Justice Department\u2019s housing discrimination case against Mr. Trump during the 1970s, noting that the applications of black and Latino residents \u201cwould be marked with a \u2018C\u2019  \u2014   \u2018C\u2019 for colored. \u201d She said state regulators had fined a Trump casino for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor and reminded the audience of Mr. Trump\u2019s promotion of \u201cbirtherism,\u201d questioning President Obama\u2019s birthplace. She recalled his opening salvo in the Republican primary, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals when he announced his candidacy, and his more recent suggestion that a judge with a Mexican heritage could not be impartial in hearing a case involving Trump University. \u201cThis is someone who retweets white supremacists online,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, citing a posting by someone with the user name \u201cWhiteGenocideTM. \u201cTrump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people. \u201d By the end, Mrs. Clinton was quoting headlines from the Breitbart News website, which is overseen by Mr. Trump\u2019s new campaign chief, Stephen K. Bannon. \u201cI\u2019m not making this up,\u201d she warned, before digging into the site\u2019s archives: \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\u201d \u201c\u2018Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer? \u2019\u201d \u201cHoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage. \u201d The address came a week after Mr. Trump hired Mr. Bannon, who has eagerly described the site as \u201cthe platform for the  \u201d  \u2014   a loosely defined and contested term often associated with white nationalist and   sentiment. \u201cThe de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the \u201d Mrs. Clinton said. At a rally in Manchester, N. H. on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a   response to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech, portraying her attacks as directed not only at him, but also at his many supporters. \u201cShe lies, and she smears, and she paints decent Americans  \u2014   you  \u2014   as racists,\u201d he said, motioning toward the crowd gathered at a hotel. \u201cShe bullies voters who only want a better future and tries to intimidate them out of voting for a change. \u201d He offered a pointed response to Mrs. Clinton and those \u201cpushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people. \u201d \u201cI have three words,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to remember these three words: Shame on you. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pitch seemed aimed largely at moderate Republicans and other voters who have watched Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts in recent days to soften his image. \u201cTrump is trying to rebrand himself,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled. \u201d She detailed explicit rejections of racist behavior from prominent Republicans in the past, like Bob Dole, George W. Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona. And she defended the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Senator Ted Cruz, who had been attacked by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Mrs. Clinton suggested a reason Mr. Trump had latched onto the   theory that Mr. Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. \u201cPerhaps in Trump\u2019s mind, because Mr. Cruz was a Cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do with it,\u201d she said, speaking before two dozen American flags. She later called the Trump campaign \u201ca moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump. \u201d In a signal of the gravity with which the campaign viewed her speech, Mrs. Clinton took the stage without music. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said that with her attacks, Mrs. Clinton was merely trying to direct attention away from her own controversies. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s attempt to delete the single worst week of her political career isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he said, citing uproars over her private email server and the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Trump\u2019s recent efforts to moderate his tone, which have come in front of predominantly white audiences, have more than occasionally offended minority voters. Mr. Trump has said   live in neighborhoods resembling \u201cwar zones,\u201d struggle to get by on food stamps and constantly face down errant gunfire. \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he has asked. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton offered her response: \u201cThe answer is everything. \u201d As Mr. Trump has been recalibrating his message, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team has been straining to hold Mr. Trump to his statements from the Republican nominating fight, reminding voters of his   stance on immigration and arguing that his campaign has encouraged hate groups. On Thursday morning, Mrs. Clinton posted a campaign video on Twitter featuring clips of white supremacists praising Mr. Trump. It included a   interview in which Mr. Trump initially declined to disavow David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader. Near the end of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s video, these words appear: \u201cIf Trump wins, they could be running the country. \u201d In her speech, she alluded to a   Trump effect in schools, citing instances of bullying that have targeted Latino and Muslim students, and lamented his penchant for conspiracy theories. \u201cThis is what happens when you treat The National Enquirer like gospel,\u201d she said. She mused at the Trump team\u2019s suggestion that she was in the throes of a health crisis. \u201cDream on,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742564355.0066519}
