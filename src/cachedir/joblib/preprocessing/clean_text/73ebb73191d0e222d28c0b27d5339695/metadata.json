C. this week, abortion provider Planned Parenthood has released an animated video of its own   history narrated by celebrities including Lena Dunham, Meryl Streep and Mindy Kaling. [Dunham, the creator and star of HBO\u2019s Girls and a   activist, shared the Planned Parenthood anniversary video on her Twitter account Tuesday morning.  \u201cThis is the story of the incredible women who sacrificed everything to bring us safe and affordable reproductive health care,\u201d the video\u2019s opening title card reads. I made this video   @mindykaling, @amyschumer, @TessaThompson_x, Meryl Streep  more because we show up for @PPFA: https:  .   \u2014   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) January 17, 2017,  The video guides viewers through the early days of the organization and details the life of its founder, Margaret Sanger. \u201cMargaret knew how to work the press,\u201d narrates Mindy Kaling, the star of Hulu\u2019s The Mindy Project. \u201cWhen she chose jail time over fines for running a birth control clinic, her case became a national sensation. \u201d After reeling off a few statistics about Planned Parenthood today, Dunham recalled that Sanger had \u201caligned herself with eugenicists. \u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to make sense,\u201d Dunham says. \u201cBut way back in the early 20th century, eugenics was an immensely popular social movement, one with the kind of widespread legitimacy Margaret craved for her own birth control campaign. \u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make something clear,\u201d Dunham adds. \u201cRacism and ableism do not have a place at Planned Parenthood, and sure as hell don\u2019t represent the organization\u2019s commitment to equality. While there\u2019s no question that Margaret left behind a conflicting legacy, it\u2019s also true that she was a champion of progress. \u201d The video discusses the invention of the birth control pill and the significance of 1973\u2019s Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, before ending with a pledge to continue providing abortion care to women across the United States. \u201cIn our first 100 years, Planned Parenthood helped establish what reproductive rights are and why they\u2019re so critically important,\u201d the video concludes. \u201cIn the next 100, we will keep fighting until we make sure they\u2019re available to everyone. \u201d Other celebrities lending their talent to the clip include Amy Schumer, Tessa Thompson, America Ferrera, Jennifer Lawrence, Gina Rodriguez and Constance Wu. J. J. Abrams is listed as an executive producer, while Dunham\u2019s boyfriend, guitarist Jack Antonoff, provided the music. Watch the clip above.
