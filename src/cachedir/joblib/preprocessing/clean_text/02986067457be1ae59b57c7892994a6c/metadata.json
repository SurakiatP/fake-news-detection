Credit: Justin Franks \\nWhat started as a simple act of kindness has since exploded into a movement that some students rely on at a college in Alabama. Justin Franks, a 20-year-old student at Alabama A&M University, first noticed that some students in his dorm building were going to bed hungry. \\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any food,\u201d Franks told ABC News. \u201cThe cafeteria here closes pretty early, and a lot of students here don\u2019t have the money to go outside of campus to eat. I wanted to cater to those students.\u201d \\nFranks spent $40 of his own money to build up a stock of instant noodles, Capri Suns, and a few household items, such as tissues and bottled waters. He planned to share his stash with those few in need, and decided to share the news of his small stash on Facebook. His post reached over 600 shares, and word spread like wildfire. \\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would get shared that much, but people really cared about our students and Alabama A&M University,\u201d Franks told WHNT News 19.

He has since moved the pantry to an old mail room in his dorm\u2019s building. It\u2019s open from 6pm to 11pm, just after the cafeteria closes and into the evening in case late-night studiers need a pick-me-up. \\nThe pantry also includes bigger basic items, such as toilet paper, deodorant, and toothpaste, along with the dozens of non-perishable food items. It\u2019s run just like a regular pantry, where students can come in twice a week and take up to three items. Franks is even training someone else to take over so that the pantry can continue long after he graduates.

He told ABC News, \\n\u201c\u2018Service Is Sovereignty\u2019 is our school\u2019s motto and I want to live up to that. I\u2019m hoping that we can keep expanding the pantry and that it\u2019ll continue for years to come.\u201d \\nIt might be a small gesture but it\u2019s helping these students in this small way that can help them get through one of the most challenging years of their life. \\nWhat are your thoughts on this news?
