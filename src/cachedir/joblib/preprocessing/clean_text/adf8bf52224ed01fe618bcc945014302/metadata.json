Trump addressed the massacre in Orlando, Fla. on Monday, one day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, as part of a broader national security speech in Manchester, N. H. where he  also contrasted himself with Hillary Clinton. Here are the highlights from Mr. Trump\u2019s speech: \u2022 Mr. Trump began his remarks saying he initially planned to focus on Hillary Clinton, \u201cand all of the bad things and we all know what\u2019s going on,\u201d adding \u201cespecially how poor she\u2019d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism. \u201d He promised that speech would come \u201cvery, very soon. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Trump called for a moment of silence for the dead in Orlando, saying it was an attack against people and \u201can attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety. \u201d He continued, \u201cWe need to respond to this attack in America as one united people. \u201d \u2022 As his first policy proposal if elected president, Mr. Trump reiterated his plan to temporarily ban Muslim immigration. He said in particular that he would ban immigration from countries where terrorism was a threat. He said, referring to the assailant in Orlando, that \u201cthousands and thousands of people, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer\u201d are pouring into the country, and that the ban \u201cwill be lifted when and as a nation we are in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. \u201d \u2022 Even though he said at the top of his speech that it would not be about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump criticized his likely opponent for her foreign policy, again sowing some conspiratorial bent on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s grasp of the terror threat: \u201cShe has no clue in my opinion what radical Islam is, and she won\u2019t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. \u201d He quickly pivoted his criticism of Mrs. Clinton to the debate over gun laws, falsely saying she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, \u201cleaving only the bad guys, terrorists with guns. \u201d He added: \u201cNot gonna happen. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Trump repeatedly framed the threat of terrorism in the realm of immigration, claiming that there were \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Muslim immigrants who are coming into the United States unscreened. (The United States does indeed have a screening process.) \u2022 Mr. Trump referred to himself as a better friend of women and the L. G. B. T. community than Hillary Clinton, referring to his immigration ban against Muslim immigrants as one against people \u201cwho reject our values. \u201d While it was notable how far Mr. Trump went in his efforts to embrace the L. G. B. T. community, often using inclusive pronouns like \u201cour\u201d and \u201cwe,\u201d he remains opposed to   marriage. \u2022 Making blanket statements against an entire religion, Mr. Trump said that the Muslim community \u201cknow what\u2019s going on\u201d regarding terrorism, despite no evidence of that in the Orlando killings. He said the Muslim community had \u201cto work with us. \u201d He added: \u201cThey knew the person in San Bernardino was bad. They have to turn them in. \u201d He was referring to the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. last December when a Muslim couple shot and killed 14 people and wounded 22. \u2022 Mr. Trump concluded his remarks with a promise, if he were to be elected president, for a \u201csafe society,\u201d and he riffed on his campaign slogan: \u201cWe will make America rich again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. \u201d _____ Hillary Clinton  addressed the massacre in Orlando on Monday, during a speech in Cleveland where she outlined her broader plans to combat terrorism. Here are the highlights from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech: \u2022 Mrs. Clinton, invoking a \u201cnightmare that\u2019s become   familiar,\u201d said it was \u201cnot a day for politics. \u201d The shooter may be dead, she said, \u201cbut the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. \u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton said that despite some progress in combating Islamic State forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria, the group would \u201cseek to stage more attacks\u201d wherever it could. She pledged to make the targeting of \u201clone wolves\u201d a top priority as president. \u2022 Noting that the shooter in Orlando, Fla. had been on the F. B. I. \u2019s radar, Mrs. Clinton said the country required \u201cmore resources for this fight\u201d and called for the removal of \u201cweapons of war\u201d from the streets. \u2022 Mrs. Clinton, noting the acrimonious national debate over guns, said everyone should be able to agree that \u201cIf the F. B. I. is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn\u2019t be able to just go buy a gun. \u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton said it was \u201clong past time\u201d for the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait to stop allowing their citizens to finance extremists. \u2022 Mrs. Clinton, observing that the shooting targeted a gay nightclub, said that \u201can attack on any American is an attack on all Americans. \u201d Addressing gay Americans, she said, \u201cYou have millions of allies who will always have your back. And I am one of them. \u201d \u2022 Seeking to contrast her approach with the   impulses of Donald J. Trump, Mrs. Clinton said America was \u201cnot a land of winners and losers,\u201d calling it \u201ca country of \u2018we,\u2019 not \u2018me. \u2019\u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton called to mind the sense of national unity after the Sept. 11 attacks, reminding voters that President George W. Bush quickly \u201csent a message of unity and solidarity\u201d to Muslims. \u201cIt is time to get back to the spirit of those days,\u201d she said, \u201cthe spirit of  . \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563602.4861271}
