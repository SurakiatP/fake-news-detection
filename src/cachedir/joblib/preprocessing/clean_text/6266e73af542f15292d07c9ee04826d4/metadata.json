Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has left a different type of record: a   presence in TV shows, movies, documentaries, pageants and even professional wrestling events over 30 years. His first television appearance seems to have been an uncredited 1981 cameo on the sitcom \u201cThe Jeffersons. \u201d Since then, Mr. Trump has seized on opportunities to create a recurring character over three decades: a    New York billionaire named Donald Trump. His cameos have included numerous TV shows (\u201cThe Nanny,\u201d \u201cFresh Prince of \u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d) and movies (\u201cHome Alone 2,\u201d \u201cZoolander\u201d and Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cCelebrity. \u201d). Including his many interviews on   talk shows, appearances on beauty pageant and professional wrestling shows, and a recurring role on his reality program \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d his credits have numbered in the hundreds, according to the Internet Movie Database. His memorable cameos have been collected in at least one YouTube supercut. This public record has created problems for Trump the candidate. It was an appearance in 2005 on \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d that caused serious damage to his campaign earlier this month.    audio leaked in which Mr. Trump used lewd and vulgar language to describe women and his behavior toward them, prompting a series of women to come forward and claim that he had groped them or otherwise behaved inappropriately. On talk shows, frequent discussions about the presidency Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in the presidency has been threaded through his pop culture persona for decades. In 1988, as tabloids covered his tumultuous marriage to Ivana Trump, he began to discuss his presidential aspirations on the talk show circuit. When asked by Oprah Winfrey if he planned to run, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cProbably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off. \u201d He added: \u201cI think I\u2019d win. I tell you what, I wouldn\u2019t go in to lose. \u201d Shortly after the 1988 election, Mr. Trump told David Letterman that he was mulling a presidential run. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that you want to see the United States become a winner,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Letterman. This    continued for years. \u201cIs it another phony campaign?\u201d Mr. Letterman asked Mr. Trump in a \u201cLate Show\u201d segment last year, \u201cor are you really running?\u201d We all know how that turned out. In a recent interview with The Times, Mr. Letterman described their relationship as ultimately playful, but called Mr. Trump a \u201cdamaged person\u201d because of his behavior on the campaign trail. On sitcoms and in movies, a symbol of wealth, ruthlessness and New York City  Mr. Trump has almost always played himself. He won a Razzie Award for his 1989 portrayal of \u201cDonald Trump\u201d in \u201cGhosts Don\u2019t Do It,\u201d a romantic comedy. Between 1989 and 2004, he showed up in at least 10 movies as himself  \u2014   or some approximation. Whether he appeared as a V. I. P. at Studio 54 or a rascal\u2019s dad in \u201cLittle Rascals,\u201d his character played up ruthless behavior toward wealth, business practices and women. In one case, Mr. Trump had a direct hand in shaping his characters: Peter Marc Jacobson, a creator of the sitcom \u201cThe Nanny,\u201d said that he had received a note from Mr. Trump\u2019s representative that quibbled over a script\u2019s reference to the real estate mogul\u2019s wealth. The script called him a millionaire. \u201cSince he\u2019s a billionaire, he would like the line changed accordingly,\u201d the note read. In the end, Mr. Jacobson changed the script to say \u201czillionaire. \u201d He also framed the note. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre and so narcissistic that somebody would want something like that changed,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sitcom. You want to be humble about it. \u201d On reality TV, a stern mentor  In \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d competition reality shows that Mr. Trump hosted from 2004 through 2015, the businessman found a way to use business failures to his advantage, claiming they had made him the consummate businessman. \u201cI fought back and I won,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBig league. \u201d Now was time to pass on that knowledge to somebody else, he said. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d billed itself as a show that collected contestants from all economic and educational backgrounds. The ultimate prize was a job close to Mr. Trump. But behind the scenes, more than 20 people who worked on the show said that Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior was sexist and demeaning toward women, according to a report filed in October by The Associated Press. One former crew member said that Mr. Trump asked a group of male contestants if they\u2019d sleep with one of their female competitors. That person, whom The Associated Press did not identify because of a nondisclosure agreement, added: \u201cEveryone is trying to make him stop talking, and the woman is shrinking in her seat. \u201d On \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d a host  \u2014   and a target  Mr. Trump hosted the comedy sketch show twice, once in 2014 and again last November, several months after he had announced his run for the presidency. \u201cWhatever one can say about Donald Trump, he\u2019s shrewd about the TV business,\u201d James Poniewozik, a critic for The Times, wrote in his review of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2015 hosting gig. \u201cHe knows what pressures producers work under, he knows what he can deliver in ratings and he knows the leverage that gives him. \u201d Lately, Mr. Trump has been the subject of overt mocking from the SNL crew, which has cast the actor Alec Baldwin to exaggerate Mr. Trump\u2019s mannerisms and lampoon his recent statements about immigration, women and minorities. Mr. Trump did not appreciate the joke. \u201cWatched Saturday Night Live hit job on me,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Oct. 16. \u201cTime to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!\u201d On professional wrestling, a wealthy benefactor  Mr. Trump has made several appearances on World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. productions. In his role, he appeared as himself, styled as a beloved voice of the people who butted heads with Vince McMahon, W. W. E. \u2019s chief executive. In 2007 on \u201cWrestleMania 23,\u201d Mr. Trump tackled Mr. McMahon to the floor and shaved his head. \u201cDonald Trump is in a world he is not familiar with,\u201d a commentator says. \u201cThis is not real estate. \u201d Another time, Mr. Trump appeared as a moneyed benefactor, dropping what appeared to be $50 and $100 bills in a gesture of audience appreciation. \u201cRight now I\u2019m dropping buckets of cash,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The audience went wild. When asked about the origins of Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with professional wrestling, the W. W. E. declined to comment. A divisive Hollywood star In recent years, Mr. Trump has become a polarizing presence in the entertainment industry. In 2007, in the midst of an ugly feud with Rosie O\u2019Donnell and three years into firing people on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Mr. Trump was feted with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. (The celebrity typically has to  raise around $30, 000 for a star and its maintenance.) But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s star, a site already vulnerable to vandals, was destroyed by a man with a hammer. His name had been chipped away.'"}, "time": 1742563584.2731597}
