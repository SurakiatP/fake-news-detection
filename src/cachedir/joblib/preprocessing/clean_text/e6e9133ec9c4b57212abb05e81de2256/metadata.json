Chris Christie of New Jersey has quietly emerged as one of the most influential advisers to his party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee and one of the leading contenders to be his running mate. Four months after endorsing Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie remains one of the few major figures in the Republican establishment to align himself entirely with Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. In public, he has defended Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling and sometimes offensive pronouncements, vouching for him even after Mr. Trump attacked a federal judge for his Mexican heritage. (Mr. Christie said he knew from personal experience that Mr. Trump was not a racist.) Mr. Christie is among those being vetted as Mr. Trump\u2019s possible running mate, according to people briefed on the process, and Mr. Trump has said in interviews that Mr. Christie would have a prominent place in a Trump White House. Already, Mr. Christie has begun the task of designing a government on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. Chosen to lead Mr. Trump\u2019s transition efforts, Mr. Christie has taken a role that some of his allies liken to that of a White House chief of staff, soliciting views on what a potential administration should look like. Mr. Christie has taken the transition process firmly in hand, according to people familiar with his activities. He has enlisted his former top aide in Trenton, Richard H. Bagger, to help manage the transition team. On a conference call with several dozen of Mr. Christie\u2019s political allies on Thursday afternoon, he and Mr. Bagger said they aimed to have a long list of possible appointees drawn up for Mr. Trump by the time of the election. And they outlined plans to fund their early preparations through a nonprofit group, people briefed on the plans said, and asked for help raising money until they receive government support after the July conventions for their transition efforts. Behind the scenes, Mr. Christie has prodded his fellow governors and Republican political donors to line up behind a candidate many view with distaste. He has made only modest headway in the last few months: Mr. Trump has struggled badly with   and Mr. Christie has pleaded with donors in personal phone calls and at   events to give him a second look. At a breakfast   in Manhattan last week, Mr. Christie cajoled reluctant donors to back Mr. Trump, arguing that giving anything less than enthusiastic support would be a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton. And he has prodded Mr. Trump, too, to shift direction at key moments: Mr. Christie was among the senior Republicans who privately urged Mr. Trump to dismiss his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was widely distrusted by national party leaders and other members of the Trump inner circle. Mr. Christie\u2019s new role is a stark transformation from a boastfully independent   politician determined to win over female, Hispanic and Asian voters, to the   man of the most culturally polarizing presidential candidate in a generation. Politically, it represents a drastic gamble for Mr. Christie, a wager that he will be better off as a loyal and   footman for an unpopular nominee than as a sulking former opponent plotting his eventual comeback. Should Mr. Christie seek the presidency again, he would probably be identified  \u2014   for better or worse  \u2014   not as a leader of the mainstream Republican Party, but as a champion of Mr. Trump\u2019s faction. Mr. Christie has also acknowledged to friends that Mr. Trump seized much of the political space Mr. Christie had hoped to occupy in his own presidential run  \u2014   that of a blunt leader with an expansive media profile and a forceful message on terrorism. But some Republicans are disheartened by Mr. Christie\u2019s integration into the Trump machinery, seeing it as a lost opportunity to build a more inclusive Republican Party this election year. Joel Maiola, a New Hampshire strategist who helped steer Mr. Christie\u2019s campaign in the state, said he had been \u201cconfused and not overly happy\u201d about Mr. Christie\u2019s involvement in the Trump operation. \u201cI think he\u2019s been diminished by the way the Trump organization has used him, and I think that\u2019s really unfortunate,\u201d Mr. Maiola said. He described Mr. Christie\u2019s efforts to unite the party behind Mr. Trump as largely futile because of Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive approach to the presidential race. \u201cHe just seems to blow up the efforts that Governor Christie has been making to sort of form those alliances and form those bridges,\u201d Mr. Maiola said. A spokesman for Mr. Christie declined to comment on his involvement with the Trump campaign or to make Mr. Christie available for an interview. Mr. Trump has been outwardly receptive to Mr. Christie\u2019s coaching. The two men describe each other as friends with an acquaintance dating back 15 years, to early in Mr. Christie\u2019s political career. Even during their clash in the Republican primaries, Mr. Christie spoke warmly of Mr. Trump as a friend as an endorser, Mr. Christie has shown loyalty that has been noted with appreciation by Mr. Trump and his children. And Mr. Trump has given credit to the governor for helping him win the Republican nomination. Addressing a   in Manhattan last week, Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Christie for his political advice and his sophisticated grasp of government  \u2014   and, perhaps most of all, for his part in demolishing Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. The New Jersey governor, Mr. Trump said, gutted Mr. Rubio so thoroughly in a February debate that he was content simply to sit back and enjoy the show. He kidded Mr. Christie, \u201cThank you, Chris, for being the bad guy,\u201d according to some in attendance who paraphrased Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. But Mr. Christie\u2019s proximity to the possible next president has come at a price. And as a Trump advocate, he has also run up against the limits of his own influence. Shortly after backing Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie visited one of his close friends in politics, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, in Annapolis. Over breakfast in the governor\u2019s mansion, Mr. Christie and Mr. Hogan discussed the presidential race, and Mr. Hogan made it clear that he did not share Mr. Christie\u2019s enthusiasm for Mr. Trump. Mr. Hogan is one of several Republican governors, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Rick Snyder of Michigan, who have said they will not support Mr. Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve agreed to disagree on this particular issue, and there\u2019s no kind of confrontation,\u201d said Matthew A. Clark, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan. \u201cGovernor Christie did not make any attempt to change Governor Hogan\u2019s mind. \u201d In New Jersey, Mr. Christie\u2019s already low approval ratings slipped further after he endorsed Mr. Trump. And on a more personal level, Mr. Christie has been routinely taunted by Democrats and more than a few fellow Republicans for his perceived obsequiousness around Mr. Trump. A gregarious politician who routinely refers to other officeholders by their first names, Mr. Christie was pilloried in late February for referring to his friend as \u201cMr. Trump\u201d in announcing his support. Soon after, Mr. Trump was caught on a microphone in Arkansas curtly telling Mr. Christie that he should go home after having finished his remarks. On the night of the March 1 primaries, Mr. Christie became the subject of internet memes featuring his seemingly vacant expression as he stood at Mr. Trump\u2019s shoulder during his victory speech. In June, Mr. Christie\u2019s staff flatly denied an account in The New Yorker that Mr. Christie had been captured on video fetching fast food for Mr. Trump. Mr. Christie has shrugged off any hard feelings about the mockery he draws on the campaign trail, but he has also recently stepped away from the stump and opted for a more discreet role. Thomas H. Kean, a former New Jersey governor, said Mr. Christie had described himself as deeply involved in Mr. Trump\u2019s activities. \u201cHe was advising him on speeches he\u2019s advising him on policies,\u201d Mr. Kean said. Mr. Kean added: \u201cHe\u2019s in a position to be a good adviser. Whether Trump will listen to him or not, I don\u2019t know. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564442.9639096}
