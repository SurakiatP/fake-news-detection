This week, PV released the fourth video in their series, and once again, Democracy Partners\u2019 founder, Robert Creamer , is at the center of the controversy (It must be noted DP makes no mention on its website of Creamer as its founder and currently has him listed as a consultant ). \\nCreamer, who visited the White House 342 times (47 of those with Barack H. Obama), was caught on PV\u2019s fourth video, and in emails, arranging an illegal $20,000 foreign contribution to Americans United for Change (AUFC), the same group which proudly stated was creating chaos at Trump events. \\nActivists at PV arranged the donation with the knowledge it was illegal, to see if AUFC would take the bait. They did. And in return, they agreed to unwittingly take on another PV activist as an AUFC staffer. In other words, PV paid AUFC $20K, and was allowed to place the pseudo-donor\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d inside the organization, a move PV felt was worthwhile to be able to expose the organization\u2019s dirty deeds. It worked. \\nPV\u2019s first video revealed AUFC\u2019s Scott Foval coordinated and arranged for paid instigators to go out and \u201cstart shit\u201d with Trump protesters, all of which was caught on tape for the mainstream media to use in its echo chamber to paint Trump and his supporters as racists, xenophobes and bigots. \\nPV\u2019s second video showed how AUFC\u2019s organization and its affiliates commit intentional mass voter fraud. The second video is an instructional video of sorts on, \u201chow to successfully commit voter fraud on a massive scale,\u201d according to PV president James O\u2019Keefe . \\nIn the third PV video, Creamer can be seen stating Hillary Clinton herself wanted \u201c ducks on the ground \u201d in some bizarre idea to stage anti-Trump demonstrations by activists dressed as Donald Duck. The DNC\u2019s Donna Brazile was also implicated in collaboration with the scheme. \\nBut it\u2019s the fourth video that\u2019s getting all of the attention now, as it purports to show AUFC knowingly received a $20,000 illegal wire transfer out of Belize. Creamer, who we know has a close relationship with the White House via visitor logs, also brags about his friendship with Barack Obama, and intimates he can arrange meetings with the president and the former secretary of state, for a price. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago,\u201d Creamer proudly stated adding, \u201cEvery morning, I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign (Clinton) headquarters.\u201d With Creamer having spent nearly a year inside the White House, and his relationship with the president, it may be easy for some to conclude the Obama administration was also involved in Creamer\u2019s schemes. \\nPV invented the donor and shell company based in Belize, Charles C. Roth III of Repulse Bay Company, who the organization claimed to Democracy Partners was a rich donor who wanted to make a difference and stop Trump from becoming the next POTUS. Creamer then tapped the president of AUFC, Brad Woodhouse, to iron out the details of the illegal contribution. The wire transfer was arranged and transmitted. Creamer confirmed as much. \\nOn a recorded phone call Creamer can be heard saying the funds \u201cabsolutely came through.\u201d In exchange for the donation, the outspoken friend of the Obamas granted an internship to Roth\u2019s niece, an undercover PV journalist, to work inside Democracy Partners. \\nIn another recorded video session, Creamer can be seen and overheard describing what he and his partners at AUFC do. Creamer stated he gets his marching orders at his 10:30 conference call to troll the Trump/Pence campaign creating incidents for the \u201cearned media\u201d to cover which echo the message the Clinton campaign wanted to project. That \u201cearned media\u201d, as we\u2019ve come to realize through the latest email dump by Wikileaks, is the mainstream media which is apparently in the tank for Clinton. \\nCreamer also discussed allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump accusers and intimated those allegations came first through his organization\u2019s connections, which is a contention Trump made at the third and final debate with Clinton. Creamer also hinted around at the possibility of arranging a meeting between Roth and Obama. \u201cI do a lot of work with the White House on their issues,\u201d he stated plainly adding, \u201chelping to run issue campaigns (immigration, ACA, gun violence).\u201d \\nWhile the PV sting was focused on the presidential election of 2016, and the White House, the DNC, and the Clinton Campaign\u2019s involvement in painting Donald Trump as a racist, xenophobe, and bigot, Creamer\u2019s comment on his involvement in working with the White House on issues of gun violence, leaves more questions than answers. \\nAs an aside, here you have a well-connected political hit man like Creamer, working with AUFC to create violence, chaos and anarchy at Trump rallies, discussing his role in promoting gun violence issues for the White House. Taken together, considering Creamers comments and actions, all may lend credibility to conspiracy theorists\u2019 claims the Obama administration has been actively promoting false flag school shootings, on-air shootings of reporters, and mall shootings, all in an attempt to sway the American public against the people\u2019s right to keep and bear arms (2 nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution). Creamer admitted as much saying he was, \u201ctrying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.\u201d \\nTurning again to PV fourth video, upon realizing PV was soon to go public with its expose\u2019, AUFC returned the 20k foreign company shell company donation on September 9 th . O\u2019Keefe, as an epilogue to the video, openly wondered why AUFC held onto the funds for a month before returning what they undoubtedly knew to be an illegal contribution.
