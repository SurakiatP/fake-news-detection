In spite of the efforts by the Zio media to divert voter attention to Donald Trump\u2019s alleged problems with women, Hillary\u2019s treasonous crimes are increasingly difficult to hide. \\nThe fact is that Hillary should be prosecuted, not inaugurated. She has supported ISIS in its war against Syria its terrorism against America. She has sent paid thugs to disrupt Trump\u2019s political events. She has used her government positions to peddal influence. She really should be in prison. \\nThis is an extremely educating and enlightening show.
