Cuomo opened the segment by saying, \u201cSean Spicer, everybody else around the president, scolded the media, \u2018Stop calling it a travel ban \u2014  this executive order. That\u2019s not what it is, you fake news people.\u2019  Then President Trump says what we\u2019ve known all along, Sebastian, it is a ban. He likes that it\u2019s a ban. He likes the original ban and that\u2019s what he wants everybody to know. Why play the games?\u201d Gorka responded, \u201cThere are no games. The president can call it whatever he likes because he has the constitutional authority to control whoever comes into this country, Chris. That\u2019s his job. The constitutional precedence and administrative law give him that right. If he wants to call it a ban, he\u2019s the president, he\u2019s the chief officer of this administration and he has every right to do that. \u201d Watch (Part 2): It went downhill from there with Cuomo accusing Gorka of being \u201cthe purveyor of spin\u201d and Gorka shouting back that CNN is \u201cclassic fake news. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563075.2813315}
