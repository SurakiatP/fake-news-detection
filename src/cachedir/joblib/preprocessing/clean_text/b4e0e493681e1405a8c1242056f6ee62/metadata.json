Tillerson is taking a hard line against Russia on the eve of his first diplomatic trip to Moscow, calling the country \u201cincompetent\u201d for allowing Syria to hold on to chemical weapons and accusing Russia of trying to influence elections in Europe using the same methods it employed in the United States. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s comments, made in interviews aired on Sunday, were far more critical of the Russian government than any public statements by President Trump, who has been an increasingly lonely voice for better ties with Russia. They seemed to reflect Mr. Tillerson\u2019s expectation, which he has expressed privately to aides and members of Congress, that the American relationship with Russia is already reverting to the norm: one of friction, distrust and mutual efforts to undermine each other\u2019s reach. \u201cThis was inevitable,\u201d said Philip H. Gordon, a former Middle East coordinator at the National Security Council who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTrump\u2019s early let\u2019   initiative was incompatible with our interests, and you knew it would end with tears. \u201d The Russians\u2019 behavior has not changed, Mr. Gordon added, and they \u201care using every means they can  \u2014   cyber, economic arrangements, intimidation  \u2014   to reinsert themselves around the Middle East and Europe. \u201d Mr. Tillerson made it clear he agreed with that view, sweeping past Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated insistence, despite the conclusion of American intelligence agencies, that there was no evidence of Russian interference in last year\u2019s election. The meddling \u201cundermines any hope of improving relations,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cnot just with the United States, but it\u2019s pretty evident that they\u2019re taking similar tactics into electoral processes throughout Europe. \u201d Such tough talk will make Mr. Tillerson\u2019s job even harder when he arrives Tuesday for the first visit to Moscow by a top Trump administration official. While he must offer sharp warnings to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and to President Vladimir V. Putin, if they meet  \u2014   it was unclear whether such a meeting had been quietly arranged  \u2014   he must also find a way forward with them to counter the Islamic State and then deal with the Syrian president, Bashar  . Yet as Mr. Tillerson arrived in Italy to meet with foreign ministers before going to Moscow, the administration was sending conflicting signals about its policy on Syria and the extent to which it would hold the country\u2019s patron Russia responsible for continued violence. Mr. Tillerson and the new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d said the American attack last week on a Syrian air base was intended solely to halt future chemical attacks, not to destabilize or overthrow the Assad government. \u201cWhat\u2019s significant about the strike is not that it was meant to take out the Syrian regime\u2019s capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people,\u201d said General McMaster, who is new to the Sunday television circuit, \u201cbut it was to be a very strong signal to Assad and his sponsors that the United States cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians. \u201d Neither man would commit to further military action in Syria even if Mr. Assad continued to kill civilians in large numbers by conventional means rather than with the chemical weapons that prompted Mr. Trump to reverse his stance on intervention. Instead, Mr. Tillerson said that defeating the Islamic State remained the first priority. Only then, he said, would he turn to a   process leading to elections, so that \u201cthe Syrian people can decide the fate of Assad. \u201d But the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, suggested that such a process was doomed as long as Mr. Assad was in power. \u201cWe know there\u2019s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cIf you look at his actions, if you look at the situation, it\u2019s going to be hard to see a government that\u2019s peaceful and stable with Assad. \u201d That statement stood in contrast not only to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s comments but also to Ms. Haley\u2019s own remarks a week ago  \u2014   before Mr. Assad carried out his latest chemical weapons attack on civilians  \u2014   in which she insisted that his departure from office was not a diplomatic priority for the United States. Still, the overall tone of suspicion and condemnation of Russia\u2019s actions in Syria indicated that Mr. Trump\u2019s top national security advisers were nudging him back to a more traditional Russia policy. During his days as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson received a friendship award from Mr. Putin, and he is aware of the suspicions surrounding those ties and has gone the furthest in the administration in separating himself from the Russian leader. The challenges have only multiplied in recent days. The Russians, angry about the attack on the air base, have threatened to cut off a communication line that the American and Russian militaries have used to notify each other about air operations in Syria. And the attack has forced Mr. Putin into a tighter relationship with Mr. Assad, perhaps tighter than the Russian leader wants. Ms. Haley, who, like Mr. Tillerson, is new to diplomacy, has also apparently concluded that a hard line toward Russia is the safest course. The contrast between her remarks and Mr. Trump\u2019s warm words for Mr. Putin on the campaign trail  \u2014   as well as his refusal to acknowledge Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election  \u2014   has been striking. The Trump administration\u2019s Syria policy has been difficult to parse. Mr. Tillerson, in his first television appearances since taking office, seemed to describe two different strategic objectives: halting chemical attacks and ultimately negotiating a  . But he made it clear that he had no intention of backing a military intervention that would overthrow Mr. Assad. That suggested that as long as the dictator used conventional means to kill his own people  \u2014   barrel bombs instead of sarin gas  \u2014   the United States would keep its distance. \u201cI think what the United States and our allies want to do is to enable the Syrian people to make that determination\u201d about Mr. Assad\u2019s fate, Mr. Tillerson said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d  \u2014   a line that was often used by his predecessor in the Obama administration, John Kerry. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve seen what violent regime change looks like in Libya and the kind of chaos that can be unleashed. \u201d Those remarks indicate that Mr. Trump does not yet have a grander strategy for Syria. Longtime Middle East experts said that might be a good thing. \u201cI for one am glad he does not have a fully   strategy on Syria, because if he did, he\u2019d probably get it wrong,\u201d said Ryan C. Crocker, perhaps the most experienced American career diplomat in the region, and dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas AM University. \u201cThere are too many variables, too many unknowns,\u201d he said, among them the expectation of American allies, including Saudi Arabia, that Mr. Trump should emphasize getting rid of Mr. Assad over defeating the Islamic State.'"}, "time": 1742564324.7121427}
