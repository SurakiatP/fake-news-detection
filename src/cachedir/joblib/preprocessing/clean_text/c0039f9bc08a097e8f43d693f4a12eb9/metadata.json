The Vermont senator revealed the changes a day after Hillary Clinton\u2019s victories widened her delegate lead and left her all but certain to win  the Democratic presidential nomination. Despite the changes, Mr. Sanders said he would remain in the race through the party\u2019s summer convention and stressed that he hoped to bring staff members back on board if his political fortunes improved. But political experts say the layoffs signal Mr. Sanders is beginning to accept that he will not be the Democratic nominee and is now focused on pulling the party toward a more progressive agenda. \u201cWe want to win as many delegates as we can, so we do not need workers now in states around the country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people right now in Connecticut. That election is over. We don\u2019t need them in Maryland. So what we are going to do is allocate our resources to the 14 contests that remain, and that means that we are going to be cutting back on staff. \u201d When asked how many people would be let go, Mr. Sanders did not give an exact number but did say, \u201cIt will be hundreds of staff members. \u201d \u201cWe have had a very large staff, which was designed to deal with 50 states in this country 40 of the states are now behind us,\u201d he said \u201cSo we have had a great staff, great people. \u201d The development came a day after Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s senior campaign strategist, said in an interview that the senator would reassess his candidacy, looking into issues of staffing and messaging. The remarks set off something of a backlash within the Sanders campaign, as officials disputed Mr. Devine\u2019s comments, saying that no such reassessment would take place. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager told NBC News that there would be \u201cno big pow wow. \u201d When asked about Mr. Devine\u2019s remarks, the senator\u2019s wife, Jane Sanders, pushed back in a MSNBC interview. \u201cNo, no. We assess on an everyday basis,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cEven if he had a string of wins, like eight in a row or he\u2019s won states by landslide victories, nobody in the media and certainly not The New York Times has ever said he has a chance to win. \u201d Stu Loeser, who owns a media strategy firm and was a longtime spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said he had seen this sort of back and forth in campaigns involving Mr. Devine before. During Vice President Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Devine had a reputation as a strategist who would be upfront with the candidate. \u201cEvery elected official needs two kinds of loyalists close to them. One kind are the people who are with them no matter what, agree with them no matter what, and help them execute their vision,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. \u201cAnd the other is an adviser who is able to stand up and tell the candidate what he or she needs to hear regardless of whether the candidate wants to hear it. Tad Devine had that role with Gore in 2000. \u201d Mr. Sanders has started to talk more openly about the possibility of not winning the Democratic contest. During a rally in Indiana he talked not just of his path to victory but discussed what he might do if he lost. He stressed he was in the race to \u201cwin and become the Democratic nominee. \u201d But he also said if he did not succeed he would try to get as many delegates as possible and \u201cput together the strongest progressive agenda any political party has ever seen. \u201d Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in a statement that the campaign would keep on staff more than 300 workers focused on the remaining contests. Mr. Loeser said Mr. Sanders\u2019s comments showed that he was beginning to pivot his message, perhaps because people within the Sanders campaign are realizing that the senator would not be able to beat Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBy the math, it\u2019s been impossible for Senator Sanders to catch up for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. \u201cNow it looks like he\u2019s finally looked down, realized there is no ground underneath him, and is starting his descent. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563140.2278683}
