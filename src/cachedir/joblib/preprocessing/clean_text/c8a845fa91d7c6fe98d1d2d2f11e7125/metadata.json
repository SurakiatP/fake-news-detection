[Kenneth Varnes, a construction engineering soldier assigned to Fort Hood, noticed a funeral procession approaching him as he drove along Highway 195 in Kileen, Texas. Recognizing the flags on the vehicles\u2019 windows as a sign of a veteran\u2019s funeral, Varnes exited his vehicle in the pouring rain and stood at attention, saluting the fallen veteran and the family members in the procession.  Zachary Rummings snapped a photo of the soldier standing in the rain to honor a fellow veteran and posted it to Facebook. He asked if anyone recognized the soldier and to let him know who it was so that he could tag him in the picture. \u201cHe stood in the rain the entire time and saluted,\u201d Rummings wrote. \u201cHats off and respect to that young man. Thank you. \u201d Not long after Rummings\u2019 post, Varnes began receiving messages on social media alerting him to the photo, KWTX CBS10 reported. \u201cThis is probably going to make someone\u2019s day, seeing me stand here, and I know how it is to go through a tough time like that, and I really just did it just to make someone\u2019s day, that was it,\u201d Varnes told the reporter. He said it was pouring when he stopped but lightened to a drizzle shortly after. \u201cAs soon as I got back in the truck, it poured again, which was really cool,\u201d he explained. He said that after recognizing it as a veteran\u2019s funeral procession, he did not think twice about his next move.  Without even knowing whose funeral was driving by, Varnes honored his fellow vet. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they were 80 years old, they were in World War II, they were in Vietnam, they were in Iraq, I don\u2019t care if they were 20,\u201d Varnes continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood. \u201d The photo went viral on social media. After posting it on his Facebook page, comments quickly poured in. A very proud father, Kenneth Varnes, Sr. expressed his pride in his young soldier son. \u201cI am so proud that my son has grew into a very   young man, his Mom and me taught him no matter what you do in life always have respect, I love you SON. Poppa would be proud of you Son, Young people need to pay attention to this and learn. \u201d His   Ashley Jacobs wrote, \u201cMy step son has gone viral. Not for attention or recognition but for respect to a soldier and his family. I love you son! I\u2019m proud of the man you\u2019ve become. \u201d Another Facebook user, Teresita Rey posted, \u201cPlease keep sharing this. Let\u2019s make it go viral! This is what respect looks like. I am a proud cousin right now. No one asked Kenneth to do this. He just got out and ignored the rain to focus on thanking a soldier for protecting this country. We need to see more actions like this on a daily basis. \u2661\u201d And from Florida, Taylor Campa posted, \u201cLove, love LOVE this. You have such a wonderful and caring soul, Kenneth. Don\u2019t you ever change!\u201d Even the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs piled on, honoring Varnes\u2019 patriotism and sense of duty. \u201cWith a long line of patrol cars and vehicles with American flags hanging from their side windows, Kenneth Varnes, a Fort Hood soldier, knew it must be for a fallen Veteran. It was pouring rain and the sky roared with thunder, but Varnes felt compelled to do something. \u201d Varnes is married and has a newborn daughter.
