But new research suggests that the next time you look at your pup, whether Maltese or mastiff, you might want to choose your words carefully. \u201cBoth what we say and how we say it matters to dogs,\u201d said Attila Andics, a research fellow at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. Dr. Andics, who studies language and behavior in dogs and humans, along with Adam Miklosi and several other colleagues, reported in a paper to be published in this week\u2019s issue of the journal Science that different parts of dogs\u2019 brains respond to the meaning of a word, and to how the word is said, much as human brains do. As with people\u2019s brains, parts of dogs\u2019 left hemisphere react to meaning and parts of the right hemisphere to intonation  \u2014   the emotional content of a sound. And, perhaps most interesting to dog owners, only a word of praise said in a positive tone really made the reward system of a dog\u2019s brain light up. The experiment itself was something of an achievement. Dr. Andics and his colleagues trained dogs to enter a magnetic resonance imaging machine and lie in a harness while the machine recorded their brain activity. A trainer spoke words in Hungarian  \u2014   common words of praise used by dog owners like \u201cgood boy,\u201d \u201csuper\u201d and \u201cwell done. \u201d The trainer also tried neutral words like \u201chowever\u201d and \u201cnevertheless. \u201d Both the praise words and neutral words were offered in positive and neutral tones. The positive words spoken in a positive tone prompted strong activity in the brain\u2019s reward centers. All the other conditions resulted in significantly less action, and all at the same level. In other words, \u201cgood boy\u201d said in a neutral tone and \u201chowever\u201d said in a positive or neutral tone all got the same response. What does it all mean? For dog owners, Dr. Andics said, the findings mean that the dogs are paying attention to meaning, and that you should, too. That doesn\u2019t mean a dog won\u2019t wag its tail and look happy when you say, \u201cYou stinky mess\u201d in a happy voice. But the dog is looking at your body language and your eyes, and perhaps starting to infer that \u201cstinky mess\u201d is a word of praise. In terms of evolution of language, the results suggest that the capacity to process meaning and emotion in different parts of the brain and tie them together is not uniquely human. This ability had already evolved in   long before humans began to talk. Brian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University who was not involved in the study, said he thought the experiment was well done and suggested that specialization of right and left hemispheres in processing information began to evolve well before human language. But, he said, it was still possible that dogs had independently evolved a similar brain organization. Dr. Hare, who studies both dogs and primates, and specializes in cognitive neuroscience and evolution, also pointed out that the dogs could leave the experiment at any time. He wrote in an email, \u201cThey were volunteers as much as is possible with animals. \u201d Primates, he said, cannot be trained to undergo MRI scans willingly.'"}, "time": 1742564568.3313906}
