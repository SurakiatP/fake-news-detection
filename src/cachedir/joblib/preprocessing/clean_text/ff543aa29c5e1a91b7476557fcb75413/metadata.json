Central Command in Tampa, FL, President Donald Trump took aim at the \u201cdishonest press\u201d for the manner which it covers the threats of terrorism or in some cases ignored.  Trump went on to vow to defeat those \u201cforces of death and destruction. \u201d \u201cThe challenges facing our nation, nevertheless, are very large  \u2014   very, very large,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction. You\u2019ve seen that. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide committing atrocities across the world. Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on   as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino, and all across Europe. You\u2019ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn\u2019t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. \u201cSo, today we deliver a message in one very unified voice: To these forces of death and destruction, America and its allies will defeat you. We will defeat them,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country  \u2014   not going to allow it. You\u2019ve seen what\u2019s been going on over the last few days. We need strong programs so people that love us and want to love our country, and will end up loving our country, are allowed in. Not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563786.5358298}
