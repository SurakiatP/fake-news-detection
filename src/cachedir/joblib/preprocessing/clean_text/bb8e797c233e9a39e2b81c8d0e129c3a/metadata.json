In many respects, what he did in this resolution by the Security Council just before Christmas was try to define the boundaries of the state of Israel. It\u2019s a rejection of 50 years of bipartisan American foreign policy that says that the parties in the dispute themselves have to work this out. \u201d \u201cI just think it was a very bad idea. It was vindictive because everybody knows that Donald Trump has a different policy view. This was intended to box [Trump] in. I\u2019m just worried that more is coming, as well,\u201d he added.
