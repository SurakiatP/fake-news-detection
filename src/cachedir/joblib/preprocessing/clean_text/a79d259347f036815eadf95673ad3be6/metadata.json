That\u2019s what happened to Josh Mankiewicz and Anh Tu Dang in 2009 at Los Angeles International Airport, thanks to Transportation Security Administration procedures. \u201cStanding ahead of me was this stunning woman,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cI was staring at her. She didn\u2019t notice. Finally we started talking. Actually, I started talking and she responded. \u201d Ms. Dang figured there was nothing else to do. She recalled thinking: \u201cHe seemed kind of nice. I may as well talk to him. \u201d Their conversation was brief and friendly. Luckily, Mr. Mankiewicz, a correspondent since 1995 for the NBC News magazine program \u201cDateline,\u201d could read the   tag hanging from Ms. Dang\u2019s bag. Unluckily, when he returned to Los Angeles from his business trip and searched for her name on Google, he found several Anh Tu Dang\u2019s, just not the one who had caught his attention. But Mr. Mankiewicz, who had never married, had impulsively given his business card to Ms. Dang, who was divorced and the owner and chief executive of the home health care business CareWorks Health Service in Laguna Hills, Calif. \u201cI was 100 percent sure I would never hear from her and that what I had done was something silly and overconfident,\u201d he said. Once Ms. Dang returned to Los Angeles from her trip and looked up Mr. Mankiewicz, she was worried that he may have a big head and big ego. \u201cHe might have girlfriends in Chicago and New York, and I didn\u2019t want to be another person on that list of women,\u201d she said. After about four weeks, she decided to call. \u201cHe was handsome and apparently smart,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, let me give it a shot and see what happens. \u201d When Ms. Dang, now 42, identified herself as the woman from the airport, Mr. Mankiewicz, now 60, didn\u2019t immediately recognize who was calling. \u201cI wondered if maybe I\u2019d lost something,\u201d he said. But when he realized it was Ms. Dang, whose nickname is Tee, he quickly invited her to dinner. \u201cI remember walking into the restaurant and being struck by how beautiful she was,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. The couple dated for over a month, but not exclusively, and then Mr. Mankiewicz decided to pursue another relationship. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the right fit for him,\u201d Ms. Dang said. \u201cYou know how you can tell when a guy\u2019s heart isn\u2019t into it. \u201d \u201cShe let me off the hook pretty easily,\u201d he said. Then one day, four years later, in summer 2013, Mr. Mankiewicz, who had months before broken off his previous relationship, found himself on the street where Ms. Dang lived. He called her and they met for lunch. \u201cNot to say we were boyfriend and girlfriend from that day forward, but I was definitely smitten,\u201d he said. \u201cI always wanted someone who could stand up on her own and stand up to me, someone who didn\u2019t need me but wanted to be with me, and that was Tee. \u201d Mark Thompson, a Los Angeles newscaster who has known Mr. Mankiewicz since childhood, said his friend has been with some women in the past who were \u201cinto drama. \u201d \u201cShe is the opposite,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cShe is not looking to litigate every cup of espresso. \u201d Despite their age difference (\u201cShe\u2019ll say, \u2018I remember when this song came out, I was in the seventh grade,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll say, \u2018I was covering the Mondale campaign. \u2019\u201d) they found compatibility in their professions. On \u201cDateline,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz speaks to people whose family members have been murdered. In her home health care business, Ms. Dang speaks to people who have often undergone devastating physical or mental losses. \u201cWe\u2019re both in roles where we are talking to people who are dealing with sadness and trauma, and they need compassion and understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cReaching people at an emotionally fragile time gives us something in common and helps us be sensitive to one another. \u201d Five weeks after they had begun dating again, real drama emerged in their relationship. Ms. Dang received a diagnosis of breast cancer and she subsequently had a double mastectomy. Mr. Mankiewicz insisted she recuperate in his   Beverly Hills condominium (ultimately she would have eight operations) in spite of her protestations that she could stay at her own place and simply lie on her couch, have the pharmacy deliver medicine and order takeout food. \u201cShe comes off as 10 feet tall and bulletproof,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cBut she needed my help, and I wanted to help her. This told me things about myself and my relationship to her, namely that I was in love with her in a way I hadn\u2019t realized. \u201d The operations forced Ms. Dang to acknowledge her vulnerabilities. \u201cI was crying  \u2014   this is hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this to happen to me at 39. \u201d And the recovery experience left her exposed to Mr. Mankiewicz in a way she hadn\u2019t planned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be Superwoman hear me roar,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t showered in days. My hair was a mess and I had tubes coming out of my body. \u201d After she recovered, she moved back to her Santa Monica apartment, but this time he was not letting go, and she felt safe. \u201cI could tell him anything, and he wouldn\u2019t judge me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can see through me like a pane of glass and read me better than anybody else. \u201d The couple could hardly have come from more different backgrounds. Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s grandfather, the screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, shared an Academy Award for writing \u201cCitizen Kane. \u201d His father, Frank Mankiewicz, was press secretary for Senator Robert F. Kennedy, presidential campaign manager for George McGovern and president of National Public Radio. \u201cI grew up with this   seat to national politics,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cEvery conversation with my dad was like opening a history book. I met Robert Kennedy a few times. George Cukor sat at our dinner table. I watched a lot of TV news, and Vietnam played out in my living room. I was interested in being a news reporter since I was 10 years old. \u201d By contrast, when bombs were falling on Saigon in 1975 and Ms. Dang was 1\u00bd years old, her mother, then eight months pregnant with Ms. Dang\u2019s brother, escaped to Guam by boat. The family, later joined by Ms. Dang\u2019s father, Khoi Van Dang, who was disabled when Ms. Dang was 13, settled in Orange County, Calif. where they became naturalized citizens. \u201cMy family did not allow me to watch TV during the week unless it was something on PBS and probably about an elephant,\u201d Ms. Dang said. She was a shy, motivated student. By sixth grade she was reading at a   level. \u201cIt was easy for me to go into my room, spend the day there reading and come out at 6 at night,\u201d she said. Mr. Mankiewicz takes their cultural differences in stride. \u201cMy dad is from a successful Jewish family, and my mom, who had been raised a Mormon, was the first member of her family to attend college,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lesson my parents gave me was: You don\u2019t have to have a lot in common with someone to love them. \u201d From her perspective, Ms. Dang believes the Vietnamese culture can be tough on daughters. \u201cSubconsciously it is ingrained that you need to take care of your guy,\u201d she said. \u201cJosh likes it that, for lack of a better word, I am not subservient. \u201d Joey Dang, Ms. Dang\u2019s brother, saw another, possibly more lighthearted connection: They both love clothes and fashion. \u201cTee used to take pictures of her shoes and put them on the outside of the boxes,\u201d Mr. Dang said. \u201cAs soon as I saw his closet, I thought, This is a man who gets my sister. \u201d (Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s closet is color coordinated, with his jackets evenly spaced.) After one year of steady dating, Mr. Mankiewicz was not making a move toward the altar. His father, who met Ms. Dang on his 90th birthday in 2014, told his son he should marry her. But his son balked: He wasn\u2019t interested in having children. He was afraid if he was a part of someone else, he wouldn\u2019t be himself anymore. And, he joked, \u201cDateline\u201d was not the biggest commercial for matrimony. The next year, Mr. Mankiewicz changed his mind about staying single, perhaps, as his brother Ben Mankiewicz, a host of Turner Classic Movies, suggested, because four events converged: Ben had a child their father died their aging mother had moved to Los Angeles and his big brother had met the right woman. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to his emotional maturity that it was O. K. to change his life at 60,\u201d Ben Mankiewicz said. \u201cIt took courage. It\u2019s hokey to say, but I\u2019m proud of him. \u201d Their mother, Holly Howell, said: \u201cAll I could say to myself was, it\u2019s about time. He was seeing her a lot and I thought, if he doesn\u2019t hurry up, she\u2019d say to hell with it. \u201d In November 2015, at the restaurant where they\u2019d had their first date, Mr. Mankiewicz proposed to Ms. Dang. \u201cShe gasped like someone in the movies I grew up watching,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a champagne toast and took a picture and then we sat there silently texting. \u201d The wedding was set for what would have been the 92nd birthday of Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s father. Eight weeks before, after the last of her operations, Ms. Dang moved in to Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s condominium. He lamented having to give away 220 of his shirts to make room for her clothes in his closet. On May 16, they were married before a small gathering of family and friends on the deck of the home of Mr. Thompson, the newscaster who became a Universal Life minister to officiate. \u201cSometimes the path to love is slow, sometimes  \u2014   courtesy of T. S. A.  \u2014   it is excruciatingly slow,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cBut I suppose we should thank them. It gave us time to have that first talk. \u201d His mother delighted in the two families\u2019 newfound connection. \u201cHe finally came to his senses,\u201d Ms. Howell said. \u201cI mean it. You have to work really hard not to like her. There\u2019s not an ounce of snobbishness in her. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s a big shot. She has views of her own. \u201d Ms. Dang\u2019s mother, Ahn Thi Le, was sold on her new    at hello. \u201cI\u2019m a Buddhist my house is a Buddhist temple,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time he came to visit me, he said, \u2018Thank you for creating your daughter.\u2019 He touched my heart right away. For her, I thought, you don\u2019t have to find another person. You found him. Eureka!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562688.1252782}
