[Biden unveiled the \u201cAmerican Possibilities\u201d PAC, giving the former Delaware Democrat the ability to rub shoulders with donors and help candidates in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races.  \u201cIt\u2019s time to reach deep into the soul of this country and once again give everyone  \u2014   and I mean everyone  \u2014   the opportunity to achieve the impossible. It\u2019s time to look beyond   news cycles and   arguments. It\u2019s time to treat each other with dignity and respect. Not as opponents, but as fellow Americans. Because that\u2019s what we are,\u201d Biden says in a statement on the website. \u201cThis is a time for big dreams and American possibilities. If that\u2019s what you believe  \u2014   and you\u2019re ready to help elect folks who believe that, and to support groups and causes that embody that spirit  \u2014   then I\u2019m asking you to join me today. \u201d However, the creation of the PAC will also serve to increase speculation he is eyeing a potential 2020 run  \u2014   nurturing the support of donors and candidates that he will need to clinch the nomination. The New York Times reported that Biden has tapped Greg Schultz, a former aide and a veteran of President Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, to lead the organization. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008 Biden. He also considered running in 2015 as a primary challenger to eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  \u2014   but eventually chose not to. Biden has since expressed regret over that decision, and has said that he \u201cnever thought [Hillary Clinton] was a great candidate. \u201d  \u201cI thought I was a great candidate,\u201d he said at a Las Vegas conference in May. Biden has the potential to be a tricky opponent for President Trump. His run would likely be a more centrist campaign than other potential 2020 candidates  \u2014   such as liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He could also challenge Trump\u2019s hold over   white working class areas in places such as Pennsylvania and Michigan  \u2014   states central to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. The New York Times reported ahead of the announcement that Biden is frustrated that Clinton lost, particularly her failure to pick up votes from white   voters.
