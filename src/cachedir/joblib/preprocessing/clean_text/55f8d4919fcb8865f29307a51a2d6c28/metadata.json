Grant payments will be made directly to the recipient\u2019s college or university immediately pending IRS approval. \u201d As well as announcing the acceptance of applications, MILO has also hired a new Selection Committee Chairman, Janet Bloomfield, to overview the applications which are to students who are \u201cattending or accepted to a two year community college or a four year college or university. \u201d \u201cMy initiative to help white men further their education is now accepting applications. We\u2019ve given it the brilliant name of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant,\u201d declared MILO on stage during his show at Cal Poly State University on Tuesday. \u201cNo this isn\u2019t a joke. \u201d \u201cIt started as a joke, but if you\u2019re a women, or you\u2019re black  \u2026     If you\u2019re disabled, or you\u2019re Muslim, or a refugee  \u2026     If you identify as an attack helicopter, you can get free money,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the facts say that actually it is young white boys who are educationally underprivileged. As educationally underprivileged as many other groups. So it did start as a joke, but nobody can resist the truth wrapped in a good joke, and there\u2019s nothing better than doing good while annoying the left. It is my favorite thing. \u201d \u201cSo I, and a number of private donors, have created this thing  \u2026     My goal is to help more men, no matter their major or political opinions, reach their educational goals. You can even major in gender studies, I don\u2019t care,\u201d MILO joked. \u201cNow although it took longer than I anticipated to set up the privilege grant, I\u2019m happy we\u2019re now well on our way to help young men achieve their dreams. I hope everyone in the room applies, I hope everyone watching at home applies. \u201d \u201cMen, as you may know, make up just 43% of America\u2019s 20. 5 million college students,\u201d explained MILO in conclusion. \u201cYet another way in which the feminist consensus about the oppressive patriarchy simply doesn\u2019t bear any relation to the facts. And that number\u2019s getting smaller. So it\u2019s all very well for social justice warriors and progressives to cry and scream and talk about \u2018changing things and making a difference and standing up,\u2019 but then there are those of us who are actually doing something for, which now in higher education, is a minority group. \u201d You can apply for the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant here.
