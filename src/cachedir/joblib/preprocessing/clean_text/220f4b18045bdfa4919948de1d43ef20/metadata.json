[Lucas called into Breitbart News Daily Show, hosted by Alex Marlow, on Monday, and for about 14 minutes, one of the most conservative radio hosts and one of the most liberal political journalists had an extremely good conversation \u2014  one that was both insightful and respectful.  (Something lacking in the current political climate.) Marlow and Lucas attended Berkeley together  \u2014   where they battled on blogs and in the school paper  \u2014   and still talk occasionally to this day.  Lucas recently penned a piece for Politico entitled, \u201cHow California Gave us Trumpism\u201d \u2014  and Marlow asked him how it was received. In response, Lucas quoted a conservative friend from high school, who was a contestant on The Apprentice and \u201cknew Donald Trump a little: \u201cScott, I feel like this piece does a really, really good job of understanding sort of how I see the world, seeing things through my eyes. \u201d And that sort of sums up Trump\u2019s appeal. He saw the world through the eyes of the tired, the forgotten, the everyman  \u2014   who\u2019d been left behind. In California, conservatives are the truest of true believers, whose isolation has made them all the more ardent about their beliefs. According to Lucas, it was that environment that gave birth to \u201cTrumpism,\u201d described by Lucas as the \u201cmarriage of \u2018Constitutional Conservatism\u2019 coming out of the Claremont Institute with a sort of \u2018Entertainment Populism\u2019 coming out of Breitbart. \u201d When asked who were some of the names who sparked what Lucas later in the interview calls \u201can important intellectual moment,\u201d more than 80% of the names are likely familiar to Breitbart\u2019s audience: One name that came up later would bring the entire discussion full circle  \u2014   and that was none other than Andrew Breitbart himself, who Lucas noted embodied both schools of thought. Breitbart was on a Lincoln Fellowship at the Claremont Institute when he launched the website that would bear his name, and later help launch one of the most unlikely presidencies in modern times. What is \u2018California Trumpism\u2019? Lucas says, \u201c\u2019Trumpists\u2019 are people who think California  \u2014   and by extension the United States  \u2014   are in decline  \u2026    that there\u2019s something wrong, something\u2019s on the downslope, and they\u2019re very willing to say that, point it out, try to figure out what to do about it. \u201d For Lucas, there are two seminal moments in the rise of \u201cTrumpism. \u201d  First, the publication of Michael Anton\u2019s \u201cThe Flight 93 Election\u201d  \u2014   in which Anton, under an alias, lays out the perfect case for why a   figure can only arise as a Phoenix from the ashes of a corrupt,   Republic  \u2014   and the tragic murder of Kate Steinle, the beautiful 32   woman cut down in the prime of her life by an illegal alien set loose on the streets of San Francisco by liberals\u2019 sanctuary policy. Lucas was very open about the way he and other liberals were taken by complete surprise by Trump\u2019s election  \u2014   something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear he would stand and fight like Reagan did, instead of cutting and running  like the Mitt Romney wing of the party.  But unlike most liberals, Lucas admitted that he believes it is important to understand how we got here, instead of simply demonizing Trump and his supporters. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this country together, we\u2019re all in this state together  \u2014   who are you people?\u201d Lucas asks, rhetorically.  \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He answers his own question early in the interview: It seems a very important intellectual moment in bringing together these sort of two strands of Conservatism that have emerged in Southern California. On the one hand, this idea from the Claremont Institute  \u2014   that the United States was founded as sort of an expression of ancient political theory coming from Aristotle and people like that.  And that we\u2019re in serious trouble with the rise of Progressive Liberal Government in the 20th Century. And on the other hand, sort of Andrew Breitbart\u2019s idea that culture is ahead of politics  \u2014   that you had to create a media vehicle that sort of spoke to people where they are  \u2014   and bring them along politically after that. And it struck me that was very obviously the formula for Trump  \u2026     Lucas decried the violence and death of free speech in Berkeley (the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement\u2019):  \u201cIt\u2019s very disheartening to see people [on the far left and the far right] who\u2019d rather punch each other than talk to each other when they have political disagreements. \u201d When asked by Marlow if life is going to get better or worse for conservatives in California, Lucas had a warning. \u201cCalifornia is always a decade or two ahead of the United States  \u2014   and  \u2026    as goes California, so, too, very often goes the United States  \u2026    \u201d. He suggested that progressive leftism was likely going to take over the rest of the nation in that time. Not likely in places like Texas or the heartland of this country, at least not anytime soon. Maybe there\u2019s another takeaway  \u2026     Since \u201cTrumpism\u201d was truly born in California, perhaps there\u2019s hope for the Golden State after all.
