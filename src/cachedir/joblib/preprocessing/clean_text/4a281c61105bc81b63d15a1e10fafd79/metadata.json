Two European satellites have captured a stunning portrait of the subtle topographical shifts at work in the landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Sentinel satellites, operated by the European Space Agency, have been snapping radar scans of the region since 2015 as part of their mission to collect data on the earth and oceans. Analysts have since compared the movement of physical features over time  \u2014   down to mere millimeters. Among the project\u2019s starkest depictions are shifts along the Hayward Fault, the gradual sinking of reclaimed land in the San Rafael Bay, and the rise of the city of Pleasanton, a possible side effect of replenished groundwater. The images align with already understood geological processes, said Roland B\u00fcrgmann, a professor of earth and planetary science at U. C. Berkeley, who was not involved in the project. But scientists believe that the acute level of detail offered by the technology could deepen knowledge in a number of areas, among them structural engineering, earthquake prediction and insurance risk. \u201cIt\u2019s developing a new potential for the world that has never existed,\u201d said Dag Anders Moldestad, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Center who participated in the project. In the case of the Millennium Tower, it could also become a factor in a court fight as San Francisco wages a legal battle that accuses the developers of failing to disclose issues with the structural integrity of the downtown skyscraper. The Sentinel satellite images  \u2014   captured from early 2015 to September of this year  \u2014   show that the   luxury condominium building is sinking into the soft soil below at a rate of nearly two inches a year. A separate examination this year found that the tower had descended about 16 inches altogether, while tilting roughly six inches, since opening its doors in 2009. The developer has insisted that the building is safe. Nicholas Sitar, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said that a small amount of sinking was to be expected among structures on the reclaimed land along San Francisco\u2019s waterfront. The Sentinel satellites, for example, found that the new Salesforce East tower, across the street from the Millennium Tower, was also sinking. The rapid rate of the Millennium Tower\u2019s descent, however, was troubling, Dr. Sitar said.

[Wall Street Journal] On Tuesday, a photo caption in the newsletter misidentified one of California\u2019s landmarks. About a dozen readers wrote to point out the error: the towering rock in the photograph was Yosemite Valley\u2019s Half Dome, not Sentinel Dome as the caption claimed. That made us wonder if it might be time for a visit. While summer tends to be the park\u2019s busiest time of the year, Yosemite regulars will tell you it is never more blissfully serene than in the winter. Crucially, it\u2019s much less crowded. In the summer, up to 600, 000 people visit each month, said Scott Gediman, a park spokesman. During the winter months, it\u2019s usually fewer than 200, 000. \u201cThe park is beautiful right now,\u201d said Mr. Gediman, speaking by phone from the Yosemite Valley on Tuesday. \u201cYosemite Falls is flowing. You\u2019ve got ice on the canyon walls. It\u2019s just gorgeous and peaceful. \u201d Most of Yosemite is cloaked by snow in the winter, including at times the valley, which sits about 4, 000 feet above sea level. Visitors can ice skate, snowshoe,   ski or even hit the slopes. Established in 1935, Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area, formerly known as Badger Pass, is California\u2019s oldest ski area. According to Frank Dean, a former park ranger who lived in the valley for eight years, Yosemite in the winter offers pageants of nature that you don\u2019t get the rest of the year. He recalled once going   skiing with some friends on New Year\u2019s Eve. The sky had just cleared after a storm and a bright moon was illuminating a dusting of snow on the valley\u2019s soaring granite walls. As the group passed by the luxury Ahwahnee Hotel, a onetime host of Queen Elizabeth II, they noticed a holiday celebration inside. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to go to that party,\u201d said Mr. Dean, who now runs the Yosemite Conservancy. \u201cBut I was thinking, \u2018Boy, I think we\u2019re having the better deal out here. \u2019\u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
