NATO is testing a drastic military buildup. We have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to Eastern Europe. These are offensive, not defensive forces. What we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Ermakov said. \\nThe North Atlantic Alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the NATO-Russia border on a permanent basis, but has been increasingly active in the region. The bloc approved its largest military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltics since the end of the Cold War at the 2016 Warsaw summit, a development viewed with deep concern in Moscow. \\nAs part of this initiative, Canada, Germany, the UK and the US will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Each will total up to 1,000 soldiers. These battalions are said to become operational in early 2017. The alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming Russia for its ostensibly \u201cassertive\u201d behavior. Moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims. \\nErmakov further explained that forces of NATO\u2019s European members are not as lethal as they might seem. \u201cOn paper this is a force exceeding Russia\u2019s [military] potential by several times. But it lacks real combat power. This is why Americans need to be everywhere. The US was forced to boost US European Command\u2019s budget,\u201d he said. \\nEarlier this year, the Pentagon requested $3.4bn for its operations in Europe in 2017, a four-time increase compared to its $789-million budget this year. A d v e r t i s e m e n t \\nRussian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that NATO increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk. \\nThe bloc\u2019s muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric \u201cgreatly reduce European security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between Russia and NATO, something Russia has been calling for so many years. Instead, the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results,\u201d Peter Korzun, an expert on wars and conflicts, wrote for the Strategic Culture Foundation. Ermakov also said that the United States wants to increase its presence in the Black Sea region to counter Russia. \u201cAmericans can no longer count on Turkey due to the failed coup attempt. Ankara has become a complicated partner. [Washington] is instead focusing on Bulgaria and Romania,\u201d he said. \\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned Romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of NATO\u2019s defense ministers. He said that Romanian troops will join the US-led battle group in Poland. He also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening NATO\u2019s presence in the Black Sea region \u201cin the air, at sea and on land.\u201d This initiative will include among other things \u201ca Romanian-led multinational framework brigade on land,\u201d he observed, providing no additional information on the subject. \\nErmakov further said that Washington also wants to counter Russia in Central Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.
