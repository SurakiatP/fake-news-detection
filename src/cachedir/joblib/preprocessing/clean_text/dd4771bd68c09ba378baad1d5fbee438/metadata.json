Trump\u2019s immigration plan with Kristallnacht, the night of horror in 1938 when rampaging Nazis smashed Jewish homes and businesses in Germany and killed scores of Jews. But if it was a provocative analogy, it was not a lonely one. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has engendered impassioned debate about the nature of his appeal and warnings from critics on the left and the right about the potential rise of fascism in the United States. More strident opponents have likened Mr. Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. To supporters, such comparisons are deeply unfair smear tactics used to tar conservatives and scare voters. For a bipartisan establishment whose foundation has been shaken by Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendance, these backers say, it is easier to delegitimize his support than to acknowledge widespread popular anger at the failure of both parties to confront the nation\u2019s challenges. But the discussion comes as questions are surfacing around the globe about a revival of fascism, generally defined as a governmental system that asserts complete power and emphasizes aggressive nationalism and often racism. In places like Russia and Turkey, leaders like Vladimir V. Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan employ strongman tactics. In Austria, a nationalist candidate came within   of a percentage point of becoming the first   head of state elected in Europe since World War II. In Hungary, an authoritarian government has clamped down on the news media and erected razor wire fences to keep out migrants. There are worries that Poland may follow suit. Traditional parties in France, Germany, Greece and elsewhere have been challenged by nationalist movements amid an economic crisis and waves of migrants. In Israel, fascism analogies by a former prime minister and a top general have again inflamed the   debate about the occupation of Palestinian territories. \u201cThe crash of 2008 showed how globalization creates losers as well as winners,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn many countries,   wages are stagnant and politics has become a battle over a shrinking pie. Populists have replaced contests between left and right with a struggle between cosmopolitan elites and angry nativists. \u201d That dislocation may not lead to a repeat of Europe in the 1930s, but it has fueled a debate about global political trends. There is a tendency at times to try to fit current movements into understandable constructs  \u2014   some refer to terrorist groups in the Middle East as Islamofascists  \u2014   but scholars say there is a spectrum that includes   nationalism, illiberal democracy and populist autocracy. \u201cOn a world level, the situation that affects many countries is economic stagnation and the arrival of immigrants,\u201d said Robert O. Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University and one of the most prominent scholars of fascism. \u201cThat\u2019s a   punch that democratic governments are having enormous trouble in meeting. \u201d Mr. Trump dismisses the labels used by those like Mr. Weld, a longtime Republican now mounting a quixotic campaign for vice president as a Libertarian. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about his alcoholism,\u201d Mr. Trump said through a spokeswoman, \u201cso why would he talk about my foolishly perceived fascism? There is nobody less of a fascist than Donald Trump. \u201d (Mr. Weld, who in the 1990s reportedly appeared in public a few times having had too much to drink, declined to respond: \u201cI\u2019ll let that ride. \u201d) Americans are used to the idea that other countries may be vulnerable to such movements, but while figures like Father Charles Coughlin, the demagogic radio broadcaster, enjoyed wide followings in the 1930s, neither major party has ever nominated anyone quite like Mr. Trump. \u201cThis could be one of those moments that\u2019s quite dangerous and we\u2019ll look back and wonder why we treated it as   at a time when we could have stopped it,\u201d said Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Brookings Institution known for hawkish internationalism. Mr. Kagan sounded the alarm this month with a Washington Post   article, \u201cThis Is How Fascism Comes to America,\u201d that gained wide attention. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of positive feedback from conservative Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who agree with this. \u201d Fascist comparisons are not new in American politics. A Google search of \u201cBarack Obama and Nazi\u201d or \u201cGeorge W. Bush and Nazi\u201d produces many images of the last two presidents as   fascists. But with Mr. Trump, such comparisons have gone beyond the fringe and entered mainstream conversation both in the United States and abroad. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the border and to bar Muslims from entering the United States. \u201cThat\u2019s the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived,\u201d he said. The actor George Clooney called Mr. Trump \u201ca xenophobic fascist. \u201d Louis C. K. the comic, said, \u201cThe guy is Hitler. \u201d Eva Schloss, the    stepsister of Anne Frank, said Trump \u201cis acting like another Hitler by inciting racism. \u201d It got to the point that his wife, Melania Trump, was prompted to say, \u201cHe\u2019s not Hitler. \u201d Mr. Trump has provided plenty of ammunition for critics. He was slow to denounce the white supremacist David Duke and talked approvingly of beating up protesters. He has praised Mr. Putin and promised to be friends. He would not condemn supporters who launched   blasts at journalists. At one point, Mr. Trump retweeted a Mussolini quote: \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. \u201d Asked by Chuck Todd on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about the retweet, Mr. Trump brushed off the quote\u2019s origin. \u201cI know who said it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what difference does it make whether it\u2019s Mussolini or somebody else?\u201d \u201cDo you want to be associated with a fascist?\u201d Mr. Todd asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump answered, \u201cI want to be associated with interesting quotes. \u201d He added: \u201cAnd certainly, hey, it got your attention, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s allies dismiss the criticism as politically motivated and historically suspect. The former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has said he would consider being Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, said in an interview that he was \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by what he called \u201cutterly ignorant\u201d comparisons. \u201cTrump does not have a political structure in the sense that the fascists did,\u201d said Mr. Gingrich, a onetime college professor who earned his doctorate in modern European history. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the sort of ideology that they did. He has nobody who resembles the brownshirts. This is all just garbage. \u201d Beyond Hitler and Mussolini, fascism can be hard to define. Since World War II, only fringe figures have overtly identified themselves that way. In modern political discourse, the word is used as an epithet. And even Hitler and Mussolini were elastic in their political philosophies as they came to power Mussolini started out as a leftist. Mr. Paxton, the fascism scholar, said he saw similarities and differences in Mr. Trump. His message about an America in decline and his    pronouncements about immigrants and outsiders echo Europe in the 1930s, Mr. Paxton said. On the other hand, he said, Mr. Trump has hardly created uniformed, violent youth groups. Moreover, fascists believe in strong state control, not      individualism and deregulation. Others caution against comparisons. \u201cI read Kagan\u2019s piece, of course,\u201d said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, in Berlin. \u201cAll the phenomena he describes are raising concerns, but I would still not call Trump or his campaign fascist. Maybe with German and European history in mind, we are a bit more cautious than others in using the label \u2018fascism. \u2019\u201d Mr. Perthes said real fascism requires two more elements  \u2014   an outright rejection of democracy and a harsher definition of order. Jobbik, the ultraright party in Hungary, would fall into this category, he said, but Norbert Hofer, the   candidate who narrowly lost the Austrian presidential vote, and Mr. Trump would not. Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, in London, distinguished between   nationalist parties like Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France and actual fascism. \u201cHistorically, it means the demonization of minorities within a society to the extent that they feel insecure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means encouraging the use of violence against critics. It means a bellicose foreign policy that may lead to war, to excite a nationalist feeling. It takes xenophobia to extremes. And it is contemptuous of a   liberal order. \u201d The debate about terminology may ignore the seriousness of the conditions that gave rise to Mr. Trump and his European counterparts. The New York real estate developer has tapped into a deep discontent in a country where many feel left behind while Wall Street banks get bailouts, newcomers take jobs, terrorists threaten innocents and China rises economically at America\u2019s expense. \u201cIt seems to me in developed and semideveloped countries there is emerging a new kind of politics for which maybe the best taxonomic category would be   populist nationalism,\u201d said Stanley Payne, a professor emeritus at the University of  . \u201cWe are seeing a new kind of phenomenon which is different from what you had\u201d in the 20th century. Roger Eatwell, a professor at the University of Bath, in England, calls it \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d a form of government that keeps the trappings of democracy without the reality. \u201cElections are seen as important to legitimizing regimes,\u201d he said, but instead of imposing   rule, as in the past, today\u2019s authoritarians \u201cuse a variety of devices to control   manipulate the media, intimidate opponents\u201d and so on. Either way, it has found pockets of support on both sides of the Atlantic. Lilia Shevtsova, a political analyst in Moscow, said   in liberal societies in the West stems from crisis or dysfunction while in illiberal countries like Russia and Turkey it reflects an attempt to fill the void left by the failure of Western notions to catch on. The problem, she added, is that \u201cthe Western political leadership at the moment is too weak to fight the tide. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628477.3778698}
