[Former Prime Minister David Cameron made the promise a key part of his demands while attempting to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s EU membership. However, other EU leaders would only agree to a temporary compromise, forcing Mr Cameron into an embarrassing climb down and helping fuel the Brexit vote.  Now his successor Theresa May is looking at resurrecting the policy and bringing EU migrants in line with migrants from elsewhere in the world. The Times reports that the government is considering the move along with a series of other decisions over the future of Britain\u2019s immigration system after Brexit. In February last year, government data showed the UK has paid over \u00a31 billion in welfare payments to unemployed EU migrants. Figures showed that in   alone, British taxpayers paid \u00a3886million for unemployed EU migrants living in the UK, and a further \u00a3814 million for EU migrants in work. Now the government is deciding whether to finally honour David Cameron\u2019s pledge of ending these benefits, although they have so far refused to commit. The report comes as the government continues to give mixed signals over its Brexit strategy. David Davis, the Brexit minister, has hinted he would not like to see business affected by curbs on   immigration, indicating at various times that Britain could stay in leave the Single Market. Chancellor Philip Hammond has also called for a \u201cbusiness friendly\u201d Brexit, although has declined to go into details. However, Theresa May is determined to appear tough on immigration. In her speech to the Conservative Party conference in October, the Prime Minister said: \u201cWe are not leaving the European Union to give up control over immigration again. \u201cWe are leaving to be a fully sovereign and independent country  \u2014   and that deal is going to have to work for Britain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561847.1772778}
