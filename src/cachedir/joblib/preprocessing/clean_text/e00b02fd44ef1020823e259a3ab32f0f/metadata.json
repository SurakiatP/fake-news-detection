President Donald Trump, the Governor of Mississippi has said. [Speaking at a party thrown for Mr Farage on the top floor of the Hay Adams hotel, Phil Bryant said: \u201cThere is an opportunity for him to work directly with the president, we call it \u2018close but unofficial\u2019.  \u201cI think you will see that type of relationship between Nigel Farage and the president where he will turn to Nigel for advice about Great Britain. \u201d The Telegraph quotes Mr Bryant as adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak for the president but I know that the president has a great deal of trust in Nigel Farage, and I think he is going to turn to him as an adviser and there would be none better. \u201d He described the former UKIP leader as a \u201chumble man who just believes in Great Britain and trying to make sure it achieves that greatness\u201d. Mr Bryant added that Brexit will be a massive boost for Britain, saying: \u201cI remind all our friends here  \u2014   there is a reason they call it Great Britain. It is going to be great again. \u201d Mr Farage spoke at the same event, saying how he was \u201cproud\u201d to have played a part in Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cAt times it wasn\u2019t necessarily that easy to be helping the Trump campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were one or two low moments. But I think what\u2019s exciting is that 2016 will be looked at in ten years\u2019 time, in a hundred years\u2019 time, as a year of a great pivot, of a great change. \u201cA year when nation state democracy reasserted itself. A year when proper decent values reasserted themselves. And I think through 2017 much of this revolution will continue across much of what is left of Mr. Juncker\u2019s European Union. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563356.2387497}
