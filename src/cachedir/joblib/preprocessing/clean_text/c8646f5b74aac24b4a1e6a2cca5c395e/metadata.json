Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. \\nThe man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn\u2019t find Kubek at his home \u2013 however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. \\nThe police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. \\nAccording to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter \\nThe News-Herald reported: \\n\u201cThe officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said \u201cyes.\u201d \\nIn response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.\u201d \\nYes, a grown man used a gun because he felt \u201coutnumbered\u201d by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn\u2019t be trusted with firearms! Kubek\u2019s hearing is scheduled for December 5th \u2013 let\u2019s hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner.
