Yet, Yale Law School has opened up an Islamic Law Center for students to study Sharia Law and in Germany, an 8-month pregnant woman was beaten for wearing a cross, because it\u2019s against Sharia Law. Now, a professor at a rival college is upset that Washington D.C.\u2019s Catholic University of America has crosses covering the classrooms and does not have a designated space for their Muslim students to pray. \\nNow, Muslims are complaining about crosses hanging up in the classroom of a Catholic University in Washington D.C. The complaint says that the crosses at the Washington D.C.\u2019s Catholic Univeristy of America are \u201coffensive\u201d and prevent Muslims from praying within the vicinity of them. This may come as a shock to many, but it is just the latest occurrence of demands for the United States to implement and maintain Sharia Law adherence. The complaint was filed with the Washington, D.C. Office of Human Rights by a Professor Banzhaf from the rivaling college of George Washington University saying that there are in fact \u201ctoo many crosses in every room of Washington D.C.\u2019s Catholic Univeristy of America\u201d which is a \u201chuman rights violation that prevents Muslim students from praying there.\u201d Officials of the Washington D.C.\u2019s Catholic Univeristy of America said that they were not aware of any complaints from any of the Muslim students who attended. \\nProfessor Banzhaf already has a pending lawsuit against Washington D.C.\u2019s Catholic University of America for terminating its policy of mixed-gender dorms. Professor Banzhaf also has a rather long history of filing civil rights lawsuits on topics that range from smoking to childhood obesity. Part of the lawsuit states the Catholic University \u201cdoes not provide space \u2013 as other universities do \u2013 for the many daily prayers Muslim students must make, forcing them instead to find temporarily empty classrooms where they are often surrounded by Catholic symbols which are incongruous to their religion.\u201d \\nPatrick Reilly of the Cardinal Newman Society was quoted as saying that \u201cthis attorney is really turning civil rights on its head. He\u2019s using the law for his own discrimination against the Catholic institution and essentially saying Catholic University cannot operate according to its Catholic principles.\u201d \\nFOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK'"}, "time": 1742562316.055585}
