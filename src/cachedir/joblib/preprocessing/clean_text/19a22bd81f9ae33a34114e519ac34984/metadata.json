According to The Political Insider , the news broke just as Donald Trump took the stage in New Hampshire, and it was the first thing he\u00c2 mentioned. \\nWatch: BREAKING: Trump begins New Hampshire rally by reacting to FBI saying it\\'s probing new Clinton emails: \u00e2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps finally justice will be done\u00e2\\x80\\x9d pic.twitter.com/iiCU5PeF4d \\n\u2014 CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) October 28, 2016 \\nHere is Trump\u2019s full statement: \\nI need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.\u00c2 The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s investigation.\u00c2 And they are re-opening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United Staes of America. \\nHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody\u2019s hope that it is about to be corrected. \\nSo that is a big announcement that I heard ten minutes ago, and I guess obviously most of you folks\u00c2 have heard about. And in all fairness, for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently 4-Star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. \\nWith that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We\u2019ll bring back our jobs, we\u2019ll strengthen our military\u2026 \\nTwitter reacted accordingly.
