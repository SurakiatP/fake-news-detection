His parents petitioned a court to change all of his legal documents, including his name, birth certificate, and Social Security card to reflect his male name and identity. [Max Briggle\u2019s mother Amber told WFAA: \u201cHe\u2019s always going to be transgender, but having that piece of paper, my hope is that it\u2019s going to make it a little easier for him. \u201d  She called these changes, \u201canother milestone,\u201d and believed the new paperwork was essential for her child while the state legislature debates the proposed \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d SB 6. If passed into law, this legislation would mandate people use bathrooms based on the gender shown on their birth certificates. Amber and husband Adam, who reside outside of Dallas in Denton, became visible advocates for transgender children as the \u201cbathroom bill\u201d debate heated up nationally and in Texas. Max, then MG, became the face of Texas trans kids when his parents invited Attorney General Ken Paxton to dinner at their home. The family wanted to show Paxton they were a \u201c  normal, remarkably unremarkable family,\u201d according to The Dallas Morning News. Paxton and his wife accepted the invitation. The AG lead a   lawsuit against the former Obama administration over a transgender directive that advised public school students could use the bathroom and other facilities based on \u201cgender identity. \u201d Ultimately, a federal judge blocked the Obama transgender guidelines. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re going to pass laws saying which facilities you can and can\u2019t use, it\u2019s awfully nice to have a document saying he can use it,\u201d said Amber Briggle. \u201cAt the same time, I just feel like it\u2019s so unnecessary. Why do I have to change my son\u2019s birth certificate so he can be treated like the boy that he is?\u201d A changed birth certificate impacts more than bathrooms. In 2016, Texas public school superintendents resoundingly approved the University Interscholastic League\u2019s (UIL) amendment requiring that school districts use a  \u2019s birth certificate to determine gender identification if questioned, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The UIL is the state\u2019s governing body for competitive public school athletics, music, and academic events. Recently, North Texas transgender teen athlete Mack Beggs, transitioning from female to male, competed on the girl\u2019s wrestling team because of UIL rules, Breitbart Texas reported. Altering Max\u2019s name required a letter from a physician meeting specific requirements and a court order. According to WFAA, Texas Health  Human Services said only 34 people in the entire state met these requirements and could change their vital documents last year. In this case, the Briggle family went through the U. S. State Department to amend their trans child\u2019s birth certificate since he was born in The Netherlands. The State Department issues a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) when American children are born in a foreign country. That document now states Max\u2019s sex as male. A CRBA functions as a birth certificate for all official purposes. Amber Briggle believes going through the State Department simplified the lengthy process. \u201cThe fact that he was born abroad made it significantly easier for us than had he been born here in Texas,\u201d she said. \u201cIn which case, I\u2019m not sure it would have happened at all. At least not at this age. \u201d The family now plans to have a \u201c \u201d baby shower to commemorate the revised paperwork. \u201cI want to have a baby shower for my baby boy,\u201d said Amber Briggle. \u201cHe\u2019s always been my son. But it\u2019s been this very long, gradual process over nine years for us to get to this point, and I feel like that needs to be recognized. \u201d Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742563151.899839}
