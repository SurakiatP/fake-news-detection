The craft began its journey on top of an Atlas 5 rocket that lifted off into the summer sky above Cape Canaveral, Fla. Seven years from now, the craft is to return and parachute a capsule with the asteroid bits into a Utah desert, giving scientists a window to some of the material that made up the early solar system, including some of the molecules that gave rise to life on Earth. Twelve minutes after liftoff, the   engine of the Atlas 5 shut off, leaving   in orbit around Earth. After some coasting, the engine fired again to kick the spacecraft onto a path around the sun. After the craft separated from the second stage, it deployed its solar arrays and established communications with controllers on the ground. \u201dThe   spacecraft is happy and healthy,\u201d said Richard Kuhns, the program manager at Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft. A year from now,   will swing back around and make a close flyby of Earth, using the planet\u2019s gravity to tilt the angle of its orbit to match that of Bennu, a   asteroid that is 1, 600 feet in diameter and has an orbit around the sun similar to Earth\u2019s. It is about as wide as the Empire State Building is tall.    \u2014   a shortening of Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer  \u2014   will catch up to Bennu in 2018, entering orbit for more than a year of observation to allow scientists to figure out where they want to scoop their sample. The spacecraft will then swoop in and touch Bennu\u2019s surface for a few seconds, using a burst of nitrogen to kick up pebbles and dirt.   is to leave Bennu in 2021 and drop off the asteroid samples in 2023.'"}, "time": 1742628505.0104802}
