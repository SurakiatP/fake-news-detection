By `Daily   12, 2016 \\nBillionaire Globalist Soros Exposed as Hidden Hand Behind Trump Protests \u2014 Provoking US \u2018Color Revolution\u2019 \u2026 Billionaire globalist financier George Soros\u2019 MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump \u2014 exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation \u2014 and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. -Free Thought Project \\nTwo recent articles may illustrate a determined attempt to overthrow the Trump victory and substitute a new regime, presumably Hillary\u2019s. \\nOne article, excerpted above, is a clever analysis of the \u201corganic\u201d protests against Trump now taking place in the US, which can certainly be perceived as a domestic \u201ccolor revolution.\u201d The second article, excerpted below, tells us about a \u201cPurple Revolution\u201d now being conducted by the Clintons. \\nTogether, these efforts, if credible, comprise a formidable challenge to the Trump administration, which has not yet even begun to coalesce. \\nThe original color revolutions were conducted against countries abroad to bring them into line with globalist strategies as promoted via American power. US intelligence agencies, the Pentagon and other internationalist facilities domestically and abroad were utilized. \\nIt could be that the same coalition is now at work inside of the US. While this \u201ccolor revolution\u201d may be led by Soros and even partially funded by him, it may be a large effort is underway that includes elements of the US \u201cshadow government.\u201d \\nMore: \\nIn light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it\u2019s an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. \\n\u2026 Now come reports from various protest locations that reveal a substantially coordinated effort, and not the organic grassroots showing by concerned Americans, as the mainstream media is reporting. \\n[Moveon.Org] is one of a number of progressive organizations affiliated with Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation. Soros-affiliated organizations across the world are deeply connected to various color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and a number of other political uprisings across the globe. \\nThis color revolution, if it formally (if secretly) exists, will certainly extend itself, thus proving it is not simply a series of spontaneous expressions. While the article was posted earlier in the week, as of this writing more protests are now being reported via CNN and other media: \\nAnti-Trump protests spread across nation \u2026 Protestors in Atlanta burned a flag near the Georgia capitol \u2026 Thousands took to the streets of cities across the United States late Friday and early Saturday as anti-Donald Trump protests saw highways and interstates blocked, numerous arrests \u2014 and a shooting at a march in Portland, Oregon. \\nAngry crowds gathered once again outside the 58-story Trump Tower, the President-elect\u2019s home in New York. Protester Shoshi \u201cRabin\u201d Rabinowitz explained her motivation for being there: \u201cWords can\u2019t describe how disgusted I am that he was elected over Hillary (Clinton),\u201d she said. \\nMarry this sudden \u201ccolor revolution\u201d to a recently reported and comprehensive \u201cpurple revolution\u201d that has just been initiated by the Clintons and you are presented with a broad-based, efficient, ant-Trump program. Here from Wayne Madsen (also available at ZeroHedge): \\nDefeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is not about to \u00abgo quietly into that good night\u00bb. On the morning after her surprising and unanticipated defeat at the hands of Republican Party upstart Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, entered the ball room of the art-deco New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan and were both adorned in purple attire. \\nThe press immediately noticed the color and asked what it represented. Clinton spokespeople claimed it was to represent the coming together of Democratic \u00abBlue America\u00bb and Republican \u00abRed America\u00bb into a united purple blend. \\n\u2026 The Purple Revolution will resist all efforts by the Trump administration to push back against the globalist policies of the Clintons and soon-to-be ex-President Barack Obama. The Purple Revolution will also seek to make the Trump administration a short one through Soros-style street protests and political disruption. \\nThese two initiatives are separate but together they indicate considerable planning and foresight, One way to look at them is as a formidable reaction to an unexpected Trump victory. Another way is to see them as a planned reaction to a Trump victory that was actually preordained. Everything was prepared, in other words, and now the trigger has been pulled. \\nWe are yet partial to the latter conclusion, believing that both Brexit and the Trump victory could be part of a larger elite manipulation (as we\u2019ve suggested several times already). \\nThe idea behind this latter manipulation would be to create an administration that is seen by people as representing a victory over globalism, but one that is then gradually destroyed and ultimately removed. People would thus realize that there is no alternative to the globalist paradigm they have struggled against. \\nIf this latter perception is correct, then the Trump administration may continue to coalesce and take effect, but it will be accompanied by significant agitation, turmoil and economic and even military violence. You can see some of our other recent articles here and here . \\nTrump may well be dedicated to his cause of \u201cMaking America Great Again,\u201d but the forces arrayed against him are formidable and dedicated to turning his victory into a message of defeat. This would be a classic form of the kind of \u201cdirected history\u201d that we often analyze. It is always married to a dominant social theme \u2013 a meme \u2013 developed as elite propaganda and purveyed by the press. \\nConclusion: In this case the meme informs us that Trump is an impossibly racist and brutal individual who will turn the US into a dictatorship that is easily slotted into a larger, international technocracy. In fact, the danger of this sort of social manipulation comes from Soros and the Clintons \u2013 and the larger shadow state itself. Trump on the other hand is the target.'"}, "time": 1742561862.7061577}
