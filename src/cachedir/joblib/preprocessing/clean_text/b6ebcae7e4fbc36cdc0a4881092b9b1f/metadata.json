{"duration": 1.4399070739746094, "input_args": {"text": "'In the hills and hollows of Mingo County, W. Va. where unemployment is nearly triple the national average, it\u2019s coal. On the southwest side of Chicago, where the landscape couldn\u2019t be more different but the economic fears are much the same, it\u2019s Oreo cookies. Elsewhere, it is cars, computers and  . And whether it is through rolling back regulations, imposing tariffs or making some    phone calls from the Oval Office to the   Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring back the vanishing jobs of miners, bakers and   workers, beginning on Day 1 of his administration. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen fast,\u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, recently told a cheering crowd in Charleston, W. Va. \u201cThis is so easy. \u201d If only that were true. For all of the appeal his message might have for residents there (Mr. Trump captured almost 90 percent of the vote in Mingo County) much of what he is promising to do  \u2014   on his own, and through congressional legislation  \u2014   couldn\u2019t be accomplished in the first 1, 000 days of a Trump administration, much less the first 100. For example, Mr. Trump has suggested easing   regulations enacted by Democrats and Republicans alike that have hurt the coal industry. But King Coal is unlikely to ever recapture market share lost in recent years to natural gas made cheap by the fracking boom, not to mention   alternative energy sources like wind and solar. Nor could Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, force steel makers to buy coal from Appalachia to heat furnaces in Asia, Europe and North America that have been idled by weak demand. \u201cI will not say he can\u2019t do anything, but it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll be able to restore coal to where it was,\u201d said John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. With production and employment in the mines down by about a third since 2008, Mr. Deskins said, \u201ceven in our most optimistic scenario, we don\u2019t expect a big bounce back. \u201d Of course, a Trump presidency is far from certain. And any president\u2019s sway over the national economy is debatable. But a big part of what has gotten Mr. Trump this far are his outsize promises. And while the case of coal and clean air illustrates the limits of a president\u2019s power in the economic arena, there are other places where Mr. Trump would have considerably more room to maneuver. Like much of his speechifying, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic and business agenda is a mixture of opening bids and   messages as well as some    proposals he might be able to put in effect as president, even without congressional approval. Sorting out what\u2019s what, though, isn\u2019t simple or safe. Just ask the pundits who wrote off Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as a sideshow even as he won one primary after another. For his part, Mr. Trump warns it would be a mistake to underestimate his ability to change the rules of the game. \u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ve gotten things done,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus. \u201d But when it comes to companies moving jobs out of the United States, he said a tougher tone was in order. \u201cI\u2019m not Obama, and there are stupid people in our government,\u201d he said. \u201cWith me, there will be consequences if you move, and the consequences will be severe. \u201d In terms of coal and recovering all of those vanished jobs in West Virginia, Mr. Trump acknowledged that price competition from cheaper natural gas was fierce. \u201cBut coal is still less expensive, and it has a major place in terms of energy,\u201d he said. And regulatory relief  \u2014   whether in terms of environmental rules or workplace safety  \u2014   would benefit the industry, he said. \u201cI have become very well versed on coal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe regulations are brutal, and they are sending inspectors into the mines two and three times a day. Even the miners say it\u2019s out of control. \u201d In law firms, corporate boardrooms, lobbyist watering holes and think tanks in Washington and beyond, experts are quietly assessing what a Trump presidency might actually look like in practice. Or to put it more bluntly, business is business. So whether they find Mr. Trump politically abhorrent or a welcome antidote to the status quo, these insiders also want to know what he might mean for their bottom line. National debate: \u201cTrump would put the bully in bully pulpit. \u201d Perhaps the greatest opportunity for Mr. Trump lies in the extraordinary ability of any president to direct the tone and contours of the national debate, especially on issues he has highlighted, like how American companies should treat their American workers. And unlike most past Republican candidates, Mr. Trump has not been reluctant to criticize big business on that topic. \u201cDonald Trump would put the bully in bully pulpit,\u201d said Seth Harris, who served as a top official in the Labor Department under Democratic presidents. Immigration: \u201cWhere the president\u2019s power is least restricted. \u201d Consider immigration, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature issues. He might well be able to deliver on one of his central campaign promises: handing out fewer green cards to foreign workers, or denying a place to   visa holders unless their American employers agree to pay them more. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why so many of Trump\u2019s proposals revolve around the idea of denying visas to people,\u201d said William A. Stock, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is the   of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThat\u2019s where the president\u2019s power is least restricted, if he asserts it. \u201d The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Mr. Stock said, gives the president \u201cthe ability to suspend the entry of foreign nationals whose entry is deemed to be detrimental to the interests of the U. S. \u201d Noting that recent administrations have invoked the law to forbid entry to individuals from the former Yugoslavia accused of human rights violations, as well as to Cuban and Iranian government officials, Mr. Stock said, \u201cThis is a tool that is pretty powerful, but it\u2019s usually been used in more limited instances. \u201d Financial reform: \u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy. \u201d And what about \u201cdismantling\u201d the 2010   financial law, as Mr. Trump promised this month? Repealing the law might be difficult, but experts who helped draft the regulations agreed that Mr. Trump could defang them through selective enforcement  \u2014   appointing different officials to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission  \u2014   and by issuing new executive orders. A President Trump would have wide latitude to name his own people to oversee less conspicuous but powerful agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and to seed Treasury and other government departments with   officials. \u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a top official at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2012 and helped draft the   bill. \u201cRegulators who don\u2019t want to regulate can thwart the will of Congress. \u201d But the president\u2019s reach isn\u2019t unlimited. Nor is it speedy. And however stupendous Mr. Trump\u2019s   skills may be, the forces of gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital are no less awesome. \u201cThe system doesn\u2019t change,\u201d said Tom Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. \u201cTrump can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to repeal this or I\u2019m going to repeal that,\u2019 but it\u2019s going to take longer than 100 days. \u201d Mr. Korologos, who served on the transition teams of President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, isn\u2019t supporting Mr. Trump this year. He added that while the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s promises might make \u201cfor nice talking points, it will be harder than he thinks. \u201d Tax cuts: A Republican Congress is unlikely to accept a $10 trillion deficit over 10 years. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to the macroeconomic picture. Mr. Trump claims his proposal for sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses wouldn\u2019t bust the budget and could lift the economy\u2019s annual growth rate to 6 percent. More   experts say that\u2019s magical thinking, a 2016 version of \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d as President George H. W. Bush famously described what came to be known as Reaganomics in the 1980s. They estimate Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan could create a $10 trillion shortfall at the Treasury over the next decade, and note that annual economic growth has topped 5 percent only once in the last 35 years. \u201cI have a hard time believing that even a Republican Congress would enact his tax plan, because it would create enormous deficits,\u201d said William G. Gale, an economist under the first President Bush who is now   of the Tax Policy Center in Washington. Mr. Trump responded that \u201cthose tax cuts go hand in hand with many other things. \u201d As a result of getting tough on trade policy and what he considers currency manipulation by China, Mr. Trump argues that more jobs would return to the United States, which in turn would spur economic growth and therefore tax revenues. Whether or not that\u2019s realistic, any significant alteration in trade or tax policy means winning over the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, both of which zealously guard their turf. \u201cThis is what makes them tick,\u201d Mr. Korologos said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than just a bunch of rhetoric to change things. \u201d Labor: An ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Like Mr. Korologos, Mr. Harris, the former Labor Department official, has seen the ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Except he was on the opposite side of the aisle, having served on the Democratic transition teams after President Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and after President Obama\u2019s victory in 2008. At Labor, where he was a top adviser under Mr. Clinton, and then as deputy secretary in the Obama administration, Mr. Harris saw firsthand just how much influence the president could have. Tasked with enforcing regulations on whether companies are abiding by minimum wage requirements, child labor restrictions, affirmative action guidelines, workplace safety rules and a web of other laws, Mr. Harris said, the Labor Department has never been very popular with big business or the Republican candidates it supports. And when George W. Bush succeeded Bill Clinton, the change was swift, Mr. Harris said. Budgets were cut, and travel to inspect factories and mines decreased. There was less emphasis on enforcement, going into workplaces and punishing violations, he said, and more on educating employers about potential infractions. After Mr. Harris returned to the Labor Department in 2009, budgets were increased, and surprise workplace inspections were resumed. \u201cWe investigated more deeply, enforced procedures, and were more likely to find violations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no executive order or action by Congress or the White House. We just did it. The laws existed  \u2014   it was a matter of whether you were going to solve the problem aggressively or be more passive. \u201d Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have long argued that regulatory zeal kills jobs and undermines economic growth. Democrats maintain it is necessary to protect employees from abuses and risks, while imposing checks on the power of big companies. Both arguments contain elements of truth. But Mr. Harris said that what was critical was that    civil servants quickly adapted to the message coming down from the Oval Office. \u201cThe president sets the tone for how our government is going to relate to our country,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who is now a lawyer in private practice in Washington. \u201cHow the laws are implemented and enforced, how the money is spent and how motivated people are to do their job. \u201d Health care: \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards. \u201d   isn\u2019t the only big   law Mr. Trump has talked about repealing. The other prominent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire  \u2014   the Affordable Care Act  \u2014   would be trickier to dispose of. Even if Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, simply repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, could bring on a political backlash from the 12. 7 million Americans who are directly covered under the law, not to mention millions more who benefit from provisions like those that allow young adults to be covered under their parents\u2019 policy and those that prevent insurers from dropping coverage for   conditions. Moreover, Mr. Trump displays a lack of understanding of how health insurance works. For example, one specific change in the A. C. A. that Mr. Trump, along with other Republican candidates, has called for  \u2014   allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines  \u2014   is permitted under the law now. The problem, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, is that insurers don\u2019t want to do it because it\u2019s not practical. \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. \u201c   health insurers don\u2019t have networks of doctors and hospitals in place. The problem isn\u2019t legal restraints, and it\u2019s not a solution to what ails the health care economy. \u201d Mr. Trump responded that deregulation is still the answer, despite the skepticism of experts like Mr. Bagley. \u201cThe problem is rules, regulations and restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have rate increases that are catastrophic, and the deductibles are so high people can\u2019t even use the health care. If it was really open and you got competition going, amazing things will happen. \u201d Environment: Sending \u201ca chill down the spine\u201d of people who enforce the laws. Environmental regulation offers a more promising target for Mr. Trump, who has called the Environmental Protection Agency a laughingstock and a disgrace, and has promised to cut its budget. In fact, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration could target many other environmental regulations by simply going after the people who enforce them, said Don Barry, who spent two decades at the Interior Department and directed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under President Clinton. Decades later, Mr. Barry still recalls how a round of firings in the Interior Department at the dawn of the Reagan administration signaled a turnabout in policy. \u201cThe single biggest thing they can do is send a chill down the spine of career survivors in the bureaucracy and bring things to a halt,\u201d he said. Similarly, a Trump administration might be willing to approve state environmental plans that are more friendly to fossil fuels, said Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners. Proposed, but not completed,   regulations aimed at restricting   mining for coal in West Virginia could be eased, he said. Trade: Trump can punish countries, but jobs are unlikely to return. Still, even if Mr. Trump were to win in November and roll back some environmental regulations, it wouldn\u2019t significantly alter the fate of Mingo County and much of the nation\u2019s depressed coal industry. \u201cTaking a more lenient stance on   or   rules would do nothing to help coal demand,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201c  power plants have been mothballed and are being disassembled, and that capacity is gone. It\u2019s not even close to something you could reverse by administrative fiat. \u201d If Washington\u2019s ability to gridlock even the most ambitious of presidential agendas were to block Mr. Trump\u2019s White House plans, he would still have the bully pulpit, of course. And unlike Theodore Roosevelt, who coined that term, Mr. Trump probably wouldn\u2019t speak softly. Still, that might not be enough to keep Oreos baking in Chicago. Nabisco\u2019s bakery there isn\u2019t shuttering completely as Mr. Trump has suggested, but some Oreo production will begin shifting to Salinas, Mexico  \u2014   where Mondelez, Nabisco\u2019s corporate parent, has invested $130 million to build new lines. Oreos will also continue to be produced at Nabisco bakeries in Virginia, New Jersey and Oregon. Announced in July 2015, the Nabisco layoffs in Chicago continued during the Illinois primary in March, despite jabs from Mr. Trump and both Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. United Technologies is similarly unlikely to rethink Carrier\u2019s move out of Indianapolis. And in an era when Apple is willing to fight the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to unlock an iPhone on national security grounds, more corporate defiance may become the norm. Blanketing countries from China to Mexico with import duties would be a tall order without congressional approval. The White House, though, does retain plenty of leeway to punish countries it thinks are engaged in currency manipulation, dumping of products below the cost of production and other   abuses. The problem for Mr. Trump  \u2014   or any president who wants to get tough on trade violators  \u2014   is that, in the global economy, imposing tariffs on competitors abroad could have serious economic consequences at home by sharply raising prices on imported goods. Cheaper   televisions, computers, clothes, furniture and other products from Walmart, Amazon and elsewhere have been a rare bright spot for struggling   and   Americans. And trade wars cut both ways: Retaliatory tariffs on   products from countries like China would prompt howls of pain at still strong domestic manufacturers like Caterpillar and Boeing. But for all the uncertainty around what might happen after Jan. 20, 2017, the lawyers and lobbyists who are now trying to gauge a Trump presidency are already emerging as winners. Mr. Trump\u2019s    unpredictability, Mr. Korologos said, is proving to be a boon for Washington\u2019s legions of lobbyists. \u201cCorporate America hates the unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cGod only knows what the hell Trump is for. And corporate America is going to want someone to save them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563312.3679276}
