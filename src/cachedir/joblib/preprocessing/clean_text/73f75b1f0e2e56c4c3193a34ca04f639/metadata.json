On Thursday, he tried out his latest project, \u201cThe Floating Piers,\u201d a walkway stretching three kilometers, or nearly two miles, that connects two small islands in Lake Iseo, in Italy\u2019s Lombardy region, to each other and to the mainland. Christo stepped out on the floating walkway of puckered   nylon fabric, designed to change color according to the time of the day and the weather. On Thursday, it was pockmarked with bright orange blotches left by footsteps treading on the   fabric. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very painterly, like an abstract painting, but it will change all the time,\u201d Christo, 81, a   American, said of his project. \u201cThe Floating Piers\u201d is his first outdoor installation since 2005, when he and   his collaborator and wife, installed 7, 500   gates in Central Park in New York City. Like his other environmental artworks, which try to reframe familiar landscapes, the 15 million euro project (or $16. 8 million) will be funded through the sale of his original drawings and collages. \u201cI think this is a record in the history of Christo\u2019s special projects because he and the team realized it in 22 months normally it takes decades,\u201d the curator Germano Celant, the project\u2019s director, said. \u201cSo I will say that it\u2019s an Italian and American miracle at the same time. \u201d Walking on the floating pier, as I discovered, is akin to being on a lightly rocking boat, without feeling wary about suddenly toppling over should a strong wave arrive. Shoes are optional, and it\u2019s probably worth taking them off, at least for a moment, to feel the fabric\u2019s texture. (There is a layer of felt beneath the saffron cover.) When wet, the walkway is a little squishy when sunny, it should feel warm to the toes. \u201cLook!\u201d Christo said, pointing to a juncture where two pathways joined to form a bright   V, contrasting against the deep blue of the lake. \u201cYou see! It falls in that way so you can see the movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually breathing. \u201d Getting the walkway to both gently undulate and remain securely affixed to the uneven lake bottom was a feat that has occupied engineers, construction companies, French   divers and even a team of Bulgarian athletes drafted over the past two years. The walkway is assembled from 220, 000   polyethylene cubes that form its    (53 feet) spine, covered this week with a waterproof and   fabric made by a German company for the project. \u201cEach project is like a slice of our lives,\u201d Christo said, \u201cand part of something that I will never forget. \u201d From Saturday through July 3, the project will be open and free to the public 24 hours a day, with a legion of boat hands, lifeguards, monitors and information officers standing guard to avert unintentional dips in the lake. \u201cIt\u2019s really a physical thing, you need to be there, walking it, on the streets, here,\u201d Christo said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s demanding. \u201d The route, which laps around the small island of San Paolo, also includes pedestrian areas in the towns of Sulzano, on the mainland, and Peschiera Maraglio, on Monte Isola, an islet rising out of the lake. The project, he said, \u201cis all this\u201d  \u2014   the piers, the lake, the mountains, \u201cwith the sun, the rain, the wind, it\u2019s part of the physicality of the project, you have to live it. \u201d \u201cI know these projects are totally irrational, totally useless,\u201d he added. \u201cThe world can live without them, nobody needs them, only me and  . She always made the point that they exist because we like to have them, and if others like them, it\u2019s only a bonus. \u201d Christo, whose full name is Christo Javacheff, and his wife, who died in 2009, envisaged a floating piers project 46 years ago, when they were approached by an Argentine art historian who suggested the R\u00edo de la Plata basin in South America as a site, but the plans fell through. Drawings for that version are on display at the Museo di Santa Giulia, in nearby Brescia.  In 1995, they considered reviving it in Tokyo Bay, but that project, too, was never realized. Yet Christo was determined. \u201cSome projects remain in your heart,\u201d he said. Apart from the sporadic protests of labor unions and a national environmental organization that was worried about the impact on the lake, the Italian project went smoothly after local officials and administrators came on board. Christo said it was about positively exploiting \u201cthe incredible chemistry of humans\u201d from all walks of life, each member of the team focusing energy on \u201csomething that does not exist\u201d  \u2014   to the point where it does. He was also relieved that there was never a discussion with officials about installing a safety fence along the sides of the walkway, allowing visitors to walk to the edge of the water. \u201cThe moment you have a parapet, forget it,\u201d he said, the feeling of walking on water is gone. Other concerns about the ability of a small lake community to deal with the avalanche of visitors that the walkway is expected to draw  \u2014   an estimated 40, 000 people a day  \u2014   appear to have been muted for now by enthusiasm for the project. Lake Iseo is perhaps northern Italy\u2019s least famous lake, overshadowed by the neighboring Lake Garda. But hotels and other lodging options here and in nearby towns are nearly booked for the duration of the run. \u201cLake Iseo won\u2019t be the same after this event,\u201d said Fiorello Turla, the mayor of Monte Isola. \u201cMonte Isola will change skin,\u201d as its exposure to the global spotlight puts it on the map, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity that we\u2019ve been given and that we want to seize and bring forward. \u201d At the close of its   run, the walkway will be dismantled and its parts recycled and resold. \u201cThe important part of this project is the temporary part, the nomadic quality,\u201d Christo said. \u201cThe work needs to be gone, because I do not own the work, no one does. This is why it is free. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628514.1078935}
