The Trump administration wasted little time in striking its targets, marking a stark contrast with its predecessor,\u201d the Times observed. \u201cThe US\u2019 decision to attack the Assad government is a show of force from the US president. He wants to prove that he dares to do what Obama dared not,\u201d the article continues, referring to President Barack Obama\u2019s declaration that using chemical weapons was a \u201cred line\u201d after Assad was accused of using them, but not issuing any military response to the act. Trump, the Times concluded, \u201cwants to prove to the world that he is no \u2018businessman president\u2019 and that he will use US military force without hesitation when he considers it necessary. \u201d The article concludes that the strikes themselves \u201cleave an impression that the decision was made in haste and are not without contradictions. \u201d President Trump announced late Thursday that he ordered the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian army airbase believed to house the equipment used for an alleged chemical weapons attack in Idlib province. The Pentagon issued a statement confirming that the objective of the strikes was \u201cto deter the [Assad] regime from using chemical weapons again. \u201d The Global Times response to the strikes differed significantly from the official Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. Spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that Chinese officials \u201coppose the use of chemical weapons by any country, organization or person for any purpose and under any circumstance\u201d and that China \u201csupports relevant UN agencies in carrying out independent and comprehensive investigations into all uses or suspected uses of chemical weapons and, on the basis of solid evidence, reaching a conclusion which can stand the test of history and facts. We have noted the latest developments. \u201d While emphasizing support for a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the Syrian Civil War, Hua refused to answer whether China considers Assad\u2019s regime \u201cthe sole legitimate government in Syria\u201d and did not directly criticize the U. S. airstrikes, instead stating, \u201cthe Chinese side always opposes the use of force in international relations. \u201d   President Xi Jinping is currently meeting with President Trump in Florida, on a visit scheduled long before the escalation of affairs in Syria. Trump reportedly said of their meeting, \u201cI think,   we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it,\u201d predicting \u201clots of very potentially bad problems will be going away. \u201d According to the Chinese state news outlet Xinhua, Xi invited Trump to visit China and enjoyed \u201c  friendly and   conversation\u201d with Trump.
