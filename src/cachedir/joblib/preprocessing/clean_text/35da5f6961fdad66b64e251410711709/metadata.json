Is Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s enduringly popular \u201cThe Mikado\u201d a droll satire of Victorian England? A racist caricature of Japan? Some amalgam of the two? Recent revivals have ended up in the cross hairs of these questions, sparking protests across the nation, along with earnest wondering about how  \u2014   and even if  \u2014   this 1885 piece should be staged in the 21st century. When an outcry arose last year over a planned revival of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players\u2019 old production  \u2014   which had featured a mostly white cast in yellowface makeup, and employed some ugly stereotypes to evoke the imaginary Japanese town of Titipu  \u2014   the company initially responded by saying that it would scrap the makeup. Then, realizing that the complications were more than skin deep, it decided to scrap the entire staging and take a year to rethink its approach, diversify its cast and create a new show. The result will open on Wednesday at Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College in Manhattan. Finding the right balance is not easy: Some of the most severe critics of \u201cThe Mikado\u201d find it too inherently offensive to be performed, while some ardent fans view any changes as bows to excessive political correctness. Shortly after the New York company announced it was replacing last year\u2019s \u201cMikado\u201d with \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance,\u201d David Wannen, its executive director, received a letter from a   pirate who complained that he was offended that the troupe did not plan to cast real pirates. David Auxier, the director of the new \u201cMikado\u201d production, recalled that \u201cSometimes the conversation got to be: \u2018You\u2019re never going to please everybody, so why try? \u2019\u201d He added: \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re starting from the understanding that we\u2019re never going to please everybody. But we\u2019re still going to try. \u2019\u201d As the use of yellowface  \u2014   which can refer not only to makeup, but to broader attempts at racial impersonation or caricature  \u2014   has drawn protests at \u201cMikado\u201d revivals from Seattle to New York, companies presenting it have responded with a variety of approaches. A   2013 staging by Skylark Opera and Mu Performing Arts in St. Paul inverted the libretto, setting the piece in England and casting   actors in key roles. This year, the Lamplighters Music Theater in San Francisco decided not to set its new production in Japan after local   performers threatened protests. Instead it moved the action to Renaissance Italy and changed the opening line from \u201cIf you want to know who we are, we are gentlemen of Japan\u201d to \u201cIf you want to know who we are, we are gentlemen of Milan. \u201d A production by the   Gilbert and Sullivan Players this fall was set in a 1960s   hotel in Las Vegas to, as the organizers put it, \u201crecontextualize the origins of the show in Japonisme and commodity racism. \u201d It still drew protests. In New York, emotions have run high on all sides. A Save the Mikado NYC Facebook page sprang up, calling for the operetta \u201cto be performed exactly as conceived by Gilbert and Sullivan, with only a very small number of minor alterations that have been standard for over half a century. \u201d Another Facebook group, Artists Against The Mikado, was \u201cdedicated to the controversial idea that minstrel shows where white people dress up as fake Japanese is a little out of date. \u201d The old \u201cMikado\u201d production had used yellowface, and the troupe had invented a minor role, played by a child, that was credited as a \u201ccoolie,\u201d which company officials said they had not realized was a slur. A 2004 version of the staging included \u201ca man with a Fu Manchu mustache and impossibly long fingernails,\u201d Josephine Lee, a professor of English and   Studies at the University of Minnesota, writes in her influential 2010 book, \u201cThe Japan of Pure Invention: Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s \u2018The Mikado,\u2019\u201d which traces the work\u2019s long, complex racial history. In an interview, Ms. Lee questioned the commonly heard defense that \u201cThe Mikado\u201d should not be considered racist because it is meant in fun. \u201cThere are lots of instances in blackface minstrelsy that are lighthearted and funny  \u2014   and also offensive,\u201d she said. Before mounting their new \u201cMikado,\u201d the New Yorkers sought advice, listened to critics and sent out casting calls that stressed a desire for diversity. At a forum held in November at the Kaye Playhouse, Jonathan Jenkins Ichikawa, a professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia who has performed in Gilbert and Sullivan works, noted that many of the most offensive elements of recent productions were invented by stage directors. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do a lot of violence to the work to not tape actor\u2019s eyes back to make their eyes look \u2018slanty,\u2019\u201d he said, recalling productions he had appeared in that did just that. So the New York company set about trying to strip away those elements. Like Mike Leigh\u2019s 1999 film \u201c\u201d which told the story of Gilbert and Sullivan as they created \u201cThe Mikado,\u201d the new production will firmly establish the operetta as a work of the Victorian imagination. A new prologue features the composer and librettist planning their next opera and admiring some Japanese objects. When a sword falls, knocking Gilbert unconscious, he dreams \u201cThe Mikado\u201d proper, set in an imaginary Japan as conceived by a   Englishman. The production will emphasize the work\u2019s satire of Victorian mores, and do away with racially charged performance tics and excessive bowing and shuffling in its choreography. While the ensemble would never be mistaken for, say, the multicultural cast of \u201cHamilton,\u201d it is the troupe\u2019s most diverse yet. Erin Quill, an   actress, wrote about the controversy last year on her lively blog, The Fairy Princess Diaries. Ms. Quill, who spoke at the company\u2019s forum in November, said in an interview that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the new production. \u201cAm I glad this conversation is happening?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbsolutely. Do I wish this conversation had been 20 years ago? Of course. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562959.5783784}
