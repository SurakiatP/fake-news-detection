Editor's Note If you learn nothing else from reading Eliason\u2019s \u201cEmigre\u201d series, you should take away how interlinked world events truly are. When you add in the machinations of various intelligence agencies and national covert operations groups, tracing a thread through from point A to point B can become an epic journey. It is also a journey that leaves you wondering whose interests are being served? In answering that question, it becomes clear that the answer is much more likely a small, influential group than a nation state. Just look at the map of the countries involved in Syria\u2019s \u201ccivil war,\u201d and it becomes exceedingly clear that what is happening in Syria is anything but a civil war. It also casts a totally different light on Europe\u2019s rejection of Syrian refugees. How cruel and mean spirited can you get than to be involved in the war that has displaced most of a nation\u2019s population, and then close your borders to those displaced? \\nW hether you are for Hillary Clinton or against her, the problem with Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t her lack of experience. Almost the entire political establishment is behind her. Throughout all the bumps and scandal in this whole election cycle, Republicans and former presidents are coming out of the woodwork supporting her. According to the LA Times she may well be one of the most experienced candidates in US history, even accounting for severe conflicts of interest inside the Clinton Foundation. Neither friend or foe doubt Hillary Clinton\u2019s experience after 30 years in politics. \\nThe problem is even Hillary Clinton\u2019s friends say she has, is a history of acting without thinking, of making bad decisions. According to Neera Tanden : \u201cAlmost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible.\u201d \\nDoes Hillary Clinton show bad instincts and terrible decision-making skills, and if she does, how will this affect the USA? \\nAccording to journalist Robert Parry \u201cthe people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe \u201cThis consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East\u2026 Taken together, the studies and reports call for more aggressive American action to constrain Iran, rein in the chaos in the Middle East and check Russia in Europe.\u201dOne of the lead organizations revving up these military adventures and also counting on a big boost in military spending under President Clinton-45 is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO that has been pushing for a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.\u201d \\nThe Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC which is associated with NATO. The CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) has only one goal. At the beginning of the presidential campaign they put out a small list of questions for the candidates to decide who they would support for the president. \\nThe first question was essentially \u201cAre you willing to go to war with Russia?\u201d Hillary Clinton has answered that question and received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. Who is the CEEC? \\nThe Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. \\nIf that seems a little too much to be believable, reconsider the Iraq war. All it took was for the Iraqi diaspora to develop strong ties with like-minded people f rom \u201c The Project for the New American Century\u201d that wanted regime change in Iraq. Many of the people associated with the PNAC crossed over into the Bush administration . They pushed the invasion together. \\nJosh DeWind\u2019s and Renata Segura\u2019s paper Diaspora-Government Relations in Forging US-Foreign Policies utilized the following source to discuss the diaspora link to US-Iraqi relations: \\nWalt Vanderbush\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Iraqi Diaspora and the US Invasion of Iraq\u201d (chapter 9), traces the collaboration between leaders of the Iraqi diaspora and neoconservative Americans, many of them linked to the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), to convince the US government to wage war and bring about \u201cregime change\u201d in Iraq\u2026 The INC claimed credit for placing 108 articles in the news media, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Times (of London), during a nine-month period before the war.\u201d \\nIt wasn\u2019t terror, Osama, or even oil that the Iraq war was fought for. It was a guy named Ahmed Chalabi who was the only victor of the Iraq war. \\nAmerican-emigre groups use their strategically settled populations in key battleground states, deep pockets, and unbridled political ambition to gain control over their home \u201cold\u201d countries. Even more insidious is the influence they exert over the United States to destroy old enemies. \\nDo we want senior cabinet and policy positions filled by people who think starting WWIII is a good goal? Let\u2019s take a look at the make-up and politics of some of these. \\nStarting at the top let\u2019s look at the Ukrainian emigres who lead the CEEC and the Atlantic Council. One thing anyone represented by the UCCA (Ukrainian Congressional Committee of America) or the UWC (Ukrainian World Congress) has in common is Axis-political heritage and beliefs. The OUN is the political grouping of Ukrainian nationalists and it would vote for Adolf Hitler if he was running in a heartbeat. \\nUnless real Nazi political views (not neo-nazi) found a way to survive all these years with this group of people, the statement is just insulting. Anyone reading should be insulted because that level of offensiveness in a politically charged environment is wrong. \\nNazism or Axis-Nazism are political beliefs and principles that structure a government the same as Republican or Democratic control would. The only difference is the \u201cism.\u201d The \u201cism\u201d means everything you do in your life revolves around your politic so it\u2019s not just political or social guides or guidelines. It\u2019s your lifestyle and everything wraps around it. Anything or anyone that goes against it is an enemy of the state, and it is personal. \\nFrom their own words in the Ukrainian Weekly, real, active political Nazi\u2019s are alive, kickin\u2019 and ready for a Clinton win! It is the sheer number of groups self-identifying as practicing real Nazi beliefs in the US gaining policy and cabinet positions under a Clinton win that is incredible. \\nThe Ukrainian World Congress, with its affiliates in over 40 countries , and others work tirelessly in trying to keep Ukraine and the Ukrainian spirit front and center. \u201cWe have had a minister of finance, Natalka Jaresko, in the Cabinet. We now have Ulana Suprun as acting minister of health. We have many from the diaspora assisting with strategizing, reforming and supporting the overall cause. We have a highly successful program in Patriot Defence. We are out to change the way business is done. Unity to act when required has been the diaspora\u2019s mantra \u2013 this cannot be disputed. As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN \u2013 (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi \u2013 are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.\u201d \\nWith all you\u2019ve heard about Stepan Bandera\u2019s OUN since the Maidan coup in Ukraine, I\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t know they call New York, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia home. \\nThe UCCA and the UWC still celebrate their Nazi SS because they are still Axis-nazis. The OUN were the vile Holocaust murderers during and after WWII and their politics live on in their children today. This is no different from the children of other Waffen-SS leaders, or if Hitler had surviving children that stood up and ran other countries based in Hitler\u2019s policy. These American kids are sent to Ukraine to learn how to copy and act like Stepan Bandera before they come back to America and get involved in policy making. \\n\u201c OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools (MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000\u2019s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by \u201cmoderates\u201d like David Duke (former head of the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S.) who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.\u201d \\nWhile American media criticizes David Duke\u2019s support for Donald Trump, they say nothing about Hillary\u2019s strongest supporters hiring David Duke as a professor to teach their children college level history. Is Hillary Clinton too far right for David Duke? After all, he has no plans to conquer Russia. \\nWhen you look at her campaign coffers and the most active political activists supporting Hillary Clinton, many are groups whose politics are not republican or democrat, but old-world nationalist. They are spread across America and still idolize their Waffen SS heroes, literally. They have statues and holidays and children\u2019s groups across America in cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago celebrating some of the vilest mass murderers in history. And they teach their children to idolize them and grow up using them as role models. They also bring up their children in the same political mold of ultra-nationalism. \\nNow they want an America that will do the same. Over the last 30 years, the old world nationalists have moved into media and policy positions to make this happen. If that wasn\u2019t enough they control a 20 million person bloc vote in key states and swing states in important cities across America. \\nI am not using the word nazi as an insult, this isn\u2019t neo-nazi or even a nazi revival. These groups have been the most extreme political activists in the USA over the last 50 years and are a continuation of what their parents were in the 1930\u2019s. In their own words, they never assimilated into American culture. They assimilated the culture to them. In the words of the CIA, they are political animals. Today, their wagons are circled around a Hillary Clinton presidency. \\nThe OUN were the guards at the Holocaust prison camps, Waffen SS, and volunteer brigades that were famous for torture and murder. In Ukraine, they killed over 3 million people and conducted the first act of Holocaust at Babi Yar. \\nThe funny part, if there was one, is that with every fiber of your being, you want to argue against these facts. The OUN on the other hand featured at least one of my articles on their rise in American politics even though I called them devils. The fact they find me credible shouldn\u2019t get lost on you. \\nWhen these good friends of Hillary Clinton from the CEEC start getting tapped for advisory posts, and cabinet positions through the Atlantic Council or Project for a New American Century, will they automatically become Democrats or Republicans? \\nDoes America want a war with Russia so the losers of WWII can settle old scores? \\nFor the first time, under a Clinton presidency, America will have unbridled Axis-nazis/old world nationalists/ nazis in most of the cabinet and policy positions. They are getting the positions because they are delivering donations, bloc votes, political propaganda, and hard activism in battleground states. \\nThe results for the Clinton campaign in emigre dominated states is the same as it was when they first got together. Clinton is up by 11 points in important emigre bloc voting districts. \u2026In last month\u2019s heavily publicized Pennsylvania Senate race. Ukrainian and Baltic groups, protesting the administration\u2019s attempts to prevent the break-up of the USSR, supported the Democratic candidate, Harris Wofford. This position contributed to the defeat of Dick Thornburgh, a former attorney general in the Bush administration\u2026.\u201dThe Ukrainian Weekly, December 8, 1991, No. 49, Vol. LIX \\nIn a Ukraine Weekly interview with candidate Bill Clinton- \u201c For the last 40 years, many Ukrainians have been supporters of the Republican Party . However, Mr. Bush severely damaged his relations with Ukrainians with his \u201cChicken Kiev\u201d speech, and by his unwillingness to see Ukraine\u2019s point of view in disputes with Russia. How will your party seek to secure the goodwill of voters concerned by this issue?\u201d \u2026 Clinton\u2019s answer\u2026\u201cThe Bush administration has had a spotty record abroad\u2026 including the president\u2019s insulting warning against \u201csuicidal nationalism\u201d made before proindependence forces in Kiev in the summer of 1991 \u2014 and a failed economic record at home. We hope Ukrainian Americans will join our effort to put people first.\u201d \u2013 Interview with Candidate Bill Clinton-Ukrainian Weekly Issue 43, 1992 \\nIn what has become the ultimate pay to play scheme, the Clinton\u2019s gave over Ukraine to OUNb nationalists to run as they saw fit. This was payment for political support and bloc votes that won the 1992 elections for Bill Clinton. American citizens were given a country to run and represent in any manner they chose to do it. \\nAccording to Ukrainian nationalist scholar Taras Kuzio , the Axis-nazi political beliefs started to be taught to children in Ukraine after the OUNb took the reins. This was the preparation for what would become a nationalist coup in 2014 Ukraine. \\nThis pattern follows the Clinton-NATO expansion and every CEE (Central and Eastern European) country freed by the Clintons followed suit. In Croatia, Croatian-Americans have more parliamentary seats and representation than any group from Croatia. \\nOther than American-emigre groups gaining rule and representing the \u201chome country\u201d in the US, there is only one other universal factor each of them revived. Axis- nazi politics and political views became normal in their home countries. In Croatia, they even revived the Waffen SS Battalions. \\nThe people at the CEEC are behind the Atlantic Council and PNAC will be making the domestic and foreign policy decisions in a Clinton administration. While I would not call Hillary Clinton a Nazi, the people she surrounds herself with actively are. There is very little doubt that Victoria Nuland, a Ukrainian-American brought up in these beliefs will be Secretary of State under a Clinton Administration. \\nTo get an understanding of what that means, the same people that are deciding Ukrainian domestic and foreign policy will be sending their people to those cabinet positions. \\nThe one thing for sure is even publications that support her candidacy wonder about Hillary Clinton\u2019s lack of judgment and surrounding herself with nationalist war-hawks that want war with Russia. \\nAccording to the WEEK : \u201cAt first, Obama went over the top of public opinion to avenge American honor against ISIS. Slowly, America\u2019s mission has crept to include some form of regime change with the ouster of Assad. Now Clinton is selling the American people on greater military interventions so that the U.S. can challenge Putin. Clinton seems unable to distinguish between what is of vital interest to the Russians and peripheral interest to America. She combines this with her bias toward always taking action \u2014 of any sort, for good or ill. The combination is dangerous.\u201d \\nThe article ends in the hope that Clinton is once again lying. Both current president Obama and Hillary Clinton are trying to sell America on the idea that there are moderates fighting a civil war in Syria. We are arming and training them. Are there moderates in Syria worth supporting? Do we have any business there to begin with? The article goes as far as stating the US is determined to overthrow every country that is friendly to Russia. \\nRight now Clinton wants to establish a no-fly-zone to protect her moderates. Who are they? US Special Forces on the ground are adamant that Clinton wants to give US military support to ISIS even if it means starting an open war with Russia. \\n\u201c Nobody believes in it. You\u2019re like, \u2018Fuck this,\u2019\u201d a former Green Beret says of America\u2019s covert and clandestine programs to train and arm Syrian militias. \u201cEveryone on the ground knows they are jihadis. No one on the ground believes in this mission or this effort, and they know they are just training the next generation of jihadis, so they are sabotaging it by saying, \u2018Fuck it, who cares?\u2019\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for Nusra guys saying they were trained by Americans,\u201d the Green Beret added. \\nSince 2014, Ukraine has fully supported al Nusra and at the beginning of the civil war pulled 200 ISIS fighters to the Ukrainian front lines. These fighters are jihadis from Crimea. They have also set up an ISIS training camp near Mariupol. Like all other volunteers, they don\u2019t receive government support and rob to make a living. \\nBefore this, the Kosovo example looms large. Does inviting indicted mass murderers and people preparing for illegal organ trade (crimes against humanity) trials to your national party convention as special guests qualify as good judgment? Does it showcase Hillary Clinton\u2019s good instincts to be president? \\nWelcome to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton\u2019s special guest from Kosovo took time-out from preparing for his crimes against humanity case to give support and wish her well. \u201cInvited as a guest to the 2016 Democratic National Convention is none other than Kadri Veseli, the Speaker of the Kosovo Assembly. Veseli is a former Kosovar Albanian leader of the KLA and its spy organization SHIK. He\u2019s being indicted along with the current president of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci for small things like organ trafficking and crimes against humanity .\u2019 The main witness against Clinton friends, Veseli and Thaci, is a man that was ordered to cut the heart out of another man that was begging for mercy. In a 1998 interview with the BBC , US special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard had this to say about Veseli and Thaci; \u201cI know a terrorist when I see one and these men are terrorists.\u201d \\nClinton\u2019s relationship with the Albanian and Kosovo killers stretches back to the Bill Clinton\u2019s first election in 1992. During the campaign season the Clinton duo found out quickly how powerful the emigre national vote was in America. In one fell swoop, the Albanians and the KLA after them went from what the USA definitely recognized as Islamic terrorists to victims we were going to war for. \\nThe Clinton humanitarian bombing in the Balkans drove victims into the waiting clutches of the KLA, and the spread of Islamic terrorism worldwide. \\nIn what became her first executive decision, first lady, Hillary Clinton brow-beat the unwilling president Clinton into bombing the Balkans and creating a humanitarian catastrophe. Today, as a result of this, ISIS is setting up training camps in what is widely referred to as \u201cClinton country. \u201c \\n\u201c On the territory of Kosovo and Metohija , the local police detained three militants of so-called \u201cIslamic State\u201d (a terrorist organization banned in Russia), is going to organize a series of terrorist attacks in Serbia.\u201d Terrorists LIH (IGIL/ISIS) break through the Balkans to Western Europe March 2016. \\nClinton\u2019s jihadi bloc vote in America remains central to her winning this election along with the rest of the CEEC. Does America want people advising the president that openly support genocide like the Kosovars, Albanians, or Ukrainians? \\nHillary Clinton is not an Islamist. Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But the question remains. Why is she surrounded by, and listening to, people that are? Is that her best judgment? GH Eliason Mr. Eliason l ives in Ukraine.
