Stories of Hillary Clinton\u2019s affinity for alcohol have been around for years, and some of them, even in her own words, are legendary. Consider her vodka drinking contest with Senator John McCain. Here it is, told by none other than Democrat Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, in her own words and posted on her Facebook page: \\nThen of course, there is the \u201ctrip\u201d Yemen. Watch her walk, her mannerisms, and her fall. Pay close attention: \\nOur video study is just getting started, though now is a good time to mention the latest from WikiLeaks on the topic of Hillary\u2019s \u201csobriety.\u201d \\nOn August 8, 2015, Hillary\u2019s Campaign Chairman John Podesta wrote to Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, \u201cShould I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you? I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll get on with Cheryl and we\u2019ll end up in a bad place. I\u2019m in a session that lasts till 3:30 your time. Is that timely or should I walk out?\u201d \\nTwo hours later, Palmieria responded, \u201cI think you should call her and sober her up some.\u201d \\nIt was 4:30pm, in the afternoon, and her staff is interested in sobering her up. \\nHillary\u2019s campaign staff are not the only one\u2019s to have noticed her drinking. \\nAmy Chozick, a reporter for the New York Times, explained, \u201cShe likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.\u201d \\nIn October of 2016, Chozick sent the following tweet: \\nMakes sense, especially in light of campaign videos like this one: \\n\u2014 Elizabeth Harrington (@LizWFB) October 10, 2016 \\nEvidently, drinking is one of Hillary\u2019s political strategies. \\nIn a July 3 article, the New York Times reported that Hillary plans to \u201cseek common ground with the G.O.P. over drinks\u201d in her first 100 days. \\nIt continued, \u201cMrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to use alcohol as a political lubricant came up repeatedly when allies and advisers were asked how she might work with Republicans. Her tale about a drinking contest with Senator John McCain of Arizona is now a Washington legend. (She said they called it quits before things got out of hand.) She believes that a relaxed, frank discussion is more authentic than trying to bond awkwardly with adversaries over sports \u2014 and more productive than keeping them at arm\u2019s length, as Mr. Obama has often done. \\n\u201c\u2018She likes to cajole, she likes to make deals, and she likes to make friends,\u2019 said Richard Socarides, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton and a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton. \u2018And she knows it\u2019s much harder to go after someone who you basically like, who you\u2019ve had a drink with.\u2019\u201d \\nOne of Hillary\u2019s confidantes, Patti Solis Doyle, once remarked, \u201cShe likes to hang out and drink and gossip.\u201d Her drink of choice? Wine and vodka. \\nOn that note, have a look at this these gems: \\nAnd another, this time, TWO-FISTED! \\n\\nPeople have asked: Did Hillary Clinton\u2019s alcohol usage lead to her current neurological condition? \\nYet another video look:'"}, "time": 1742561919.0556357}
