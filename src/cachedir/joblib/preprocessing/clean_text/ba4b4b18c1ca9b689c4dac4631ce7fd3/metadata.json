[Stephen Tennes, the owner of Country Mill Farms, has sold his fruit and vegetables at the East Lansing Farmer\u2019s Market for the past seven years. After city officials learned of his Christian belief that marriage is the union between one man and one woman, they invoked a   policy to exclude him from being able to sell at the farmers\u2019 market.   Tennes says he was barred from selling his produce after his business, Country Mill Farms, refused to host a lesbian couple\u2019s wedding at its orchard in Charlotte, 22 miles outside East Lansing. Explaining his position on Facebook, Tennes cited his \u201cCatholic belief that marriage is a sacramental union between one man and one woman. \u201d In a statement, the city of East Lansing said the farmer\u2019s decision not to host a   wedding violated a \u201c  ordinance that protects sexual orientation as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that grants the right for   couples to be married. \u201d In point of fact, the city introduced a modification to the city\u2019s farmers market vendor agreement just this year requiring sellers to comply with East Lansing\u2019s Human Relations Ordinance. Among other things, the ordinance prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. The city\u2019s punitive action targets the farmer\u2019s use of his own private property, 22 miles outside the city and well outside its jurisdiction. Mr. Tennes has declared that he does not discriminate against LGBT customers at the farmer\u2019s market, and gladly sells his produce to all comers. \u201cIt\u2019s our faith that informs us how to treat all who come to our farm and the farmers market with dignity and decency   \u2026     serving customers of many races, religions, cultures and those who identify with the LBGT community,\u201d he said. When it came to actually hosting a   marriage that contradicts his biblical understanding of the nature of marriage, Tennes felt obliged to decline. \u201cOur faith and beliefs on marriage and hosting weddings at our home and in our backyard of our farm have nothing to do with the city of East Lansing,\u201d Tennes said at a press conference. According to Gay Star News, the biblical view of marriage is \u201chomophobic\u201d and the City of East Lansing barred Tennes for his \u201chomophobic religious views. \u201d On Wednesday, May 31, Tennes filed a federal lawsuit against the city of East Lansing seeking his reinstatement at the market.  According to the lawsuit, Country Mill is the only business to have been prohibited under the market\u2019s   policy. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization specializing in religious liberty cases, is representing Tennes. They have asserted that his religious views on marriage have no bearing on his involvement at the market and said the city\u2019s actions amounted to a First Amendment violation. \u201cSteve and his farm have been singled out and excluded from full participation in the life of the community for only one reason,\u201d said ADF counsel Kate Anderson. \u201cSteve expressed a viewpoint the city did not like. \u201d \u201cIf the government can shut down a family farmer just because of the religious views he expresses on Facebook   \u2026     then no American is free,\u201d Anderson said.
