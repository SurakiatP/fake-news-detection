Archuleta now faces charges of misdemeanor theft, 1st-degree official misconduct and tampering with physical evidence. \\nAccording to an arrest affidavit, Archuleta responded to a call of shots fired in the early morning hours of October 7. The call then led to a short pursuit which ended as the car crashed. The driver got away while the passenger of the vehicle was knocked unconscious. \\nArchuleta\u2019s body camera then recorded the officer for the next 24 minutes and 40 seconds. In the footage, he took pictures of the scene and then searched the man\u2019s clothing which had been removed by paramedics. \\nIn the video, Archuleta finds a stack of cash in the man\u2019s pants with a $100 bill on top, according to the arrest affidavit. He then separates the $100 bill from the stack and a $1 bill remains on top. \\nThroughout the footage, Archuleta shuffles money and rearranges paperwork in his patrol car, the affidavit said. \\nAccording to the Denver Post, when a detective collected the cash and logged it into the property bureau as evidence, he counted $118 and did not find any $100 bills, the affidavit said. But while reviewing Archuleta\u2019s body camera footage as part of the investigation, the detective noticed the $100 bill. \\nAmazingly enough, instead of covering up the theft, the detective crossed the thin blue line and reported the inconsistency with the $100 bill to internal affairs. When confronted by investigators, Archuleta told them he would \u201ccheck his war bag\u201d to see if any of the money had slipped into a crevice in his patrol car. \\nAccording to the arrest affidavit, Archuleta called the detective back an hour later and claimed he found 12 $100 bills that \u201cmust have fallen in his bag.\u201d After being caught red-handed, Archuleta then turned in the money. \\nAccording to the Post, the Denver district attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute the shooting suspect because of the missing cash and because Archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside the suspect\u2019s vehicle before detectives had a search warrant, the affidavit said. \\nEarlier this year, the Denver police department was equipped with body cameras. We now know why it took so long for the department to adopt them. Archuleta will now go down in history as the first Denver cop to be criminally charged based on body camera evidence. \\nLike most cases of police theft, this incident is not isolated. In fact, just 2 months ago, Grants Police Department Sgt. Roshern C. McKinney, 33, was arrested after an investigation found that he\u2019d stolen both money and marijuana from the police department. Like Archuleta, he entire theft was captured on the officer\u2019s own body camera. McKinney has since been charged with marijuana distribution, conspiracy, and felony embezzlement. \\nState police also charged McKinney\u2019s 23-year-old girlfriend Tanicka Gallegos-Gonzales, for drug distribution and conspiracy. Both were arrested in Albuquerque and booked into the Sandoval County Detention Center, according to KOB. \\nPublic Information Officer for the New Mexico State Police, Elizabeth Armijo said Grants police chief, Craig Vandiver alerted state police after the department found video from Mckinney\u2019s lapel camera that \u201cexposed possible illicit activity by a Grants Police Department sergeant.\u201d \\nWhat does it say about the criminal tendency of some police officers when they are unable to practice restraint from theft \u2014 knowing that they are being recorded?

This \u201ccivilian\u201d was fleeing a scene of \u201cshots fired\u201d leading the cop in a short chase before crashing. \\nStupid MSM puppets.'"}, "time": 1742563402.1728828}
