Trump supporters talking about Trump, versus Hillary supporters criticizing Trump? \\nIt turns out that doesn\u2019t matter. \\nThis same system\u2013relying on engagement data\u2013also successfully predicted Trump\u2019s win in the Republican primaries. \\nDemocratic presidential candidate should not get too comfortable in her alleged lead. \\nUltimately, Trump supporters and Trump haters are extreme. But, ultimately, it appears no news is bad news. \\nAs the founder of this artificial intelligence system stated, \u201cIf Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since internet engagement began in full earnest,\u201d Rai told CNBC. \\nHopefully, come November, anyone possessing a modicum of human intelligence will vote this artificial intelligence prediction into reality.'"}, "time": 1742564191.2737992}
