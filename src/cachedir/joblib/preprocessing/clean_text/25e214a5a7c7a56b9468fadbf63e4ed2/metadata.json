Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, may have wanted to steal something even more valuable: an American presidential election. As our election takes a turn that could be drawn from a Cold War spy novel (except it would be too implausible) Putin has an obvious favorite in the race: Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to me\u201d that Putin favors Trump, says Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was ambassador to Russia until 2014. \u201cIf I were Putin, I would rather deal with Trump, too, given the things he has said about foreign policy. \u201d Look, Democratic Party leaders exchanged inappropriate emails showing bias for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, and a hacker\u2019s disclosure has properly triggered a ruckus. But that scandal pales beside an effort apparently by a foreign dictatorship to disrupt an American presidential election. It also seems scandalous to me that Trump on Wednesday effectively invited Russia to hack into Clinton\u2019s computers for deleted emails from when she was secretary of state, saying at a press conference, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing. \u201d Yes, Trump is entertaining. But increasingly, the antonym of \u201cgravitas\u201d is \u201cTrump. \u201d Clinton could have responded by inviting Russia to hack into Trump\u2019s computers and release his tax returns she didn\u2019t because the hack would be illegal and her plea would be unpresidential. In his press conference, Trump also cast doubt on the idea that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not Russia,\u201d he said, suggesting it might be China, or \u201csome guy with a 200 I. Q. \u201d So let\u2019s go through the evidence. America\u2019s intelligence agencies have assessed with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russia\u2019s government was behind the hack, and private security companies have identified two Russian teams of hackers that were inside D. N. C. computers. One team is called Cozy Bear and is linked to the F. S. B. the successor to the K. G. B. and another is called Fancy Bear and is linked to the G. R. U. or Russian military intelligence. Cyber experts are very familiar with both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. The next question is whether Russia was also behind the release of the stolen emails to WikiLeaks. Someone using the name Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be behind the hack, denied Russian involvement and claimed to be Romanian  \u2014   but wrote Romanian badly. ThreatConnect, a private security firm, issued a meticulous report showing that Guccifer used a   VPN (virtual private network) service and displayed other \u201cheavy traces of Russian activity. \u201d \u201cGuccifer 2. 0 is a Russian propaganda effort,\u201d ThreatConnect concluded. After talking to experts, I have the sense that there\u2019s considerable confidence that Russia is the culprit, but more doubt about whether Putin gave the order and about whether the aim was to benefit Trump or simply to create havoc. \u201cI think the most likely explanation is that someone in Russian intelligence, probably very high up, decided to help Donald Trump,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, but he added that there\u2019s no solid evidence for this. One reason for caution is that history shows that \u201cintelligence community\u201d is sometimes an oxymoron. In the 1980s, the United States accused Russia of conducting chemical warfare in Southeast Asia, citing \u201cyellow rain\u201d in jungles there. Years later, it turned out that this \u201cyellow rain\u201d may have actually been bee excrement. Democrats should be particularly wary of hinting that Trump is some sort of conscious pawn of the Russians, or is controlled by Moscow through financial investments. It\u2019s true that his son Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that \u201cwe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. \u201d But do you really think that if Trump were an agent he would have exaggerated his ties, as he did last year, saying of Putin, \u201cI got to know him very well\u201d? In fact, Trump acknowledged Wednesday, he has never even met Putin. The reason Moscow favors Trump isn\u2019t some conspiracy. It\u2019s simply that Putin dislikes Clinton, while Trump\u2019s combination of international ignorance and catastrophic policies would benefit Putin. In particular, Trump\u2019s public doubts about NATO renounce more than half a century of bipartisan orthodoxy on how to deal with Russia, and undermine the Western alliance that checks Putin. One nightmare of security specialists is Russia provoking unrest among ethnic Russians in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania and then using rioting as an excuse to intervene. NATO members would be obliged to respond, but frankly it\u2019s not clear that they would  \u2014   and Trump\u2019s loose rhetoric increases the risk of paralysis and a collapse of the alliance. In that sense, Trump poses a national security risk to the West, and that\u2019s reason enough Putin would be thrilled to see him elected president.'"}, "time": 1742562178.633216}
