Sources earlier told CNN that those discussions had begun, but the law enforcement officials now say they have not.[14] \\nFBI Director James Comey is under assault for what is being perceived as more than simply partisan behavior. Former presidential advisor, Lanny Davis writes for The Hill: \\n\u201cComey as FBI director \u2014 an investigative agency, not a prosecution agency \u2014 (does not) have any authority to send a report to Congress in the middle of an investigation about the past or present subject of an investigation. He appears to be in violation of the limits on his authority as FBI director by disclosing investigation information \u2014 or possible investigation information \u2014 directly to Congress with obtaining permission from the attorney general or someone else delegated authority by her. His decision to reveal the results of an ongoing investigation, before a published criminal indictment, violates due process principles and pre-indictment secrecy rules and guidelines of the Justice Department.\u201d[16] \\nThrough court challenges to FBI search tactics under FISA and other counter-terror legislation, accessing \u201ccloud\u201d based emails and either representing them as \u201cfound\u201d in a warranted search of a hard drive or in \u201csyncing\u201d a computer to place emails on a drive under a warranted search, clear prohibitions have been established.[Addendum I] \\nIn this case, with no warrant in place at all, there are no possible interpretations of FBI actions that could be consistent with admissibility. \\nIn what has been seen by most a the long expected \u201cOctober Surprise,\u201d the highly controversial letter written by FBI Director James Comer, something more far reaching has developed, a constitutional crisis that may well exceed that of Watergate or even Iran/Contra. Like the Federal Reserve, the FBI itself lacks a clear constitutional authority. There is no mention of nor authorization given, in the constitution, for a national police force. In fact, the Constitution, in the 10th Amendment ratified in 1791 states: \\n\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d[12] More often than not, this has been ignored, a \u201cstepchild\u201d of the Bill of Rights. Here, however, the FBI, created initially as the \u201csex police\u201d[11], created to enforce the Mann Act[13], has assumed not only \u201cpowers not granted\u201d under the constitution, but has exponentially expanded its reach, well beyond constitutional limitations on rights of privacy and against unreasonable search and seizure, assailed by laws like the Patriot Acts.\u201d \\nBehind the current controversy, that of an FBI director being accused of interfering in an election and acting against policy, procedure and advice of the Attorney General, is something more. The FBI has crossed into the area of possible criminality, violating clear cut Federal Court restrictions, not only through an illegal search but by actually planting evidence and then channeling misleading information into the press with a clear intent to subvert constitutional authority. \\nAnother issue is the kind of language Comey has been using to mollify critics who have kept a flurry of investigations going and who have subjected him to hostile interrogation for endless hours in front of highly partisan committees. Colonel Jim Hanke (ret), former US attache to Israel and ranking NATO military intelligence planner commented on the nature of Comey\u2019s assertions of Hillary\u2019s classified emails: \\n\u201cTake the text of any of the emails we have seen. Anything here could have been said in a press conference or on a television interview and, in those formats, would not have been considered classified. There would have been fallout, for sure, not from disclosing policy or in endangering operations, real issues that get high level classification. Hillary\u2019s emails, were they made public, and there was reason to expect this might well happen, are revealing and reflect on her personal judgement and, at times, demonstrate a lack of grasp, particularly when it comes to Russia or Syria. These are issues of public confidence, not criminality nor are they areas of real security classification. \\nConversely, what we have seen Comey do may well rise to the level of something serious, certainly he undermines the FBI and attacks the American system of government. As to what his intent was or to what laws apply, this is not my area of expertise but I would like to think that criminal code could deal with this kind of threat.\u201d \\nOne additional consideration to put into the mix is Wikileaks. During recent weeks while Wikileaks has released two dozen batches of emails, the Clinton campaign has mirrored earlier charges made against Wikileaks by former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinsky, that Wikileaks \u201csexes up\u201d and even fabricates documents that are, according to Brzezinsky, when speaking to Judy Woodruff of National Public Radio, \u201cseeded\u201d into a virtual deluge of material. \\nThe FBI used FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) powers when it downloaded and \u201csynced\u201d Clinton emails into former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s computers, according to legal experts.[1,4,6,7] The FBI knowingly violated the law in applying terror statutes when they illegally expanded their search into Weiner\u2019s computers and downloaded emails from a 3rd party account. With only days before an election, the term \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d has never been more applicable. \\nThe question people are asking is; \u201cWhy did Director Comey choose to ignore legal advice and, more importantly, was he aware that he was upsetting an American presidential election based on a pattern of criminal-level misconduct by his own agency?\u201d \\nThe FBI lied when it claimed the it found Clinton emails when it searched Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer. Sources now tell VT that the FBI in fact \u201csynced\u201d the email account of Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, Huma, downloading the emails \u201cfrom the cloud\u201d and falsely claiming they were discovered as part of a legal search warrant. However, there is no case law supporting the expansion of such warrants to spouses or others whose email accounts may be accessible through devices but were not stored on hard drives and not by any stretch of the imagination, legally accessed under any possible search warrant tied to Weiner\u2019s sexual indiscretions. \\nWhat did in fact happen here was planting of evidence, by the FBI, illegally accessing a \u201ccloud based\u201d email account not included in a search warrant and downloading to a hard drive that was included in a warrant. This is a common FBI/DHS practice used in terror investigations, making use of a single warrant to follow cloud accounts for multiple users. \\nIn an article in today\u2019s Washington Post, the issue of how the FBI found emails that should not been on Weiner\u2019s computer were brought to light. \\n\u201cTop Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has told people she is unsure how her emails could have ended up on a device she viewed as her husband\u2019s computer, the seizure of which has reignited the Clinton email investigation, according to a person familiar with the investigation and civil litigation over the matter. \\nThe person, who would not discuss the case unless granted anonymity, said Abedin was not a regular user of the computer, and even when she agreed to turn over emails to the State Department for federal records purposes, her lawyers did not search it for materials, not believing any of her messages to be there. \\nThat could be a significant oversight if Abedin\u2019s work messages were indeed on the computer of her estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a 15-year-old girl. So far, it is unclear what \u2014 if any \u2014 new, work-related messages were found by authorities. The person said the FBI had not contacted Abedin about its latest discovery, and she was unsure what the bureau had discovered.\u201d[8] \\nThere is no evidence, of yet, that Director Comey was aware the \u201cevidence\u201d he took to congress was illegally planted on Weiner\u2019s computer but Comey was aware of the practice. Typically, the FBI search warrants used can give access to cloud based emails as outlined below by FBI Special Agent James M. Cauthen: \\n\u201cAn alternative is for the investigator to search in the same manner as the user would\u2014with the computer turned on and connected to the data. In this example, the investigator needs access to the subject\u2019s computer with the relational database software and connection to the cloud. The investigator could consider combining two search warrants\u2014one on the computer owner for the location being searched under Rule 41 and one on the cloud provider under \u00a72703 for the content to which the computer is connected. \\nWith this approach, the investigator will need to understand how to operate database software and make queries. These queries must comply with the search warrant. The investigator must conduct the search carefully as actions taken on a live system will change the data on the computer. Using this method, it may be possible to obtain a single search warrant combining the provisions of Rule 41 and \u00a72703; however, it should be noted that there is no case law yet on implementing this strategy.\u201d [7] \\nIn light of the controversy over the handling of this issue by FBI Director Comey, an article in The New Yorker, dated October 28, 2016 cuts to the director\u2019s state of mind. From that article: WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report )\u2014James Comey, the embattled director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, presided over a special ceremony on Friday evening to commend the brave F.B.I. agents who had to touch Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer. In awarding the commendations to the agents, whom Comey called \u201cthe bravest men and women this country has to offer,\u201d the F.B.I. director criticized the political uproar that he said had overshadowed \u201ctheir selfless acts of heroism.\u201d \u201cThese agents have performed far and beyond the call of duty,\u201d a visibly angry Comey said. \u201cI know we\u2019re eleven days away from an election and tensions are running high, but we shouldn\u2019t let that subtract in any way from what these brave agents did with their own hands.\u201d \u201cWho among us could look at ourselves in the mirror and say, \u2018I have what it takes to touch Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer \u2019?\u201d Comey asked. \u201cI know I sure as hell couldn\u2019t.\u201d[15] A common way to hide ones train in Washington is to wrap whatever the smell is \u201cin a bloody flag\u201d or to hand out medals for heroism. This is \u201cdeception 101\u201d and Comey wasn\u2019t in the least bit coy about using his agents, who may be steeped in ethical or even criminal complicity, in that same \u201cbloody flag\u201d theatrics. \\nThe Clinton/Weiner connection may well be an abuse of expanded counter-terrorism powers the FBI assumed during the Bush era. However, in 2008, these powers were curtailed by a Federal court decision. [Addendum I] From the New York Times, April 19, 2016: \\n\u201cWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge has rejected a legal challenge to rules permitting F.B.I. agents, when working on domestic criminal cases, to search emails written by Americans that the government has intercepted without a warrant in the name of gathering foreign intelligence. \\nIn an 80-page opinion that was issued in November and remained classified until being made public on Tuesday, Judge Thomas F. Hogan, the chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, ruled that what critics call \u201cbackdoor searches\u201d of messages by the F.B.I. comply with both the Constitution and the FISA Amendments Act. That 2008 statute legalized a form of the government\u2019s once-secret warrantless surveillance program.\u201d[9] \\nThere has been considerable controversy involving the FBI\u2019s illegal expansion of search warrants in criminal cases. With the expanded powers under the Bush administration\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, covering the use of broad \u201csingle warrant\u201d powers in domestic terrorism cases, the FBI has on numerous occasions misused FISA powers in criminal investigations. \\nThis has been brought before the Federal Courts in 2008 [Addendum I] and the FBI should well consider itself forewarned not to attempt to apply questionable expanded powers under FISA legislation intended to apply to terror threats. That FISA was applied here, knowing a court challenge would take far too long to correct the damage, in this case a \u201crigged\u201d presidential election, as claimed by Clinton campaign advisor, John Podesta.
