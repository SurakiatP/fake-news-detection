[The New York architecture firm wants to build a   skyscraper 31, 068 miles above the Earth. Analemma Tower is a project meant to \u201capply design thinking on a planetary scale\u201d to create \u201cthe world\u2019s tallest building ever. \u201d  The building will float in a massive figure eight through the northern and southern hemispheres, passing over several major cities as it goes. The firm\u2019s plan suggests building in Dubai specifically because of the country\u2019s ability to craft massive superstructures for about   the cost of building in the U. S. Analemma would employ a Universal Orbital Support System (UOSS) to hang   by \u201chigh strength cable\u201d from the aforementioned asteroid. And if it becomes reality, Analemma would be a sectional world all its own. Business centers would dominate the lower levels, with apartments situated above. Gardens, religious areas, as well as commercial and entertainment areas all have their place. The tower is full of   engineering, including   windows that adjust their height for differences in temperature and air pressure. Solar panels placed on the uppermost levels will harness energy to keep the whole thing running, while fresh water is harvested from the clouds below. Of course, they\u2019ll need to position an asteroid of appropriate size to accomplish their science fiction Wonderland. The firm cited the European Space Agency\u2019s \u201cRosetta\u201d mission and NASA\u2019s 2021 asteroid retrieval mission as evidence that the concept doesn\u2019t stray too far from modern realities.
