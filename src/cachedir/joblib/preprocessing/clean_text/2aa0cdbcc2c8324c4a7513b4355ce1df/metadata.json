[Mnuchin\u2019s   comment was \u201cThe unemployment rate is not real,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t seem to have been questioning the validity of the statistics produced by BLS.   U. S. News and World Report, for example, swiftly accused Mnuchin of repeating a \u201cclaim that has rankled economists\u201d about how \u201cgovernment statistics have been politicized and aren\u2019t accurate,\u201d but that\u2019s not what Mnuchin said. Rather, he made the case to Senator Maria Cantwell ( ) that the official unemployment statistics suggest the job market has healed to a degree most actual workers and   would disagree with, because there\u2019s so much happening that isn\u2019t captured by that narrow statistic. There was a bit of ideological jousting in the exchange, as Cantwell was basically trying to push Mnuchin into saying his primary focus should be preventing another \u201cmajor implosion\u201d in the financial markets, while he galloped in the opposite direction and talked about   Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to the forgotten middle American.  Democrats want the 2008 financial crisis to be seen as an impossible,   challenge President Obama was still coping with on his last day in office. Mnuchin turned that around by talking about how the American workforce has suffered under Obama\u2019s policies. \u201cLet me just tell you, from having traveled with the   for the last year, I absolutely understand why he got elected,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cAnd that is because, as you point out, the average American worker has gone nowhere. \u201d \u201cThe unemployment rate is not real,\u201d Mnuchin continued. \u201cThe average American worker has gone nowhere. And the   is committed  \u2014   as am I, as his economic adviser  \u2014   to work for the American people and grow the American economy, so that the average American worker does better. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been willing to sell all my investments, okay?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been willing to give up my businesses. My desire is to work for the American people, to create a better economy. And I understand that. I\u2019ve traveled for the last year. I\u2019ve seen this, and the   understands that very clearly. \u201d The Hill notes that   Trump himself has criticized the unemployment rate as \u201cphony numbers\u201d and \u201ctotally fiction. \u201d He\u2019s not alone in that critique, especially in questioning how only one of the many numbers compiled by BLS gets media attention (at least, under Democrat presidents) and it doesn\u2019t count people who have exited the workforce entirely. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s MarketWatch noticed Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci stepping forward on Twitter to back Mnuchin\u2019s play: He\u2019s right. Wage growth stagnant, labor force participation at   low,   unemployment rate high for this stage in economic cycle https:  .   \u2014   Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) January 19, 2017,  The numbers are accurate, but they have been cherry picked and spun dry.
