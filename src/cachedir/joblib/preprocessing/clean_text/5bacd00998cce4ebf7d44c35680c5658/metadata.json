Those of us who were raised the only child of a single parent know how intense the relationship can be. Different days you may play the role of child, parent, sibling or emotional crutch  \u2014   some days all at once. As you get through it, you try to find space for yourself, to become someone outside the   world that your parent has provided. This is the main struggle driving iO Tillett Wright\u2019s debut memoir, \u201cDarling Days. \u201d Tillett Wright was raised in the bohemian East Village of the 1980s and \u201990s by Rhonna, a sometime model and   \u201cglamazon\u201d who preferred spending money on dance classes rather than on bills or groceries. In this household, Tillett Wright knows love but also instability. \u201cSleep doesn\u2019t happen much in the house, what with the plays and things late at night, plus Ma is in a real bad way,\u201d the child observes. \u201cIt\u2019s like she has a night personality and a day personality. \u201d Tillett Wright grows up skinny and scrappy, able to score meals off neighborhood friends, then shimmy up the side of a building to get into the apartment undetected. Born female, Tillett Wright also grows up identifying as a boy. At 6 he turns to his dad, tells him he\u2019s now a boy and, for the next eight years, dresses and passes as such, avoiding   bathrooms and locker rooms for fear of being found out. Neither parent objects to this rewriting of gender. \u201cMa doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s strange that I live as a boy. Boys have all the fun, girls have tons of restraints,\u201d Tillett Wright observes. But classmates bully him, with one student wrapping a hand around his neck in a stairwell to check for an Adam\u2019s apple. Tillett Wright, an L. G. B. T. activist and host of MTV\u2019s \u201cSuspect,\u201d now identifies as a transgender man. It\u2019s Ma\u2019s benign neglect that is at the source of Tillett Wright\u2019s malnourishment and general malaise, yet she\u2019s the one who fights hardest for her \u201ckitty. \u201d Their relationship, though later strained by brutal fights, is always close. \u201cWe are some kind of twins,\u201d Tillett Wright tells his mother in the letter that prefaces the memoir, \u201cable to see each other in a room of closed eyes, able to hear each other in a world of silence. \u201d Twins or not, as a child Tillett Wright longed for regular meals and a real bed, not the broken army cot his mother finds for him on Canal Street. He fantasizes about finding a way to live with his \u201cPoppa\u201d in Europe without \u201cstabbing my mother, my best friend, in the throat\u201d by ratting her out to a school counselor. The emotional heart of the book lives within this tension  \u2014   between taking care of his controlling and needy mother and taking care of himself. In this struggle, Tillett Wright is cleareyed but compassionate. \u201cDarling Days\u201d begins strong. The East Village of Tillett Wright\u2019s childhood is especially vivid: \u201cOur building repels \u2018normal\u2019 people. They\u2019d have to love cockroaches, scalding radiators and thin walls . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. they would have to establish their own niche in the zoo and defend it. \u201d The menagerie includes an emaciated recluse who collects pianos, a pair of retired porn stars who reign over the building and his mother\u2019s rotating cast of boyfriends \u201cwith broken teeth and crooked minds. \u201d But as we move further into the narrative, and deeper into the trials of Tillet Wright\u2019s adolescence, his perspective narrows. Though passionately felt and described, his struggles can feel overdetailed they\u2019d benefit from the insights of an older, wiser narrator. To make reference to Vivian Gornick, it\u2019s too much situation, not enough story. I sometimes wished Tillett Wright would step back from the roller coaster of new schools and, later, new lovers to give us a broader view on the changes to his city, his community and especially his fallible but fascinating parents. While he was living his life, history was also happening, and the inclusion of that history could enlarge his memoir. Nevertheless, it\u2019s hard not to root for Tillett Wright when he finally comes into his own, and especially as he finds love with women, accepting a queer identity he\u2019d long feared and resisted: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear my tragedies on my skin, in my teeth, in my walk. I want something different than what I\u2019m inheriting, but I\u2019m going to have to make that happen for myself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628348.2983298}
