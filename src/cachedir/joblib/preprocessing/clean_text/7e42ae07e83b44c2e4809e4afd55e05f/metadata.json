This, argues Karl Denninger of the Market Ticker , is a mathematical certainty.\\nIn a recent interview with Future Money Trends Denninger touches on the various dire challenges facing America. From the Presidential election to the rampant corruption in our financial, political and healthcare systems, he pulls no punches and warns that the worst is yet to come unless real action is taken immediately. Failure to do so, says Denninger, will lead to a collapse of everything we consider to be a part of our current way of life.\\nIf we do not start locking people up our government, our way of life and every asset class\u2026 the price of all of them\u2026 is going to collapse. This is not a maybe. This is arithmetic. It\u2019s not politics. The problem here is that nobody in the political sphere from either party is talking about this. This is where the problem lies.\\n\u2026At the same time, this is what is bankrupting all of the public sector pensions\u2026 If you\u2019re a policeman, a firefighter, a teacher in any of the states you\u2019re not going to get your money . At best you\u2019ll get half. I\u2019ve run the numbers\u2026 the best systems in the country right now will be able to pay half of those benefits\u2026 many of them are worse than that. You\u2019re going to also see the collapse of all the state budgets for the same reason because they\u2019ve got those embedded liabilities. Law or no law, I don\u2019t care what your state Constitution says you have. If you can\u2019t collect the money you\u2019re not going to get the check. \\n\\n( Watch at Youtube )\\nWhat\u2019s worse is the fact that not only can we not stop what\u2019s coming, Denninger says that there is really no way to prepare for it from a wealth preservation aspect because anything that doesn\u2019t get wiped out in a crash will probably be stolen by the government. Thus, when we think preparedness, we\u2019d better be thinking in terms of survival essentials:\\nYou can\u2019t [protect your wealth]. You need to be looking at your wealth in terms of how many chickens are you going to be able to buy or how many gallons of gasoline\u2026 or how many kilowatt hours of electricity because the number of dollars you have or how many ounces of gold is utterly immaterial\u2026 The only thing that matters is what they buy. \\n\u2026 The problem is and the aspect that people take on this \u2026. and I get these questions all the time whenever I post an article showing the math\u2026 The first thing that comes up in the comments is \u2018 what do I do as an investor to protect myself from this? \u2018\u2026. The answer is there isn\u2019t a way to do it\u2026 remember, the government will steal everything that\u2019s not nailed down and not protected with your life\u2026 so, unless you\u2019re willing to die, at which point you don\u2019t care how much money you have because you\u2019re dead, there is no personal protection method that works.\\nIf the picture Denninger paints of the future of America is accurate \u2013 and we can\u2019t really argue with the mathematical evidence he has put forth at The Market Ticker over the last decade \u2013 then when this system does collapse it is going to lead to widespread chaos as every asset class out there is going to be worth significantly less than it is today.\\nIn such a scenario we need to consider what will have value and what will take the form of money when dollars are no longer a feasible mechanism for exchange.\\nAs Denninger points out, the only thing of importance will be how much the\u201dassets\u201d in your posession will be able to buy.\\nDollars may be worthless in this instance. Gold and silver may have fallen or risen in price, but their purchasing power is what will matter, and as Denninger notes, they may be illegal to own so trade would have to take place on black markets. Food, medicine, toilet paper, soap, and other essentials will sky rocket in value, as has been evidenced by the hyperinflationary collapse currently taking place in Venezuela.\\nSo when we look at protecting ourselves from the coming crash of our entire way of life, it\u2019s the essential goods and services that people can\u2019t live without that will become the assets of choice.\\nThe math is clear. It is coming. Prepare for it now.\\nKarl Denninger posts regular commentary and news at hsi web site The Market Ticker .
