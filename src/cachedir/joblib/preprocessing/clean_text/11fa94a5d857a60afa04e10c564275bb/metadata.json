[The new show, created by Atamanuik, will premier on Thursday, April 27 and will reportedly run weekly if it becomes a ratings success.  \u201cWhen I was first approached about this show I thought it would be about me, but on further thought, this makes way more sense,\u201d Comedy Central president Kent Alterman said.  Comedy Central released a short video clip on Monday, which offers a glimpse of what audiences can expect from Atamanuik\u2019s parody Trump.   . @LateNightDonald makes a surprising announcement. No, he\u2019s not resigning. #PresidentShowpic. twitter.   \u2014   The President Show (@PresidentShow) April 3, 2017,  \u201cThey unzipped my pants. They got on their knees, it was disgusting,\u201d Atamanuik says, surrounded by a gaggle of reporters on Air Force One. \u201cAnd I would get incredible ratings, some of the best ratings, huge ratings. Great ratings, ok? And they\u2019d say, You want to be on the same channel as Noah Trevor, or whatever the guy\u2019s name is. Who cares? Whatever. I said just invite me on and be nice. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have the best guests, the most beautiful women. It will be so funny, the most funny show,\u201d he says. Atamanuik has made something of a career out of lampooning the president. The 30 Rock alum has performed his Trump impersonation on The View, CNN\u2019s Newsroom, and on a   Trump vs. Bernie debate comedy tour that aired on Fusion. \u201cLaughing at the President is a proud American tradition and we hope not to disappoint anyone in that department,\u201d Atamanuik said in a statement. \u201cBut our political system is too broken for us to be content joking about one man, even though he is a disastrous silly little toddler boy. Mostly I\u2019d just like to thank Comedy Central for giving us this platform to speak truth to power and if we\u2019re lucky, end up in prison!\u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563018.3487613}
