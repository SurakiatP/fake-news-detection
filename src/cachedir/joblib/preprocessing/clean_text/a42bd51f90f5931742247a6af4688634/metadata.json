Scott Armstrong and Dr. Kesten Green which claims that only a fraction of 1 percent of the papers published in scientific journals follow the scientific method. Professor Armstrong appeared on Breitbart News Daily today to discuss his research with    Alex Marlow. [\u201cThe problem in journals, with government research, and with universities is that nobody asks them to follow [it]. I\u2019ve been publishing for 55 years and can\u2019t ever recall anyone saying \u2018you should follow the scientific method. \u2019\u201d  Armstrong, along with Dr Kesten Green developed a checklist of eight criteria to assess whether a paper or a study follows the scientific method. According to the checklist, scientific studies must (1) test multiple reasonable hypotheses, (2) provide useful findings, (3) fully disclose methods, data, and other relevant information, (4) conduct a comprehensive review of prior knowledge, (5) use valid and comparable data, (6) use valid and simple methods, (7) provide any experimental evidence, (8) reach conclusions consistent with the evidence. \u201cSo, [Dr.] Kesten Green and I got involved with this to develop a simple checklist that would help people to say \u2018are you following the scientific method?\u2019 If you\u2019re going to fly a plane, if you\u2019re going to be a doctor and operate, you have to use a checklist, and if you use a checklist you are much more effective. Nothing like that exists right now. \u201d \u201cThere is one exception, and that is PLOS One, Public Library of Science One actually provides a checklist. I think it took them about five years before they became the largest scientific journal in the world, so they\u2019ve really revolutionized things. \u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is, government research, universities  \u2014   they\u2019re asking for what I call advocacy research. They have something, they want you to prove it, make sure you prove it, you do, you keep getting paid. \u201d \u201cAdvocacy research is the bulk of these 99 percent of   studies, and they\u2019re not done for scientific development, they\u2019re done to support a political idea. If you want to make money in universities these days, you publish papers that support global warming and you live handsomely. \u201d Armstrong said that the problem of   research had been a problem since at least the 1920s, but that it has intensified in recent years with the \u201cvast growth of government funding for research. \u201d \u201cI agree with many of the greats of the past when I say that the government should not be involved in research. \u201d Armstrong reiterated his argument that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violates all eight of his checklist for following the scientific method. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can go and look at their work and you can use that checklist. \u201d Listen to Professor Armstrong\u2019s full discussion with Alex Marlow below.
