[Here are each of those nine times, presented in the order of Comey\u2019s testimony:  1  \u2014   Asked by Sen. Mark Warner to clarify Comey\u2019s claim that he believed President Trump was seeking to \u201ccreate some sort of patronage relationship\u201d by inviting him to a    dinner at the White House, Comey offered his response with the qualification that he could be \u201cwrong. \u201d He stated: Well, my impression, and again it\u2019s my impression, I could always be wrong but my common sense told me what was going on is, either he had concluded or someone had told him that you didn\u2019t, you\u2019ve already asked Comey to stay, and you didn\u2019t get anything for it. And that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship, in fact, he asked specifically, of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay. 2  \u2014   Comey used the \u201cwrong\u201d qualification when he further interpreted Trump\u2019s intentions at the same dinner: My common sense, again I could be wrong but my common sense told me what\u2019s going on here is, he\u2019s looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. 3  \u2014   Comey said he could be \u201cwrong\u201d about his interpretation of an instance on January 6 in which Trump allegedly asked Comey to speak with him alone after a meeting at a conference room at Trump Tower. My impression was something big is about to happen. I need to remember every single word that is spoken, and again, I could be wrong, I\u2019m 56 years old, I\u2019ve been, seen a few things, my sense was the attorney general knew he shouldn\u2019t be leaving which was why he was leaving and I don\u2019t know Kushner well but I think he picked up on the same thing so I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to. 4  \u2014   Asked why he thought he was fired from his position as FBI chief, Comey replied: I guess I don\u2019t know for sure. I believe  \u2014   I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn\u2019t know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he\u2019s saying something that\u2019s not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 5  \u2014   Comey was asked to interpret a statement that he claims Trump made to him in private in which the   director claims Trump stated about an FBI probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn that \u201cI hope you could see your way to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. \u201d Comey stated: Well, the context and the president\u2019s word are what led me to that conclusion. As I said in my statement, I could be wrong, but Flynn had been forced to resign the day before. And the controversy around general Flynn at that point in time was centered on whether he lied to the vice president about his nature of conversations with the Russians, whether he had been candid with others in the course of that. So that happens on the day before. On the 1, the president makes reference to that. I understood what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn\u2019s account of his conversations with the Russians. 6  \u2014   Comey was asked about a March 30 phone call in which he claims Trump asked him what the FBI could do to \u201clift the cloud\u201d of the Russia investigation, which Comey says Trump described as impeding the president\u2019s ability to govern. He replied: I think what he meant by the cloud  \u2014   and, again, I could be wrong  \u2014   but the entire investigation is taking up oxygen and making it hard for me to focus on what I want to focus on. The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation. 7  \u2014   Comey was asked whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions was aware of concerns about Flynn at the time Sessions was sworn in to the attorney general position. \u201cI don\u2019t as I sit here,\u201d Comey responded. \u201cI don\u2019t recall that he was. I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t remember that he was. \u201d 8  \u2014   Asked whether he had conversations with Trump about the Russia threat that suggested the president was \u201ctaking that hostile action seriously,\u201d Comey replied: I don\u2019t remember any interactions with the president other than the initial briefing on January the 6th. I don\u2019t remember  \u2014   could be wrong, but I don\u2019t remember any conversations with him at all about that. 9  \u2014   Comey stated he could have the date \u201cwrong\u201d regarding an alleged phone call from Trump: \u201cThere was another phone call that I mentioned could have the date wrong, March 1st, where he called just to check in with me as I was about to get on the hospital. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
