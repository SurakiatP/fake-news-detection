[The awards ceremony honored Chelsea Handler, who refers to gun ownership as a \u201chobby\u201d rather than a right, and were attended by January Jones, Tom Arnold, and The Voice champion Alisan Porter. Will Ferrell also attended and served as \u201cauctioneer\u201d for the evening.  According to People, Stewart\u2019s attendance was highlighted by Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Gross said Stewart had approached him with an idea about a new way to push gun control and that he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by her proposal. He said, \u201cShe came to us because she has something she wants to do with this issue. She eagerly shared her idea and without hesitation and is showing up tonight. She is committed to actually doing something, not just lending her name. \u201d While no specifics were given about Stewart\u2019s gun control idea, People reports that it will revolve around taking \u201cclassic American depictions of our fascination with guns\u201d and adding a new message. Stewart spoke about using images to change the way Americans perceive what is considered to be \u201ccomforting. \u201d And talked about how we need to work to keep children from playing with toy guns because it convinces them that real guns can offer protection when they grow up: One of them involved the shattering of the idea that it\u2019s cool to play with toy guns and little kids grow up thinking that\u2019s going to protect and empower them. We kind of take that idea and go, \u2018Actually this is something else that could happen,\u2019 and that needs to be considered by people who might not think about that kind of thing. Stewart\u2019s filmography includes American Ultra, a film about an unorthodox government agent who has to fight for his life after being targeted for death. Stewart\u2019s character uses firearms to help the agent defend himself.
