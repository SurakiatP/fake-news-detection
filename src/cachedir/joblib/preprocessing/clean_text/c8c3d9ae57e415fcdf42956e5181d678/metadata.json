The next thing you know, an ad for a flu remedy pops up on your web browser, or your video streaming service starts playing a commercial for Tylenol. The content of those ads is no coincidence. Digital ads are able to follow people around the Internet because advertisers often place invisible trackers on the websites you visit. Their goal is to collect details on everywhere you go on the Internet and use that data to serve targeted ads to your computer, smartphone and connected television. This global commercial surveillance of consumers is poised to become more extensive as tech companies expand into the Internet of Things, a category that includes wearable computers and connected home appliances like smart thermostats and refrigerators. Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google can already follow users from device to device because people log in to their services with the same IDs on various gadgets. For other marketing companies, tracking people on multiple   devices has become a holy grail. The process is complex, because some lack the direct relationship with people that the giant tech companies already have. Only about 6 percent of marketers can reliably track a customer on all of that customer\u2019s devices, according to the research firm eMarketer. But advertisers are working toward the goal. \u201cOur privacy is completely under assault with all these connected devices,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the founder of WhiteHat Security, a web security firm. So what better time to get a head start on defending yourself against web snoops (as if email trackers, which this column covered last year, weren\u2019t annoying enough already)? Many companies offer tools to help obscure your digital footprints while you\u2019re browsing the web. We researched and tested four tracker blockers and found their results varied widely. In the end, the app Disconnect became our   tool of choice. Here\u2019s how web tracking works: In general, targeting individuals with digital ads involves a sophisticated ecosystem of third parties  \u2014   like online advertising networks, data brokers and analytics companies  \u2014   that compile information on consumers. When you visit websites, these companies typically pick out your browser or phone using technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags that can enable trackers to identify your activities as you move from site to site. To sell ads delivered to certain categories of consumers, like suburban singles looking for romance, companies may sync these ID tags to pinpoint individuals. The downside is, your browsing history may contain sensitive information about your health concerns, political affiliations, family problems, religious beliefs or sexual habits. \u201cMore than just being creepy, it\u2019s a huge violation of privacy,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a privacy advocate for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit that also offers the   tool Privacy Badger. \u201cPeople need to be able to read things and do things and talk about things without having to worry that they\u2019re being watched or recorded somewhere. \u201d We took a close look at four free privacy tools: Ghostery, Disconnect, RedMorph and Privacy Badger. We tested them with the Google Chrome browser on the top 20 news websites, including Yahoo News, CNN, The Huffington Post and The New York Times. The tracker busters generally work in similar ways. You download and install an   for a web browser like Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The   companies each compile a list of known web domains that serve trackers or show patterns of tracking services. Then when someone connects to a website, the tools prevent the browser from loading any element that matches their blacklist. Ghostery, a popular tracker blocker, was the most difficult to set up. When you install it, it asks you to manually select the trackers you want to block. Our problem with that approach is that there are hundreds of trackers, and most consumers probably won\u2019t recognize most of them, putting the onus on users to research which specific services they might wish to block. Scott Meyer, the chief executive of Ghostery, said this had been a deliberate design choice. When trackers are blocked, parts of websites may not function, so it is less confusing to let users experiment and decide which ones to block on their own, he said. \u201cWe block nothing by default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct contrast to other companies who are saying, \u2018We\u2019re turning everything off and let you turn whatever you want back on.\u2019 That\u2019s way too complex for users. \u201d The tracker blocking tool RedMorph takes the opposite approach. It blocks every tracking signal it can detect and lets people decide which ones to allow. For parents concerned about their children\u2019s Internet use, RedMorph also offers a service to filter out certain sites or block certain swear words or other language they find inappropriate. \u201cWhen you go home, you lock the door and you may pull down the shades at night,\u201d said Abhay Edlabadkar, the chief executive of RedMorph. \u201cYou should have the same level of privacy control over your Internet activities. \u201d In our tests, RedMorph was the most thorough with blocking trackers. It blocked 22 of them on USAToday. com, whereas Privacy Badger blocked seven, Disconnect blocked eight and Ghostery detected eight. But in the process, RedMorph caused the most collateral damage. It blocked some videos on the websites for CNN, USA Today, Bleacher Report, The New York Times and The Daily News. It also broke the recommended reading list on Business Insider and a Twitter box on BuzzFeed. For people who run into issues loading websites, the company offers an \u201cEasy Fix\u201d button to stop blocking a website\u2019s trackers, but that\u2019s hardly an ideal solution when it causes so many websites to malfunction. Mr. Edlabadkar of RedMorph said the tool was blocking some videos or recommended reading lists because they were loading only after a tracker had been loaded first. That leaves Privacy Badger and Disconnect. Privacy Badger detects   domains that users are connecting with when they\u2019re loading a website and blocks those domains only if they are determined to be tracking you. Its widget shows sliding bars of trackers it has detected. The ones in red are blocked and the green ones are allowed. Disconnect takes a similarly nuanced approach. The company said some tracking was fair and necessary for a website to work properly  \u2014   for example, if a site like The New York Times is using analytics to collect information about readers, as it describes in its privacy policy. However, Disconnect will block trackers from third parties that are collecting, retaining or sharing user data. On its website, it publishes lists of trackers it blocks and those it allows, along with explanations of its policy. \u201cWe really focus on privacy rather than blocking ads that are done in a respectful way,\u201d said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect. \u201cIt\u2019s important we have the ability for publishers to survive and make money. I think there\u2019s a middle ground. \u201d In the end, we picked Disconnect as our favorite tool because it was the easiest to understand. It organizes the types of tracking requests it is blocking into different categories: advertising, analytics, social media and content. Mr. Grossman of WhiteHat Security also tested tracking blockers and chose Disconnect for similar reasons. He breaks his online activities into two separate web browsers to make himself more difficult to track: On one browser, he does everyday tasks like reading news articles on the other browser he logs into accounts that are linked to his personal identity, like online banking sites and Amazon. But Mr. Grossman said that in the broad arms race between consumers and advertisers, the advertisers always find some way to outmaneuver us. \u201cWe\u2019re talking   industries totally designed to track you online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission in life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628574.164496}
