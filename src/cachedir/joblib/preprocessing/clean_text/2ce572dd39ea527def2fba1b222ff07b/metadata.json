Va.  \u2014   Cole Chapman and his wife, Silvia Gabriel Fields, were having coffee on their deck when a nearby creek suddenly burst its banks, sending them and their two children sprinting to their pickup truck for safety. \u201cWe heard cracking and popping, and a sheet of water just started pouring into the yard,\u201d Mr. Chapman said Saturday night. \u201cIt was like something totally exploded. \u201d Minutes later, their yard submerged beneath gushing,   water, the family raced over muddy roads to higher ground. \u201cMy son was in the back seat, saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to die, we\u2019re going to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chapman recalled. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there thinking, \u2018I sure hope you\u2019re not right. \u2019\u201d The storms that swept West Virginia last Thursday created historic flooding and in the aftermath left hundreds of homes, buildings, bridges, roads and vehicles destroyed. The storms were tied to at least 24 deaths. The authorities said on Sunday that all of the people reported missing had been accounted for except in one county, Greenbrier, which suffered the greatest death toll in the flooding. Sixteen deaths were reported in Greenbrier County, all but one of them in the small town of Rainelle. The town\u2019s mayor, Andrea Pendleton, wept as she surveyed her community on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. \u201cI weep for my people,\u201d she said. \u201cI weep for the businesses. \u201d The county is home to a luxury resort and golf course that was scheduled to host a P. G. A. tournament from July 4 to 10. But the course, like much of the surrounding countryside, was overrun by floodwaters and the event was canceled. \u201cCanceling the Greenbrier Classic is certainly the most prudent course of action as our foremost concern is the   of those who are having to live through this tragic situation,\u201d the P. G. A. Tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, said in a news release. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with them. \u201d The owner of the resort said that while it was closed for business, he would offer a limited number of free rooms and meals to house some of the people affected by the floods. The powerful storms appeared to have caught many people off guard. Hundreds of people were left stranded, and bodies that were recovered from houses  \u2014   including those of a man and two women at one location, all presumed to have drowned, officials said  \u2014   suggested that either people did not have enough time to flee, or did not heed warnings to evacuate. The state remained under a state of emergency on Sunday, with more than 17, 000 homes and business still without power. Late Saturday, President Obama declared a major disaster in the state that frees up federal funding for relief in three of the   counties  \u2014   Kanawha, Nicholas and Greenbrier. More heavy rain is forecast for Monday in some of the areas in West Virginia already hit hard by flooding, but Greenbrier County is expected to be spared. Mr. Chapman recounted his family\u2019s harrowing escape as his truck crashed and bounced over debris in the road. He said for what seemed like an hour, he fought through water, mud and rain to get to Clendenin, usually a   trip. The pickup almost flipped at one point, he said, as he drove over a fallen tree. \u201cThere was enough water hitting the side of the truck to make it rock,\u201d he said. The family escaped, drenched, with little more than the clothes they were wearing. \u201cI left with just what I had in my pockets,\u201d Mr. Chapman said. When he returned to the house later, he said, he saw that their   aboveground pool had been lifted and dashed against the side of the house. The family has no flood insurance, he said, and he is unsure whether they will be able to return home. Storms had been in the forecast for Thursday, but their overpowering strength came as a surprise to many. Most of West Virginia and the western parts of Virginia received 1 to 3 inches of rain in a few hours on Thursday afternoon and evening, but the downpour was far more intense in some places. Parts of Greenbrier County, a sparsely populated area bordering Virginia, got 8 to 10 inches of rain, the National Weather Service reported. Power went out a couple of hours before the creek burst its banks, Mr. Chapman said. But he and Ms. Fields were unaware how quickly the swollen creek was rising. Neighbors reported finding out about flooding only after someone knocked on their door. Over the weekend in Clendenin\u2019s tiny downtown, a church group grilled burgers in a parking lot next to a Dairy Queen that was demolished by the Elk River, which flooded to record levels. Another church group passed out clothes and cleaning supplies to those left homeless. In rural West Virginia, it is not uncommon for multiple generations of a family to live near the same small town. On Thursday, Ms. Fields and two other households of relatives were flooded out. Gerald and Naomi Fields, her parents, live in Clendenin. Mr. Fields said he knew they were in trouble when he saw \u201ca massive amount of water coming off the mountain\u201d on his way home from work on Thursday. He said a rescue team worked for hours to evacuate residents of a nursing home. \u201cThose emergency workers literally put their lives on the line to get them out,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 3 in the morning, when they were done, one man just collapsed from exhaustion. \u201d Another set of relatives 10 houses away lost everything. Ms. Fields\u2019s older sister Erica Babbitt and her husband, David, said their house was ruined. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be starting from scratch,\u201d Mr. Babbitt said. For now, all 11 members of the three related households are staying at an empty church rectory in Nitro, west of Charleston. Mr. Babbitt said his church has rallied around them, feeding them, giving them clothes, shelter and a few personal items. Ms. Babbitt said she and her husband had been getting ready to move to Fairmont for a new job. \u201cI was thinking about what it was going to take to move,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t have to worry about that now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563209.1555753}
