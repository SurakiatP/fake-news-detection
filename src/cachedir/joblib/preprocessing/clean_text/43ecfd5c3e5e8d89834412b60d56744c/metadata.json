Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas. \\nBut such advice is not likely from Pompeo, who has spoken out against the closing of CIA\u2019s \u201cblack sites\u201d used for torture and has criticized the requirement that interrogators adhere to anti-torture laws. He has also opposed closing the prison at Guantanamo, which has become infamous for torture and even murder. \\nAfter visiting Guantanamo three years ago, where many prisoners were on a hunger strike, Pompeo commented, \u201cIt looked to me like a lot of them had put on weight.\u201d \\nThere is little doubt that the champagne was flowing on Friday at CIA headquarters, from the seventh-floor executive offices down to the bowels of that building where torture practitioners have been shielded from accountability for 15 years in what amounts to the CIA\u2019s internal \u201cwitness protection\u201d program. \\nIndeed, relief over the Pompeo appointment came in the nick of time. For one fleeting moment earlier in the week, there was some panic at the hint that the International Criminal Court might show more courage than President Barack Obama in bringing torture perpetrators to justice. \\nThat suggestion caused a moment of angst up and down the CIA\u2019s ladder of authority, from supervisory felons, such as Director John Brennan and agency lawyers, down to the thugs hired to implement the amateurish but gruesome regime of torture depicted in gory detail in the Senate Intelligence Committee investigative report , \\nPublished in December 2014 and based on original CIA documents, the report\u2019s Executive Summary revealed a range of gruesome practices from the near-drowning sensation of water-boarding to the forcible rectal feeding of detainees. \\nPompeo\u2019s Defense \\nPompeo responded to the findings by personally attacking Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein. He claimed she had \u201cput American lives at risk\u201d and he called CIA participants in the torture program \u201cheroes, not pawns in some liberal game being played by the ACLU and Senator Feinstein.\u201d Former Rep. Pete Hoekstra (left) argues with ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern about the Senate torture report on CCTV America\u2019s \u201cThe Heat\u201d on Dec. 11, 2014. (Screenshot from program) \\nPompeo seemed to be taking his cue from former chair of the House Intelligence Committee Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, who, right after the Senate report was released, boasted to me on live TV that he had been briefed on \u201c90 to 95 percent\u201d of the cruel practices laid bare in the Senate investigation. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201c Clashing Face to Face on Torture .\u201d \\nTorture also has its supporters in the Senate, which will be called on to confirm Pompeo as CIA director. At a Senate hearing on May 13, 2009, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, gave a tip of the cap to the Spanish Inquisition, which he cited as proof that torture could elicit some useful confessions (as it was used in the Fifteenth Century to detect \u201ccrypto Jews\u201d and to burn several thousand heretics at the stake). \\nDuring a hearing on detainee interrogations, Sen. Graham said : \u201cLet\u2019s have both sides of the story here,\u201d pointing out that there could be evidence that torture produced \u201cgood information.\u201d Graham added, \u201cI mean, one of the reasons these techniques have survived for about 500 years is apparently they work.\u201d \\nOn Wednesday, I was given nine minutes on radio to comment on the ICC\u2019s tentative move to seek accountability for American torture practices. But Pompeo\u2019s nomination on Friday is sure to dispel the brief moment of anxiety among the CIA\u2019s torturers. \\nCongressman Pompeo is living proof that you can get all A\u2019s at West Point, graduate first in your class, and still flunk the Constitution with its quaint Eighth Amendment prohibition against \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d Not knowing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights apparently makes you a good pick to head the CIA. \\nAs member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), Pompeo also was protective of the National Security Agency\u2019s systematic abuse of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against illegal searches and seizures. \\nThe selection of Pompeo came a few days after Vice President-elect Mike Pence told ABC that he would model his handling of the job after former Vice President Dick Cheney under President George W. Bush. \\nThough Pence may have meant Cheney\u2019s assertive role and interaction with Congress, there was also Cheney\u2019s advocacy for \u201cregime change\u201d wars and what the Bush administration called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d which earned Cheney the label from The Washington Post, \u201cVice President for Torture.\u201d \\nCheney has never been repentant about his aggressiveness in the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a minute,\u201d he has declared . \\nReal Expert on Torture \\nYet, even as Bush-Cheney apologists found excuses and euphemisms for torture, Gen. John Kimmons, head of Army Intelligence, told a Pentagon press conference on Sept. 6, 2006 \u2013 the same day he knew that President Bush planned to advertise the efficacy of his \u201calternate set of procedures\u201d \u2013 that torture did not result in sound information. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nConceding past \u201ctransgressions and mistakes,\u201d Kimmons insisted: \u201cNo good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices. I think history tells us that. I think the empirical evidence of the last five years, hard years, tells us that.\u201d (Emphasis added) \\nThat\u2019s also what I learned as a young Army Intelligence officer 50 years ago. Cheney, Hoekstra, Graham, Trump, Pence and Pompeo can keep whistling on the dark side, but there is zero evidence to challenge what Gen. Kimmons had to guts to point out on that important day. The Senate Intelligence Committee report of December 2014 should have long since laid to rest the canard that torture \u201cworks.\u201d \\nOn a moral level, I also cannot quite fathom the attitude of Pence \u2013 who says, \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order\u201d \u2013 tolerating torture and torture advocates. If memory serves, Jesus Christ was tortured to death. \\nLest I seem to be coming down too hard on how so many fundamentalist Christians wink at (or applaud) torture, I must concede that \u2013 after 9/11 \u2013 the growing acceptance of practices like torture, previously widely condemned as totally unacceptable behavior, gained willing acceptance among many non-fundamentalist Christians, as well. \\nMany years ago when I studied ethics at Fordham, New York City\u2019s Jesuit university, I was taught that there was one immutable category called \u201cintrinsic evil,\u201d which included slavery, rape and torture. \\nSomehow, torture slid out of that category when Fordham\u2019s president, Rev. Joseph M. McShane, SJ, succumbed to the \u201ccelebrity virus,\u201d and decided to ask alumnus (then-White House aide on counterterrorism and now CIA Director) John Brennan to give the Commencement address in 2012. \\nBrennan had publicly defended the practice of extraordinary rendition (aka kidnaping, most often for torture). Brennan was also on the routing for emails regarding CIA torture procedures. (It is important to note that, without a demonstrated \u201cneed to know,\u201d no one is included as an addressee on such delicate matters.) \\nAdding insult to the injury of giving Brennan such an important invitation, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in \u201cHumane Letters\u201d (what might seem like a sick joke), as fellow honoree, Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archbishop of New York, applauded from the same platform. \\nWhen a number of graduating seniors objected to this profaning of their graduation, President McShane gave a glib gloss on torture and drone killings in these words: \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a black and white world; we live in a gray world.\u201d \\n(A group that I helped found, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, has written a number of Memoranda on torture and most recently on the CIA\u2019s cover-up of torture , an issue completely neglected in the corporate media.) \\nRay McGovern works for Tell the Word, a publishing arm of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour in inner-city Washington. He served as an Army Intelligence officer and then a CIA analyst for a total of 30 years, and is co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS).'"}, "time": 1742628338.1019108}
