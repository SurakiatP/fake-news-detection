Weiner is separated from wife Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides. \\nAnd they worried that Clinton\u2019s unconventional email arrangement had finally caught up to her and might imperil her presidential bid less than two weeks before Election Day. \\n\u201cI\u2019m livid, actually,\u201d one Clinton surrogate told The Hill. \u201cThis has turned into malpractice. It\u2019s an unforced error at this point. I have no idea what Comey is up to but the idea this email issue is popping back up again is outrageous. It never should have occurred in the first place. Someone somewhere should have told her no. And they didn\u2019t and now we\u2019re all paying the price.\u201d \\nAnother ally called the campaign\u2019s mood something akin to \u201cparalysis,\u201d and blamed Weiner\u2019s behavior for railroading the campaign. \\nOne strategist said the developments would further cement the notion that Clinton has something to hide. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s made people think there\u2019s always going to be something around the Clintons, some investigation, some inquiry,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cIt never goes away.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564247.687119}
