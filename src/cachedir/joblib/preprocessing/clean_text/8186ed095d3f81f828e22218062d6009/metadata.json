Literature has more to offer, at least as far as boys are concerned. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn have a rich and renewable legacy. And it may be that association that imparts a novelistic vibe to Ira Sachs\u2019s \u201cLittle Men,\u201d beyond the Louisa May Alcott echo in the title. It\u2019s a subtle movie, alert to the almost imperceptible currents of feeling that pass between its title characters. They are Jake Jardine (Theo Taplitz) and Tony Calvelli (Michael Barbieri) two middle schoolers who cross paths in Brooklyn. I almost ended that sentence \u201cand fall in love,\u201d a possibly misleading but not at all inaccurate account of what happens. The childhood bond that the psychologist Harry Stack Sullivan called \u201cchumship\u201d can be as intense and mysterious as romantic love, and can be sparked by the kind of intuitive connection that arises between Jake and Tony when they first meet. Jake, pale and reserved, is an exile from Manhattan, flung across the East River by the tides of family fortune. His father, Brian (Greg Kinnear) might be described as a struggling actor if it didn\u2019t seem that the fight had mostly gone out of him. He works, but he mostly worries, tries to be a nice guy and feels guilty when he fails at it. Jake\u2019s mother, Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) who is a bit more decisive, is a therapist, and her smiling demeanor acts as a shield against the unspoken tensions hovering in the air whenever she and her husband are together. The family moves into an apartment that used to belong to Brian\u2019s father, whose death is the movie\u2019s precipitating catastrophe. The old man also owned the building where Tony\u2019s mother, Leonor (Paulina Garc\u00eda) runs a dress shop, and if \u201cLittle Men\u201d is a love story it is also a tale of economic conflict in a rapidly changing city, a fable about the insidious, toxic power of money and real estate. Jake\u2019s grandfather is recalled as a   bohemian of the kind that used to be more plentiful in New York. \u201cHe loved me,\u201d Leonor says, perhaps hinting that they were lovers but more pointedly explaining why he charged her so little rent. Brian, urged on by his sister, wants to raise it. As the dispute between them escalates, it casts a shadow over Jake\u2019s relationship with Tony. All the   think they are being perfectly reasonable as they dig in their heels and allow a business matter to turn into a personal grudge. None of them can help it everyone needs money. Their behavior  \u2014   the politesse that grows increasingly cold, the contempt that seethes among people who believe themselves to be not only right but righteous  \u2014   is dismaying, but hardly surprising. It\u2019s also not really the point. Mr. Sachs holds the adults at arm\u2019s length, declining either to judge them too harshly for their selfishness or to extend them more than minimal sympathy for their difficulties. In other words, \u201cLittle Men\u201d is on the side of Jake and Tony, as both a narrative strategy and a moral choice. Their temperaments and backgrounds are different, as are their interests. Jake is a hothouse flower, his artistic talents and sensitivities carefully cultivated by his parents. Tony, whose father travels for work and is almost never at home (Hernan, a friend of Leonor\u2019s played by Alfred Molina, is around a lot) is more of a   kid. He\u2019s gregarious and easygoing and dreams of being an actor. The two boys conceive a plan to apply to a specialized arts high school together. When parents are around, \u201cLittle Men\u201d feels like a modest, precise drama of urban life, but when it follows Tony and Jake, absorbing the loose rhythms of their companionship, the film becomes something richer and harder to classify. It\u2019s a boys adventure story edged with unspoken risks, and the young actors take the kind of chances that their more careful and disciplined elders have been trained to avoid. There are inklings of sexual desire between the boys and implications of homophobia in the world around them, but mostly there is a sense of discovery and change, of all the unruly and enigmatic experiences often collapsed into the phrase \u201c  . \u201d There is also a protest against the banal imperatives of maturity, and above all against the ways that adults ignore and discount the emotional lives of the young. Kathy, Brian and Leonor would do anything for their sons except take their relationship seriously, and the possibility that something as precious and real as friendship could be sacrificed because of money registers as a profound insult. And also as a fact of life. Mr. Sachs, in his last three features  \u2014   this one, \u201cLove Is Strange\u201d and \u201cKeep the Lights On\u201d  \u2014   has refined a style of emotional realism that stands out against both the mumbly diffidence and the sociological scorekeeping of too much independent American cinema. \u201cLittle Men\u201d only looks like a small movie. \u201cLittle Men\u201d is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Parental guidance is the worst. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes.'"}, "time": 1742564600.3221617}
