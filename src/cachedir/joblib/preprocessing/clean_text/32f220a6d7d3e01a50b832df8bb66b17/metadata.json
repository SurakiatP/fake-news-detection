Lab tests have confirmed the age of the artifact and its mysterious composition. The idea that humanity has been visited by beings not from Earth in the distant past has captured the interest of millions worldwide.\\nEvery once in a while, a strange discovery makes us reconsider whether or not history, as we have been told, is accurate.\\nWhat if we are missing something, and what if, in the distant past, extremely advanced technology was present on Earth?\\nREAD: Everything We Have Been Taught About Our Origins Is A Lie \\nThe mysterious artifact, composed mainly out of aluminum was found in Romania during the 1970\u2019s when the nation was under communist rule, and information about it was released to the public at the time.\\nNow, lab tests conducted in Lausanne, Switzerland, have revealed that the metal fragment is composed of 90 percent aluminum and the remaining 10 percent of 11 different metals.\\nThe artifact has an approximate age of 250,000 years, reports British newspaper the Sun .\\nBut is this artifact really compelling proof ancient astronauts visited Earth hundreds of thousands of years ago?\\nAs it turns out, Aluminum was not created by \u2018modern civilization\u2019 until 200 years ago. Aluminium was first isolated in 1825 by Danish physicist HC Oersted, so the discovery of the piece of metal with an age such as this has been considered extraordinary by researchers.\\n\\nThe item was discovered in 1973 when constructors were working on the shorelines of the Mures River, in the vicinity of the town of Auid. At around 10 meters below the surface, workers were left surprised when they recovered three mysterious objects.\\nAll of them appeared, unlike anything they had seen, and seemed to be very old.\\nArchaeologists were brought to the site and identified two of the objects as being fossil remains.\\nHowever, the third piece left researchers surprised. IT appeared to be a man-made artifact, composed of an extremely lightweight metal. Researchers suspected at the time that it was the end of an axe.\\nTo confirm the theories, the objects were sent to analysis to Cluj, Romania.\\nExperts determined that the fossils belonged to a large \u2013extinct\u2014 mammal that died between 10,000 and 80,000 years ago.\\nREAD: We Are Being Lied To About Our History \\nHowever, the third object caused confusion among experts. Scientists determined that the object was composed of a lightweight metal and was most likely manufactured due to the concavities of the object.\\nThe Auid artifact is 20 meters long, 12.5 centimeters wide and has a thickness of 7 centimeters.\\n\\nThe object resembled some kind of part belonging to a complex mechanical system. However, researchers were unable to determine to what it belonged.\\nDeputy Director of the Romanian Ufologists Association, Gheorghe Cohal said: \u2018Lab tests concluded it is an old UFO fragment given that the substances it comprises cannot be combined with technology available on Earth.\u2019\\nHowever, not everyone seems convinced. Local historian Mihai Wittenberger doesn\u2019t believe the object belongs to a complex mechanical device left behind by ancient astronauts. In fact, Wittenberger\\nbelieves the mysterious object may actually be a metal piece from a World War II German aircraft.\\nMore precisely, Wittenberger claims the alleged \u2018alien artifact\u2019 was actually part of the landing gear of a Messerschnmitt ME 262.\\nBut there\u2019s one problem with that explanation. The mystery object is 250,000 years old.\\nThe mysteries surrounding the artifact have not been solved, and currently, the \u2018out-of-place- artifact resides in the History Museum of Cluj-Napoca, next to a sign that reads: \u2018origin still unknown\u2019.\\nSource: EWAO \\nRelated: Everything We Have Been Taught About Our Origins Is A Lie We Are Being Lied To About Our History Ancient Egyptians had electricty and batteries thousands of years ago Forbidden History & OOPARTS: Out of Place Artifacts Ooparts: Alien electronic chip with age 450 million years found in stone near Labinsk city in Russia 17 Out-of-Place Artifacts Said to Suggest High-Tech Prehistoric Civilizations Existed The 500-Million-Year-Old Dorchester Pot Should Not Exist Have Humans devolved through history?
