[Fitton said, \u201cIn the end, we need to see what the [Comey] memos say. We want to see what other Comey memos are out there, so the American people can figure out one way or another what went on. \u201d  Fitton remains quite skeptical of the media and, seemingly, Comey. Added Fitton, \u201cWe had sued for records about the Flynn investigation. We haven\u2019t gotten anything from the FBI. This is the sort of document we should have gotten. You have to wonder if these documents are being correctly characterized, whether the interpretation of the documents is as   as is being suggested by the New York Times and the other media. We can\u2019t presume that. \u201d \u201cWhere are all the Comey memos?\u201d continued Fitton. \u201cIf Mr. Comey\u2019s habits are to be believed, he wrote memos about all his interactions with the president and   officials, and I think all these memos ought to be made public if they\u2019re out there. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
