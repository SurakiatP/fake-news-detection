To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Here\u2019s the plan for the week, not including breakfast because I\u2019m on a farina kick and that\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste, and not including lunch because really when it comes to the midday hours you should get out of the office or the house and walk around. If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There\u2019s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I\u2019m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert. On Monday night, it would be great to eat falafel, but that means you\u2019ll need to get and soak some dried chickpeas this evening. Fry them on Monday, and eat cut watermelon for dessert. Then on Tuesday, you could simmer Melissa Clark\u2019s outstanding recipe for a smoky fish chowder into existence, serve it with soda crackers, and offer ice cream for dessert. (You can make your own. We\u2019ve been grooving on Gifford\u2019s recently, for what that\u2019s worth.) Wednesday, maybe try Mark Bittman\u2019s recipe for scrambled tofu with tomatoes, scallions and soy sauce? (In keeping with Tejal Rao\u2019s brilliant idea to pair vegan ranch dressing with grilled lamb, we\u2019re thinking you could add some ground pork to the recipe and be happy indeed.) Dessert:   oranges, sliced into eighths. Thursday night is dealer\u2019s choice: Either make Julia Moskin\u2019s recipe for avocado fattoush with mint vinaigrette or choose one from our collection of recipes for healthy weeknight dinners. And then for dessert, try the chef Seamus Mullen\u2019s recipe for peaches, pistachios, honey and ricotta. Finally, maybe you\u2019re looking to button up your plans for Rosh Hashana, which starts on Oct. 2? It\u2019s never a good idea to cook something for the first time for a holiday. So for Friday night dinner (Shabbat, don\u2019t you know!) perhaps you could give Melissa\u2019s new recipe for chicken with figs a run? Or try David Tanis\u2019s new recipe for baked spinach rice? If those don\u2019t suit you, we have an entire recipe collection devoted to the High Holy Days. Other ideas for what to cook this weekend are on our site and apps. Save the recipes you like to your recipe box and rate them when you\u2019re done cooking. You can and ought to leave notes on recipes if you have a shortcut or substitution to suggest the conversation among us helps us all. If you run into technical trouble, please ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. (If your issues are more metaphysical, or if you have a complaint about tone or content, or if you want to gush or have suggestions about what we might be doing more or less of, you can reach me at foodeditor@nytimes. com.) Now, did you read Dwight Garner on Robert Gottlieb\u2019s memoir in The Times? Please do. They\u2019re excellent together. Did you see that Prince Buster, the trailblazer of Jamaican ska, died recently at 78? If you\u2019d like to see some cool old videos and listen to his music, there\u2019s a pretty cool \u201cbead\u201d on Milq devoted to ska and rocksteady. Check that out. Finally, let\u2019s see what Gao Gao, Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu are up to. Yes, it\u2019s Panda Cam from the San Diego Zoo. You\u2019ll like it. See you tomorrow.'"}, "time": 1742563198.1753798}
