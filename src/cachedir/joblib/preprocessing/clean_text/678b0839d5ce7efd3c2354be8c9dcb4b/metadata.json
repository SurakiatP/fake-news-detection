[Brussels gave Poland one month rather than the usual two to address its concerns about the ancient Bialowieza forest or face being summoned by the EU\u2019s top court.  \u201cOne month was considered the right time considering the urgency of the situation,\u201d European Commission spokesman Enrico Brivio told reporters. He said Poland\u2019s reply to requests to stop   logging in the forest was \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d amid concerns it could cause irreparable biodiversity loss. The Bialowieza forest includes some of Europe\u2019s last primeval woodland and has been granted protected status by the UN heritage organisation. The threat comes with Brussels and Warsaw already at loggerheads over changes to Poland\u2019s constitutional court which the EU has warned could merit sanctions as a \u201csystemic threat\u201d to the rule of law. Since the populist PiS administration came to power in Warsaw in October 2015, it has come into conflict with Brussels on several fronts. The EU launched both the logging inquiry  \u2014   based on a complaint by environmentalists  \u2014   and the rule of law investigation last year. If the logging case goes before the European Court of Justice, Poland could face fines. But if found at fault on the rule of law Poland could face the far more serious prospect of seeing its EU voting rights suspended. The Bialowieza forest straddles Poland\u2019s eastern border with Belarus and is home to unique plant and animal life, including a herd of some 800 European bison, the continent\u2019s largest mammal. The vast woodland includes one of the largest surviving parts of the primeval forest that covered the European plain ten thousand years ago. The Polish government began logging in May last year, saying it was clearing dead trees to prevent damage caused by the spruce bark beetle, and insisting the policy was entirely legal.'"}, "time": 1742564389.6201718}
