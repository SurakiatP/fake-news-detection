He had already vowed to change the libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists, and his personal insults were becoming more vicious. (One news correspondent was a \u201csleaze\u201d another was \u201cthird rate. \u201d) Most troubling was that he was keeping a blacklist of news organizations he was banning from his rallies, and it was growing. I called him at the time, to see what this would look like in a Trump administration. Would he deny White House credentials to select reporters and news organizations? No, he said. \u201cThere, I\u2019m taking something away, where I\u2019m representing the nation. \u201d We can only hope he means it. Because if Mr. Trump keeps up the posture he displayed during the campaign  \u2014     war footing  \u2014   the future will hold some very grim days, not just for news reporters but also for the American constitutional system that relies on a free and strong press. It\u2019s one thing to wage a press war as a candidate, when the most you can do is enforce reporting bans at your rallies, hurl insults and deny interviews and access (all of which are plenty bad). It\u2019s another thing to do it from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where you have control over what vital government information is made public, and where you have sway over the Justice Department, which under President Obama has shown an overexuberance in investigating journalists and the   who leak to them. Imagine what somebody with a press vendetta and a dim view of the First Amendment would do with that kind of power. For their part, American newsrooms are conducting their own reassessments, vowing to do a better job covering the issues that animated his supporters, and acknowledging that Mr. Trump tapped into something in the national mood, the power of which they failed to grasp. They now know they underestimate him again at their own peril. Yet they also know that the need to continue with probing, unflinching reporting that promotes the truth in the face of whatever comes at them will be great. In the days immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, journalists that don\u2019t work at organizations with Breitbart in their names were preparing for potential reporting challenges, the likes of which they have never seen, while lawyers were gaming out possible legal strategies should Mr. Trump move against press freedoms. Right after his victory Mr. Trump was telegraphing a gentler tone, declaring to  The Wall Street Journal, \u201cIt\u2019s different now. \u201d Perhaps he was making his   \u201cpivot\u201d to become \u201cmore presidential than anybody\u201d save Abraham Lincoln. But then came the Saturday night release of his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in which he said he would keep his Twitter account so that when any news organization gave him \u201ca bad story,\u201d he would \u201chave a method of fighting back. \u201d And he didn\u2019t skip a beat on Sunday morning, when he attacked The New York Times with a Twitter post that read, \u201cWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \u2018Trump phenomena. \u2019\u201d The statement was false. The paper said Sunday that postelection cancellations were so substantially outstripped by a surge of new subscriptions that its subscription growth rate in the period that followed Tuesday\u2019s result was four times the growth rate in the same period of last quarter. In an atmosphere in which it\u2019s not shocking to hear about   literature being sent to the home of a Jewish reporter  \u2014   the address having been published online by supporters of Mr. Trump  \u2014   it was hard to see any of this as very presidential, though the definition may be changing. The funny thing is that few major political figures have had a more codependent and at times friendly relationship with the press than Mr. Trump. Before he stopped doing news briefings in the later phase of the campaign, he was shaping up to be the most accessible   nominee in modern history. But displeasing him could have an intensely personal cost, which the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly vividly recalls in her new book, \u201cSettle for More. \u201d Ms. Kelly, who became Mr. Trump\u2019s leading television nemesis during the primary campaign, writes about how the candidate, unhappy with a segment she did in July 2015, threatened to unleash \u201cmy beautiful Twitter account against you. \u201d After enduring her tough questioning at the first presidential primary debate, he made good on his Twitter promise, which in turn led to death threats against her, she said. (\u201cI would spend many days of the coming months accompanied by security,\u201d she writes.) It didn\u2019t help, she wrote, that Mr. Trump\u2019s special counsel, Michael Cohen, recirculated a Trump supporter\u2019s tweet that read \u201cwe can gut her. \u201d That was followed by what she took as another threat, from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski. As Mr. Lewandowski unsuccessfully lobbied a senior Fox News executive to remove Ms. Kelly from the next Fox debate, she writes, he said he would hate to see her go through such a \u201crough couple of days\u201d again. (Fox News described the conversation the same way earlier this year.) Mr. Lewandowski had been the living embodiment of Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive approach to the press. He was, after all, arrested on charges that he manhandled the former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields. (Prosecutors in Florida ultimately dropped the charges.) After a paid stint at CNN, Mr. Lewandowski returned to the Trump fold last week, and could wind up in the administration or at the Republican Party headquarters. Another member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, broke new ground this year by financing the \u201cHulk Hogan\u201d lawsuit against Gawker, which resulted in Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy and sale to Univision. Though that was technically an    case, it was a model for what Mr. Trump has said he wants to see in opening up libel laws. Most First Amendment lawyers agree that fundamentally changing the libel law would require a reversal of the landmark Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan. And while that might seem like a long shot, Laura R. Handman, a First Amendment lawyer, said in an interview that Mr. Trump could find ways to \u201cchip away\u201d at it. First Amendment lawyers are more immediately concerned with potential leak investigations, as well as Freedom of Information Act requests, which can provide the best way to expose government secrets. Look no farther than the potential attorney general candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as mayor of New York was so allergic to records requests that news organizations and others regularly sued him for basic information. Success at court was meaningless given that proceedings kept the information out of public view for so long that \u201che really won,\u201d said George Freeman, who was the assistant general counsel for The New York Times then and is now the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center. I\u2019ve said it before, but the solution will be what it has always been  \u2014   good, tough reporting. For all the appropriate discussion about how they missed some key dynamics of the race, mainstream news outlets produced a lot of   journalism. They provided a glimpse into the tax returns Mr. Trump wouldn\u2019t share showed how he and Mrs. Clinton ran their charities investigated their family business dealings and bluntly called out falsehoods, more of which came from Mr. Trump. The wrong lesson to take from the past year is that reporters should let up in their mission of reporting the truth, wherever it leads. That\u2019s more important than ever, given how adept Mr. Trump and his allies have proved to be at promoting conspiracy theories that can spread faster than ever through social media. But if there is one thing we learned this year, it was the wisdom of the old mnemonic device for the spelling of \u201cassume\u201d (makes an \u201cass\u201d out of \u201cu\u201d and \u201cme\u201d). Mr. Trump campaigned through surprise and may well govern through surprise. We\u2019ll know how this thing is going to go only when we know. Now, where\u2019s my seatbelt?'"}, "time": 1742562510.4949365}
