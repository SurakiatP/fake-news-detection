Information recovered from the laptops could only be used in the email investigation and not in others. \\nAs part of the immunity agreement, the FBI and Justice Department agreed to destroy Mills\u2019 and Samuelson\u2019s devices, a revelation that sparked outrage from congressional Republicans when it was announced earlier this month. \\nThe Journal\u2019s report largely confirms reporting in August from The Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s Richard Pollock that the FBI and several U.S. attorneys offices were conducting an unorthodox, joint investigation into the Clinton Foundation. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: FBI-US Attorneys Conducting Joint Probe Of Clinton Foundation) \\nCNN reported at around the same time that a Clinton Foundation probe was tabled by the Justice Department. Pollock\u2019s report and the new piece from The Journal undermine CNN\u2019s reporting. \\nWhile the investigation has gone forward, the Justice Department has stymied the investigation at several turns, according to The Journal. \\nThe DOJ refused to grant the FBI the power to issue subpoenas or conduct formal interviews. It also refused to convene a grand jury to weigh evidence in the case. \\nMore pushback occurred in August, when a senior DOJ official contacted the FBI\u2019s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, to voice his displeasure that New York field office agents were continuing the investigation even though the DOJ had declined to provide investigative support. \\nThe official was \u201cvery pissed off\u201d that the FBI was continuing its efforts, according to The Journal. \\nThe call occurred on Aug. 12, a day after CNN reported details of FBI-DOJ discord over whether to investigate the Clinton Foundation. It was also a day after Pollock reported that an investigation was underway. \\nMcCabe figures prominently in The Journal\u2019s reporting and in the overlapping Clintonworld investigations. \\nIt was revealed last week that McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, received nearly $470,000 in contributions to a Virginia state senate campaign last year from Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s super PAC. \\nMcAuliffe is a close Clinton ally and is the subject of a separate FBI investigation. \\nAccording to The Journal, McCabe refocused the Clinton Foundation investigation a week after FBI director James Comey announced in early July that he would recommend to the Justice Department that charges not be filed against Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails. \\nThe charity probe would be led by the FBI\u2019s New York office with help from the Little Rock office, according to The Journal. FBI field offices in Los Angeles and Washington were also involved in the Clinton Foundation investigation. \\nThe Los Angeles office subpoenaed bank records related to the Clinton Foundation after obtaining information during a separate public corruption case. The office in Washington was investigating McAuliffe\u2019s financial relationships from before he joined the Clinton Foundation as a board member. \\nAfter Comey\u2019s announcement on the Clinton email investigation in July, McCabe decided that the Washington FBI office would focus on the separate McAuliffe matter. He recused himself from that investigation because of the donations his wife received from McAuliffe\u2019s super PAC in 2015. \\nWhile the FBI has insisted that McCabe is not compromised in any of the investigations \u2014 the email probe, the Clinton Foundation, or the McAuliffe matter \u2014 The Journal reports that some agents believe he has issued \u201cstand down\u201d orders in the Clinton Foundation inquiry.

Still other sources denied that McCabe issued a \u201cstand down\u201d order. They asserted that McCabe ordered investigators to continue on their investigative path. \\nMcCabe\u2019s Aug. 12 phone conversation with the senior DOJ official would seem to suggest that he supported the investigation. \\n\u201cAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?\u201d McCabe asked the DOJ official, according to a Journal source who was familiar with the conversation. \\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d the official reportedly said, after a brief pause. \\nThe new report also details a presentation that FBI officials made to the Justice Department in February to lay out the case against the Clinton Foundation. \\nSome of the Journal\u2019s sources said that the DOJ\u2019s career public integrity prosecutors did not believe that the case was strong. \\n\u201cOthers said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case,\u201d The Journal reported. \\nDOJ officials told the FBI at the meeting additional investigative tools \u2014 subpoenas, interviews or a grand jury \u2014 would not be authorized.'"}, "time": 1742628449.8392391}
