S. representative from Pennsylvania will cut off all federal funding to state, county and local jurisdictions with sanctuary policies. [\u201cNot one cent,\u201d Representative Lou Barletta ( ) told Breitbart Texas in an interview on Thursday morning. \u201cThese mayors, sheriffs, and state leaders are thumbing their noses at federal immigration law. The only way to stop them is to hit them in their pocketbooks. \u201d  He said the leaders of these sanctuary jurisdictions are not just choosing to violate federal law, \u201cthey\u2019re bragging about it in press conferences. \u201d Mayors across the country have been lining up in droves to declare themselves sanctuary cities, Breitbart Texas reported in November 2016. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said, \u201cChicago always will be a sanctuary city,\u201d NPR reported.  \u201cTo all those who are, after Tuesday\u2019s election, very nervous and filled with anxiety   \u2026     you are safe in Chicago, you are secure in Chicago and you are supported in Chicago. \u201d His comments come in the face of the city\u2019s massive crime and murder rates. By the end of the year, Chicago would approach 800 murders by the end of 2016. In Texas, a newly   sheriff, dubbed by her opponent in the race with the moniker \u201cSanctuary Sally,\u201d told the Travis County budget director she would no longer be able to certify her department was in compliance with laws requiring cooperation with immigration officials. The move will put her department, and county residents, at risk of losing $1. 8 million in state funding. Federal funding could also be stripped under existing law. \u201cThis is a perfect example,\u201d Barletta told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThey\u2019re making a mockery of our laws. \u201d Barletta said his bill, the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act, H. R. 83 (attached below) strengthens the current law, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1373, being used to strip law enforcement grants from sanctuary jurisdictions. \u201cMy bill will enhance this by stripping all federal funds \u2014  not one cent. \u201d Representative John Culberson ( ) worked with the DOJ throughout 2016 to force the department to certify the   sanctuary jurisdictions and use this existing law to cut off their funds for grants awarded in 2017. \u201cWhen I originally introduced this bill in my first session, there were 80 cities that were considered sanctuary cities,\u201d the   congressman said. \u201cNow that number has grown to more than 300 because we didn\u2019t do anything about it when there were only 80. We\u2019re putting the American people in danger. \u201d He cited the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco as an example of a sanctuary city putting Americans\u2019 lives at risk. Steinle was murdered in July 2015 by an illegal immigrant who had been released from jail months earlier by the sheriff who refused to honor an immigration detainer. He had previously been deported five times. Since that time, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee doubled down on his city\u2019s sanctuary status. \u201cSan Francisco is a sanctuary city and will not waiver in its commitment to protect the rights of all its residents,\u201d Lee told local reporters. A frustrated Barletta said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop talking about it and start taking action against these sanctuary cities. \u201d \u201cThe good in this bill,\u2019 he explained, \u201cis that if we stop these cities now, there might not be any more Kate Steinles. \u201d \u201cUntil we do, there will continue to be more Kate Steinles \u2014  more Americans killed at the hands of illegal aliens that should have been deported after being in jail,\u201d Barletta said. \u201cEveryone will be outraged, but we will know we could have done something about it. \u201d His bill awaits a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee chaired by Rep. Bob Goodlate ( ) before it can move to the House floor for a vote. Chairman Goodlatte has been harshly critical of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over sanctuary cities. \u201cWhile I agree that sanctuary city policies are unacceptable, it\u2019s hypocritical for Secretary Johnson to criticize sanctuary cities while at the same time refusing to take the steps necessary to end these reckless policies,\u201d Goodlatte said to outgoing DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson during a hearing in September 2015. Barletta concluded. \u201cTo me, there\u2019s no gray area here \u2014  Right is right, wrong is wrong, and illegal is illegal. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
