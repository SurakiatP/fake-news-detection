But in recent months, as the U.S. presidential election took a series of bizarre turns, Iranians seeking to make fun of the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d ditched the arts and crafts and simply switched on their TV sets. Iran\u2019s state television, a bastion of ideologues, for once interrupted its regular programing of the \u201cmurders and crimes committed\u201d by the United States, and instead aired all three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2014 live. In a country that tightly controls information about the United States and depictions of Western democracy generally, the decision to air the debates was unprecedented. The election is an opportunity for Iranian hard-liners rather than a threat, insiders said. \u201cWe only need to sit back and let these candidates show themselves how idiotic they are,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a conservative analyst and a regular guest on state television. \u201cThe best way for us to prove that the U.S. government is corrupt and hideous is by showing these people live on our TV.\u201d Live, yes, but some parts \u2014 especially those criticizing Iran \u2014 were not fully translated. After each debate, experts would discuss and agree that the U.S., especially in its current state, \u201ccannot do a damn thing.\u201d Iran\u2019s political establishment has been thoroughly enjoying the campaign. Not because the ruling clerics favor either candidate, but because, they say, the tenor of the debates shows the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d that U.S. democracy has become. On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the U.S. election \u201ca spectacle for exposing their crimes and debacles.\u201d Khamenei seized on the campaign\u2019s tawdriest details: accusations of infidelity and sexual assault. \u201cThe remarks made by these two U.S. presidential candidates over the last few weeks on immoral issues \u2014 which are, for the most part, not baseless accusations \u2014 are enough to disgrace America,\u201d he said during a speech commemorating the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. His supporters responded enthusiastically by shouting, \u201cDeath to America.\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, was not mentioned by name, but the ayatollah seemed to praise his outspokenness, saying: \u201cPeople pay more attention to him.\u201d The candidate, he said, is tapping into genuine American dissatisfaction. \u201cBecause the people look at what he says and see it is true,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cThey see it in the facts of their lives.\u201d Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been officially anti-American. Many ordinary Iranians have milder feelings for the U.S., where more than 2 million of their relatives live. Iran\u2019s leaders, however, are entangled in a constant battle for power and influence with the United States, which was long the strongest power in the Middle East. The U.S. withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan have emboldened Iran. Leaders felt comfortable enough to cut a nuclear deal with the U.S. and expand Iranian influence in the region, local analysts said. \u201cAmerica is no longer a superpower in the region. It\u2019s weak in the Middle East. They are now only one of the players,\u201d said Jalal Barzegar, a reformist journalist. \u201cIt\u2019s now just a country.\u201d For Iranians uninterested in watching the debates, Iran\u2019s state television had another option. In recent weeks it has been airing Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d called \u201cHouse of Straw\u201d here because playing cards is considered un-Islamic. Kevin Spacey\u2019s portrayal as the conniving politician Frank Underwood is the perfect embodiment of the \u201cinhumane face\u201d of U.S. politics, state television officials have said. Apparently, Khamenei has also been watching. In his recent speech, he quoted a line uttered by Spacey in the series. \u201c\u2018Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left one,\u2019 as they say themselves,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cThis is the kind of people they are.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562200.0772004}
