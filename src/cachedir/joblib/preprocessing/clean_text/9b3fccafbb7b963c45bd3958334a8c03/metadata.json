Trump is in striking distance of winning the election with two days to go, and there\u2019s really just one reason for that: He\u2019s leading white voters without a college degree by a huge margin. In recent national surveys, Mr. Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 59 percent to 30 percent among that group. It\u2019s larger than the   lead that Mitt Romney had with those voters in the final polls in 2012. On their own, Mr. Trump\u2019s gains among this group have been enough to cancel out four years of favorable demographic shifts for Democrats among Hispanic and   white voters. He has even won supporters among some of the same white voters who backed Barack Obama in 2008. It suggests that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama might have a little more in common than you might think  \u2014   at least from a political standpoint. If Mr. Trump wins the presidency, that will ultimately be why. It has been a consistent pattern all year. Whenever Mr. Trump fights his way into a tight race with Mrs. Clinton, it\u2019s because he manages to run up the score with   white voters. In the past week, analysis of the early vote has already made it clear that turnout will be more than high enough for a Democrat to win a presidential election. Latino turnout will be high. Black turnout may not reach 2012 levels, but it will not be so low that one could reasonably blame black turnout for a Clinton loss. But Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among the white working class gives him a real chance at victory, a possibility that many discounted as recently as the summer. He could win enough Electoral College votes without winning the popular vote, through narrow victories in Midwestern and Northeastern battlegrounds like Wisconsin and New Hampshire, where Democrats depend on support among white   voters. Mr. Trump\u2019s strength with that group could even be enough for him to win Florida, where Mrs. Clinton\u2019s abundant support among Hispanic voters would otherwise all but doom a Republican. The conventional wisdom after 2012 held that Mr. Obama was a historically weak candidate among white   voters, and that there wasn\u2019t much room for the Republicans to make additional gains. To the extent that there was an argument for how Republicans could make big gains among the group, it was that they could rally the support of missing white voters  \u2014   a group that in reality appears more Democratic than the white voters who do turn out in elections. But exit polls tend to undercount the number of less educated voters, and the national exit polls obscured Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among white voters in the North. They showed him faring worse among white voters than any Democrat since Walter Mondale, but that was exclusively because of his weakness in the South. In many Northern states  \u2014   like Iowa and Ohio  \u2014   Mr. Obama did better among white voters than past Democrats. There was a lot of room for Mrs. Clinton to fall. She\u2019s proving it. For many, it was very hard to imagine that Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   a white Democrat who excelled among white   voters in the 2008 Democratic primary  \u2014   could lose voters who supported Mr. Obama in the 2012 election, or who approve of his performance today. It\u2019s even stranger if one believes that racism is at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal: If Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters are animated by racism, then why did so many of them vote for Mr. Obama? Racism might well animate Mr. Trump\u2019s base. But his appeal among some white Obama supporters suggests that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama might have something in common. Mr. Trump has changed the story lines of the 2012 and 2008 elections  \u2014   and tapped into many of the same issues and frames that helped Mr. Obama. In 2008, Mr. Obama depicted himself as an agent of hope and change: He ran against Washington, the establishment and special interests. In 2012, the Obama campaign attacked its Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, as a plutocrat who would outsource jobs and help the wealthy, not the middle class. Those are the kinds of reasons that white   Democrats in places like Scranton, Pa. and Youngstown, Ohio, remained with the Democrats. In this election, Mr. Trump flipped that frame. He ran against the establishment  \u2014   and against a candidate who embodies it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney. He depicted Mrs. Clinton as someone who supports corporate  \u2014   even global  \u2014   interests over the middle class on issues like trade and immigration. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complement the notion that she\u2019s not trying to help ordinary Americans. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has spent more time questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the presidency than emphasizing the traditional Democratic campaign message about the economy. Mr. Trump is expected to fall short of the presidency, in part because of his problems capitalizing on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deep weakness among white   voters. There are probably many young white men without a degree, for instance, who liked Mr. Obama and don\u2019t like either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. Regardless of the outcome, these voters will loom over American politics. Huge parts of the Republican Party\u2019s establishment would undoubtedly prefer a candidate who\u2019s friendlier to their views on immigration and trade. If Mrs. Clinton wins with strength among the well educated and Hispanic voters, much of the Republican establishment will conclude that those groups are in their electoral interest as well. But the voters receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s views on these issues would have pulled Republicans awfully close to victory, even with a deeply flawed candidate. They\u2019re also among the voters likeliest to be skeptical of Mrs. Clinton in four years. It would be difficult for the party not to cater to them. Democrats would have the opposite challenge. Four years after demographic shifts were credited for Mr. Obama\u2019s victory, the party would undoubtedly realize the extent to which they remain dependent on the support of voters whom they might have assumed they no longer needed. At the same time, their winning coalition would be better educated and more diverse than ever before. Without a Republican like Mr. Trump as a foil, it could be hard to devise an agenda and a message that would hold Mrs. Clinton\u2019s coalition together.'"}, "time": 1742561879.7660007}
