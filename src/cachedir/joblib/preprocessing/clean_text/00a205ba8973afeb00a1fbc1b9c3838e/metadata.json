It was a bit of a    moment when Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, told reporters that President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, had called Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the judiciary \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and \u201cdisheartening. \u201d The account was readily confirmed on the record by a White House adviser, Ron Bonjean, working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation. But that wasn\u2019t enough to stop the president from going after Mr. Bluementhal where it hurt: The president was referring to 2010 news, broken in The New York Times, a media outlet he has openly criticized, that Mr. Blumenthal had  exaggerated his   service. The president, who might want to be making friends with the senators who need to confirm Judge Gorsuch, tipped his hand as to what news program he was watching Thursday morning: CNN, where Mr. Blumenthal was being interviewed. Mr. Trump registered his discontent. Actually, Mr. Cuomo did ask about Mr. Blumenthal\u2019s service, he said. It is also unclear what was \u201cfake\u201d about a story that relied as much on the people shepherding the Gorsuch nomination through the Senate as on one of the senators who will cast a vote. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, confirmed the Blumenthal account Thursday morning, as did former Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican and one of Judge Gorsuch\u2019s shepherds. Mr. Cuomo also did not ask the senator about the president\u2019s bone spurs. Maybe he was just not positively disposed toward the United States Senate Thursday morning. After taking a whack at Senator Blumenthal, Mr. Trump turned to an old nemesis, Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, whose actual Vietnam heroism, beyond dispute, was disparaged by Mr. Trump. This time, the president was unhappy that Mr. McCain had suggested that the recent raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of an American commando, multiple civilians and possibly a child who was an American citizen was not a success. The president\u2019s tweets came after his press secretary, Sean Spicer, asserted Wednesday that the senator owed an apology to Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, who lost his life in the raid. Mr. McCain offered no such thing. \u201cWhen you lose a $75 million airplane and, more importantly, an American life is lost, I don\u2019t believe you can call it a success,\u201d he told NBC News. Jeff Sessions\u2019 bruising confirmation as attorney general Wednesday evening set off a predictable flurry of news releases that declared the   Alabama senator to be a great American who would \u201cmake America a safer place\u201d (the National Rifle Association) or \u201ca lap dog\u201d and a \u201cdangerous gamble\u201d (the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence). But for all the bombastic pronouncements, a more measured,   note came from, wait for it, the pot industry. Mr. Sessions has been a longtime foe of legalizing marijuana, but the National Cannabis Industry Association was totally chill. \u201cWe look forward\u201d to working with Mr. Sessions to maintain the Justice Department\u2019s current   approach to state marijuana policies, the association said. \u201cWe will work with him to do that,\u201d the industry said cheerfully. In other words, don\u2019t bogart that joint, my friend. When President Trump met with the airline industry on Thursday, the executives had plenty to complain about: an air traffic control system that is out of date, an airport infrastructure that is failing, computers that are melting down. And in the president, the executives found a sympathetic ear. Airports are getting \u201cthe wrong stuff,\u201d he said. The air traffic control network is \u201ca system that\u2019s totally out of whack. \u201d Why? \u201cWe spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, we got nothing,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports. \u201d The day President Trump took the oath of office, he filed paperwork to declare his candidacy for   not so much because he was overeager but because money was still flowing into his campaign coffers, and any funds raised over $5, 000 in 2017 would have had to be returned unless Mr. Trump registered as a candidate. And we know the president doesn\u2019t like refunds. So what\u2019s a federal employee to do with a boss who was technically running for office the day he stepped into the Oval Office? The Office of Special Counsel has answers. It has told federal employees that they may not express a view about whether Mr. Trump should be   or defeated in 2020 while on duty or in the workplace, but it assured them that they were otherwise free to express support or disapproval about Mr. Trump and his policies. A new guidance document was issued on Tuesday after the office said that it had received numerous inquiries about the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s filing for  . In contrast, former President Barack Obama filed such paperwork more than two years after his inauguration. The office  \u2014   an independent agency that watchdogs   protections  \u2014   said that with the exception of expressly advocating Mr. Trump\u2019s success or failure in the 2020 election, federal employees were still pretty free. \u201cBecause the 2020 election is still more than three years away, at this time not all expressions of support or opposition to President Trump constitute political activity for purposes of the Hatch Act,\u201d which prohibits federal employees from politicking, it said. The office also developed a new answer to its list of frequently asked questions that spells out with greater detail the scope and limits of federal employees\u2019 right to express their views while they are at work or on duty. The new answer distinguished between expressing a view about current events, policy issues and matters of public interest  \u2014   which federal employees are always free to do  \u2014   and political activity, meaning advocating the success or failure of a particular political candidate or party. For example, it said, federal employees on duty or in the workplace are free to say \u201cI agree with health care reform,\u201d but not, \u201cIf you disagree with health care reform you should support candidate X. \u201d Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of the   corporation that gave the world Carl\u2019s Jr. Hardee\u2019s, and racy ads of   women eating large hamburgers, is finally getting his confirmation hearing (on Feb. 16) after multiple delays. And Democrats see a cabinet nominee they may just be able to derail. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, called on the president to withdraw Mr. Puzder\u2019s nomination, describing his business record as \u201c . \u201d He also picked up the conservatives\u2019 war cry, assailing Mr. Puzder for hiring an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. \u201cThey ought to withdraw Puzder\u2019s nomination before he further embarrasses this administration and further exposes the hypocrisy of President Trump in saying one thing to the workers of America and doing another,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. Momentum may be building. Democrats have attacked his record at CKE, the parent company of the   chains. Opponents have moved to unseal divorce records, which may contain details of domestic violence accusations leveled by his   then retracted. And until Mr. Schumer chimed in, conservatives  \u2014   led by the White House adviser Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart News  \u2014   were the leading voices attacking Mr. Puzder for employing an undocumented immigrant. Well, if he doesn\u2019t get confirmed, Mr. Puzder will have a nest egg to fall back on. Ethics documents released Wednesday night showed that he pulled in a $3. 4 million salary last year, owns as much as $55 million in company stock that he must divest himself of, expects a bonus of $1 million to $5 million and even secured a relocation benefit worth between $250, 000 and $500, 000. And he would not be nearly the richest member of the cabinet. Budget season is fast approaching on Capitol Hill, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met for a private breakfast on Wednesday with the lawmakers who will largely decide on the Pentagon\u2019s coming request for more money to increase what President Trump has said are the nation\u2019s badly \u201cdepleted\u201d armed forces. Mr. Mattis and top aides met with the senior Republican and Democrat on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and their counterparts on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees that control the Pentagon\u2019s purse strings. The big   is complicated, however. Under the terms of the 2011 Budget Control Act, both domestic and military spending is subject to hard, statutory budget caps. Republicans want to lift those caps for the Defense Department. Democrats insist that they will go along only if the caps are raised for domestic spending as well. For a guy who famously  \u2014   and rightly  \u2014   rejected the polls that showed he would not win the presidency, Mr. Trump has suddenly become quite enamored with those surveys. Vexed by the federal courts and questioned by the press, the president has turned to public opinion to bolster his policies, especially his temporary ban on visas to travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. And it\u2019s not just polls of Americans. Hey, polls of Europeans back him up too. And of course, polls also back up his feeling for the news media  \u2014   which, as you might have noticed, he doesn\u2019t like.'"}, "time": 1742561646.5297923}
