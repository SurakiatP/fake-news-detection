Tell us what you\u2019d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com Across California, public transit agencies are pushing ballot measures in search of money for just about everything related to transit: new rail lines, highway widening and even pothole filling. Santa Clara County will vote in November on a   sales tax to finance transportation projects. Similar measures will be on the ballot in Sacramento County and, very likely, San Diego County. Possibly several other Bay Area counties as well. Los Angeles County decided last week to put a   tax on the ballot for the third time in just eight years. These small sales tax increases have become perhaps the only realistic way to pay for ambitious transportation projects, said Brian D. Taylor, a professor of urban planning at U. C. L. A. \u201cVoters and elected officials have become very hostile to increases in fuel taxes,\u201d he said. In 2008, voters in Los Angeles approved a   sales tax increase for 30 years. That has financed projects like the   rail line connecting downtown to the beach, which just opened. (Never mind that the trip is often still faster by car.) Four years later, voters rejected a plan to extend that Los Angeles County sales tax another 30 years. Now we\u2019re headed to the ballot box again  \u2014   only this time, the sales tax hike would be permanent. \u2022 With concerns about climate change growing, Oakland banned the transport and storage of large coal shipments, halting a plan to a use a former Army base to ship coal to China and other overseas markets. \u2022 After last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, will undocumented immigrants in California, and around the country, go back to avoiding the authorities? Many vow to keep living in the open. \u2022 \u201cThe tragedy is that more of them didn\u2019t die. \u201d Remarks by extremist pastors celebrating the massacre in Orlando, Fla. including one in Sacramento, have brought attention to   congregations. \u2022 The ad industry is confronting the rise of Facebook. Our media columnist offers a report from Cannes, France. \u2022 The drone craze may be heading to the water. OpenROV, a   in Berkeley, is building submarine drone kits. \u2022 A new battlefront for tech giants: Amazon is going up against Apple, Google and Microsoft in the education technology market for primary and secondary schools. \u2022 Airbnb, which helped craft a rental law in San Francisco, is now suing the city to block the law\u2019s enforcement. \u2022 Gov. Jerry Brown signed a $171 billion state budget for the next fiscal year, including $2 billion for a   fund. He invoked the fable of \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper\u201d to explain why. [Sacramento Bee] \u2022 In a community scorched by wildfire, residents believed their homes were left to burn because firefighters were protecting wealthier areas. [Los Angeles Times] \u2022 The Oceanside police said a woman suspected of drunken driving struck and killed a pedestrian, then drove for a mile with the victim\u2019s body lodged in the front seat. [NBC San Diego] \u2022 How crazy is the San Francisco rental market? One tenant had his rent hiked to $8, 000 from $1, 800. [SFGate] \u2022 A former top Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department official was sentenced to five years in prison. Prosecutors said he tried to block a federal investigation into the abuse of inmates at county jails. [Los Angeles Times] \u2022 The artificial turf fields at San Diego schools save lots of water. But parents are worried that the fields, made in part of crushed old car tires, are harming their children\u2019s health. [Voice of San Diego] \u2022 Now that LeBron James has brought an N. B. A. title to Cleveland, San Diego sports fans have been ranked the most miserable and   in the country. On the bright side, they still get to live in San Diego. [ESPN] You know this bear. It flies on the state flag, and dances on the sideline at U. C. L. A. football games. But how well, exactly, do you want to know this bear? (Especially if you\u2019ve seen the scene of Leonardo DiCaprio attacked by one in \u201cThe Revenant. \u201d) In fact, the last California grizzly bear was killed nearly 100 years ago. Now, the Center for Biological Diversity wants to bring the bears back to the California. Grizzly bears are endangered. In the continental United States, they live only in Yellowstone National Park and a few other remote locations. The bears, the group said, would not be running around downtown San Francisco. They could be safely reintroduced in the remote Sierra Nevada. On its website, the group describes grizzlies as eating mostly nuts, berries, fish and small animals, and only \u201cthe occasional person who pokes a camera in their face. \u201d (Not exactly reassuring.) This past week, a black bear, known as a skittish animal, clawed its way into a tent and scratched a man who was camping about 30 miles from Los Angeles. Grizzlies are far larger and more aggressive than black bears. For now, federal and state officials, convinced that a   grizzly bear would eventually end up in a campground, have not yet shown interest in bringing them back.
