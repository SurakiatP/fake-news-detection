[Despite stating in their fourth paragraph that the former UKIP chief Nigel Farage \u201chas not been accused of wrongdoing and is not a suspect or a target of the U. S. investigation\u201d authors Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Nick Hopkins, and Luke Harding composed 2000 words claiming \u201csources\u201d told them about the FBI\u2019s interest in Mr. Farage.  Not naming sources, or even who or where they work, the Guardian reports the British MEP is a \u201cperson of interest\u201d to the FBI  \u2014   if only because he has met several members of the President\u2019s administration and sought to interview Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in his capacity as an LBC radio presenter. The Guardian quotes anonymous informants  \u2014   though it is not clear if there is more than one  \u2014   as embellishing these links to present Farage as a   figure, describing how, \u201cIf you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. \u201cHe\u2019s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There\u2019s a lot of attention being paid to him. \u201d Responding in a statement seen by Breitbart London, the veteran Brexit campaigner said it took him \u201ca long time to finish reading\u201d the article because he was \u201claughing so much\u201d. \u201cThis is fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump. \u201cFor the record I have never been to Russia, I\u2019ve had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT in the last 18 months. \u201cI consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia. \u201d Farage also reiterated that his \u201cmeeting with Julian Assange was organised for me by LBC Radio with a view to conducting an interview. \u201d In response to the Guardian article, it has taken me a long time to finish reading because I am laughing so much at this fake news.  \u2014   Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 1, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742628495.4517045}
