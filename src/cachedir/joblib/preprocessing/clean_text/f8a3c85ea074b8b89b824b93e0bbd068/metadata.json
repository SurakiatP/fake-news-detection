Like her character, Metz has also struggled with her size ever since she was a little girl. \\nIn an interview with People Magazine this week, Metz revealed that she has felt the exact same pains that 8-year-old Kate experienced in the flashbacks sequences shown on TV. \\nFor Metz, even as a child her weight \u201cwas always something I was cognizant of. I\u2019ve had pictures of when I was 3 and 4 years old, and I\u2019ve always been chubby.\u201d \\nThen she discovered that her weight was something she was supposed to be ashamed of.

She called that a life-changing moment: \\n\u201cI had this epiphany that my life is my own and my choices are my own.\u201d \\nPrior to \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Metz appeared in only a few things , and certainly not as a lead actress. \\nShe played Ima \\'Barbara\\' Wiggles on \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show,\u201d described as the \u201cfattest woman of all time\u201d by the show. \\nEven then, she had to wear a fat suit on set: \\nHer newfound fame and honest portrayal of a woman struggling with her weight has not gone to her head, though. She\\'s staying grounded and grateful: \\n\u201cI just feel really grateful that I can pursue my dreams and also reach people in ways that I never expected.\u201d \\nMetz told Refinery 29 last month that women have already reached out to her and praised her touching portrayal of Kate. \\nIn reality, 67% of American women are a size 14 or higher, but these women only make up about 2% of the images portrayed in the media, according to Refinery 29 . \\nResearch has also shown that dieting is more likely to cause obesity than solve it, according to the New York Times : \\n\"After about five years, 41 percent of dieters gain back more weight than they lost. Long-term studies show dieters are more likely than non-dieters to become obese over the next one to 15 years. \\nThat\u2019s true in men and women, across ethnic groups, from childhood through middle age. The effect is strongest in those who started in the normal weight range, a group that includes almost half of the female dieters in the United States.\" \\nWhile she\\'s not the first, Metz\\'s performance has the potential to open more doors for plus-sized actresses who are trying to find their place in Hollywood. Other actresses such as Rebel Wilson, Queen Latifah, and Melissa McCarthy have also helped pave the way. '"}, "time": 1742628426.0595083}
