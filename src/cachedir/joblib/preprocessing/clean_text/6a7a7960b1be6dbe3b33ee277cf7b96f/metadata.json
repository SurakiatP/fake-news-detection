He made his remarks in an interview with \u201c The Axe Files ,\u201d hosted by David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Obama. Kaine said the former secretary of state will press lawmakers to rewrite the Sept. 14, 2001, Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that set the stage for the invasion of Afghanistan and has underpinned the entire war on terrorism. Obama has invoked the measure to argue that his undeclared but escalating war on ISIS is legal, a position Kaine had previously dismissed as an \u201c Alice in Wonderland \u201d strategy. Clinton believes that \u201cit\u2019s time for us to take that now-outdated authorization, and really think about what we are confronting, and work together to reach some legislative-executive accord about what it is we\u2019re doing,\u201d Kaine told Axelrod. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to get back in the game and refine and revise that authorization.\u201d Seventy percent of the current Congress wasn\u2019t in office when lawmakers approved the 2001 AUMF, and America\u2019s terrorist enemies have \u201cmorphed and changed,\u201d the senator argued. Obama called in a May 2013 speech for revising and repealing the 2001 AUMF, saying it was time to get America off \u201ca perpetual wartime footing.\u201d His top aides have since admitted that the job will fall to the next president . No lawmaker has worked harder than Kaine to get Congress to debate and vote on an AUMF that specifically covers the Islamic State. \u201cWe have allowed President Obama to wage an executive war of his own choosing without any congressional permission for nearly two years,\u201d Kaine told Virginia Military Institute cadets at their graduation in mid-May. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that a future president will use this example to also justify initiating war without the permission of Congress.\u201d Clinton had sent mixed messages about whether she would seek a new AUMF, but lined up earlier this year squarely behind her running mate\u2019s view. A spokesman for her campaign, Jesse Lehrich, told Yahoo News in July that the former secretary of state \u201cagrees with Senator Kaine that if we are serious about confronting ISIS, Congress ought to express its resolve to stand behind our military and win this fight by passing a new AUMF.\u201d After stalling at the request of vulnerable Democratic lawmakers facing the 2014 midterm elections, Obama finally submitted an ISIS-specific AUMF to Congress in February 2015, but it\u2019s essentially dead . The legislation reflected his national security aides\u2019 desire that it not tie his hands. The document authorized airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in the following three years. It forbade the use of American ground troops in \u201c enduring offensive ground combat operations \u201d \u2014 a term the White House described as deliberately vague. It also allowed strikes against \u201cindividuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL\u201d anywhere in the world. Democrats have balked at supporting such a sweeping measure. Republicans have pointed to the three-year limit and the ground-combat language to argue that the AUMF improperly binds the hands of Obama\u2019s successor. The truth of the matter is that both sides see political peril in the president\u2019s proposal. Democrats recall how voting in favor of the Iraq War helped to doom Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential ambitions. And Republicans, who could vote to remove the language they describe as objectionable, prefer to criticize Obama\u2019s handling of the conflict without taking any steps that might make them co-owners of the strategy.'"}, "time": 1742564527.2608829}
