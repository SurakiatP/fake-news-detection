Department of State funding could be cut by 31 percent, sparking outrage among mostly Democrats, who say the cuts could put the country at risk. [Wendy Sherman, under secretary of state for political affairs in the Obama administration, told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Thursday that Trump\u2019s proposal to cut the State Department\u2019s budget by a third would have \u201cimplications\u201d for  fighting terrorism and epidemics like Ebola. \u201d  But Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) said on Thursday at the Conversations with Conservatives Press Conference on Capitol Hill that, given the agency\u2019s priorities during the Obama administration, the cuts might fall short. Gohmert said the cuts  \u2014   first reported as 28 percent but later clarified by the State Department as totaling 31 percent   \u2014   \u201cmight not be enough. \u201d Gohmert cited the Obama administration\u2019s priority at State of promoting homosexual rights around the world, including encouraging nation states to change their laws regarding homosexuality and   marriage. On Jan. 11, the   rights publication the Washington Blade published a story entitled, \u201c10 ways Obama promoted LGBT rights abroad. \u201d Those moves by the Obama administration\u2019s State Department included: Mark Toner, acting spokesman at State, clarified on Thursday the proposed percentage of cuts at State. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of confusion about that, so let me try to clarify it,\u201d Toner said. \u201cThe FY 2018 budget requests 25. 6 billion in base funding for the Department of State and USAID, and that\u2019s a 10. 1 billion or 28 percent reduction from the FY 2017 continuing resolution level. \u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s a 28 percent reduction without the overseas contingency operations funding,\u201d Toner said. \u201cSo the budget also requests, obviously, 12 billion as overseas contingency operations funding for a total request of 37. 6 billion, which represents an overall reduction of 17. 3 billion. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s 31 percent from the annualized  \u2014   or from the CR level, which is base and OCO funds,\u201d Toner said. \u201cSo just to simplify it, the two variations there  \u2014   the 28 percent is the amount of reduction without OCO, which is the overseas contingency operations funding. \u201d \u201cThe 31 percent number or figure is with that overseas contingency operations funding,\u201d Toner said. The Los Angeles Times suggested in its reporting on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was not concerned with the budget cuts, rather than characterizing his remarks as compatible with President Trump\u2019s assessment that the Department has been overfunded in the past. \u201cBut the head of the department, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seemed unconcerned Thursday,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cThe level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past  \u2014   and particularly in this past year  \u2014   is simply not sustainable,\u201d Tillerson said at a brief news conference in Tokyo, the first stop on a     tour of Asia. \u201cTillerson, for most of his career a top executive at Exxon Mobil, said he expected more aid from other countries would help to cover the shortfall as the U. S. recedes, and he said he was \u2018confident\u2019 the State Department would continue to fulfill its mission,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cWe are going to be undertaking a very comprehensive examination of how programs are executed, a very comprehensive examination of how we are structured, and I\u2019m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department, we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective, much more efficient and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWe understand the challenge,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI take the challenge that the president has given us on willingly and with great expectation that with everyone in the State Department\u2019s assistance, we\u2019re going to deliver a much better result for the American people in the future. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562883.3986967}
