[\u201cWe are absolutely dead serious about the wall,\u201d Mulvaney said, calling it one of the president\u2019s \u201ctop three\u201d budget priorities.  He pushed back against reports that said the administration was reducing funding for the border wall, pointing out that Trump\u2019s budget was a dramatic increase in border security from the previous year. The 2017 budget included $1. 5 billion for border security and $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The 2018 budget, he explained, requested $2. 6 billion and $4. 5 billion for DHS. The text of the budget specifies funds for \u201ca physical wall\u201d on the southern border of the United States. \u201da physical wall\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) May 23, 2017,  The funding would help fund replacement wall, new wall, roads and infrastructure for the wall as well as land acquisition. The director suggested that supporters should be patient regarding the wall, noting that it was only the first step in the lengthy project. \u201cKeep in mind, you can\u2019t just   \u2026     you don\u2019t automatically magically build a wall in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he said. On Monday, Mulvaney previewed a $1. 6 billion request for \u201cactual    construction. \u201d He described \u201ccompetition\u201d process for getting the best possible wall design for each area of the Southern border, citing   prototypes that were currently being constructed. \u201cWe fully expect that different barriers will serve best in different areas,\u201d Mulvaney said.
