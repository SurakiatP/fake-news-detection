Nov 6, 2016 5 0 \\nRecently, tensions between law enforcement workers and peaceful protestors with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have escalated. A series of standoffs have resulted in protesters being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tased, and even attacked with concussion cannons. \\nAfter months of struggles to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri River, opposition of the DAPL were blessed when a herd of buffalo appeared out of nowhere. Buffalo were seen on the hill during the current front line standoff at Standing Rock. \\n\u2014 Kat Maguire (@katworldmusic) October 27, 2016 \\nI\u2019m in tears over the buffalo appearing at #StandingRock ! The ppl have been praying & the ancestors responded. https://t.co/qouCvCCgtZ \\nA cry of joy was heard over the crowd because The Standing Rock Sioux had reportedly been praying for help in the midst of the standoff. \\n\u201cThe ancestors are with us,\u201d said Myron Dewey, who uploaded video footage of the stampede to Facebook. \\nBuffalo are revered as symbols of sacrifice in Native American culture. Indigenous people believe the animals, known as \u201cTatanka Oyate\u201d or \u201cBuffalo Nation,\u201d sacrifice themselves in order to supply their meat and hides for people. \\nAccording to RT: \\nAt least 117 demonstrators have been arrested in North Dakota as protesters continue to protest against the construction of the controversial pipeline, which will cut through Native American land. Protesters say its construction will destroy sacred sites and have a negative impact on the region\u2019s water supplies. \\nIn a statement from the tribe\u2019s chairman, David Archambault II, the leader condemned what he called the recent \u201cmilitarized law enforcement\u201d against protesters. \\n\u201cMilitarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to pray for peace. We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564174.977395}
