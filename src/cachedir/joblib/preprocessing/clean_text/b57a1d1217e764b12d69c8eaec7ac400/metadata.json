First night in federal prison, and he was already headed to solitary confinement, his case too notorious for him to mingle safely with the others. He remembers the cell being clammy and dark. It made him think of Rikers Island, where his father had been held after being arrested when Pedro was 11. But this was a few grades higher: the Metropolitan Detention Center, in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a windowless cage looming over New York Bay. From the next cell came a voice, pricking him out of his numbness: \u201cHey, Espada! Hang in there. You\u2019re the senator, right?\u201d the voice said. \u201cMy mother voted for you. \u201d Senator, he was: Pedro Espada Jr. once the   powerful man in New York State. And \u201csenator\u201d he remains  \u2014   even today, three years into a   sentence for stealing money from a nonprofit. There are a lot of \u201csenators\u201d in America\u2019s federal prisons these days. In May, three more corrupt New York State lawmakers are expected to join the jumpsuited ranks, three more cautionary tales from a State Legislature with no apparent shortage of them. There is Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and former Assembly speaker, who was convicted of abusing his office in return for nearly $4 million in kickbacks. There is Dean G. Skelos, a Republican and former Senate majority leader, who was found guilty of selling official favors for payments and jobs for his son. Convicted last fall in overlapping trials that sent Albany into upheaval, the two men are to be sentenced within 10 days of each other in May, with Mr. Silver\u2019s sentencing scheduled first, on Tuesday. And then there is John L. Sampson, all but eclipsed by the convictions of Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos, who led the Senate Democrats for three and a half years. Mr. Sampson was convicted last year of trying to thwart an investigation into allegations that he had embezzled state funds. He is to be sentenced on May 19. Like many of those convicted before them, Mr. Silver, Mr. Skelos and Mr. Sampson have asked for minimal or no prison time. Prosecutors, sentencing guidelines and recent history suggest they should not expect any leniency. If interviews with four former lawmakers  \u2014   two currently incarcerated and two who have been released  \u2014   are a guide, the three men are in for a prolonged humbling. Their former colleagues tell of spiritual awakenings, physical survival and mental toughening. But what figures largest in these personal narratives  \u2014   what they say has sustained them throughout  \u2014   is the belief that they were wrongly prosecuted. Contrition? What for? Outside, their names are synonymous with scandal. Inside, they command a measure of respect. \u201cI have a title for life,\u201d said Efra\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. a Democrat and former state senator from the Bronx who was convicted in 2009 and spent almost six years at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, N. J. before being released in February. \u201cI introduced myself as Efra\u00edn. But they called me senator. \u201d With the expected arrivals of Mr. Skelos, Mr. Silver and Mr. Sampson, there will be at least nine former members of the New York State Legislature in the federal prison system. Nine more were released over the last few years. One, facing terminal cancer, is under house arrest. Another died in prison. \u201cI laugh at all those who turned up their nose at me,\u201d said Shirley L. Huntley, a former state senator from Queens who spent 10 months in federal prison in Danbury, Conn.  \u2014   the institution on which the women\u2019s prison in \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d is based  \u2014   after pleading guilty in 2013 to stealing more than $87, 000 in taxpayer money through a nonprofit she ran. \u201cNow look where they\u2019re at. They\u2019re in worse shape. \u201d Puffing on an   in her living room in Queens, the same room where she once secretly recorded seven of her colleagues for the authorities, she went down the list. Friends. Enemies. Allies. Idiots. Then came the   bile tempered with a laugh. \u201cYou can tell all the other crooks I say hey!\u201d Mr. Espada prefers a new honorific: prison abolitionist. Some facts before going further: Before all this happened, he had run for office about a dozen times, losing more often than he won. He had shaken a swarm of investigations and one indictment before succumbing to a second. He had risen from poverty to become the   Latino in New York State government  \u2014   and, briefly and under  bizarre circumstances, the   powerful man in the state  \u2014   but only after   bringing the Senate to a standstill and making Albany a national laughingstock in the process. He once tried to hide from a television reporter by putting on an orange ski cap and using a baby to shield his face. On a recent morning at the Metropolitan Detention Center, sitting in a plastic chair in an airless,   booth in what resembled a large hospital waiting room  \u2014   minus the televisions, the pastel watercolor paintings, the magazines and the windows  \u2014   Mr. Espada seemed shorn of the grandiloquence that those in Albany had come to know so well over the two decades of his singularly unruly political career. No more ego, he promised  \u2014   or not as much, anyway. No more referring to himself, without irony, as Hurricane Espada. He said he was devoting his life to reforming America\u2019s prisons. He had seen, he said, how prison devastates lives and families instead of rehabilitating inmates. He had seen prisoners released, only to return within months, unable to cope in a society that no longer wanted much to do with them. He had been studying the   literature: Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d Harvey A. Silverglate\u2019s \u201cThree Felonies a Day\u201d and \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Prison,\u201d by Jeff Smith, a former Missouri state legislator. Mr. Espada said that only violent offenders, people like murderers and rapists, should be in prison, and that others should be forced to serve their communities. Of Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver, Mr. Espada said, \u201cAnybody that would want to put them in jail for 10 or 15 years should spend a weekend in here and think whether that\u2019s necessary. It wouldn\u2019t pay back the people they harmed. \u201d He avoided addressing the victims of his own crimes. Mr. Espada, a Democrat, was convicted in 2012 of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the nonprofit health care clinics he ran in his Bronx district when he was a state senator. He spent the spoils on sushi, parties, spa treatments and a Bentley. Then he got caught. In the years since, there have been 16 months of no daylight and no fresh air, and before that nearly a year of not seeing his family. And before that, a   stint in solitary confinement after he stepped over the property line at the Federal Correctional Institution in Schuylkill, Pa. one of three prisons where he has spent the past three years. All in all, a thorough humiliation. \u201cI know that I was too consumed with the search for personal power,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that I was too consumed with materialistic things. \u201d He gestured at his khaki jumpsuit, his shiny white sneakers. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t miss any of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m used to living on $300 a month. \u201d His time at Schuylkill overlapped briefly with that of Larry B. Seabrook, a former city councilman from the Bronx who is serving five years for corruption. But neither felt much like talking shop. \u201cThis is our new existence,\u201d Mr. Espada said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about how to fit in. \u201d At Fort Dix, his third stop, he said he learned how the other inmates made prison hooch out of sugar and candy distilled in the bathroom, each   bottle going for $40, and where they bought cellphones and drugs. Once back at the detention center in Brooklyn, he learned to get his protein from canned tuna, eggs and peanut butter bought at the commissary, and to relish microwave meals of commissary mackerel, chicken, pork sausage and rice. Once a professional brawler, he learned to avoid confrontation. (There have been a few close calls, even so.) He learned to sleep through the noise of 100 other men snoring and going to the bathroom and working out and watching television, so he can wake up at 4:30 a. m. to lift weights. To survive solitary confinement by running in place until he was exhausted. To love God, about whom he had not thought all that much for many years. To keep busy with Bible study and a biweekly book club. To cherish every visit with his wife, who has visited him each weekend, even though touching is restricted and they have had to sit side by side, knees facing forward, rationing their two kisses and hugs. He learned about small satisfactions, like when eight of the students in the G. E. D. class he teaches every afternoon recently passed their test. They call him \u201cProfessor. \u201d Professor Espada takes pride in teaching nearly illiterate men to read, in counseling younger inmates, and in helping others work through their cases in the library. Senator Espada sits here unchastened, boasting of the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d he once led  \u2014   same as Bernie Sanders, he said. Senator Espada is the one planning to tear down a bad system from the inside out. The one insisting he was framed. If they have one thing in common, these Albany alumni, it is this: They refuse to be expunged from the rolls of the innocent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t weigh on me that there\u2019s this opinion of me, because it\u2019s not true,\u201d said William F. Boyland Jr. a Democrat who represented Brownsville in the Assembly. He is serving a   sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Loretto, Pa. a   drive out to the western part of the state, after being convicted of bribery in 2014. It is a recurring theme. \u201cI don\u2019t have that thing where I\u2019m a criminal, so I\u2019m smiling,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who spent much of a   interview at his Bronx apartment outlining, in baroque detail, all the ways he said he had been railroaded by prosecutors, the judge and even his own lawyer. (Before he left prison, he said, his fellow inmates told him, \u201cYou\u2019re safer here with the homies. The billionaires will put out a contract on you. They don\u2019t like you, \u2019cause you tell it like it is. \u201d) \u201cI did not steal money from Soundview or from anybody,\u201d said Mr. Espada, referring to the health care network he ran. He had not received a fair trial, he said he would have continued to contest the charges had he not run out of resources and the will to subject his family to what he described as further pain. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t spend the money right, but I didn\u2019t steal the money,\u201d said Ms. Huntley, who suggested that she had been the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by old enemies in Albany. Besides, she added, as if this would mitigate things, the actions in question had occurred before she entered the Senate. In a more reflective moment, Ms. Huntley said she could not bring herself to move on. \u201cSome people say, let it go,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to let stuff go. I don\u2019t want to die being known as, what\u2019s the word all the newspapers used? \u2018Disgraced senator. \u2019\u201d She said she wanted to be treated \u201cjust as a person. Just use my name. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ve got to make me sound like I\u2019m great. You all call me disgraced, but in my mind, I\u2019m not disgraced. \u201d In this season of   corruption cases, few phrases have dominated discourse in the State Capitol like ethics reform. Yet Mr. Boyland, Mr. Espada, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez and Ms. Huntley had little to say on the subject. If anything, they suggested, they and their colleagues had been punished simply for doing things the Albany way. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they were crooks. Everybody does all that,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said of Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018I help you, you help me.\u2019 So what is that? Politics. \u201d Mr. Boyland was asked if he would endorse any of the reforms his former colleagues have discussed this session, including closing a   loophole and banning outside income for legislators. He smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t endorse anything now,\u201d he said. A day begins at Federal Correctional Institution in Loretto. A former monastery on a hilltop, it would resemble a high school campus were it not for the rings of concertina wire that surround it. Mr. Boyland is awake at 6:30 to meditate before going to work on the facilities team. (Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, too, was initially assigned a job assisting a plumber, but, by his own account, was deemed more of a burden than a help.) Mr. Boyland runs around the track. He lifts weights. Without the constant nag of his cellphone, without the late, indulgent Albany dinners, he is, he said, the healthiest and most focused he has ever been. To other inmates, he introduces himself as Will. But he lives with men from New York, even some familiar with his old district. There is a Boyland Street in Brownsville, named for his uncle, who once held the same Assembly seat. \u201cYou the same guy?\u201d the inmates ask. Amid the chaos of this year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Boyland said, he is in demand as a political analyst. \u201cAll. The. Time,\u201d he said, flashing a smile. Some of the queries have a more local bent: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Cuomo and de Blasio?\u201d he has been asked, referring to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, combatants in a   intrastate quarrel. \u201cThey\u2019re both Democrats, so what\u2019s the beef about?\u201d He passes the rest of the day with religious services, Bible study, work on his legal appeal and reading. He is taking classes in Spanish (because of the   constituents in his old district)   skills (just in case) and crocheting (hats, mostly). He has almost finished James Redfield\u2019s \u201cThe Celestine Prophecy,\u201d which he described as a   novel about the spiritual journey of a wrongly imprisoned man. He said he could relate. From afar, he tries to raise his    son, who is back in Brooklyn. He was the hardest thing to leave behind. Albany, he does not miss. It was serving his constituents, he said, that he loved. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to being on this side of the table,\u201d he said, indicating the round visitors\u2019 room table where he sat across from a reporter. \u201cI was the one visiting to bring help. I\u2019m usually on that side of the table. \u201d They watch the evening news and read the New York City papers, eavesdropping on a world that has tried to delete them from its memory. Even so, what lies beyond the prison walls has begun to seem abstract  \u2014   fuzzy around the edges. When Mr. Espada was in solitary confinement at Schuylkill, he was allowed one hour a day to go outside, shackled and cuffed. He always went, no matter the weather. \u201cAn opportunity to experience daylight, sunlight, rain hitting your head  \u2014   it\u2019s as basic as that,\u201d he said, his voice softening. \u201cI said to myself, I would never complain about the elements again, because I loved it when the rain hit my head, when it was cold. \u201d Then the man who was once the   powerful in New York State gathered himself, pivoting back to the pitch. He was the better for surviving this, he said. Not that it was about him it was about those far less fortunate than him, who would carry this scarlet letter the rest of their lives. He had promised them he would fight for them, for reform, and he would. He would never give up. There was a reason they still called him the Senator.'"}, "time": 1742628380.5542552}
