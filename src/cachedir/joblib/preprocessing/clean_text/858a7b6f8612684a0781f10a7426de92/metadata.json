[\u201cThe animal rights group has produced a disturbing new video that depicts a cat suffering at the hands of its owner. It\u2019s difficult to watch. It\u2019s also completely fake,\u201d reports Mashable. \u201cBut it looks real it is a skilled CGI work clearly meant to deceive viewers. Now, PETA is trying to enlist complicit media organizations to knowingly publish the fake video in an effort to make the lie go viral. \u201d  \u201cThrough this marketing effort, PETA is trying to convince the media to report and share a fake video as if it\u2019s real, in hopes of deceiving the public to create manufactured outrage,\u201d Mashable continued. \u201cAs animal lovers, this is offensive. As a media outlet with a responsibility to truthfulness, this is unethical. As people with basic moral values, WTF?\u201d Mashable claims PETA\u2019s involvement in the fake video is shown in a    clip that was also emailed to them by a public relations firm allegedly working with the animal activists: What we\u2019d like to do is have Mashable debut this video of a cat, created with   imagery (CGI) being abused, which will have been planted on YouTube anonymously by the ad agency who created it for PETA. Your posting of the provocative piece would simply be to acknowledge that it\u2019s in circulation  \u2014   not to make any claims about its authenticity.   \u2026     When the video has drawn the critical response and the number of views we\u2019re anticipating (ideally, into the millions) we would then have you reveal to the world that the cat was NOT harmed, but was actually created with CGI by posting this    video. It reveals the reasons for the creation of the first video and asks people to avoid circuses that use lions, tigers, or any other live animals. Mashable called the plan to create a viral video \u201cwrong and irresponsible,\u201d while one Twitter user called them \u201cunethical\u201d for the trick. \u201cAnyone surprised?\u201d asked Daily Mail U. S. political editor David Martosko on Twitter. Anyone surprised? https:  .   \u2014   David Martosko (@dmartosko) June 7, 2017,  \u201cPETA is pitching literal fake news because PETA is terrible,\u201d added BuzzFeed reporter Tyler Kingkade. PETA is pitching literal fake news because PETA is terrible https:  .   \u2014   Tyler Kingkade (@tylerkingkade) June 7, 2017,  PETA has previously faced criticism for deceptive tricks, including the time they hired musician Jona Weinhofen to hold a fake plastic sheep covered in blood in a deceptive attempt to turn people against sheep shearing. The image was refuted by sheep farmers, with one claiming, \u201cIn two decades of living on a sheep farm, I have seen nothing resembling the images put forward by Peta in its campaign against the wool industry. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
