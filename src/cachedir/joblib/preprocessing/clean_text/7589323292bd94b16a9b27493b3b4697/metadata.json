From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. Now, all of the parties involved\u2014including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes\u2014need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it\u2019s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators\u2019 rights to protest peacefully, and workers\u2019 rights to do their jobs safely. \\nOn the same day the militarized action in North Dakota took place, Native youth from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes \u2014 tired of the damning silence from Hillary Clinton \u2014 demonstrated outside of Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. \\nA number of brave Lakota youth and their Lenape relatives erected a teepee and prayed in the lobby of Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn office as a militarized police force evicted water protectors from their traditional Treaty Lands in North Dakota. They were there to deliver a letter to Clinton about the pipeline. \\nA 14 \u2013year-old girl from Standing Rock attempted to deliver a letter to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn campaign HQ to ask her to take a stand on the Dakota Access Pipeline. The youth stood at the front desk in tears asking for someone to please come down to accept the letter. The guards completely ignored the young girl, and the Clinton campaign refused to show enough respect to send a campaign staffer to cordially accept the letter. \\nJust after this dozens of police arrived and ordered us to disperse or we would be arrested. \\n\u201c What a crock,\u201d said Ruth Hopkins, a Dakota-Lakota Sioux writer for Indian Country Today Media Network. \\n\u201cHillary Clinton managed to make a statement about the Dakota Pipeline that literally says nothing. Literally,\u201d 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben tweeted in response to the Clinton campaign statement. \\n\u201cKind of a BS statement by the Clinton camp on #NoDAPL, frankly,\u201d wrote MSNBC host Joy Reid. \u201cThe outrage taking place out there cries out for outrage.\u201d \\nOr as Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting journalist Adam Johnson put it, this \u201cis the most Clinton thing of all times.\u201d \\nThis curiously appears to be another case of Clinton having a \u201cpublic and private position,\u201d as revealed in her leaked speeches to Wall St. banks, the primary drivers behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The fact is that Clinton has completely turned her back on the Standing Rock Sioux. Her statement was essentially a non-statement, which speaks volumes as to who she is truly beholden too\u2026 and it isn\u2019t the American public. The words \u201cfind a path forward that serves the broadest public interest\u201d can be directly translated into \u201cthis pipeline is good for Merica, and we don\u2019t care about Native issues\u2026 but we\u2019ll pretend we do until I\u2019m elected.\u201d \\nPlease share this story if you believe Clinton\u2019s statement is a blatant disrespect to all Native peoples!
