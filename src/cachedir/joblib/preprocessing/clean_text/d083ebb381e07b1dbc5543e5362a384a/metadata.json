S. does. [\u201cCivilized countries that have universal healthcare  \u2014   no country, no group of people, no tribe sh*ts on their own to the extent and the level that we do to each other it\u2019s the most embarrassing and humiliating thing about this great country,\u201d Moore said on a conference call Thursday held by the Progressive Democrats of America.  \u201cHumans anyplace else, what they don\u2019t do is sh*t on their own,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThey need their own for their own defense. They need their own for their own survival  \u2014   they need their own. They need to protect their children, not say to the child, \u2018sorry, no, we got rid of Obamacare. We won\u2019t help you. You\u2019re sick? Tough. \u2019\u201d Moore predicted that Trump would work with Congress to \u201cretain as much or most, even all\u201d of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010 and commonly called Obamacare, because at the end of the day Trump \u201clikes being popular. \u201d \u201c[Trump is] trying to find a way to have his cake and eat it too, basically. He likes being popular. He likes his ratings. He does not want to be seen  \u2014   and he said this during the campaign  \u2014   as the guy who is throwing 20 million people out on the curb. He said that because he wouldn\u2019t be very popular then,\u201d Moore explained. \u201cHe will look for a way to retain as much or most, even all, and I think he\u2019s learned that the worst thing about Obamacare to his supporters is the fact that it\u2019s called Obamacare,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s just going to change the name, you know, the man is all about branding. \u201d On Wednesday, conservative lawmakers called on Trump to work with Republican leaders in Congress to completely repeal the health care law. But Moore says Trump will likely keep much of Obamacare intact, and move merely to change the law\u2019s name and make adjustments. The   went on to praise the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for its   ruling upholding a lower court\u2019s order halting President Trump\u2019s temporary   executive order. \u201cThe more we can discombobulate him, the better,\u201d Moore said of the ruling. Moore also told Progressive Democrats of America members that the liberal left is \u201cdoomed\u201d if Rep. Keith Ellison ( .) doesn\u2019t win his race to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742562006.8283975}
