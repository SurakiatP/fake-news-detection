In fact, it seems that the idiot just got exactly what he deserved \u2013 and that\u2019s not even the real kicker. \\nYesterday, Mad World News reported on James Otis, the man who was recorded destroying Trump\u2019s star on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California and stealing the two plaques that were in the concrete. Of course, he later stated that the two stolen objects would be auctioned off on election day with the proceeds promised to Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cvictims.\u201d \\nProving to be a cocky moron, Otis gave an itinerary, saying that he wanted to deliver a few remarks at the location of his crime at 9:30 this morning. Unfortunately for him, things didn\u2019t go according to plan as the man just got exactly what he deserved. Donald Trump\u2019s Hollywood star before (left) and after (right) James Otis destroyed it \\nAlthough Otis had promised to turn himself in today, Deadline reports that police tracked him down and arrested him before he could use the incident to further himself any more. Unfortunately for him, the news got even worse when he was officially slapped with a felony vandalism charge. Oh, and that little \u201cauction\u201d he was going to have isn\u2019t going to happen since police confiscated at least one of the plaques, which they found stashed in Otis\u2019s car: Police confiscated at least one part of the plaque (Source: TMZ ) \\nThe real kicker came next, though. Since damages were valued at over $400 , Otis is facing up to 3 years in jail and more than $10,000 in fines. Of course, Otis didn\u2019t seem to mind facing the consequences \u2013 until, that is, he heard what he\u2019d actually earned. James Otis \\nIn fact, he only made himself out to be more of an idiot during an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News when he said, \u201cI was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women.\u201d \\nClearly uninformed on the truth, he then added , \u201cIt\u2019s just a big joke to him. I have children; I have many women in my life who don\u2019t think it\u2019s a joke. But he does.\u201d He continued, \u201cHe lies about it, he shuffles and I don\u2019t see, there\u2019s no reason to believe at all that it will ever stop now. He\u2019ll continue to do this, he\u2019ll continue to make women suffer. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell him. \u201cYou need help. Please understand that.\u201d Trump\u2019s star is already being repaired (Source: Breitbart ) \\nOtis doesn\u2019t even understand that what he did wasn\u2019t really any big deal. As of right now, the star is being replaced. Furthermore, destroying that property didn\u2019t do a darn thing to Trump since it wasn\u2019t his property \u2013 it was the states. In short, he just cost the American taxpayer more money because now we have to fix it. \\nThat\u2019s the problem with the entitled mentality these days \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter to them who they hurt in the process. Of course, coming off looking like an idiot sure can\u2019t feel good, but he\u2019ll get a nice long time to think about that while he\u2019s rotting in prison for a few years.'"}, "time": 1742564623.5439634}
