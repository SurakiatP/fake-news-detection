Arnoldski -  \\n\\n\\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been played by a prankster pretending to be the president of Kyrgyzstan.  \\nOn November 2nd, the official website of the Ukrainian president announced that Poroshenko had held a telephone conversation with the president of Kyrgyzstan.  \\n\\n\\nHoewever, the head of the presidential administration and deputy head of its department on Kyrgyzstan, Sapar Isakov, subsequently told Interfax that the information was unreliable and suggested that someone had played the Ukrainian president. \\nThe day before the alleged conversation took place, Russian prankster Aleksey Stolyarov (known as Lexus), famous for his big pranks played on Ukrainian politicians, wrote on his Facebook: \u201cAre there any specialists on or from Kyrgyzstan here?\u201d \\n\\n\\n\\nThe famous Ukrainian jurist Andrey Portnov commented on the situation:  \\n\u201cWhat turned into nearly an hour long discussion of bilateral relations between the Ukrainian president and the alleged president of Kyrgyzstan should definitely cost the head of the presidential administration his career. This event speaks to the final destruction of the state apparatus and the transformation of its governing institutions into one continuous comedy. Of course, this was made possible thanks to the lustration ongoing in the country, as a result of which a number of inadequate slackers and fools have emerged.\u201d  \\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742628465.782787}
