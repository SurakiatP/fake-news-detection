They may have decided on Trump. These things do not happen by accident.\u201d \\nThus spoke a high-level US business mover and shaker with secure transit in rarified Masters of the Universe-related circles, amidst the utter political chaos provoked by head of the FBI James Comey\u2019s latest bombshell. \\nIt\u2019s virtually established by now that US Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Comey not to release his letter to Congress. But Comey did it anyway. If he had not, and a scandal would \u2013 inevitably \u2013 spring up after the US presidential election, Lynch would be perfectly positioned to deny she knew anything, and Comey would be on the firing line. \\nLynch is a certified Clinton machine asset. In 1999 then-President Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorney\u2019s office. She left in 2002, taking the private practice revolving door. She was back to the Brooklyn office in 2010, urged by Obama. Five years later she became the 83rd US Attorney General, replacing the dodgy Eric Holder. \\nA plausible case has been made that Comey took his fateful decision based on a serious internal revolt at the FBI \u2013 led by key people he trust \u2014 as well as being egged-on by his wife. \\nYet one of the key questions that refuse to go away is why the FBI waited until 11 days before the US presidential election to supposedly \u201cfind\u201d an email trove on certified sexting pervert Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. A Deal With Donald? \\nThe business source, although unsympathetic to the Clinton machine, especially in foreign policy, is a realpolitik practitioner, not a conspiracy theorist. He is adamant that, \u201cthe FBI reversal could not have happened without orders above the President. If the Masters [of the Universe] have changed their mind, then they will destroy Hillary.\u201d He adds, \u201cthey can make a deal with Donald just like anyone else; Donald wins; the Masters win; the people think that their voice has been heard. And then there will be some sort of (controlled) change.\u201d \\nWhat\u2019s paramount in the whole soap opera is the faith in the US political system \u2014 as corrupt as it may be \u2014 must endure. That mirrors the faith in the US dollar; if confidence in the US dollar fails, the US as a hegemonic financial power is no more. \\nThe source is equally adamant that, \u201cit is almost unprecedented to see a cover-up as extensive as Hillary\u2019s. A secret meeting between Bill Clinton and the Attorney General; the FBI ignoring all evidence and initially clearing Hillary to near rebellion of the whole of the FBI, attested to by Rudolf Giuliani whose reputation as a federal prosecutor is unquestioned; the Clinton \u201cpay for play\u201d foundation. The Masters are troubled that this is getting out of hand.\u201d \\nThe record shows that \u201cthe Masters do not usually have to go to such lengths to protect their own. They did manage to save Bill Clinton from the Monica Lewinsky perjury and keep him in the presidency. The Masters were not attacked in this case. They even got away with the 1987 cash settlement crash and the theft surrounding the Lehman debacle. In all these cases there were no overarching challenges to their control, as we see now open to the public by Trump. They antagonized and insulted the wrong man.\u201d All Aboard the Huma Train \\nHillary Clinton is not at the center of Comey\u2019s jaw-dropping October Surprise; it\u2019s actually her right-hand woman and ersatz \u201cdaughter\u201d Huma Abedin. This early January essay on Huma Abedin contains plenty of nuggets out and about \u2013 some of them positively eyebrow raising. \\nIn case Hillary Clinton becomes the next President of the United States (POTUS), Abedin, alternatively known as Princess of Saudi Arabia, will most likely become Hillary\u2019s chief of staff \u2013 the power behind running all White House operations. \\nA glimpse of the FBI-Huma Abedin connection is available here. Abedin was granted Top Secret security clearance for the first time in 2009, when Hillary named her deputy chief of staff for operations. Abedin later said she \u201cdid not remember\u201d being read into any Special Access Programs (SAPs). It\u2019s crucial to remember that one of Abedin\u2019s emails was huma@clintonemail.com. Crucial translation: she was the only high-level State Dept. aide whose emails were hosted by the notorious Subterranean Clinton Email Server \u2013 which she claimed she didn\u2019t know existed until she heard about it in the news. \\nAbedin swore under oath in a lawsuit brought against the State Dept. by Judicial Watch that she had handed over all of her laptops and smart phones that could host emails relevant to the Subterranean Email Server investigation. \\nThat may not have been the case. The laptop at the center of Comey\u2019s bombshell was shared by Abedin and her husband Wiener before they split. If Abedin lied, she could face up to five years in jail for perjury. As if the whole illegal email-cum-sexting saga was not sordid enough, the \u201cclimax\u201d now seems to have turned into a mixed wrestling match between the former couple, with the big \u201cprize\u201d being the slammer. \\nThe FBI has finally obtained a warrant and is now frantically searching no less than 650,000 Abedin emails found on sexting freak Wiener\u2019s laptop; the objective is to exactly determine which ones came from the Subterranean Email Server. \\nAs if this was not demeaning enough, the FBI continues to conduct an investigation on the Clinton Foundation. As former Assistant Director of the FBI Tom Fuentes said , \u201cThe FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation\u2026the investigation would go forward as a comprehensive unified case and be coordinated, so that investigation is ongoing and Huma Abedin and her role and activities concerning Secretary of State in the nature of the foundation and possible \u2018pay to play\u2019, that\u2019s still being looked at now.\u201d \\nWhatever happens until election day, US voters will have to consider the startling fact they may choose a next POTUS that is the subject of a wide-ranging \u201ccomprehensive unified\u201d FBI investigation. A Rotten, Rigged System? \\nA former federal public corruption prosecutor volunteers a plausible take on Comey\u2019s action. In a nutshell, FBI agents investigating Weiner\u2019s sexting \u2013 and they are a different set of agents investigating Emailgate \u2014 saw evidence of State Dept emails on his laptop. Comey knew he needed a search warrant to comb the emails at Wiener\u2019s computer. So he pre-empted the \u2013 inevitable \u2013 subsequent hype by \u201csending out a vague\u2026letter to the Hill\u201d that in the end left everyone even more confused. \\nThat interpretation though may be only scratching the surface. Deeper and deeper, it seems that Comey\u2019s decision was really precipitated by the senior FBI agents\u2019 insurgence \u2013 fed up with the \u201cextreme carelessness\u201d Hillary cover-up. They\u2019ve got to have some surefire material on the Clinton (cash) machine that never saw the light. Comey could have just waited to say something after the election; after all the FBI maintains they had checked all Clinton emails, including deleted ones, not to mention the Podesta emails. So the emails on sexting Wiener\u2019s laptop may be no more than a limited hangout. \\nA much more plausible explanation is that Comey had to do it not only because of the FBI internal revolt (or because he had an urge to upstage WikiLeaks?) He had to do it because the rot goes way beyond the Clinton \u201cpay to play\u201d racket and involves virtually the whole system, from the deep recesses of the Obama administration to the War Party scam, the Department of Justice, the CIA and the FBI itself. \\nWhat next? Brace for impact; it may well be the ultimate November Surprise.'"}, "time": 1742563840.5673125}
