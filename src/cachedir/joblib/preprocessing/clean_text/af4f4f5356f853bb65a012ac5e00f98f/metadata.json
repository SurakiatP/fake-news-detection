Mo Brooks ( ) told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow of Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that he expects a vote on the House Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the same day. Brooks is opposed to the bill. [\u201cI do not control the voting process. That\u2019s done by [Speaker of the House Paul Ryan] and he can always change his mind,\u201d Rep. Brooks noted. \u201cBut as of last night, we\u2019re voting today. \u201d  He said he was uncertain if estimates that the bill does not have enough votes to pass are still valid. \u201cThere were a lot of emotional pleas last night that might cause people to take off their thinking hats and react with their hearts, rather than their heads, and support what we all know is bad legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, I believe it is a horrible replacement bill,\u201d Brooks declared, when Marlow asked why so many Republicans support a bill that seems to fall far short of GOP promises to repeal Obamacare.  \u201cSecond, in my judgment, the reason is there are a lot of Republican politicians who, back home, wanted to pretend that they were in favor of Obamacare repeal in order to win their primaries, when, in fact, they weren\u2019t,\u201d he contended. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re to the stage where votes count. If we can get bills to the president\u2019s desk, there\u2019s a good chance that they will be signed. We are suddenly finding that a lot of Republican congressmen, maybe they weren\u2019t really for repeal of Obamacare in the first place. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we have a bill that is referred to as \u2018 \u2019 or \u2018Obamacare 2. 0\u2019   \u2014   because it does not repeal Obamacare,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn fact, it keeps the substantive parts of Obamacare that have caused premiums to skyrocket, which is why the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation are warning us in Congress that health insurance premiums over the next two years will go up 15 to 20 percent, rather than drop like you would have happen if there was an Obamacare repeal. \u201d Brooks said he had two major reasons for believing the House bill is a bad piece of legislation. \u201cOne is we were sent to Washington, D. C. to help struggling American families with healthcare costs, not pass legislation that\u2019s going to continue to increase the cost of health care, which is what this bill does,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we should be doing is implementing cost containment measures,\u201d Brooks argued. \u201cWe should be repealing the parts of Obamacare that have forced these skyrocketing premiums on struggling American families, rather than keep them in this new bill. \u201d  \u201cIn addition to that, we should interject new provisions that will force competition into the marketplace,\u201d he continued. \u201cBy way of example, we should be forcing interstate health insurance competition that, in turn, will force lower insurance prices, as health insurance companies from around the country compete for a customer base. We should be repealing antitrust exemptions that suppress competition, that create oligopolies and monopolies that, in turn, drive up healthcare costs. \u201d  \u201cThose are the kinds of things we should be doing on the cost containment side so that premiums will not go up that estimated 15 to 20 percent, as is represented to us by both the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. As an aside, I\u2019ve heard no argument to the contrary  \u2014   much less no persuasive argument to the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second reason may even be bigger than the first, and that is that Obamacare 2. 0 is the largest Republican welfare program in the history of the Republican Party. That has a lot of implications, cascading effects,\u201d Brooks warned.  \u201cBy way of example, it undermines the work ethic. It encourages more and more Americans to live off the hard work of others. Obamacare 2. 0, because of this welfare provision over time, is going to dramatically increase the need to raise taxes or borrow more money to pay for, if past experiences are any indication, what will be escalating welfare costs. As you know, struggling American families cannot afford more taxes, and America cannot afford more debt. It\u2019s already at $20 trillion. We\u2019re already being warned that we\u2019re heading into insolvency and bankruptcy. We need to heed those warnings, rather than destroy what it took more than two centuries of American ancestors to build. \u201d  \u201cIn addition to that, there\u2019s a huge political ramification, and you see it a little bit in the debate that we\u2019ve had so far. By way of example, if this bill passes with this huge welfare program, all of a sudden, you are converting tens of millions of voters who now are   into welfare dependents  \u2014   thus making elections about who can deliver the most welfare for me to help me with my health insurance premium,\u201d he said.  \u201cThat\u2019s going to have a huge electoral impact. That\u2019s going to turn America over to the Bernie Sanders socialist wing of American society. Quite frankly, it may be the death knell for the free enterprise system that has helped make America the greatest economic power in the world,\u201d he warned. Brooks offered an example of how the political dynamics of the House Republican bill were making the   problem worse, even before the bill is voted upon. \u201cObamacare 2. 0, this Republican welfare program, was introduced about two weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Congressional Budget Office, on March the 13, did an analysis of that bill as it was two weeks ago. Two weeks later, the Congressional Budget Office on March 23 did another analysis of what purports to be the amended version of Obamacare. Over that   period, the financial projections worsened by $187 billion, as congressional politicians scrambled to promise more and more welfare to placate merely feared demands of these projected welfare recipients. So just the mere fear of future demands for welfare caused this House of Representatives to worsen our financial condition by $187 billion in just two weeks, in this legislation. \u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re not doing what we were sent here to do: cut premium costs, make health care more affordable on the one hand, and on the other hand, to create a huge new welfare program that, in effect, duplicates the structure of Obamacare,\u201d he lamented. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the Alabama voters sent me to Washington, D. C. to do, and I\u2019m very much puzzled by those other congressman who think that\u2019s a good thing. \u201d Brooks predicted that \u201cif people think with their heads,\u201d the bill will \u201cgo down into a crashing defeat. \u201d \u201cIf they think with their hearts, then it has a reasonable chance of passing,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is tremendous pressure, particularly amongst Republican friends in the House and Senate and the White House, to pass this legislation because of our friendship, as opposed to whether it\u2019s good or bad for America. \u201d Marlow noted that the bill is \u201coverwhelmingly unpopular\u201d with voters, scoring as low as 17 percent support in polls, but seems to enjoy vastly disproportionate support from the House Republican caucus. \u201cIt has very little to do with what America wants outside the Beltway and a lot to do with what    America  \u2014   and, in particular, special interest groups and lobbyists  \u2014   want,\u201d Brooks replied. \u201cFrom my perspective, it\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever faced, and I\u2019ve been in public life for three decades,\u201d he said, when Marlow professed to have heard few cogent defenses of the bill. Brooks had little use for the argument that this legislation was just step one in a   or \u201c \u201d plan to repeal Obamacare. The White House description of this strategy describes step two as relief from burdensome regulations, and step three as \u201cadditional legislation,\u201d such as permitting health care to be sold across state lines and reforming malpractice insurance. \u201cI agree with the argument of those in the Senate who have called part three the \u2018sucker bucket,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd part two is subject to litigation that will tie it in knots for who knows how many years. If it\u2019s good, why not put it in this legislation? If we\u2019re really going to do it, why not put it in this legislation and force it through the House, and force it through the Senate, if it\u2019s good and if it\u2019s going to happen. \u201d \u201cTwo and three  \u2014   two might happen to some degree, although who knows how many years it will take for it to get through all the litigation aspects? Number three, never happen,\u201d he predicted. Marlow cited the argument that defeat for the House Obamacare bill will hinder Republicans in their mission to \u201cstop the Democratic Party\u201d and its agenda. \u201cStopping the Democrats is meaningless if we\u2019re not, at the same time, doing the right thing for our country,\u201d Brooks declared.  \u201cI don\u2019t believe this impacts President Trump\u2019s reputation so much as it impacts those who have given the president bad advice and put him in this position,\u201d he added.  \u201cThe simplest and smartest thing to do would have been to pull up the Obamacare repeal bill that passed the Republican House and passed the Republican Senate two years ago that was vetoed by President Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cPass that through the House. Pass that through the Senate. Have whatever effective date you want in the future to implement the   market principles that we want to force competition into the marketplace. \u201d  \u201cWe had legislation that we voted on in the past that got unanimous support of Republicans in the House, unanimous support of Republicans in the Senate. It even complied with those arcane, crazy Senate rules that frustrate America in so many different ways, and it made it to the president\u2019s desk,\u201d Brooks pointed out. \u201cIt baffles me that that was not done, although it doesn\u2019t really baffle me once you start thinking about all these Republican politicians who wanted to go back home saying, giving the impression, that they\u2019re for repeal of Obamacare when they really aren\u2019t. \u201d Marlow noted that President Trump has essentially said the current House GOP bill is the only repeal and replace option that will be on the table for the near future and voting it down will leave Obamacare in place for a long time to come. He asked Brooks if this was a \u201cthreat\u201d to recalcitrant lawmakers or, at least, a dramatic \u201cratcheting up of the rhetoric. \u201d \u201cI would call it a bargaining tool or a tactic,\u201d Brooks replied. \u201cI am mildly surprised, but not too much. It seems consistent with the bargaining tactics that the president talks about in The Art of the Deal. I would hope that whoever is advising the president would not advise him to surrender on an issue of this magnitude. America deserves better. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: '"}, "time": 1742563829.381685}
