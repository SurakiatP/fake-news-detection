He\u2019s seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and he\u2019s no longer talking about banning Muslims. While \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d which referred to Washington\u2019s culture of corruption, was one of his later campaign slogans, he\u2019s filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. He\u2019s even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue, the wall between the United States and Mexico . \\nOne piece of Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make people\u2019s lives better and it\u2019s something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical, in that it\u2019s not a gift to Wall Street and it\u2019s even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed. In a rally just a month ago, Trump said about student loans: \\n\u201cWe would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrower\u2019s income, 12.5 percent, we\u2019d cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. \u201cAnd if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we\u2019ll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.\u201d \\n\u201cStudents should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.\u201d \\nSource: Washington Post \\nTrump\u2019s proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obama\u2019s . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap, Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduate\u2019s income. Trump\u2019s program, though, would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Trump\u2019s would forgive debt after 15 years while Obama\u2019s would forgive after 10. In that one significant way, Trump\u2019s program is even more liberal than Obama\u2019s and if he carries it out, Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their party\u2019s President. \\nThe American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: \\n\u201cThey are way off on their numbers,\u201d said Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIf you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years, you\u2019re going to forgive a lot more debt than you\u2019re going to make up for in the form of the higher payments they\u2019re proposing, by a lot. I don\u2019t even need to run the numbers. It\u2019s so obvious.\u201d \\nReally, it\u2019s not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that, though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that, Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for.'"}, "time": 1742628442.7148032}
