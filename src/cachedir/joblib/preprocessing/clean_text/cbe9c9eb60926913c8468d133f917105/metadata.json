By Boris Egorov , RIR Russia's Ministry of Defence \\nMilitary special operation forces are elite units of the Russian Armed Forces. They are controlled by the Main Intelligence Agency (GRU) under General Staff. \\nThe primary function of special forces in wartime is infiltration behind enemy lines, usually well before hostilities are scheduled to begin and, once in place, to commit acts of sabotage (such as the destruction of vital communications logistics centers, the command posts for the guidance of nuclear weapons ), the assassination of key government leaders and military officers. \\nActing in groups of five to ten people, the Spetsnaz GRU is able to act autonomously for several days. \\nSoldiers go through special physical and psychological training, in which special emphasis is placed on mastering the weapons, skill in radio communications, and knowledge of the enemy\u2019s territory. \""}, "time": 1742561929.2234805}
