Suddenly, they seem to be just everywhere, onscreen and offscreen, in   flicks, in   comedies and even in the presidential race. The latest   evidence that women are hot (kind of) and not simply in a   way, is \u201cBad Moms,\u201d a funny, giddy, sentimental   from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who wrote the 2009 hit comedy \u201cThe Hangover. \u201d That movie pretty much ignored the ladies but made enough money to spawn another smash and a second, less successful sequel that may have killed off the franchise. So if \u201cBad Moms\u201d kind of feels like leftovers, there\u2019s a reason. Much like \u201cThe Hangover\u201d (Mr. Lucas and Mr. Moore can take writing credit and blame only for the first movie) \u201cBad Moms\u201d is a comedy of outrage pegged to a gender stereotype, this time the smother mothers of America. You know the type, or maybe you\u2019ve just read about her in lifestyle articles featuring enlightened parenting and   snacks. She\u2019s the one who  \u2014   in between enjoying a fulfilling career and flipping through cookbooks for vegan cookie recipes (for a bake sale, natch)  \u2014   ferries the kids from school to soccer and whatever other extracurricular activities can pad a college application. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that Amy (Mila Kunis) struggles to emulate. The frantic, pinwheeling center of \u201cBad Moms,\u201d she enters in heels at full speed, a pace she keeps up as she sprints from one demand to another, often with her two children in tow. Mr. Lucas and Mr. Moore, who both wrote and directed, keep Amy on the run for a while, playing her harried purposefulness against some gently disruptive sight gags: a giant head of Richard M. Nixon that she makes for a school project, a dog wearing a helmet, an office run by giant children. (Clark Duke plays her boss, while Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith and Annie Mumolo offer backup as the   mean girls  \u2014   i. e. the momsters.) The    mother might be a fantasy, but she\u2019s good for a laugh. She\u2019s also been good for sales. You could fill an entire Amazon fulfillment center with parenting books, with a few rows reserved for putatively bad or just   moms. These range from   reads like Allison Pearson\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Know How She Does It\u201d to   manuals with   titles, like one coyly subtitled \u201cThe Parenting Guide for the Rest of Us. \u201d (If a lot of these humor books seem to focus on mothers, it\u2019s probably because that\u2019s the way the world still turns, although you also have to wonder if stories about terrible fathers cut too queasily close to the bone for mass readership.) The   movie was inevitable, given both this industrial parenting complex and the boomlet of comedies about badly behaved women that have appeared in the wake of \u201cBridesmaids\u201d (2011): \u201cTammy,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cSisters\u201d and so on. Most of the women in these movies don\u2019t resemble villainous vixens of old, like those film noir femmes fatales who caused tough guys to go weak in the knees and murmur, \u201cBaby, I don\u2019t care. \u201d Most of these funny ladies aren\u2019t even particularly naughty. They just do things that women aren\u2019t supposed to do or, more truly, don\u2019t often do in mainstream American movies, like pound shots, fall flat on their faces and have sex without tears. The comedy in \u201cBad Moms\u201d hinges on a rarer type: the good mother gone rogue, which here mostly involves kicking back, something Amy does after she boots out her cheating husband and stops coddling her kids. (They\u2019re forced to eat cold cereal. From a box.) The naturally likable Ms. Kunis, who has a screwball heroine\u2019s springiness and the eyes of Bambi under fire, helps humanize the story\u2019s mechanical turns, as do her gal pals, the neurotic, overachieving Kiki (Kristen Bell) and the   slacker Carla (Kathryn Hahn). If I could write sonnets, I would write one about Ms. Hahn, whose timing  \u2014   she finds depths in that little pause before a joke crests  \u2014   can turn laughs into howls. Carla aside, the movie\u2019s yuks are tame stuff. What makes \u201cBad Moms\u201d funny (aside from its lineup of gifted performers) isn\u2019t that Amy and her friends go wild they don\u2019t, not even close. It\u2019s the women\u2019s shared,   pleasure in their freedom and friendship. In the most comically honed and sustained scene, Amy, Kiki and Carla run mild and a bit loony  \u2014   and in slow motion  \u2014   through a supermarket, where they rip open boxes, chug booze and (absurdly) terrorize a guard, their every offense turned into an epic of   destruction by the decelerated visuals. There\u2019s nothing genuinely transgressive about their behavior they\u2019re just drunk, happy and together. \u201cBad Moms\u201d is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Booze and some bedroom rocking and rolling. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes.'"}, "time": 1742561788.5106642}
