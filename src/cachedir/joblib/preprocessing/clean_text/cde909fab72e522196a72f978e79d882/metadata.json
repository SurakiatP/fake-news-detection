Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, did all he could to keep her in the dark. But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena, headphones around her neck and   in place, to play her older sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open final. The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change, but the protagonists do not. So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the   record with Steffi Graf, there was no dodging that number in her own head. Now, after her     victory over her sister, she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it. \u201cI\u2019ve been chasing it for a really long time,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I\u2019m here. It\u2019s a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne. \u201d She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998. They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special, but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them. Much has changed in 19 years. Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling. The court, once green, is now a deep blue. The beads and the braces are long gone, but the sisters\u2019 power tennis remains. And though their father, Richard Williams, in one of the great sports predictions, saw the future clearly when he said the younger, fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player, perhaps not even he realized how wide the gap would eventually grow. Serena Williams now has 23 major singles titles to her sister\u2019s seven, and has won seven of their nine Grand Slam finals and eight of their last nine matches. Those figures brook no argument. Williams 2. 0 has the better operating system when it comes to locating the lines and creating the angles under the greatest pressure. She also has the purer service motion. But Williams 1. 0 certainly gave it her all Saturday night, throwing herself into the groundstrokes and displaying more emotion when a return struck the net or a rally failed than she has perhaps ever shown in a major final. \u201cIt was palpable how much Venus wanted it,\u201d said Isha Price, the Williamses\u2019 half sister. An   final is always an emotionally complex affair, which is all the more reason to admire how the older sister has so often handled the disappointments. \u201cThat\u2019s my little sister, guys,\u201d Venus Williams said, pointing at Serena during the   ceremony. She then spoke to her sister directly. It was quite a riff. \u201cCongratulations, Serena, on No. 23,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI have been there right with you. Some of them I lost right there against you. I guess that\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s been an awesome thing. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that. And all the time I couldn\u2019t be there, wouldn\u2019t be there, didn\u2019t get there, you were there. I\u2019m enormously proud of you. You mean the world to me. \u201d Serena Williams is now within one victory of Margaret Court\u2019s career record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. \u201cGood on her if she\u2019s good enough to do it,\u201d Court said during the week in Melbourne. Williams has closed in on Court with an unprecedented run of success at an age when most great women\u2019s tennis players of the past had already retired. Graf, for example, was done by 30. But Williams has now won 10 major singles title since turning 30. On Saturday, she became the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era, breaking her own record set at Wimbledon last year. Venus, 36, was the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be at 23 without her there\u2019s no way I would be at 1 without her,\u201d Serena Williams said of her sister in the   ceremony. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would have anything without her. She\u2019s my inspiration. She\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m standing here today, and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me to be the best player I could be and inspiring me to work hard. Every time you won this week, I felt like I\u2019ve got to win, too. \u201d This final was edgy from the start, beginning with four straight breaks of serve and with Serena Williams angrily breaking a racket in just the third game after she lost her footing trying to change direction when one of her sister\u2019s shots struck the net cord. The quality of play fluctuated considerably, but the match ultimately was determined by Serena Williams\u2019s returns. Venus Williams had won over 50 percent of the points on her second serve in her surprise run to the final. She won just 29 percent Saturday. \u201cSerena always expects a tough match against her sister, but I don\u2019t think she expected it to be quite that tough from the start,\u201d Mouratoglou said. At 35, Williams is back on top after playing little in 2016 except for the Grand Slam events and losing the No. 1 ranking to Angelique Kerber, who defeated her in last year\u2019s Australian Open final. Williams looked shocked when it was announced after her victory that she would return to No. 1. Mouratoglou later explained, a tad sheepishly, that he had not answered truthfully when Serena had inquired about it. He said he wanted to avoid putting extra pressure on her at an already fraught moment. \u201cActually, I think she\u2019s happy I did it now,\u201d he said. The Open could easily have gone awry for Serena Williams. In her return to the circuit earlier this month at a tournament in Auckland, New Zealand, she was upset in her second match by Madison Brengle, making 88 unforced errors on a blustery day. But Williams has often proved that she can click into a higher gear without much match play, and she did not drop a set in seven matches as she won her seventh Australian Open singles title. Venus Williams, seeded 13th here, remains one of the great players of this era, but she has not won a major singles title since she beat Serena to win Wimbledon in 2008. In the intervening years, she received a diagnosis of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, that limited her training and contributed to her falling from the top 100 in 2011. But she has learned to manage her health problems and is having a   renaissance that might be a much bigger talking point if it were not for her younger sister\u2019s   surge. Venus Williams will be at No. 11 in Monday\u2019s WTA rankings. The sisters have become, through experience, adept at compartmentalizing, even if facing each other across the net is still not entirely natural. Their family members struggle with it, too. Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, did not make the long journey to Melbourne this year, but Isha Price did. And she decided that she preferred to watch the match at her hotel until it was nearly over instead of putting herself through the crucible of watching in person. \u201cLong story short, I don\u2019t think people actually understand the significance of what they see, these two players, who literally for generations have been able to transcend what they do,\u201d Price said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very difficult to watch, listen, hear commentary, all of that. We watch tennis on mute. It\u2019s hard. To keep your body in optimal shape to be able to perform at this level consistently over 20 years is an incredible feat. But you still have the conversation where it\u2019s not enough. \u201d It is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with the record books, however. Serena keeps moving the bar higher, but the poignant part on Saturday night, was that despite all of Venus\u2019s talent and staying power and eloquence, only one Williams sister has managed to win the singles championship at Melbourne Park.'"}, "time": 1742628391.53367}
