[Pollak began by asking if the London Bridge attack would finally provide the   call needed for those who underestimate or downplay the dangers of radical Islamic terrorism.  \u201cA lot of people who were in denial almost say the right thing after these events. They sort of can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d Fleitz replied.  \u201cBut what really concerns me is that yes, it\u2019s right we have to improve security  \u2014   we need better outreach, we need better intelligence  \u2014   but there\u2019s something they\u2019re not talking about in the U. K. that really needs to be focused on: the role that the failure to assimilate British Muslims has created the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are communities where British Muslims are deliberately not assimilating, are being taught to hate British society, and this is incubating radicalism. There\u2019s actually a parallel system of sharia law courts in the U. K. that operate. \u201d \u201cWe may have generations of radical Islamists in the U. K. until the British government wakes up and stops the situation,\u201d he warned. Pollak pointed out that the United States has unassimilated religious communities with their own internal systems of government that live peaceably alongside their neighbors, such as the Amish and Jewish communities in upstate New York. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly true there are some communities in the United States that have not assimilated,\u201d Fleitz agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about Amish or Jewish communities, but I will tell you that there are enclaves of Muslim communities in Michigan and Minnesota that concern me. We know that in Minnesota there\u2019s a rising rate of measles because the community has not assimilated into the rest of the community, and is not vaccinating their children. This is wrong. This is a big problem. \u201d  \u201cThe problem with these Muslim communities is that it is making them susceptible to this radical worldview that wants to destroy modern society, create a global caliphate, and impose sharia law on everyone on Earth,\u201d Fleitz contended. \u201cThese other communities aren\u2019t trying to do that. They\u2019re peaceful religious communities. \u201d \u201cAlso, when we have immigrants coming to a country from another country, I think they need to learn the practices and laws of the country where they\u2019re coming to, the country that is accepting them and serving as a refuge for them. I think when people come to their new home country, they should understand and learn about the laws of this new country. That\u2019s not happening in the U. K.,\u201d he said. Pollak offered the converse observation that some of the worst terrorist murderers, such as the San Bernardino jihadis, appear to be fairly  .  \u201cWe can have homegrown radical Islamist terrorists  \u2014   and I don\u2019t really think they\u2019re homegrown, I think they\u2019re inspired or directed by foreign Islamist terrorist organizations  \u2014   but it\u2019s this ideology of hate that either is being communicated to them over the Internet, or is being passed on to members of separated communities in the U. K. It\u2019s the ideology we have to confront, and I think this problem is worse in these separate communities,\u201d Fleitz said. Fleitz argued that measures to hinder the ability of extremists to recruit and coordinate with the Internet should be explored, with due regard for civil liberties, but he is more concerned about \u201cradical clerics and radical mosques who are promoting this type of hate and ideology firsthand. \u201d \u201cI also want to stop these ISIS videos that we know homegrown radical Islamist terrorists are taking in, and it\u2019s playing a role in radicalizing them,\u201d he added. \u201cI think   was a   call. You could just see how Republicans and Democrats in Washington were working together against the threat. Now we\u2019re challenged by political correctness, and people who are in denial, and don\u2019t want to the let the government take the steps it has to take to go after radical Islam,\u201d Fleitz reflected. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a radical Islamic terrorist attack, we get these lectures about Islamophobia from our leaders, leaders in the U. K. I think that is really hobbling the ability of our government to go after this threat, and that\u2019s unfortunate. I hope what happened in London will be a   call, but I\u2019m worried in a few weeks we\u2019ll be lectured about Islamophobia again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who raises concerns about radical Islam seems to be tarred and feathered as an Islamophobe in this country. I\u2019ll let the people who peddle this term give a better explanation, but that\u2019s my experience,\u201d he replied when Pollak asked for a precise definition of \u201cIslamophobia. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
