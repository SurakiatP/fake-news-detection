It was in this mode, more or less, that the NBC News political director, Chuck Todd, and his colleague Carrie Dann began the Aug. 3 edition of First Read, the network\u2019s daily political tip sheet, warning that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign had gone \u201cfrom \u2018unraveling\u2019 to \u2018break glass\u2019 mode. \u201d They began with a heroic attempt to catalog all the previously      things Trump said and did in the preceding 24 hours, a long list that included the candidate\u2019s displaying to a rally audience the Purple Heart medal he had been given by a retired U. S. Army lieutenant colonel who was wounded in Iraq. \u201cI always wanted to get the Purple Heart,\u201d said Trump, who received draft deferments during the Vietnam War for, among other things, bone spurs that had miraculously little impact on his youthful athletic career. \u201cThis was much easier. \u201d \u201cPut those words into the mouth of any past presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, and that comment almost certainly would have been labeled a near   gaffe,\u201d Todd and Dann wrote. In 2016, however, \u201cit wasn\u2019t even the most blockbuster Trump news of the afternoon. \u201d This prompted them to consider something that, coming from a pair of political journalists, bordered on heresy: Maybe, they mused, we were looking at \u201cthe end of the gaffe. \u201d The \u201cgaffe,\u201d in its old, prepolitical usage, was essentially a faux pas: a breach of etiquette or  \u2014   in the diplomatic context, where it often appeared  \u2014   local custom. In 1922, an anonymous British military officer\u2019s wife recounted in Blackwood\u2019s Magazine how, at a party, she had breezily remarked to a Belgian government minister how happy she had been living in Bonn, Germany, during the postwar occupation. The minister recoiled and informed her that he had spent 10 months in solitary confinement there. \u201cI had obviously said the wrong thing,\u201d she wrote, \u201ccommitted a gaffe. \u201d \u201cSaying the wrong thing\u201d is the most straightforward definition of a political gaffe, too. The question, of course, is what precisely we mean by \u201cwrong. \u201d Reporters typically mean it in the strategic sense  \u2014   something a politician seeking office, or occupying one, should know better than to say. And because strategy is amoral, the media\u2019s preoccupation with gaffes has always been an easy target for critics. It\u2019s emblematic, they argue, of campaign reporting at its hollow,   worst  \u2014   representing little more than, as Jason Linkins of The Huffington Post wrote earlier this year, \u201cthe inability of politicians to be perfect at all times, and the media\u2019s ability to monetize these momentary lapses. \u201d But there is another way of thinking about the gaffe: as an inevitable expression of the paradoxes of scrupulously objective political reporting, pressures that have held reporters hostage for decades. Until Trump, of all people, set us free. The journalistic ritual of   dates approximately to the Vietnam era, but it blossomed into a   obsession during the 1980 candidacy of Ronald Reagan, whose malapropisms were well noted even before he won the Republican nomination. Before the summer was out, reporters were fulminating over his description of the Vietnam War as a \u201cnoble cause\u201d and his suggestion that the United States should pursue official relations with Taiwan  \u2014   a move that contradicted the terms of normalization previously negotiated between the United States and China. Both statements were within the spectrum of conservative opinion, but reporters took them as blunders. By early September, press reports routinely described Reagan\u2019s campaign, in The Times\u2019s words, as on \u201cthe political defensive after a string of admittedly costly verbal gaffes. \u201d Two months later, Reagan trounced Carter, winning 44 states. During his administration, verbal pratfalls became enough of a running joke that David Gergen, then his director of communications, commissioned a large plaster foot with a bullet hole in it to be passed around. The Washington Post\u2019s Lou Cannon diligently cataloged the \u201cReaganism of the Week\u201d Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who worked in the White House during Reagan\u2019s second term, wrote later that \u201cReagan had no objection and frequently turned to the column to discover his own gaffes. Reagan\u2019s advisers soon discovered what the boss already knew: that Americans didn\u2019t mind his gaffes and were even entertained by them. \u201d What Reagan understood, in D\u2019Souza\u2019s telling, was that a gaffe revealed at least as much about the journalists who called attention to it as it did about the politician who uttered it. It reflected their own preoccupations and biases, which voters did not necessarily share. Ever since the late 1960s, when reporters began to take a more active role in scrutinizing presidential candidates, they had operated on the assumption that the way a candidate managed the challenges and humiliations of the campaign trail was in some way reflective of how they would perform in the White House itself  \u2014   that a candidacy was a meaningful simulation of a presidency. By the 1980s, this vision of campaign reporting was toppling into solipsism. Journalists were, effectively, grading politicians on their ability to perform what everyone understood to be a largely artificial version of themselves  \u2014   practicing a kind of theater criticism as much as political reporting. This reached its magnificent zenith in 2012, when a Washington Post reporter shouted at Mitt Romney during a photo op in Warsaw, \u201cWhat about your gaffes?\u201d What about his gaffes? The George Washington University political scientist John Sides reviewed   data from the 2012 race and found that none of the   slips of the campaign  \u2014   not even the surreptitiously filmed video of Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d comments  \u2014   had any appreciable effect on either candidate\u2019s support. In imagined service of the interests of voters, reporters had lost track of what actually mattered to them. Still, criticism of the media\u2019s gaffe fixation  \u2014   like Michael Kinsley\u2019s famous observation that \u201ca \u2018gaffe\u2019 is the opposite of a \u2018lie\u2019: it\u2019s when a politician inadvertently tells the truth\u201d  \u2014   has often been a bit too clever, reflecting the same blend of cynicism and forced na\u00efvet\u00e9 as the trail reporters it maligns. The critics tend to miss something important: the way in which   is, ultimately, a logical and sometimes deliberate way of tackling the impossible task the press has assigned itself. For avowedly nonpartisan and nonideological reporters, examining the substance of a politician\u2019s beliefs and policy views is a professional minefield: The more deeply they venture into it, the more open they are to accusations of bias. The benefits of this dilemma mostly accrue to politicians. If reporters spent too much time on the comfortably nonpartisan foibles of Reagan\u2019s \u201cReaganisms,\u201d they spent too little looking closely at his advisers\u2019 devotion to   economics. The gaffe, then, is a safety mechanism. It moves a statement from the realm of substance to the realm of performance and strategy  \u2014   allowing the reporters to critique it without incriminating themselves professionally. To say that Trump\u2019s views on immigration are inhumane, or   from the standpoint of the economy or national security, might hint at a subjective opinion on the part of the reporter. An easier problem to identify is that, spoken aloud, those views may hurt him with electorally important constituencies, or reflect poorly on his ability to stay \u201con message\u201d in the manner expected of politicians. A rational candidate would not deliberately do something that unnecessarily jeopardizes his chances of victory, so it follows that the outburst must have been a mistake  \u2014   a gaffe. This of course bears little resemblance to how actual voters,   or   assess his words. In that sense, Trump really does have more in common with voters than he does with political elites. His inability to apologize or back down has opened the door to a   politics, stripping away the convenient fiction of missteps and errors that journalists turn to when they are uncomfortable confronting a statement on its merits. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe,\u201d Obama said on Aug. 2, needling the many Republicans who had recently denounced Trump\u2019s words without rescinding their endorsements. \u201cThis is daily, and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he\u2019s making. \u201d He\u2019s right at this point, to treat Trump\u2019s statements as anything other than intentional is to uphold   convention at the expense of common sense. Trump has laid bare journalism\u2019s contradictions  \u2014   reporters\u2019 desire to be critical of politicians without criticizing anything they stand for  \u2014   to the point where we have no choice but to examine them. This may be the least expected outcome of 2016: The most flagrantly dishonest candidate in recent memory is forcing us to have the most honest political discussion we\u2019ve had in years.'"}, "time": 1742562264.733713}
