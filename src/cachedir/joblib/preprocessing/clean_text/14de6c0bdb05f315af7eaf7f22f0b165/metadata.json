Posted on October 21, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry WikiLeaks couldn\u2019t have made it clearer in a series of tweets on Thursday \u2013 the US election for the President of the United States is rigged. The establishment have selected their President and by hook or crook she will be \u201celected.\u201d \\nResponding to allegations that WikiLeaks recent leaks have outed it as playing partisan politics, WikiLeaks fired back , \u201c You are not a fan of publishing true information about corrupt ruling power factions who will take power on Jan 20? \u201d \\nOn the day WikiLeaks publicized the release of emails from Barack Obama\u2019s personal account, their Twitter account then stated that the outcome of the election was planned from the outset: \u201c What election? It has been clear from the beginning who is going to win. This is, in effect, a power consolidation exercise .\u201d \\nConsidering what we now know about the behind-the-scenes rigging of the Democratic primary, the collusion between the DNC establishment and mainstream media, and the fact Hillary Clinton pushed for Donald Trump\u2019s GOP nomination, can you possibly disagree? \\nAre Presidents elected or selected? \\nWikiLeaks emails from Barack Obama\u2019s personal email account reveal that the Bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election, secretly organizing the transition of power. \\nThe 2008 transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth. Martha Joynt Kumar, in a book about the transition, said it \u201c was the best in anyone\u2019s memory, in part because 9/11 made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time .\u201d \\nToday\u2019s revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth \u2014 suggestions Obama was selected by the shadow government, rather than elected by the people, are no longer tinfoil hat territory. \\nThe most eye catching email in today\u2019s leak contains a message from John Podesta about an invitation from President George W. Bush to the \u201cPresident-Elect.\u201d \\nShould that have read \u201cPresident-Select?\u201d Podesta sent the email to Obama before the election result was known. \\nBut it gets even worse. \\nThe emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the 2008 election had taken place. According to an attached memo in one of the emails, Obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the Bush Administration, including then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, prior to the election. \\n\u201c As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election. \u201c Are Presidents elected or selected? \\nAnother attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon. \\n\u201c We are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition, who should be the point of contact with Treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent. \\nNormally these decisions could be made after the election, and ideally after the selection of a National Economic Advisor, but, of course, these are not normal times. \u201c \\nNot normal times? Perhaps not in 2008. But eight years later, it seems nothing has changed. What was \u201cnot normal\u201d in 2008 has become very much the norm in 2016. \\nThanks to WikiLeaks and the unprecedented peek behind the curtains of power they have granted us, the shadow government has been exposed to the light. 2008 wasn\u2019t a smooth transition of power, it was silky smooth power consolidation. \\nWikiLeaks\u2019 variety of journalism \u2013 cold, hard, pristine truth \u2013 has more than ruffled feathers. The entire henhouse has gone mad. The ruling party are slavering at the mouth, and mainstream media has never been so easy to see through. \\nWatch CNN\u2019s Scott Cuomo , the same guy caught lying to Americans about their First Amendment rights, put himself in the running for a Razzie Award after the network pulled an interview with Rep. Chris Collins as soon as he mentioned WikiLeaks.'"}, "time": 1742628550.823155}
