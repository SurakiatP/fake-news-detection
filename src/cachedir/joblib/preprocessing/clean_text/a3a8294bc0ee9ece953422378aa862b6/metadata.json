[Although the   visa is only meant to be used by a U. S. company when there are no American workers with the   needed for the job, critics argue the program is riddled with abuse and fraud, leaving Americans to sometimes train their cheaper, foreign replacements before being fired.  Trump\u2019s new executive order targeting abuse by U. S. companies, as Breitbart News reported, calls for the Department of Justice (DOJ) the Labor Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a \u201cfull legal analysis\u201d of all the problems negatively impacting American workers in the   visa system.   expert and attorney John Miano told Breitbart Texas that Trump\u2019s move on the issue is one that is setting the administration on the right trajectory. \u201cWe\u2019re going to want to see some   later on,\u201d Miano said in an interview. \u201cBut you can\u2019t criticize the president for taking action. This is what we elected him for. \u201d Miano said the fact that Trump is mentioning the   visa program, an issue that went unaddressed by at least the past two administrations, is \u201cvery big. \u201d Likewise, Sara Blackwell, an attorney who represents Americans who\u2019ve been fired because programs like the   applauded Trump\u2019s move. \u201cWe hope it\u2019s a beginning of a lot more. I\u2019m hopeful,\u201d Blackwell told Breitbart Texas. \u201cBut, I\u2019m extremely happy that President Trump is talking about it and acknowledging there\u2019s a huge problem. \u201d The legal review by DOJ, the DOL and DHS will include tracking down abuses within the   visa program where more than 85, 000 Americans are either replaced or passed over for jobs by foreign nationals. Experts like NumberUSA\u2019s Rosemary Jenks and the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 Mark Krikorian both said the   legal review approach by the Trump Administration is the right way to go about ending the mass discrimination against American workers that currently takes place. \u201cI do think it\u2019s the right approach to take because [DOJ, Labor Dept. and DHS] have different roles to play,\u201d Jenks told Breitbart Texas. \u201cAbuse is handled by the Labor Department. DHS is the agency that\u2019s setting requirements for admission. And DOJ is prosecuting the abusers. This is definitely the right approach. I hope the administration will continue talking to outside groups. \u201d \u201cClearly, by indicating that all three departments have to do a review of the program, the White House is making clear they understand the process,\u201d Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThe initial clearinghouse is the Department of Labor. A lot of the cheap labor aspects can be addressed by the Labor Department\u2019s regulations and statutes. \u201d Krikorian said he was glad to see the Trump Administration calling for a broad review into the   visa system, rather than taking smaller, administrative actions. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s encouraging that they didn\u2019t just try to change   unilaterally, they understand there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to it,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cThey know a lot of this has to be fixed by Congress. \u201d Before the Executive Order, the Trump administration worried critics of the   visa after not making any changes to the system before the application process began. For instance, the Trump Administration could have changed the   system from its current state of handing out visas through a random lottery, switching it to a process where the   jobs are given priority. Krikorian, though, told Breitbart Texas that the lack of prior change to   was mostly likely not politically driven, but rather the administration simply running out of time on the issue. Nonetheless, the new executive order has changed the outlook Americans impacted by the   have on the Trump administration, Blackwell said. \u201cWell the people who are affected by this and know this businesses model were extremely deflated when the   application process started without changes,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cNow, they\u2019ve gone from hopeless to hopeful. \u201d Last week, Breitbart Texas exclusively reported how Trump Senior Adviser Stephen Miller held a White House meeting on the   visa issue with longtime critics like Blackwell and Howard University professor Ron Hira.
