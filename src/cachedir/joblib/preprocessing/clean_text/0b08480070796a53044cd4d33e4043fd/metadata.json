[A main protest coalition group calls itself DisruptJ20. The organization\u2019s website does not say much about who is behind the group. DisruptJ20 \u201crejects all forms of domination and oppression, particularly those based on racism, poverty, gender and sexuality, organizes by consensus, and embraces a diversity of tactics,\u201d the site reads.  Claiming it stands for the vast majority of Americans, the group calls itself the \u201cstart of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. \u201d DisruptJ20 is planning a slew of actions aimed, as the group relates, at \u201cdisrupting the ceremonies. \u201d According to the website, those actions include \u201cspontaneous, unpermitted events,\u201d an \u201cunpermitted, anticapitalist march,\u201d civil disobedience and disruption plans. Lacy MacAuley has been one of the main public faces of DisruptJ20, conducting numerous interviews with the news media as an activist with the group. Her contact details are listed on DisruptJ20\u2019s website. From 2011 until the end of 2013, MacCauley, who turned down a Breitbart News interview request, served as a media activist at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) which has received financing from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute. IPS regularly partners with the   Center for American Progress to produce joint documents and reports on progressive issues. CAP was founded by John Podesta, the former chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Podesta previously served as a counselor for President Obama\u2019s White House and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. IPS and CAP previously released a \u201cUnified Security Budget,\u201d a list of defense spending recommendations that were partially adapted by the Obama administration. MacAuley\u2019s IPS bio evidences her ties to professional leftist groups, including the controversial, now defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) Project Vote, and United for Peace and Justice. Her IPS bio reads: Lacy came to IPS after doing communications for a variety of progressive organizations through the progressive PR firm Massey Media LLC and as a single contractor. She has done media relations work with groups such as Project Vote and ACORN, United for Peace and Justice, Jubilee USA, Mountain Justice Summer, the IMF Resistance Network, and the Solidarity Center (international affiliate of the  ). The only other contact listed on DisruptJ20\u2019s website is for organizer Legba Carrefour. Speaking to the Boston Herald, Carrefour made clear DisruptJ20\u2019s intention is to cause \u201cchaos\u201d at the inauguration. \u201cIf the headline (on Jan. 21) is \u2018Donald Trump inaugurated amid complete chaos and a cluster (expletive),\u2019 then we won,\u201d Carrefour said. \u201cA lot of us are people who could be considered anarchists. None of us have respect for the office or the man. \u201d On his Twitter account, Carrefour describes himself as a \u201crather glam anarchist who lives, writes, and organizes a metric f*ckton of protests in Washington, DC. \u201d Another   protest organizer has been identified as Scott Green, a leader with the D. C.   Coalition. Green was captured allegedly plotting inauguration hijinks in an undercover video released yesterday by Project Veritas. \u201cI was thinking of things that would ruin their evening, ruin their outfits and otherwise make it impossible to continue with their plans. So they get nothing accomplished,\u201d Green says in the video. Green and his group were involved in violent protests in Sacramento in June. Local Fox40 reported: \u201cI would use the word force.   and other fascists don\u2019t back down, they can, and they ought to be made to back down,\u201d said Scott Green, a supporter of the   Action group, also known as Antifa. Green, who used an alias while speaking to FOX40 for safety, did not attend the protest, but he says he has been present at similar ones that ended violently. Antifa itself isn\u2019t new, but is an offshoot of the group   Action, which started in the late \u201980s in Minneapolis. Anther activist caught allegedly plotting against the inauguration in the Project Veritas video is Luke Kuhn. \u201cIf you had a pint of butyric acid, I don\u2019t care how big the building is, it is closing,\u201d Kuhn says in the video during a conversation about setting off a chemical concoction to cause the evacuation of one of the planned inauguration balls. One Luke Kuhn protested President Bush\u2019s inaugural in 2001 and was quoted at the time in the Baltimore Sun as a \u201cveteran protester. \u201d Kuhn told the newspaper about his plans to bypass police checkpoints at Bush\u2019s inauguration that year. \u201cIf people pass through the checkpoints and the police take their signs, the demonstrators will be made ineffective,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I encourage people to do   \u2026     have 30, 000 people march to one of the checkpoints and demand to get through. \u201d In February 2006, Kuhn led a   at a Minuteman Project rally on Capitol Hill against the U. S. guest worker program. Activist Dylan Petrohilos was also filmed by Project Veritas allegedly participating in the DisruptJ20 planning meeting. He doubles as a digital journalist for ThinkProgress, which is a media project of the     Center for American Progress.
