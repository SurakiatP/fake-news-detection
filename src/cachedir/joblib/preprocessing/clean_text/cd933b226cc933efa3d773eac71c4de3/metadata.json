[The song \u201cGood Cop Bad Cop\u201d sees the California rapper paint the picture of   America as being filled with crooked cops targeting minorities, falsifying police reports, planting evidence, and doing anything they can to \u201csend another young brother\u201d to jail.  \u201cBlack Lives Matter, it\u2019s not chit chatter. Cause all they wanna do is scatter brain matter. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. A nine is terrible in your face,\u201d Cube raps. The political track sees Cube question if a \u201cgood cop\u201d is \u201cjust a fantasy. \u201d The song\u2019s hook also presents a racially charged scenario that sees the \u201cblack police showin\u2019 out for the white cop\u201d and the \u201cwhite police showin\u2019 out for the black cop. \u201d In an interview this week with Apple\u2019s Beats 1 Radio host Zane Lowe, Cube described \u201cGood Cop Bad Cop\u201d as a   \u201cF*ck tha Police 2017,\u201d and explained why he decided to release the updated take on the controversial 1988 song. \u201cWe had done \u2018F*ck tha Police\u2019 so many years ago,\u201d he said of the N. W. A. song. \u201cWith the emergence of Straight Outta Compton the movie, we realized that it\u2019s still the same thing that\u2019s going on. We needed a more    version of the community talking to the police and to the authorities. \u201d Despite how the song seems to broadly brand law enforcement officers as racist, Cube says it is an appeal \u201cto the good cops to turn in the bad cops. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the first line of defense for us is for good cops to get the bad apples out of the bunch. Because they\u2019re sucking all the respect that police used to have is being sucked away by these bad apples,\u201d he said. Last year, however, Cube said he would not stop performing the   enforcement song \u201cF*ck tha Police. \u201d In that same Beats 1 Radio interview, Cube also said President Donald Trump\u2019s policies are hurting poor people the same way George W. Bush\u2019s did. \u201cThe same weight under a Trump Administration is starting to feel the same way as it did when daddy Bush was in the White House,\u201d the rapper said. \u201cIt was the weight of all those policies geared against poor people who were trying to pull themselves up. I feel like that same attack is happening against the most poor and vulnerable people. That same ugliness is starting to rear its head again. \u201d Ice Cube is scheduled to appear on Friday\u2019s episode of HBO\u2019s Real Time as a replacement for Sen. Al Franken, who cancelled his appearance after host Bill Maher\u2019s use of a racial slur on the show last week.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742561990.6118312}
