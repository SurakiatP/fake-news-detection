On Sunday morning, Pope Francis officially bestowed that title at her canonization ceremony in St. Peter\u2019s Square. \u201cI think, perhaps, we may have some difficulty in calling her St. Teresa: Her holiness is so near to us, so tender and so fruitful, that we continue to spontaneously call her Mother Teresa,\u201d the pope said in    remarks during his homily. It was a festive atmosphere at the Vatican, under a broiling summer sun, and several flags fluttered in the light breeze: from Albania, representing the Roman Catholic nun\u2019s ethnic origins from Macedonia, to note her birthplace, Skopje from India, where she spent most of her life, working in the slums of Kolkata and from the many other countries where her humility and selflessness touched countless lives. When Francis proclaimed her St. Teresa at the end of the formal ceremony, in Latin, the crowd erupted in sustained applause. \u201cWe are proud of her, all of India is proud,\u201d said Marina Borneo Sam, who traveled from Kolkata with her mother to be at the ceremony. \u201cShe may no longer be there, but we still feel her spirit around us. \u201d For some, Mother Teresa\u2019s saintliness was so evident from the start that her canonization was just a formality. \u201cFor me, nothing has changed,\u201d said Giovanna Tommasi, a lay member of the Missionaries of Charity, the religious order founded by Mother Teresa in 1950. \u201cWhen you were fortunate enough to know her, as I did, then today\u2019s celebration doesn\u2019t change much. \u201d The canonization was a highlight of the Jubilee year, which the pope had proclaimed to celebrate the theme of mercy, and on Sunday he called Mother Teresa a \u201ctireless worker of mercy. \u201d His homily was primarily addressed to volunteer workers celebrating the Jubilee. \u201cToday, I pass on this emblematic figure of womanhood and of consecrated life to the whole world of volunteers: May she be your model of holiness,\u201d Francis said. He also praised her \u201cdefense of human life, those unborn and those abandoned and discarded,\u201d emphasizing her relentless petitioning against abortion. Mother Teresa earned fame and accolades over a lifetime spent working with the poor and the sick, and with orphans, lepers and AIDS patients. She made the cover of Time magazine in December 1975 for an article that acknowledged her as one of the world\u2019s \u201cliving saints. \u201d When told that she had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, she said, \u201cI am unworthy. \u201d A portrait of Mother Teresa, described by Pope John Paul II as an \u201cicon of the good Samaritan,\u201d was displayed on the facade of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and showing her in her distinctive   white sari. The portrait was commissioned by the Knights of Columbus and painted by Chas Fagan, an American artist. Because of her celebrity, she stepped where many religious figures do not. \u201cShe made her voice heard before the powers of this world, so that they might recognize their guilt for the crime of poverty they created,\u201d the pope said on Sunday. Mother Teresa\u2019s supporters praise her selflessness and humility, noting that though she associated with royalty, government leaders and popes, she continued to live simply until her death, at age 87, in 1997. \u201cShe was one with us,\u201d Sister Mary Prema Pierick, the superior general of the Missionaries of Charity, said at a Vatican news conference on Friday. \u201cShe never wanted or accepted anything not common with all the sisters. \u201d The order that Mother Teresa started with 12 nuns now numbers more than 5, 800 people in 139 countries, including two orders of brothers and one of priests. The congregation continues her work of ministering to the world\u2019s least privileged, those she called \u201cthe poorest of the poor. \u201d Mother Teresa was \u201cboth mother and teacher,\u201d Sister Prema said. \u201cShe lived the religious life with so much joy and enthusiasm that we all wanted to be close with her. \u201d Her gift, she added, was \u201cto make everybody aware of their own responsibility,\u201d and inspire people with the knowledge that \u201ceach one of us can make a difference. \u201d Mother Teresa was canonized 19 years after her death, remarkably fast for modern times. John Paul II, who is now also a saint, went against protocol when he allowed the canonization process to begin two years after her death, not the customary five. He beatified her in 2003 after a miracle, the healing of a   woman, was attributed to her intercession. A second miracle, recognized by Francis last year, opened the way to sanctity. \u201cI am very grateful for this miracle,\u201d said Marcilio Haddad Andrino, a Brazilian who recovered from a   brain infection in 2008 after his family prayed to Mother Teresa. Mr. Andrino came to Rome for the ceremony and was present at the Vatican news conference. \u201cThe merciful Lord looks at us all without any distinction,\u201d Mr. Andrino said. \u201cMaybe it was me this time, but maybe tomorrow it will be someone else. \u201d Mother Teresa, for all her acclaim, was not without critics. Some have questioned the hygiene and medical standards adopted by the sisters in some of the shelters and clinics run by the Missionaries of Charity. Others, like Dr. Aroup Chatterjee, have criticized what they call a \u201ccult of suffering\u201d that was prevalent in some of the homes run by the order. In a book, and in the documentary \u201cHell\u2019s Angel,\u201d the author and essayist Christopher Hitchens accused Mother Teresa of being an \u201cally of the status quo,\u201d also calling her a \u201czealot\u201d and a \u201cfanatic. \u201d Mr. Hitchens charged that instead of empowering the poor to seek a better future, she instilled the idea that their condition was permanent. Her campaigns against birth control and abortion, which she once called \u201cthe greatest destroyer of peace today,\u201d angered feminists and raised concerns with aid organizations. Some doctors and officials in India have also challenged the narrative of Monica Besra, the woman said to have benefited from Mother Teresa\u2019s first miraculous intervention, saying Ms. Besra had been suffering from a cyst, not a tumor. Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in 1910 to Albanian parents in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire and now the capital of Macedonia. Today, she is regarded as the city\u2019s most important native, and celebrations for her canonization will be held there for a week. \u201cSkopje and the citizens of Skopje will use this opportunity to thank the saint Mother Teresa and to continue on the path that she unselfishly showed us  \u2014   the path toward understanding, compassion and love,\u201d said Koce Trajanovski, the mayor of Skopje, where streets and clinics are named for her. A memorial in her honor has attracted more than 700, 000 visitors over the last five years. The canonization was broadcast live on the Vatican\u2019s television station and streamed online through a Vatican website. It was presented on Vatican Radio in seven languages, including Albanian. Tens of thousands of people gathered at St. Peter\u2019s Square on Sunday, along with 15 official government delegations, including representatives of India and the United States. The chief Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, said all 100, 000 tickets that the Holy See had made available had been distributed. At St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan looked out at the crowd that had filled the pews and remarked, \u201cI thought St. Patrick\u2019s would be empty this morning, because when I was watching the Mass this morning, it looked like the whole Catholic world was in St. Peter\u2019s Square. \u201d Mr. Burke recalled a visit to the Vatican press room that Mother Teresa made \u201cmany years ago. \u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not the only saint to have passed through here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there haven\u2019t been many, I think. \u201d She is the perfect saint for the year of mercy, the Rev. Brian Kolodiejchuk, the superior general of the Missionary Fathers of Charity, one of the religious institutes founded by Mother Teresa, said on Friday. Mother Teresa was \u201cso aware of her need for mercy before God. She was very much at home with her own poverty,\u201d added Father Kolodiejchuk, the chief promoter of her case for sainthood. \u201cThis Year of Mercy is first of all a reminder to all of us that before God we all stand in need of mercy so in this we are all poor. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563296.0666752}
