Sir Richard Shirreff warns that NATO faces \u201cnuclear war with Russia in Europe,\u201d and that America is already technically at war with Russia. In a hawkish article for CNN , Shirreff asserts that the west faces the biggest threat from Russia since the Cold War and that Vladmir Putin plans to \u201cre-establish Russia\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s great powers\u201d by marching into the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Comparing the west\u2019s policy towards Putin to the appeasement of Hitler, Shirreff claims that Moscow, \u201cmay have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable: nuclear war with Russia in Europe.\u201d Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, an attack on one NATO member country represents an attack on all member countries, meaning the United States would be at war with Russia if Russian troops set foot in Baltic countries. \u201cA Russian attack on the Baltic states puts America at war with Russia \u2014 meaning nuclear war, because Russia integrates nuclear weapons into every aspect of its military doctrine,\u201d writes Shirreff. He also states that \u201cRussia is at war with America already,\u201d recycling the claim, which remains unproven, that Russia is behind the email hacks that led to Wikileaks\u2019 publicizing of Clinton campaign emails. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think Russia would limit itself to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.
