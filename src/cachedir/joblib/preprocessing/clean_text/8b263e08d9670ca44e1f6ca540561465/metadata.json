The FBI investigation has uncovered laptops from Clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. \\nAnd most importantly of all , the sources at the FBI have apparently told Baier with \u201c99 percent accuracy\u201d that Hillary\u2019s server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. \\nMeanwhile, we now know that the Department of Justice attempted to pressure the FBI into shutting down the investigation into the Clinton Foundation entirely. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI deputy director even asked the DOJ if they truly wanted to shut down a \u201cvalidly predicated investigation.\u201d \\nThis is devastating information for Hillary. \\nDonald Trump is now leading in Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, and North Carolina. Trump is within spitting distance in Colorado and Pennsylvania, and two new polls show Trump up in Virginia and New Hampshire, respectively. If Trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. \\nThe best case scenario for Hillary Clinton just days ago was simple: hunker down and wait out these scandals. Assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its pre-Comey normal, with Hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. But each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and State Department. Each new day demonstrates the extent of the cover-up by the Obama administration. \\nHillary\u2019s running out of days to recover. \\nThe only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now, especially if the American public is upset enough about her pay-for-play and exposure of American classified material to put Trump in the White House, not trusting Loretta Lynch\u2019s DOJ to prosecute Hillary for her crimes.
