Back in the pop arena after her detour into show tunes and pop standards, Lady Gaga unleashes her great big voice on a perennial pop subject:   fury and disillusionment. \u201cMistaken for   wasn\u2019t love, it was a perfect illusion,\u201d she belts, angry and tremulous. Lady Gaga and three producers  \u2014   Mark Ronson, Tame Impala\u2019s Kevin Parker and BloodPop  \u2014   go for a     hybrid, with a Motown beat underpinning both electronics and guitars and an   Top 40 key change into the last verse. But the influence Lady Gaga still can\u2019t escape is Madonna the climax of the chorus, the words \u201cperfect illusion,\u201d use the same melodic line as \u201ckeeping my baby\u201d in Madonna\u2019s \u201cPapa Don\u2019t Preach. \u201d JON PARELES The narrator is a prisoner  \u2014   incarcerated in some verses, brutalized by corrupt capitalism in others  \u2014   in \u201cDigging for Windows,\u201d the first solo song in a decade from the Zack de la Rocha, the rapper who fronted Rage Against the Machine. Produced by   (who had Mr. de la Rocha as a guest with his project Run the Jewels) the track pounds away, mostly on one relentlessly repeated note, thickening and eventually bringing in a loud guitar to match the mounting anger. Part of the message is arguable  \u2014   \u201cWon\u2019t mark the name on a ballot\u201d this year?  \u2014   but the fury is convincing. J. P. It was 2004, another election year, when Green Day released \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d its blast at the quiescence of the George W. Bush years. \u201cRevolution Radio\u201d is the title song of its album due Oct. 7, and Green Day\u2019s tools and attitude haven\u2019t changed: punk propulsion, guitar hooks and barreling drums behind pop melody carrying a call for \u201ca rebel\u2019s lullaby under the stars and   the lost souls that were cheated. \u201d The band\u2019s old energy endures so does the frustration. J. P. The   rapper Mykki Blanco temporarily sets aside her usual bravado in \u201cLoner,\u201d one of the more melodic tracks on her debut album, \u201cMykki. \u201d With Jean Deaux cooing a chorus alongside her, she testifies to deep insecurities within the fishbowl of social media. \u201cI need help, I\u2019m so sad,\u201d she confesses, but she can\u2019t resist broadcasting her problems: \u201cI\u2019m standing wasted on  \u2019m naked. \u201d It\u2019s the plaint of someone who\u2019s never sure which followers are also friends. J. P. \u201cVeil Scans\u201d is less than five minutes long but evokes eternity. The electronic composer Tim Hecker deals in dread, repetition, density and depth, opening dark chasms in the soundscape. A loop of what sounds like a string orchestra, sliding upward through just one whole tone, runs nearly all the way through \u201cVeil Scans\u201d around it are warped echoes and reflections, clouds of static, deep bass murmurs, distant voices, eerie keenings. It\u2019s not so much a   track as a glimpse into some inexorable evolutionary process. J. P. A decade ago the pianist Eric Lewis was that rare thing: a promising young musician who, of his own volition, had stepped away from a coveted post in the house orchestra of Wynton Marsalis\u2019s Jazz at Lincoln Center. He soon became something even rarer: a jazz artist with the profile and bearing of a certain kind of pop star. Rebranding himself as ELEW, he wowed a range of audiences, from the TED Conference to the White House, with hyperdynamic covers of songs by Coldplay, the Killers and Linkin Park. So what to make of his new acoustic trio album, \u201cAnd to the Republic,\u201d made with one of Mr. Marsalis\u2019s old rhythm sections? Whatever else you want to say, it doesn\u2019t smack of cynicism. Mr. Lewis crowds the track list with acts of tribute: to his romantic partner (\u201cLil Luba\u201d) to a former mentor (\u201cTones for Elvin Jones\u201d) to a couple of lodestars (\u201cOrnette,\u201d \u201cMonk\u201d) to a formative sound (\u201cThe Philly Groove\u201d). And he connects handily with the bassist Reginald Veal and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts, favoring a     polyrhythmic swagger. You hear it on the opening track, \u201cMedicine Man,\u201d which works a childlike melodic line into something like an expedition. At the same time, Mr. Lewis finds a place for something from the ELEW wheelhouse: a chiming arrangement of \u201cHeartbeats,\u201d by the Swedish electronic duo the Knife. NATE CHINEN Having Peter Gabriel write the song for Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cSnowden,\u201d the film about the computer systems administrator who revealed the extent of secret government surveillance, was a match so neat it seems almost inevitable. Mr. Gabriel realized the implications of the internet early on, and well before that his songs had reckoned with the ways that larger systems grind down individual liberty. He\u2019s also a master of shadowy, suspenseful,   production, like the ticking percussion and staggered bits of melody he uses in \u201cThe Veil. \u201d The lyrics are on topic: \u201cSome say you\u2019re a patriot, some call you a   American hero or a traitor that deserves to Die. \u201d But Mr. Gabriel finds the broader implications, too, as he sings, \u201cThere\u2019s no safe place to go. \u201d J. P. Carly Rae Jepsen recently released \u201cEmotion: Side B,\u201d a companion to her critically adored 2015 album \u201cEmotion\u201d and a   late applicant to your poolside summer soundtrack. \u201cFirst Time\u201d is the album\u2019s most irrepressibly gleaming track: a product of the Swedish   complex, evoking 1980s bubble gum like Debbie Gibson. Ms. Jepsen, true to form, mixes some hope into her heartbreak. \u201cBut if you stay here,\u201d she sings, \u201cwe could away the goodbye. \u201d N. C. The close of summer lends both a backdrop and a metaphor to Jason Aldean\u2019s new single, in strong rotation on country radio. It\u2019s a tune of stoical yearning, the yawp of a dude bemoaning the end of a seasonal romance. \u201cShe might have stayed   never ever left these arms,\u201d he brays, \u201cIf only I had a little more summertime. \u201d It\u2019s an efficient burst of feeling from Mr. Aldean\u2019s seventh studio album, \u201cThey Don\u2019t Know,\u201d due on Friday.
