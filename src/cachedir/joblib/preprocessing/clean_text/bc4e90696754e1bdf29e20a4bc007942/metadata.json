Police detained him and ordered him off the streets, saying this was \u201ceasier\u201d than \u201ctaking on\u201d the aggressive protestors.[  activist Tommy Robinson was joined by Rebel Media reporter Caolan Robertson, approaching demonstrators to ask their views on issues such as female genital mutilation and sexual grooming.  Within five minutes of arriving at the protest, according to Robertson, the pair were surrounded by people shouting \u201cNazi, white supremacist!\u201d resulting in attending police officers detaining Robinson. Footage shows Robinson approaching a man screaming \u201cNazi scum!\u201d and asking for him to explain why he is a Nazi. A policewoman quickly removes Robinson from the scene, asking him to \u201crespect that these people don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d. A subsequent attempt by Robinson to engage a student protestor about her views on Islam is terminated by an aggressive older male, who pushes him away shouting: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a Nazi on this demo. Get off!\u201d Robinson tries to mollify the man by explaining that he is just trying to have a \u201cpolite conversation\u201d but the male begins screaming about losing family in the Holocaust and whips up unruly chants of \u201cNazi scum, off our streets!\u201d It is at this point that Robinson is dragged away by the police, who attempt to separate him from Robertson and his camera. When Robinson asks why he is the one being manhandled when it is the demonstrators who are being aggressive, a female officer explains bluntly that \u201cit\u2019s easier to remove you\u201d than to \u201ctake on\u201d the angry crowd. She also claims Robinson is the one causing the violence \u201cby his sheer presence\u201d. Footage shot at another point on the march shows Robinson attempting to ask demonstrators their view on the oppression of women under Shariah, and being told \u201cYou\u2019re a racist\u201d repeatedly. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Robinson finally asks. \u201cYes it is!\u201d the demonstrator replies. Elsewhere, a protestor tells Robinson she is on the march because it feels as though years of   leislation has been for nothing. \u201cWhat if I told you that, statistically, white people are the biggest victims of racism in the UK?\u201d Robinson asks. \u201cWhite people can\u2019t be victims of racism,\u201d she scoffs. In fact, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) found that most victims of racism in England and Wales were white as long ago as 1999, in a report titled \u201cRacial Attacks and Harassment\u201d. Scottish statistics published in 2015 show that \u201cWhite Britons\u201d are also the most common victims of race hate crimes north of the border. Scotland\u2019s first ever   murder victim was a white schoolboy named Kriss Donald, who was kidnapped, stabbed 13 times, and burned alive by a Pakistani gang in an unprovoked attack in 2004. Finally, a figure Robinson identified as Unite Against Fascism leader Raymond Bennett begins abusing Robinson and has the police remove him a second time. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to debate their issues because they\u2019re so blinkered, so fascist,\u201d Robinson tells Robertson. \u201cThese people\u2019s views have never been challenged   \u2026     they\u2019ve been indoctrinated. \u201d  '"}, "time": 1742628304.2584095}
