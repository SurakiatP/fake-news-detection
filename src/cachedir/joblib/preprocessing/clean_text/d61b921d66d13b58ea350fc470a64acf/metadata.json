The surprise revelation triggered an immediate worldwide crash, as speculators and investors reacted to the shock news that the bus driving community was not responsible for maintaining the monetary and financial stability of the nation, as had been previously thought. \\n\u2018This news has sent a tremor through the banking system, as bus drivers have been the custodians of British currency since 1634,\u2019 noted financial historian Michael Porteous. \u2018It should have actually been 1631, but Frank was three minutes late leaving the Kirkstall Road depot this afternoon due to roadworks on the A65\u2019. \\n\u2018Drivers are given updates every minute from the major global stock exchanges, relayed to them on tiny screens attached to their rear view mirror\u2019, continued Porteous. \u2018This allows them to make split-second adjustments, releasing particular coins into general circulation from those little trigger dispensers if more liquidity is required, or retaining them to meet government monetary targets. More bloody retention than releasing, you say? I couldn\u2019t comment.\u2019 \\nUp until recently drivers were trained up to ask belligerently \u2018Have you NOT got anything less?\u2019 when any note was offered as payment, before throwing a fistful of low-denomination copper at passengers. They were also mandated to regularly drive past bus-stops full of pensioners on rainy Fridays between 9-11am, if inflation targets had been overshot. \u2018Their role in ensuring the financial system runs smoothly shouldn\u2019t be under-estimated,\u2019 concluded Porteous. \u2018That\u2019s why your bus driver never even acknowledges you when you get on and looks fixedly into the middle-distance \u2013 they\u2019re making complex split-second asset purchase calculations. Alternatively, it may be because they despise you, with that pathetic excuse of a hail that you do, arm half bent and shaking, every sodding day, before getting on and trying to pay with a bloody twenty for your pathetic one-mile journey. For Christ\u2019s sake, can\u2019t you look for some pound coins before you leave, you selfish, middle class tw@t.\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 17th, 2016 by chrisf Click for more article by chrisf ..'"}, "time": 1742628500.4007785}
