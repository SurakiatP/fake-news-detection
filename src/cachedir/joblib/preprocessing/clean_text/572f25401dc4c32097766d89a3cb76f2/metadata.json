They can stay in their barricaded apartment as their country descends into sectarian bloodshed and chaos, or entrust their lives and fortunes to a human smuggler who promises to spirit them to safety through a magic portal in an abandoned dentist\u2019s office. The couple choose the mysterious doorway and are instantly transported to a Greek island, where they find themselves among hundreds of other desperate refugees. With its surreal premise, \u201cExit West,\u201d an acclaimed new novel by Mohsin Hamid, might feel hallucinatory and distant had it arrived at a different moment. Instead, the novel  \u2014   which fuses magical realism with a harrowingly vivid story of global migration and displacement  \u2014   feels ominously relevant. Mr. Hamid, a cultural chameleon and polyglot who was born in Pakistan and spent more than half his life in the United States and London, didn\u2019t intend to write a dystopian parable about the current refugee crisis. When he began working on \u201cExit West\u201d four years ago, he started with an abstract idea: a global network of passageways that circumvent borders, allowing migrants to immediately cross oceans and continents and erasing the already porous barriers between nations and cultures. \u201cThe idea of these doors, which I feel already exist, unlocked the form of this novel,\u201d Mr. Hamid, 45, said in a Skype interview from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. \u201cI wanted to write a very large book about the entire world on a very small scale, so I needed to find some way of covering a lot of ground. \u201d Mr. Hamid\u2019s literary profile has been growing ever since he dazzled critics with his 2000 debut novel, \u201cMoth Smoke,\u201d which explored the lives of   Pakistani youth and was a finalist for the   Award. Since then, his three novels have collectively sold a million copies and been translated into 35 languages. But \u201cExit West\u201d is likely to draw a much broader audience, and seems poised to become one of this year\u2019s most significant literary works. To meet demand from booksellers, Mr. Hamid\u2019s publisher, Riverhead, had already ordered four printings before the book\u2019s release on Tuesday. Prominent novelists like Zadie Smith, Michael Chabon, Joyce Carol Oates and Kiran Desai have praised the novel as an urgent and essential story, particularly at a moment when immigrants and Muslims have been demonized. Mr. Hamid, who lived in the United States for 17 years and describes himself as \u201cculturally and emotionally at least half American,\u201d said the last few months have left him frightened and depressed. He wonders whether he will still feel welcome in an America that appears increasingly hostile to foreigners and Muslims. His native country, where he is raising his two young children, has suffered a wave of terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and the Taliban. The world seems to be veering toward the upheaval and entrenched polarization that Mr. Hamid envisioned in the novel. He never imagined \u201cExit West\u201d would become so grimly prescient, with the crisis in Syria displacing millions, and nationalist movements gaining ground in the West. He started writing the story long before rising nativist sentiment led to \u2018Brexit\u2019 and Donald J. Trump signed executive orders targeting illegal immigrants and barring refugees from entering the country. \u201cThe basic impulse, this growing need for so many people to move because of political calamity and environmental catastrophe, and the rise of nativism and tribalism  \u2014   those things were quite clearly happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I hadn\u2019t imagined we\u2019d be where we are now, I guess I\u2019m not surprised. \u201d But while \u201cExit West\u201d seems like a dark reflection of our tumultuous times, Mr. Hamid said the novel grew out of a hopeful impulse. \u201cWhat if we look at a very difficult future  \u2014   can we still find hope and beauty and love and things that we want?\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, this is not a novel about dystopia actually it\u2019s about looking for signs of hope and optimism in the future. \u201d The novel represents bold new territory for Mr. Hamid, whose earlier works, including \u201cThe Reluctant Fundamentalist\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia,\u201d were formally innovative and experimental but firmly grounded in reality. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to abide by the laws of physics up until now,\u201d he said. He drew inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges, and from children\u2019s literature, one of his favorite genres. He grew up devouring books by J . R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, and lately has been reading Harry Potter to his    daughter. The spare prose in \u201cExit West\u201d feels almost biblical at times. The magic doors give the story a mythical sweep, as the refugee couple, Nadia and Saeed, escape to Mykonos, then London, then finally the Bay Area, encountering angry nationalist mobs but also benefiting from the unexpected generosity of strangers. Mr. Chabon said that the surreal elements of the novel allowed Mr. Hamid to write about the refugee experience in ways that \u201cfew writers would have the courage or chutzpah to get to. \u201d \u201cWhat makes this book special is that it takes on a subject that a lot of readers are going to wish they could avert their eyes from,\u201d he said. \u201cMagical realism is about getting you to look at something with fresh eyes and see something marvelous in the everyday, and there\u2019s something radical about treating the refugee experience as something with the potential to be marvelous. \u201d Like his protagonists, Mr. Hamid has spent much of his life feeling displaced, rootless and alienated. \u201cGrappling with movement, and the wrenching and painful nature of that, has been very central to my life,\u201d he said. Born in Lahore in 1971, Mr. Hamid moved at age 3 to Northern California, where his father was studying for a Ph. D. at Stanford. A chatty child, he suddenly found himself cut off from language, unable to communicate with other children. He assimilated, only to be uprooted again at 9, when his family returned to Pakistan. By then, he had forgotten how to speak Urdu, his first language. \u201cWhen I was younger I used to imagine I was some kind of a freak, I\u2019m not really anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI became a very good chameleon. \u201d At 18, he returned to the United States to attend Princeton, where he took writing workshops with Ms. Oates and Toni Morrison. Ms. Oates recalled him as \u201cquietly well spoken, though forceful in his critiques of others\u2019 work. \u201d He later went to Harvard Law School, and continued to write fiction, working on a draft of \u201cMoth Smoke. \u201d He worked as a consultant at McKinsey  Company in New York, and convinced the company to give him three to four months off a year to write. He later moved to London, where he met his wife, a classically trained singer and musician who is also from Lahore. After the birth of their daughter, Mr. Hamid felt a pang of homesickness, and convinced his wife to move back to Lahore to be near their parents. (He is a dual citizen of Pakistan and Britain.) \u201cI remember him saying, \u2018I have to go back, it\u2019s a waste of happiness to be away from them,\u2019\u201d said the filmmaker Mira Nair, who directed a film adaptation of \u201cThe Reluctant Fundamentalist. \u201d Mr. Hamid has lived in Lahore for the past seven years. He writes while his two children are at school  \u2014   pacing around his office and reading passages out loud  \u2014   and works as a consultant for the branding agency Wolff Olins. His wife runs a restaurant. He\u2019s deeply attached to Lahore. But Mr. Hamid feels conflicted about whether he belongs there. \u201cThe life of a writer is more fraught here than it might be in other places,\u201d he said. Sometimes, he considers leaving again, but worries about the emotional toll on his family. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to pick up and leave,\u201d he said. \u201cAs is the case in the novel, leaving home is an emotionally violent act. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562294.1398878}
