Too young to understand agendas, the little boy humiliated himself in front of his class, which he will have to live with the rest of the school year. \\nSchool administrators have a responsibility to report it when they feel something is wrong at home, which some would think is probably the case with this boy based on what this twisted woman dressed him as. Instead of being given the choice to be whatever he wants, his seemingly controlling mother convinced him to don what she thought was a pretty cool costume without thinking about the emotional damage it could do to her child. \\nThe liberal mother, who goes by @DebbersGar \u00c2 online, was proud that she got her son to dress up as her hero, Hillary Clinton, when she posted his photo online with the description, \u201cOur 8-year-old son is with you @Hillary Clinton, today and every day.\u201d Adding to the realistic nature of the female costume, she grew her boy\u2019s hair out so it could be styled in Hillary\u2019s signature winged bouffant. She completed the androgynous costume with a pantsuit, Hillary campaign pin, and slogan briefcase, then topped it off with a pair of pearlescent girl shoes. The 8-year-old boy dressed as Hillary Clinton in his mother\u2019s post \\nWhile the look is atrocious regardless of gender and has no place in a second-grade classroom, the fact that she more or less forced her son to dress as a woman makes it worse \u00e2\\x80\\x94 but it\u2019s par for the course with gender-bending liberals. \\nWhile she made her political point and was clearly proud of it, her son likely sat alone at lunch and played by himself at recess in his yellow woman\u2019s pantsuit, but she\u2019ll blame other people\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d parenting for raising kids who treated her son this way.'"}, "time": 1742561928.0008502}
