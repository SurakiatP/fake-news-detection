Sharpton said, \u201cAs I watched last night President Trump nominate Judge Gorsuch be in the Supreme Court  \u2014   first of all let\u2019s be clear, Gorsuch is a very conservative, go by the Founding Fathers kind of interpretation of how you deal with Constitutional law and would sit on that court and would rule in a way that would be against the interests of those of us that clearly when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, was not considered full human beings and full citizens. So when you deal with the mentality and the legal profile of Judge Gorsuch, it is not a good one. But even beyond that, let us not forget he is not sitting, and being nominated to sit in Scalia\u2019s seat, he\u2019s being nominated to sit in Garland\u2019s seat. President Barack Obama nominated Judge Garland, who has got as much or more qualifications as this nominee, to have been the Supreme Court judge. \u201d \u201cNominated him almost a year ago, Febuary of 16 when Scalia died,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey stalled, they filibustered, they would not even give a hearing to Judge Garland. It is time for the Democrats now to say since you changed the rules, you\u2019re going to have to live by the rules you applied to President Obama\u2019s nominee, and we are not going to allow you to change it and we will use those rules to block this nominee, Gorsuch. The Bible says that you sow that  \u2014   that same thing shall you also reap. But Bill Bellamy had a better idea \u2014  they should come in the Senate and replay \u201cThe Big Payback,\u201d  James Brown song. Bill was right, just take one of them old blasters, Chuck Schumer, and blast out The Big Payback. You took my judge. That ain\u2019t right. Wouldn\u2019t give a hearing. You know that I\u2019m tight  \u2014   the big payback. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563782.8047142}
