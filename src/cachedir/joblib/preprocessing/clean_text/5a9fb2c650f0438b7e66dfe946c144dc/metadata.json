[The fear took hold on inauguration day, when members of the Violence Prevention Research Program watched the Climate Change information disappear.  Wired reports that Magdalena Cerd\u00e1 saw the Climate Change information vanish and viewed is as a \u201ccall to action. \u201d She said she \u201cworried the same thing could happen to gun violence data on websites belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u201d Cerd\u00e1 was on an Amtrak train when she noticed the Climate Change material disappearing and she \u201csent an email to Garen Wintemute saying [they] needed to start downloading   \u2026     data immediately. \u201d The goal was to get all the online resource material saved to a   drive so they would have it, even if an outside party ordered it removed or inaccessible on the internet. Veronica Pear is a data analyst at the Violence Prevention Research Center. She said, \u201cI was scared. \u201d Pear is using \u201cfederal data for a paper on firearm mortality \u2014  tracking hotspots in California between 1999 and 2015 \u2014  and her work is almost complete. \u201d She said she had grown accustomed to finding the information she needed via online searches, and had therefore never downloaded or backed anything up. But once Cerda announced the erasure of Climate Change information, Pearl began searching and storing information. She said, \u201cI had to enter around 50 different queries, I felt frantic. \u201d UC Davis now has untold numbers of resources saved on secure servers. Pear described the compilation of the material as \u201ca public service for the scientific community. \u201d She added, \u201cAnd for me, it feels more important now than ever to be vocally on the side of truth. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
